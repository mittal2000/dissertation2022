Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-harvey-crisis_us_599f3d3de4b05710aa5b095f,"The president has bounced from one crisis to another since taking office. This might be the first ""real"" one.",2017-08-24,President Donald Trump tours Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters after an Aug. 4 briefing on hurricane season.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599f3dd31e00002700c5f318.jpeg?ops=crop_64_115_6618_3059%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Having lurched from one crisis to the next, starting the day he was inaugurated, President Donald Trump could be facing the first real one of his presidency not of his own making: Hurricane Harvey.Trump has inflamed relations with his own intelligence community, picked fights with fellow Republicans in Congress, brandished the nation’s nuclear weapons on Twitter, encouraged neo-Nazis and created chaos at the nation’s airports with a poorly crafted travel ban that remains tied up in the courts.All of those troubles, though, were generated because of his own words and actions. The 125 mile-per-hour storm churning toward the central Texas coast is the first menace directly affecting Americans in Trump’s presidency beyond his control. And as of Thursday afternoon, he had spoken about it not at all.Trump’s daily schedule did not include a hurricane briefing. His morning statements on Twitter attacked the news media, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who said Tuesday night that Trump’s apparent mental state made it dangerous for him to be in control of the nation’s nuclear weapons.White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, though, said Thursday that Trump has been monitoring the hurricane situation. “The president has been briefed and will continue to be updated as the storm progresses, and it’s certainly something he’s very aware of and will keep a very watchful eye on and stand ready to provide resources if needed.”Shortly after Sanders wrapped up her daily briefing, a tweet was sent on Trump’s account that advised people “to plan ahead.” It contained links to websites and an embedded video, which Trump’s personally written tweets rarely contain.Trump’s silence on a storm that is forecast to cause devastating flooding stands in contrast to what previous presidents have done.Last October, for example, Barack Obama used an Oval Office photo opportunity to warn residents of Atlantic coastal states after Hurricane Matthew did not strike Florida but remained offshore. “I just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane; that the potential for storm surge, flooding, loss of life and severe property damage continues to exist,” Obama said. “And people continue to need to follow the instructions of their local officials over the course of the next 24, 48, 72 hours.”At the operational level, the Federal Emergency Management Agency appears to be preparing for Harvey the same way it has dealt with storms in the aftermath of its much-criticized handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005: deploying staff and emergency supplies to areas where they will likely be needed.“The supplies include about 250,000 meals, 77,000 liters of water and 4,000 tarps. These supplies are being moved from FEMA’s warehouse/distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas to an Incident Support Base in Seguin, Texas, should those supplies be needed,” FEMA public affairs director William Booher said in a statement. “FEMA personnel are on the ground at emergency operations centers in Texas and Louisiana to support any requests for federal assistance.”FEMA plays primarily a coordinating role in hurricane preparedness and recovery, with the states’ own agencies taking the lead. Yet the success or failure of the combined effort can have a big effect on a presidency.Obama was helped by his leadership in the immediate aftermath of “superstorm” Sandy, which hit New Jersey and New York just ahead of the 2012 presidential election. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush, already behind in his re-election race, was hurt by the federal government’s slow response to Hurricane Andrew’s direct hit on Miami. And 13 years later, Katrina’s strike on New Orleans and FEMA’s poor response was a major reason for the decline of son George W. Bush’s second-term effectiveness. The following autumn, Democrats retook control of both chambers of Congress.Tricia Wachtendorf, director of the University of Delaware’s Disaster Research Center, emphasized the importance of collaboration among local, state and federal agencies when dealing with potentially disastrous events. Wachtendorf witnessed Katrina’s effects firsthand.“If Harvey turns out to be a large-scale or catastrophic event, the country will be looking at how the current federal administration demonstrates leadership, both operationally in terms of its resources and support as well as symbolically,” she told HuffPost in an email.“Disasters are governed at the local and state level,” she added. “The federal government, when called upon, provides support to those efforts. That interaction with the local and state governments is critical.“Given that this is potentially the Trump administration’s first major hurricane response to contend with, the administration’s actions and words are particularly important.”Ryan Grenoble contributed to this report."
1,THE WORLDPOST,Why Banning Hate Groups Won't End Them,"Cynthia Miller-Idriss, ContributorAssociate Professor of education and sociology, American Unive...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hate-groups-ban_us_599ca5a5e4b0d8dde999a009,"Bans often backfire, further fueling extremism by driving it underground and adding to disaffected youths' sense of unfairness or injustice.",2017-08-24,"White supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. Aug. 12.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599dfa051f00002a001aaa01.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After Charlottesville, it’s important to understand that banning hate groups is a risky strategy that can create unintended consequences. This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t ban hate groups. But it does mean that bans should be thought of less as strategies to combat the extremist fringe and more as symbolic actions to help shape and reassert the mainstream.Banning hate groups is one of the most effective strategies in the fight against white supremacy and right-wing extremism — but not for the reasons you might think. This is because banning hate groups — whether through shutting down campus speakers, internet domains or financial services platforms — won’t permanently affect their ability to mobilize, organize, recruit or raise money. Bans are temporary. They are important not because of what they silence, but because of what they say.For the past eight years, I’ve studied the varied ways in which right-wing extremist symbols, slogans and iconography are banned in Germany, from legal restrictions to school dress codes, for my forthcoming book, “The Extreme Gone Mainstream.” What I’ve learned is that bans matter because they establish clear moral boundaries.When companies ban hate groups from their clientele or universities expel students who participate in or celebrate violent acts, they draw a line that clearly conveys what they stand for. Bans send an unequivocal message that hate groups’ beliefs, statements and actions are so incompatible with mainstream values that their members and organizations are unwelcome as consumers, guests, speakers or visitors.In so doing, bans help redraw with clarity the lines of what is mainstream and what is not. They express solidarity and support for members of vulnerable groups — racial and ethnic minorities, Jews and Muslims, immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community — who feel threatened, scared and alone in the wake of white supremacists’ and right-wing extremists’ hateful rhetoric. Importantly, they provide a sense of efficacy to those who otherwise may feel helpless in the face of hate. And they establish moral guidelines for others to follow.So yes, bans matter — perhaps more now than ever — as a way of asserting moral leadership and clarifying institutional values. But what bans do not do is combat right-wing extremism itself. They are not an effective strategy to counter extremist ideologies. Even worse: bans often backfire, further fueling youth engagement in extremism by driving it underground and adding to disaffected youths’ sense of unfairness or injustice.Nowhere is this more evident than in Germany, where legal restrictions on the use of the swastika and bans on other extremist symbols in places like stadiums, schools and clubs have led to the wide use of coded right-wing symbols that help extremists circumvent bans. The most common of these, the number 88, takes the eighth letter of the alphabet (H) to stand for “HH,” or “Heil Hitler,” and is used by American right-wing extremists too.In Germany today, a wide range of alphanumeric codes are in play, many of which evolved in reaction to bans on the first wave of coded symbols like 88, 18 (for Adolf Hitler) or 28 (for Blood and Honor, the name of a banned group). For example, while I was doing fieldwork in the early 2000s for my first book, I learned that a German school had banned the number 88 from display. I then discovered that students started wearing T-shirts with the equation 100-12 on them. More recently, the right-wing scene has used the code “2yt4u,” relying on the phonetic pronunciation of the sequence to sound out the phrase “too white for you.” Over time, German legal restrictions and bans against far-right symbols are part of why games and codes are so popular with right-wing youth today — they always find new ways to manipulate symbols with evocative references, alpha-numeric sequences and mathematical equations.Breaking bans and taboos is clearly appealing to young people. Extremist groups already serve as spaces for disaffected youths to express anger, betrayal and resistance and to lash out at mainstream society, whose expectations are often seen as unattainable. Messaging worn on the extremist clothing and merchandise I study in Europe includes language like “F*** your society,” “No rules” and “Rebellion.” Banning far-right symbols and groups can make rebellion even more central to the cause by giving the far right a sense of legitimacy in narratives about silencing or infringement of free speech, effectively tapping into their anger and desire to resist.While silencing and shutting down the far right can make extremism worse, bans are important in other ways. They are tools for strengthening and defining collective social norms and values, reminding a nation what it stands for and what it will refuse to tolerate. In this sense, the cascade of bans we’ve seen in the U.S. since Charlottesville is most important not as a tactic to combat white supremacy, but rather as a strategy to affect and communicate with mainstream Americans and those who are the targets of far-right rhetoric and hate crimes.Effectively combatting hate groups will require a multi-pronged and long-term effort to better understand and interrupt the varied paths that lead young people into hate and violence. In addition to bans, policymakers, corporate and university leaders and others must commit to engaging in long-term work and in-depth strategies to prevent hate groups from further growing in the U.S. To do this well, we need more research on the varied factors that contribute to youth radicalization and violence, and more evaluation of the effectiveness of counter-radicalization programs intended to interrupt or reverse those processes. We also need to support and rely more heavily on the expertise of former extremists and the range of organizations that work with youth who have dropped out or exited extremist scenes. Finding ways to combat growing polarization will also help. We need more dialogue across our differences and more opportunities for people from diverse backgrounds to work collaboratively in local communities, schools and neighborhoods in ways that build trust, empathy and understanding."

Larson, who sits on Cinefamily’s advisory board, posted the statement to Instagram, writing: “The allegations at Cinefamily are upsetting to me personally, both as an advocate for sexual assault survivors and a member of the community.”On Monday morning, an anonymous email was sent to the Cinefamily community accusing Shadie Elnashai, the vice president of Cinefamily’s board of directors, and Hadrian Belove, the executive managing director of Cinefamily, of sexually harassing and abusing multiple younger female staff members.“Shadie and Hadrian exploit the eagerness of young female hopefuls to feed their own sexual needs,” the email reads. “These are not the only illegal activities this non profit organization engages in, but they are the most inexcusable.” (Head over to Jezebel to read the allegations in full.) The 27-year-old actress thanked the women who came forward with their stories of harassment, adding that Cinefamily should be a safe and welcoming community. “First, I would like to thank the brave survivors who spoke up ― I believe you,” Larson wrote. “The responsibility for handling allegations of this nature should never fall on the assaulted. Cinefamily prides itself on being a space of safety and communion ― it is time for further action to be taken to ensure that.”On Tuesday night, both Elnashai and Belove resigned from their positions at Cinefamily.The nonprofit released a statement in response to accusations included in the anonymous email.“Our non-profit organization has zero tolerance for any action intended to harm or injure our staff, volunteers, or patrons,” the statement read. “Any claims made are dealt with swiftly and directly, with respect and moral integrity.”Head to Facebook to read Cinefamily’s full statement.

3,MEDIA,Wall Street Journal Editor Berates Reporters For Critical Trump Coverage,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wall-street-journal-gerard-baker-leaked-emails-trump-phoenix_us_599e31d0e4b06d67e3351b00,"The editor-in-chief told reporters their coverage was packaged in ""selective criticism,"" according to emails obtained by The New York Times.",2017-08-24,"Gerard Baker, editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal, reportedly admonished Journal staffers over an article on President Donald Trump's speech Tuesday in Phoenix.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599e409a1e00003c00c5f11c.jpeg?cache=TUCiUtW8QR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The editor-in-chief of the Wall Street Journal reportedly berated reporters at the newspaper in a late-night email Wednesday over their coverage of President Donald Trump, according to internal emails obtained by The New York TimesThe email exchange between Gerard Baker and reporters concerned a story draft on Trump’s explosive campaign rally in Phoenix on Tuesday, when the president attacked the media and members of Congress, and threatened to shut down the government to press efforts to build his Mexico border wall.The reporters’ take on Trump’s rally was apparently too opinionated for Baker. “Sorry. This is commentary dressed up as news reporting,” Baker said in an email sent at midnight, according to the Times.In a follow-up email, Baker was more specific in his criticism: “Could we please just stick to reporting what he said rather than packaging it in exegesis and selective criticism?”The Times pointed out that several phrases about Trump included in the draft sent to Baker did not make it to the final story published on the Journal’s website Wednesday morning, including a line describing the white supremacy rally violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “reshaping” Trump’s presidency.Also not making it into print were phrases describing Trump’s speech as “off-script” and as pivoting from earlier remarks in which the president “solemnly called for unity.”This isn’t the first time Baker has appeared to ask staffers at the paper to hedge their language when reporting on Trump, who has close ties to the Journal’s owner Rupert Murdoch. (As the Times pointed out, Murdoch and Trump had dinner together in the White House recently.)In January, BuzzFeed obtained emails from Baker asking editors “to stop referring to the countries targeted” in Trump’s executive order as “majority-Muslim countries,” even though Trump’s ban does indeed target majority-Muslim countries. That same month, Baker appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and said the Journal wouldn’t be calling Trump’s lies “lies” in its reporting, a move that veteran news anchor Dan Rather called “deeply disturbing.”“I think it’s then up to the reader to make up their own mind to say, ‘This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. And you know what? I don’t think that’s true,’” Baker explained on NBC at the time.Many staffers in the Journal newsroom have expressed concerned over whether the paper has been too soft on Trump, both during the campaign and after the election, HuffPost’s Michael Calderone reported in February.The editor-in-chief defended the Journal’s coverage of Trump during a staff town hall in February, telling staffers, “Don’t let anybody get away with saying our reporting of Donald Trump has been soft.”But if Baker wanted to give the impression that the Journal was being fair on its coverage of the president, he may have missed his chance when the paper published stories based on an interview Baker scored with Trump in late July.Instead of publishing Baker’s full interview with Trump, the Journal published excerpts. Then Politico obtained a leaked transcript of Baker’s full interview with the president, which the Columbia Journalism Review called “embarrassing” for the paper.The transcript revealed Baker’s inability to press Trump if he got the facts wrong or to keep him on-topic, and it included a short and friendly visit from Ivanka Trump. Baker and the first daughter chatted about seeing each other at an elite media party in Southampton earlier that summer.Responding to the New York Times report on the emails Wednesday night, a Journal spokesman said in a statement: “The Wall Street Journal has a clear separation between news and opinion. As always, the key priority is to focus reporting on facts and avoid opinion seeping into news coverage.”"

Yeah, let’s say a girl. Let’s call her Tiffany. Tiffany is a huge football fan, and her favorite team, the San Francisco 49ers, is in the middle of a playoff run. Tiffany is from New York City, but worships the Niners for one reason ― Colin Kaepernick. She’ll strive to be like him ― principled, passionate, persistent.Have you heard his story? The real story? In the distant future, too few will remember the meaningful details ― if enough of us allow it to be whitewashed.The story will be told that there was a time when a few bad apples among our nation’s police forces were giving all officers a bad name. Instead of protecting and serving, they were taking innocent lives.When the justice system failed to hold these officers accountable, Colin took a stand by taking a knee during the national anthem. He wasn’t loud, he wasn’t abrasive, just passionate. He loved the United States so much, he was willing to call it out when we weren’t living up to our own ideals. Our ideals are important, they make us who we are, and when we fail to achieve them, everyone suffers.Colin understood this, so when things got tough, when players and the media criticized him, he didn’t get angry, he pushed on. When NFL owners challenged his stance, he responded with truth. Colin took a step back from the league to continue his fight, and when the time was right, a compassionate owner with a heart of gold brought him in. Without the kindness of this one rich man, who risked absolutely nothing by signing a talented quarterback, Colin would not matter.After the signing, the media spectacle was huge. Think pieces praising the owner were written faster than the average person could read them, talking heads glowed at the league’s “bold stance for racial justice.”But while the world basked in this progress, the first steps toward sanitizing Colin’s story were underway. Preseason began, ticket sales soared and the NFL grew giddy amid the PR boost. However, Colin? Well, he won’t get much of a chance, and after a few okay games, and maybe a year or two as a backup, he disappeared from the game.But Tiffany doesn’t know about that complicated portion of the story, and she probably won’t ever hear it ― the clips of Tomi Lahren calling Colin a terrorist, and Rush Limbaugh instigating listeners to attack him will serve as reminders of those dark days, but their outrageous rhetoric will create cover for the people who were just as racist but were more subtle in their articulation. Tiffany won’t hear about the owners who called him a terrorist, the death threats from nameless haters or the league’s all-powerful rebuke.Tiffany will get the feel-good stuff. And the stuff will be spectacularly good ― because despite the drama that she never sees, the league will parade Colin’s legacy for its own benefit.In Tiffany’s day, Colin’s likeness will sit in the Hall of Fame, players will be required to wear red cleats once a year to celebrate the first time Colin knelt for justice, and young fans will be inspired by his story.That’s right, in 20 years, Colin will be a hero.A hero who the league, in cahoots with the institution of white supremacy, will have sanitized to their liking.Behind closed doors, Colin will remain an example of rogue activism they will use to chide others who take a stand against injustice. Another unapologetically black activist whose accomplishments will be erased to fit a narrative.But the day Colin is openly appreciated for the sacrifices he made, the career he lost and the death threats he endured, the celebration will be led by his enemies. The same men who riled up opponents, handed those people a rope, and cheered in the dark as his character was assassinated, will be the ones who gush about how important Colin was and the way his activism inspires them.Some may call this a travesty, but that’s just the way whiteness works. When you lack the money to control a narrative, or the platforms to lead a conversation, the victors will choose how your story is told, even if they were the ones that supplied the rope to lynch you.Until then, Colin will continue to fight the system, and as he battles for black lives, and we battle for his right to do what he loves, the powers that be will recoil.Let’s strive for the day when doing the right thing will be celebrated in the moment, and not attacked for being “wrongheaded” or impatient."

If that wasn’t bad enough, Linton decided to respond to one commenter, Miller, who wrote: “Glad we could pay for your little getaway. #Deplorable.” In the now-deleted post, Linton responded to the rather harmless comment with a long and tasteless tirade. Linton mocked Miller, calling her “adorably out of touch” after apparently scrolling through Miller’s Instagram page. “@Jennimiller29 cute!....Aw!! Did you think this was a personal trip?! Adorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol,” Linton wrote. “Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I’m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day ‘trip’ than you did.” (Scroll down to read Linton’s full response.) In her essay on CNN, Miller wrote that Linton’s response only furthered her original point. “She chose to respond in a way that only clarified her privilege by extolling her wealth and position,” Miller wrote. “In a follow-up post on Instagram, she said I was out of touch, which I find incredibly laughable. I don’t think she has any idea what everyday Americans deal with, especially when it comes to economic struggles. Since her husband is secretary of the treasury, it behooves her to find out.”Although Linton issued a statement on Tuesday apologizing for her response to Miller, the mother of three remains skeptical. “Nothing [Linton] says now can negate the fact that her initial response to my frustration was to continue bragging about her wealth and to allege that her contributions to society have been more significant than mine,” Miller wrote.Miller added that Linton’s bragging shows the stark contrast between her lavish lifestyle and that of many hardworking Americans that her husband is meant to represent. “Americans are hurting ― some even dying ― as they struggle with racism, poverty and health care costs. And yet the wealthy Linton defends her boasting and derides me, a hardworking, taxpaying American, in the process,” Miller wrote. “Her husband serves in the executive branch of our government. At the very least, she owes the American people the appearance of compassion and, to use her own word, humanity.”She wrapped up her poignant essay by calling on Linton’s empathy and humanity: “You’re a prominent person now, Linton, so please use your influence for good.”Head over to CNN to read Miller’s full response to Linton.

10,MEDIA,Trump Takes Authoritarian Stance In Portraying Journalists As Anti-American Enemy,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-portrays-journalists-as-anti-american_us_599da653e4b0d8dde99a844c,"“This was incitement, plain and simple” ABC News correspondent Cecilia Vega said following Trump's Phoenix rally.",2017-08-23,Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday night that the news media is working against the American people.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599daa2c1e00002700c5efc9.jpeg?cache=prlCBUIFlq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump followed in the tradition of authoritarian rulers during Tuesday night’s raucous rally in Phoenix by accusing journalists of disliking their own country and actively working toward its failure. It was an insidious line of attack that stood out even to journalists accustomed to Trump’s persistent swipes at the press over the past two years. “This one felt different,” ABC News correspondent Cecilia Vega said Wednesday on “Good Morning America. “It really feels like a matter of time, frankly, before someone gets hurt.”Trump’s demonization of the press was apparent throughout the 2016 campaign, as he recklessly attacked journalists at rallies and blacklisted others. He now routinely dismisses critical coverage as “fake news,” and several of the insults he used Tuesday night could’ve come straight from his Twitter feed. The president ripped the “failing New York Times,” accused Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos of using the paper as a lobbying arm for Amazon, and called CNN “pathetic” ― an insult which prompted a “CNN Sucks!” chant from the crowd that the president appeared to relish. He did praise some in the media as “honest,” like Fox News, which Trump said “has treated me fairly.”But Trump shifted into more dangerous territory when accusing the news media of dividing and weakening the country, a way of delegitimizing perceived critics that’s reminiscent of autocratic rulers. “Honestly, these are really, really dishonest people,” Trump said of the press. “And they are bad people. And I really think they don’t like our country. I really believe that.”Trump also said of the press that “you would think they’d want to make our country great again” and yet he “honestly believ[ed] they don’t.”Vega, who at one point filmed the jeering crowd of Trump supporters, described the president’s remarks as “incitement, plain and simple.”Trump’s rhetoric Tuesday night harked back to his February accusation that the “fake news media” is the “enemy of the people,” specifically outlets such as The New York Times and major TV news organizations. The phrase “enemy of the people” has a troubling history. The Nazis maligned Jews as enemies of Germany, and China’s Chairman Mao Zedong employed the same construction to target dissenters. Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin also used the phrase to disparage political adversaries and others opposed to their dictatorial rule. Nina Khrushcheva ― a New School professor and great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who actually rejected the term “enemy of the people” in 1956 ― told The Times in February that Trump’s words were “shocking to hear in a non-Soviet, moreover non-Stalinist setting.” She likened Trump’s “enemy of the people” line to notorious dictators of the past in that the “formulas of insult, humiliation, domination, branding, enemy-forming and name calling are always the same.”MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a former friend of Trump who has since emerged as a frequent critic, described Trump’s anti-press statements on Wednesday morning as “Stalinist.”Trump has long shown a soft spot for strongmen. He’s heaped more praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin than on traditional European allies who operate in more open and democratic ways. He’s also praised autocrats like Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government jails more journalists than any other, and Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who has justified killing journalists, among others.Though Trump didn’t specifically use the phrase “enemy of the people” on Tuesday night, he repeatedly suggested that the press and the public are in opposition. “You’re taxpaying Americans who love our nation, obey our laws, and care for our people,” Trump said. “It’s time to expose the crooked media deceptions and to challenge the media for their role in fomenting divisions, and yes, by the way ... they are trying to take away our history and our heritage.” That reference to “history and heritage” is particularly ominous in light of the killing of an anti-racist protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, allegedly by a white supremacist. Trump received widespread criticism for initially blaming “many sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, rather than directly calling out the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who descended on the city. On Tuesday night, Trump accused the news media of distorting his remarks while conveniently leaving out how he faulted “many sides” early on. Trump has also recently bemoaned the loss of “beautiful” public statues of Confederate leaders, who were secessionists fighting to preserve slavery in the United States. He’s said the statues’ removal would rip apart the country’s “history and culture.” The president’s characterization of the press is especially alarming, given that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has repeatedly refused to rule out jailing journalists for doing their jobs and suggested last month that the Trump administration intended to make it easier to subpoena reporters in attempts to find out their confidential sources. Sessions said that press freedom is “not unlimited,” and when covering national security, journalists “cannot place lives at risk with impunity” ― language that raised fears of legal repercussions for the act of reporting. News organizations typically engage with the government prior to publishing sensitive or classified information, and editors try to balance the need to inform the public with national security concerns. And yet the president’s accusations may help foster a climate in which journalists’ actions are viewed as suspect at best, or anti-American at worst. On Twitter, several prominent journalists expressed concern over Trump’s language and the possible violent repercussions, an understandable fear given recent physical attacks on reporters. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson said that Trump’s claim that journalists don’t love their country is “a vile, cynical and disgusting lie.”Tom Ricks, a veteran military journalist, labeled Trump’s behavior “un-American.”And Jim VandeHei, the co-founder of Politico and more recently of Axios, described Trump’s comments about reporters as “despicable, extremely deceptive, and dangerous.”“To say reporters erase America’s heritage, don’t love America, turn off cameras to hide truth, are to blame for racial tension is just plain wrong,” VandeHei tweeted, noting the work of Daniel Pearl, a journalist who was decapitated while reporting in Pakistan, and others who died while “exposing facts.”“There are great Americans deeply concerned about a changing nation,” VandeHei continued. “God forbid one buys Trump’s mad rant and takes action.”"

Phillips will also direct the untitled project, which is meant to be an origin story within the DC Comics’ expanding cinematic universe. Deadline said Martin Scorsese will produce the movie, but a source close to the production told HuffPost that the “Goodfellas” director’s involvement is not official. He is in “early discussions” to join.The Joker vehicle is the first in a “yet-to-be announced new banner under DC [that] will give the studio the opportunity to expand the canon with unique story angles revolving around these iconic characters,” according to a Warner Bros. statement.Despite the dozens of Gotham City scoundrels that appear in the comic books, this green-haired creep has clearly become Hollywood’s go-to Bruce Wayne adversary. The Joker was first introduced to the big screen in 1966′s “Batman,” in which Caesar Romero portrayed him as an eccentric prankster. Jack Nicholson gave the character a darker spin in Tim Burton’s 1989 hit, also called “Batman.” Mark Hamill voiced The Joker in “Batman: The Animated Series,” as well as its 1993 spinoff movie, “Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.” Zach Galifianakis voiced him in this year’s “The Lego Batman Movie.” The Joker’s most recent live-action screen appearance came in last year’s dreadful “Suicide Squad,” where he was played by Jared Leto, who is expected to reprise the part in both the sequel and the Harley Quinn spinoff. Before that, Heath Ledger won a posthumous Oscar for bringing corrupt gusto to the role in 2008′s “The Dark Knight.”Even though Leto is the current Joker, Warner Bros. will seek a different actor for this movie, which will take place in early-1980s Gotham. Deadline says its tone will emulate that of gritty Scorsese classics like “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull.” Where does a director like Phillips fit into a hard-edged crime thriller? Your guess is as good as ours.Different films have given The Joker different backstories, so the direction this stand-alone effort will take is unclear. The most common origin involves The Joker tumbling into a vat of chemical waste that bleaches his skin and drives him mad. In Burton’s “Batman,” The Joker was the one who murdered Bruce Wayne’s parents. What evil will he get up to this time? We’ll find out soon enough."

Robert E. Lee. City councils and universities have since moved to take down several controversial monuments, while demonstrators have toppled others.Although the debate over Confederate statues is uniquely American, the broader question of how a nation should memorialize painful or divisive parts of its past is an issue that numerous countries still struggle to address. Some have chosen to outright remove monuments or notorious buildings, while others have recontextualized them or built new ones in their place. Whatever the outcome, the process is often contentious.“Most countries have been pretty reluctant or just don’t know how to commemorate periods of shame or national crimes perpetrated in the national name. No country is very good at it, and we haven’t been very good at it, either,” said James E. Young, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who has consulted for governments on how to memorialize their pasts. In Europe, many post-Soviet states have chosen to take down the statues of Josef Stalin and Vladimir Lenin that dotted their cities under communist rule. Ukraine, for instance, has removed over a thousand Lenin statues following the ouster of its pro-Russia president in 2014. But some former communist states have instead decided to move their Soviet-era monuments somewhere else or alter them to connote new meaning. Hungary keeps many of its communist-era statues in a memorial park, a move Taiwan also favored for statues of its former leader Chiang Kai-shek.In other cases, citizens have taken it upon themselves to respond. In 1991, a young Czech artist in Prague painted a Soviet World War II-era tank monument entirely pink. The artist was arrested for vandalism, but members of Parliament repainted the tank to protest his detention.In countries like Italy and Spain, where brick-and-mortar remnants of fascist rule are still standing, architectural works and even human remains have been a source of debate. Spanish Parliament passed a nonbinding vote in May urging the removal of former dictator Francisco Franco’s body from a public tomb ― something that has yet to occur.France, meanwhile, bans any monument to its Nazi-collaborating Vichy government, and as of 2013, every street name featuring Vichy leader Philippe Pétain had been changed.Nowhere in Europe, however, has had to confront its past crimes on the same scale as Germany. The country’s reckoning for World War II and the Holocaust has led to the preservation of some sites, such as Auschwitz, while most other symbols of Nazi rule were systematically destroyed or banned. It is currently illegal for Germans to display any symbols associated with Nazism or Adolf Hitler, with a few exceptions for artistic purposes. Holocaust denial, too, is a prosecutable offense. Along with the removal of monuments to the Third Reich, Germany has also built memorials and museums that commemorate the victims of Nazism. Seeking to counteract the grandiose monuments the Nazis built, some of the memorials have taken on more experimental forms. The city of Hamburg erected the Monument Against Fascism in 1986, consisting of a 39-foot pillar upon which citizens were invited to engrave their names in solidarity. When a portion of the pillar was filled up with signatures, that section was lowered into the ground, bringing an unmarked section down and starting the process again until eventually the whole pillar was completely gone. The work took seven years and ended with the erection of a plaque commemorating the monument that stated, “In the end it is only we ourselves who can stand up against injustice.”Germany has also created federally funded projects to atone for its past. In the mid-1990s, the country held competitions to design a memorial for the 6 million Jewish people killed by the Nazis. It sparked a fierce debate as artists and politicians argued over how it was possible to properly memorialize the Holocaust.One of the artist submissions for the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe even proposed that Germany destroy Berlin’s famous Brandenburg Gate and sprinkle the dust over the monument site, then cover the area with granite plates. The concept aimed to memorialize the void left by the Holocaust with another absence. The design ultimately chosen, created by architect Peter Eisenman, opened in 2005 and features thousands of concrete, tomb-like slabs rising from the ground on an uneven plane. Meanwhile, across Canada, there are small monuments that focus on healing and understanding of “Canada’s Holocaust,” which ripped 150,000 indigenous children from their families and placed them in residential schools under the guise of education.The policy ― which the U.S. also pursued ― began in the 19th century and continued in some form until the last school was finally closed in 1996. The children died from malnutrition and other horrific conditions, and generations were traumatized by the institutions’ legacy of sexual and physical abuse.Recent Canadian initiatives have focused less on building memorials and more on removing monuments or tributes to notorious or polarizing historic figures. In June, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau renamed the Langevin Block, which houses his office. The building’s namesake was Sir Hector-Louis Langevin, one of the architects of the residential school system. The city of Calgary also renamed the Langevin Bridge this year.In Mexico, sites honoring controversial figures from the country’s past have also become targets for removal or public ire. In 1981, President José López Portillo installed a statue of Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who carries a brutal colonial legacy, in Mexico City. It lasted a year before the subsequent presidential administration took it down.A statue of Mexico’s former dictator Porfirio Díaz, unveiled in 2015, also drew protests, with demonstrators at the ceremony chanting that it would come down. It is still currently standing.Mexico has also built monuments for its national tragedies. One such site is a memorial in Mexico City for the hundreds of student demonstrators killed by government forces during the Tlatelolco Massacre in 1968, when police and armed forces opened fire on the crowd.Another, unofficial, monument stands on Mexico City’s Paseo de la Reforma to honor the 43 missing student activists who are presumed dead after they disappeared following an attack by police in 2014.One of the closest and most recent analogues for the U.S. push to remove Confederate statues took place in South Africa, where a student movement rose up against memorials to historical figures who promoted forced racial segregation. A groundswell of resistance to colonial and apartheid-era monuments began in 2015, when a student at the University of Cape Town flung a bucket of excrement on a prominent statue of Cecil John Rhodes, a 19th-century imperialist who paved the way for the country’s apartheid system.South Africa’s student movement against Rhodes and other colonial figures grew in size and spread to other campuses. The demonstrations eventually prompted the university to remove the Rhodes statue and forced the government to propose a plan to create “common parks” that situated the statues in a context that discussed the country’s history.South Africa’s Arts and Culture Department told HuffPost South Africa on Friday that it would comment in early September on that project’s progress.The different approaches to memorializing atrocities and painful national histories show that the U.S. could address its Confederate monuments in various ways. But it’s possible the country will remain stuck in this debate for some time.So far, action on Confederate statues and other controversial memorials has been piecemeal and conducted mainly at the local level, given the huge obstacles to a systematic and coherent national process of dealing with them. President Donald Trump has repeatedly opposed the removal of statues and used the issue to rile up his base.Trump has lamented the “history and culture of our great country being ripped apart” as Confederate statues come down. He reiterated his opposition to their removal during a campaign-style rally in Phoenix on Tuesday. Polls show that the public is also split over what to do with the statues, with a majority wanting the figures to remain in place.But the continuous rise and fall of memorials across the world also shows that regardless of their history, monuments are not as permanent as they may seem. “Monuments are never really perpetual or built for perpetuity, they’re built to last as long as the generation that built them,” Young said.“They come into being as a cultural production, they’re received, their meanings change and when time is up, they go away,” he added. “Just like any other human production.”Andree Lau contributed to this report from HuffPost Canada, Marc Davies contributed from HuffPost South Africa, Alexandre Boudet contributed from Le Huffington Post, Sebastian Christ contributed from HuffPost Germany, Alejandro Angeles contributed from HuffPost Mexico."

Polls show that the public is also split over what to do with the statues, with a majority wanting the figures to remain in place.But the continuous rise and fall of memorials across the world also shows that regardless of their history, monuments are not as permanent as they may seem. “Monuments are never really perpetual or built for perpetuity, they’re built to last as long as the generation that built them,” Young said.“They come into being as a cultural production, they’re received, their meanings change and when time is up, they go away,” he added. “Just like any other human production.”Andree Lau contributed to this report from HuffPost Canada, Marc Davies contributed from HuffPost South Africa, Alexandre Boudet contributed from Le Huffington Post, Sebastian Christ contributed from HuffPost Germany, Alejandro Angeles contributed from HuffPost Mexico."

It’s clear to us all that America’s roads, highways, bridges, hospitals, government buildings, airports, and sewers are in dire need of repair. Trump touted $200 billion in new spending, and additional incentives for private investment — which really boils down to privatizing American infrastructure. We’ve seen a decline in infrastructure spending the last several years, and The New York Times reports that “In 34 states, spending on government construction projects was lower last year than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. The trend has continued this year. Public construction spending in June was 9.5 percent lower than during the same month last year.”As state budgets are cut, projects are halted. So where will this outpouring of money come from? Private investors will step in, with the promise of big tax incentives. Companies will undoubtedly focus on projects that are the most profitable, keeping labor and supply costs down in the process, rather than on building the infrastructure that is most needed. Tracy Gordon, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, tells The Atlantic that “Government is in the business of providing. Business does not want to provide.”The outcome will be that private companies chosen for major projects will not invest in the infrastructure where it’s needed in the vast expanse of “rural America” Trump keeps talking about, like establishing broadband internet. Rural communities don’t generate a solid return on investment for them.Instead of incentives for our richest companies, the federal government needs to step up to find funds for the game-changing projects in rural areas, as well as real changes in cities. My organization, LAANE (Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy) has been part of successful efforts in Los Angeles to build infrastructure while providing good jobs for our communities who need them most. The RePower LA campaign, which includes partnerships with IBEW Local 18, Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE), and other community and environmental organizations, advocates for equitable clean energy investment and good jobs at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Our coalition has expanded solar and energy efficiency for Los Angeles, including upgrading existing lighting and power sources for homeowners throughout the city. We promote a union pre-apprenticeship program that recruits women and communities of color, including the re-entry population, to learn electrical and water utility skills and get on the path to a career at the DWP. This work is being done to benefit folks with barriers to employment, while also improving our city’s water and power infrastructure. LAANE is also working with a new coalition, Our Water LA, to find better ways to capture LA County stormwater. We want to advance water resilience and make sure that water conservation jobs are good, union jobs that support local families. On the national front, our affiliate, the Partnership for Working Families (PWF), supports similar projects in major cities across the country. As PWF Executive Director Nikki Fortunato Bas says, “We must remember that infrastructure investment is a justice issue that will either move us toward greater racial, environmental, economic and gender equity or further from it.”There are many of us who recognize the value of better streets, transportation, and upkeep of our aging systems — so much so that we are willing to tax ourselves to fund these crucial projects. As Donald Cohen, Executive Director of In the Public Interest, points out, tax increases tied to building projects are gaining traction in major cities, including Los Angeles.“In November [2016], over 70 percent of Los Angeles voters approved increasing a sales tax to raise $120 billion for expanding mass transit and improving highways. Like all infrastructure investment, the new spending will help boost the regional economy. But Los Angeles will go even further: construction jobs will be targeted for workers from high-poverty ZIP codes and apprenticeship programs, and the recently incarcerated.”This comprehensive approach takes into account the importance of good jobs and local input on plans for maintenance and new projects, and this is critical to our country’s next phase of strong infrastructure. The last thing we need is a handful of corporations making these decisions for us, and contracts with low road employers that decrease the possibility of strong, family-sustaining jobs for more Americans."

It was unclear what exactly had started the uproar.Four people who were in the middle of the crowd said Trump supporters and opponents were yelling at one another as the crowd dispersed following the rally ― a rambling, 77-minute address. “I was outside and nothing was happening when a cop just threw a smoke bomb and dispersed everybody,” Misha Smith, 42, said outside the convention center. “Then people started throwing water bottles.”After a tense standoff, police officers wearing gas masks stood in a line in front of the convention center on 2nd Street and ordered the crowd to leave before moving forward with riot shields. Loud bangs sounded in the sky. “Everyone was just standing there,” said Jalyna Ramos, 23, a University of Arizona student. “We were literally just standing there, just hanging out. Literally out of nowhere people started running. It sounded like a really loud gunshot, and I saw a woman on the floor in tears.”The confrontation dragged on for more than an hour as police pressed the remaining protesters a block away from the convention center, then lined up along the street. They repeatedly announced through a loudspeaker that anyone who remained in the area would be arrested.Police then pushed into the remaining crowd, which had thinned to a few dozen people, and again launched projectiles. They pepper-sprayed a crowd that included a young girl. Phoenix police said they did not carry out any arrests, and no one was reported injured. But law enforcement officials said some protesters had thrown rocks and bottles at authorities, telling AZ Central in a statement that they had “dispersed some gas in the area.”Thousands of people were expected to gather at the Phoenix venue that hosted Trump’s rally, with some of the president’s most ardent supporters lining up by Tuesday morning. At least 3,000 others said they planned to protest Trump and his anti-immigrant views outside the convention center in an effort to “send a very clear message that we will not pardon white supremacy.”Nick Visser contributed to this report."

Edward Wilson said by telephone from the Medical University of South Carolina’s Storm Eye Institute in Charleston.It was a similar story at the University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, New York City’s Health + Hospitals/Bellevue, the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and the Casey Eye Institute in Portland, Oregon: not a blurry eye in sight.At Nashville’s Vanderbilt University Medical Center, however, seven people were scheduled to see doctors with concerns from viewing the eclipse, Dr. Shriji Patel said.“We have opened extra clinics over the next three days, and I’m expecting them to be full,” he said.Direct exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet radiation even for a fraction of a minute can be enough to overwhelm the photoreceptor cells lining the back of the eye. The symptoms ― blind spots and blurriness ― become apparent in the following hours. It can take months, but the retina can largely heal itself if the damage is not severe.In the largest investigation into an eclipse’s effects on a nation’s ocular health, doctors found 70 cases of sun-damaged retinas after an eclipse shadowed the United Kingdom in 1999, according to a 2001 paper published in Eye, a medical journal.The paper noted this was a low incidence for a country then home to some 55 million, and symptoms cleared up for all 70 people within six months.Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Lisa Shumaker"

Arpaio has been scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 5 and faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine, according to Reuters.In 2013, a federal judge ordered Arpaio to halt his department’s practice of routinely stopping Latino drivers because they might be undocumented immigrants, ruling it amounted to racial profiling. Arpaio had his officers conducting what he called “saturation patrols” in an attempt to find people who had entered the country illegally.Arpaio, 85, later publicly acknowledged he violated that judge’s order but argued that his action were “not intentional.”While speaking with Fox News, Trump called Arpaio “a great American patriot.”“I hate to see what has happened to him,” Trump said.Trump also spent years touting birther conspiracies. He didn’t acknowledge Obama was born a U.S. citizen until September 2016, less than two months before Trump won the presidency. Even after he held a press conference on the issue ― during which he said, “President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.” ― Arpaio floated the idea that Trump might still doubt the legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate.Amid this controversy, Arpaio in November lost his re-election bid to Democrat Paul Penzone.

Sometimes we might get caught up with focusing on our kids’ happiness and success - and assume that issues of racism, antisemitism, chauvinism or conversely tolerance and equality - will just “come naturally” or just sort themselves out. The thing is that the most conscious ways of being in the world don’t come naturally. Or at least not in our heavily constructed culture and not to most of us. We usually need to actively, passionately and deliberately cultivate an alternative approach - or the old mantras and ideas will continue to play out, generation by generation. “Cultural competence is an ongoing and dynamic process that asks us not only to acknowledge the cultures of those different from us but to celebrate them”. - Nicole A CookeAs Mrs. Cooke teaches: It’s not enough to teach tolerance. Tolerance is the capacity to endure pain or hardship - as though coming together with members of other races than our own was some kind of difficult thing. A step above tolerance is awareness - being able to tolerate and even being aware of cultural differences. But as conscious parents, I believe our goal needs to go beyond that - to culture competence and consciousness.“It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.” - Audre Lorde, in her book, Sister OutsiderSo how do we raise race conscious kids? I don’t have “The Answer”. But I have some ideas, and I’d love to hear yours in the comments below (pssst, this is NOT a forum for heated or hateful speech so if that’s your thing, please don’t waste your time here). 1. Teach them world history, not only our own history - One of the things that widens our perspective like no other is being exposed to other people’s stories. And the more diverse, wide ranging and wordy they are the more our eyes are opened to other people’s narratives. What can easily feed seeds of hate - is fear - and what creates fear is a lack of familiarity with the “other”. A little tip I learned from the Charlotte Mason educational pedagogy is to focus on first-person “real live” books - i.e. historical fictions that tell realistic stories in the first person - these make identifying with the feelings, challenges and agendas of the story teller so much closer to home and accessible. 2. Expose them (actively) to others - When our social circles, churches, schools and neighbors all look uniform and homegenues - we get the underlying message that this is the “right” or even the “only” way to look, behave and feel. When we’re not coming into contact with people who look different than we do - they feel “alien” and even threatening to us. As parents we can counterbalance this by even our small day to day actions - taking longer to chat with the lady on the bus, being kind and friendly to a stranger in the supermarket. Or even take steps to actively find more inclusive, diverse groups. 3. Bring up equality and racism in conversation - When there’s something that we’re nervous to discuss, such as death, money, sex and race - it’s probably a key indicator that this topic should be brought up. We’re all petrified of our child making some embarrassing remark to someone they know: whether it’s the feat that your little girl asks your favorite Aunt why her behind is “sooo large?” (true story: I did this to my aunt when I was 4) or the fear that your white child will ask his black friend why their hair is “so springy”. The fact is that children are mostly uninhibited when it comes to questions about bodies… or anything personal… 4. Arm them with ways of protecting others - Whatever race you and your children are - it’s always important to arm children with active tools of nonviolent communication to step in and defend anyone they witness being mistreated. Children need to know that is what is expected of them and that should be taught and upheld by adults from the youngest of ages. We need real tools for this, discussing hypothetical scenarios and practicing what one can do (tend to the victim of bullying, stand up to the bully, call an adult for help etc). 5. Model “uncomfortable” conversations - Do not avoid asking people about their story. Many of us do because we’re afraid of stepping on toes or being perceived as insensitive or not minding our business. And I’m not suggesting getting nosy. But when we’re uncomfortable and we completely sidestep entire sides of a person - such as not asking where they are from - because we’re worried about the answers we might get - we can inadvertently create inhibition in them. As though they have something to hide. Our children need to see us taking interest in others, wanting to know more, being open to hearing other perspectives - curious, interested… and that leads me to...6. Teach them open ended questions - One of the best “peace” tools I think exists, for couples, friends and even countries is open ended questions and active listening. It’s something most of us were never taught and never even experienced. When you feel you have never been truly heard you learn to shout louder, or to shut up completely. We can offer our children this experience by asking: “what’s that like for you?” “Can you tell me more?” “Can you tell me about that?” “how does that feel?” - open ended questions is all about listening to and absorbing someone else’s experience. When we feel listened to we’re more likely to have space to listen to and hold space for others. 7. Buy dolls and books that expose them to other narratives - Our market place is often a true reflection of white privilege acting itself out through the toys, books and TV shows on offer. Toys are overwhelmingly white - and this is painful for children of color to not be represented. It’s also damaging to all children because it portrays a skewed version of the world and reinforces the idea that one race - namely whites - are superior to others. We can put out money in toys and books that create a more diverse play room in our homes. As my friend, Maria, pointed out to me - we can take this even a notch further. Not only choosing toys themselves that represent diverse peoples, but also choosing to support toy companies of marginalized communities. For some ideas on where to start, check out the links below.8. Protect Childhood Issues of racism or antisemitism can ignite within us a wild fire of terror and fear. Whilst I don’t think we should protect our children from these topics I think we should protect them from the intensity and violence that these topics sometimes come with. This means not going into too graphic a detail, not seeing scary videos or the news. As someone who myself experienced severe PTSD after over-exposure to terror attacks (and the news coverage that went with them) - I can safely recommend that this does not serve anyone. Further, our own anxiety and rage needs to be kept in check, as parents. We need to insulate ourselves to the degree necessary to compose ourselves from a place of love and tolerance, not of hatred and fear. I think part of teaching kids consciousness around race, anti semitism or any other form of violent intolerance - is teaching them what the opposite looks like. Embracing those members in society who need it. Understanding history, having tough conversations, using open ended questions, being open to learn and to teach, taking active steps to expose ourselves and our children to other narratives and to other people - these are some of the ideas that come to mind for me when I think about raising race conscious children. The root of racism is a deep misunderstanding of the “other”, it’s a feeling of fear and distance from anyone who isn’t like us. My guess is that those fears and violent feelings are rooted in childhood and in a family and community who felt superior and violent as well. That is why we fight fear with love.This is not an easy topic to address - and I’m sure I’ve stepped on someone’s toes, or worse. But in the spirit of opening the conversation with curiosity and nonviolent communication, please extend me the benefit of the doubt.

Sometimes we might get caught up with focusing on our kids’ happiness and success - and assume that issues of racism, antisemitism, chauvinism or conversely tolerance and equality - will just “come naturally” or just sort themselves out. The thing is that the most conscious ways of being in the world don’t come naturally. Or at least not in our heavily constructed culture and not to most of us. We usually need to actively, passionately and deliberately cultivate an alternative approach - or the old mantras and ideas will continue to play out, generation by generation. “Cultural competence is an ongoing and dynamic process that asks us not only to acknowledge the cultures of those different from us but to celebrate them”. - Nicole A CookeAs Mrs. Cooke teaches: It’s not enough to teach tolerance. Tolerance is the capacity to endure pain or hardship - as though coming together with members of other races than our own was some kind of difficult thing. A step above tolerance is awareness - being able to tolerate and even being aware of cultural differences. But as conscious parents, I believe our goal needs to go beyond that - to culture competence and consciousness.“It is not our differences that divide us. It is our inability to recognize, accept, and celebrate those differences.” - Audre Lorde, in her book, Sister OutsiderSo how do we raise race conscious kids? I don’t have “The Answer”. But I have some ideas, and I’d love to hear yours in the comments below (pssst, this is NOT a forum for heated or hateful speech so if that’s your thing, please don’t waste your time here). 1. Teach them world history, not only our own history - One of the things that widens our perspective like no other is being exposed to other people’s stories. And the more diverse, wide ranging and wordy they are the more our eyes are opened to other people’s narratives. What can easily feed seeds of hate - is fear - and what creates fear is a lack of familiarity with the “other”. A little tip I learned from the Charlotte Mason educational pedagogy is to focus on first-person “real live” books - i.e. historical fictions that tell realistic stories in the first person - these make identifying with the feelings, challenges and agendas of the story teller so much closer to home and accessible. 2. Expose them (actively) to others - When our social circles, churches, schools and neighbors all look uniform and homegenues - we get the underlying message that this is the “right” or even the “only” way to look, behave and feel. When we’re not coming into contact with people who look different than we do - they feel “alien” and even threatening to us. As parents we can counterbalance this by even our small day to day actions - taking longer to chat with the lady on the bus, being kind and friendly to a stranger in the supermarket. Or even take steps to actively find more inclusive, diverse groups. 3. Bring up equality and racism in conversation - When there’s something that we’re nervous to discuss, such as death, money, sex and race - it’s probably a key indicator that this topic should be brought up. We’re all petrified of our child making some embarrassing remark to someone they know: whether it’s the feat that your little girl asks your favorite Aunt why her behind is “sooo large?” (true story: I did this to my aunt when I was 4) or the fear that your white child will ask his black friend why their hair is “so springy”. The fact is that children are mostly uninhibited when it comes to questions about bodies… or anything personal… 4. Arm them with ways of protecting others - Whatever race you and your children are - it’s always important to arm children with active tools of nonviolent communication to step in and defend anyone they witness being mistreated. Children need to know that is what is expected of them and that should be taught and upheld by adults from the youngest of ages. We need real tools for this, discussing hypothetical scenarios and practicing what one can do (tend to the victim of bullying, stand up to the bully, call an adult for help etc). 5. Model “uncomfortable” conversations - Do not avoid asking people about their story. Many of us do because we’re afraid of stepping on toes or being perceived as insensitive or not minding our business. And I’m not suggesting getting nosy. But when we’re uncomfortable and we completely sidestep entire sides of a person - such as not asking where they are from - because we’re worried about the answers we might get - we can inadvertently create inhibition in them. As though they have something to hide. Our children need to see us taking interest in others, wanting to know more, being open to hearing other perspectives - curious, interested… and that leads me to...6. Teach them open ended questions - One of the best “peace” tools I think exists, for couples, friends and even countries is open ended questions and active listening. It’s something most of us were never taught and never even experienced. When you feel you have never been truly heard you learn to shout louder, or to shut up completely. We can offer our children this experience by asking: “what’s that like for you?” “Can you tell me more?” “Can you tell me about that?” “how does that feel?” - open ended questions is all about listening to and absorbing someone else’s experience. When we feel listened to we’re more likely to have space to listen to and hold space for others. 7. Buy dolls and books that expose them to other narratives - Our market place is often a true reflection of white privilege acting itself out through the toys, books and TV shows on offer. Toys are overwhelmingly white - and this is painful for children of color to not be represented. It’s also damaging to all children because it portrays a skewed version of the world and reinforces the idea that one race - namely whites - are superior to others. We can put out money in toys and books that create a more diverse play room in our homes. As my friend, Maria, pointed out to me - we can take this even a notch further. Not only choosing toys themselves that represent diverse peoples, but also choosing to support toy companies of marginalized communities. For some ideas on where to start, check out the links below.8. Protect Childhood Issues of racism or antisemitism can ignite within us a wild fire of terror and fear. Whilst I don’t think we should protect our children from these topics I think we should protect them from the intensity and violence that these topics sometimes come with. This means not going into too graphic a detail, not seeing scary videos or the news. As someone who myself experienced severe PTSD after over-exposure to terror attacks (and the news coverage that went with them) - I can safely recommend that this does not serve anyone. Further, our own anxiety and rage needs to be kept in check, as parents. We need to insulate ourselves to the degree necessary to compose ourselves from a place of love and tolerance, not of hatred and fear. I think part of teaching kids consciousness around race, anti semitism or any other form of violent intolerance - is teaching them what the opposite looks like. Embracing those members in society who need it. Understanding history, having tough conversations, using open ended questions, being open to learn and to teach, taking active steps to expose ourselves and our children to other narratives and to other people - these are some of the ideas that come to mind for me when I think about raising race conscious children. The root of racism is a deep misunderstanding of the “other”, it’s a feeling of fear and distance from anyone who isn’t like us. My guess is that those fears and violent feelings are rooted in childhood and in a family and community who felt superior and violent as well. That is why we fight fear with love.This is not an easy topic to address - and I’m sure I’ve stepped on someone’s toes, or worse. But in the spirit of opening the conversation with curiosity and nonviolent communication, please extend me the benefit of the doubt.

Though he only faces “up to” six months in jail, any pardon by Arpaio would be a set-back for civil rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law in the United States. From the founding of our nation until today, we have been often reminded to carefully guard our constitutional freedoms; now is not the time to fail in this responsibility. Understanding Arpaio’s recent career is vital to grasping the significance of his conviction. Starting in 2005, Arpaio’s racially-targeted enforcement of immigration law became controversial. One Department of Justice report determined that his policies were the worst pattern of racial profiling in United States history. His obsession with immigration enforcement even obscured the enforcement of other laws, including those prohibiting sexual assault and child rape.Arpaio’s immigration enforcement policies included sweeps of Latino neighborhoods and the detention of individuals solely on the basis of their race. As a result, he was the defendant in two lawsuits, including one brought by the Department of Justice. Despite his department’s effort to criminally investigate the presiding judge, one suit resulted in a federal injunction against his department’s continued use of racial profiling and a $4.4 million dollar judgment against his department.Despite the injunction, Arpaio declared in 2014 that he would continue the racist immigration policies until he was held in contempt. A federal court granted his wish last month, finding him guilty of criminal contempt. Now, President Trump is considering a pardon.If President Trump follows through, substantial harm may come to racial minorities in the United States. According to Professor Robert Spitzer, an expert on the subject, presidential pardons usually happen when the president feels “that the person has suffered enough,” that “the person being pardoned was prosecute[d] wrongly” or “subject to a sentence that was out or proportion to the crime,” or that “the person being pardoned has reformed himself.” None of these are the case here. Instead, President Trump would pardon Arpaio for two possible reasons: either (1) due to Arpaio’s early political support for his presidential campaign; or (2) on the basis of his political agreement—that is, because the President believes that Arpaio has done nothing wrong in violating the Constitution. Neither is acceptable; both indicate that racist law enforcement policy is not only acceptable, but that those responsible are can act free from consequences. Furthermore, the President of the United States intervening to undo a conviction of a public official who violated American citizens’ constitutional rights does unspeakable violence to those rights. Our rights mean little when there is no redress when they are violated—which is precisely what a pardon here would do. During the debates over ratification of the Constitution, James Madison warned us that it is not enough to inscribe our rights on paper; they must live in the hearts of our elected officials. When our elected officials do not value those rights, and when law enforcement is freed to act without regard for them, our Constitution becomes a mere “parchment barrier.”This post originally appeared on the blog of the California Civil Rights Law Group.

He warned against “swift conclusions” while noting the white van had Spanish license plates and had been flagged for circling near the concert venue.“It would be wrong at this moment to pile up these facts and conclude ... there was a plan to attack with gas bottles, etcetera, because that was the picture last week in Barcelona. I would be careful with that.”The driver, whose name was not released, was taken into custody for questioning, and a bomb squad was examining the vehicle. Dutch authorities did not specify the number of canisters in the van.Spanish news agency Europa Press, quoting Spanish anti-terrorist force sources, reported later that the Spaniard arrested in Rotterdam had, in principle, no link to jihadist terrorism. The gas canisters in his vehicle were apparently for domestic use, it said.Police said the concert was canceled at around 7 p.m., shortly before doors were to be opened for guests.As concert-goers were sent away from the Maassilo, a former grain silo complex on the Maas River that has been converted into an event hall, the venue was cordoned off.No injuries, arrests or detentions were reported until the bus driver was detained at around 9:30 p.m.The National Coordinator for Security and Counterterrorism’s office said the threat level in the Netherlands was unchanged at “substantial,” where it has been since 2013.The Guardian newspaper reported earlier this month that the band has received hate mail from people who are offended by its name, which includes the Arabic word for God. The band says it is not intended as an insult.(Reporting by Toby Sterling and Julien Toyer.; Additional reporting by Bart Meijer, Adrian Croft and Jesus Aguado; Editing by Sandra Maler and Cynthia Osterman)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599de0371900002500dd5152.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Another White House council has taken a hit after President Donald Trump’s controversial response to a deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Seven members of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, which includes Obama appointees, resigned this week, citing Trump’s Charlottesville response and other issues.“Your actions have threatened the security of the homeland I took an oath to protect,” the resigning members wrote in a letter sent Monday and obtained by HuffPost. They referenced the Aug. 15 press conference about infrastructure reform in which Trump suggested the “alt-left” was also guilty of instigating violence in Charlottesville. “You failed to denounce the intolerance and violence of hate groups,” the letter read.The resigning members include Cristin Dorgelo, former chief of staff at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Barack Obama; DJ Patil, former White House chief data scientist; and Christy Goldfuss, former managing director at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. All three confirmed to HuffPost that they had resigned.Daniel Tangherlini, a former administrator of the General Services Administration, was also among those who resigned, CQ Roll Call confirmed on Wednesday. Seven total people resigned, according to Dorgelo and Goldfuss.A White House spokesperson did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. But a White House statement published by Reuters on Tuesday said “We can confirm that a number of members of the [council] who had been appointed under the previous administration have submitted their resignation.” The National Infrastructure Advisory Council is made up of presidential appointees from the private sector, academia and government, and was originally founded in 2001 under then-President George W. Bush. It advises the president on security, including cybersecurity, for critical infrastructure like water systems. There are now only 20 members listed on the council’s website, down from 27 earlier today.The Trump administration has not shown itself to be “adequately attentive to the pressing national security matters within the NIAC’s purview, or responsive to sound advice,” the resigning council members wrote.They also said the president has “given insufficient attention to the growing threats to the cybersecurity of the critical systems upon which all Americans depend, including those impacting the systems supporting our democratic election process.” This is only the latest White House council to lose members in the wake of Trump’s Charlottesville response. Multiple high-profile business leaders on two White House advisory boards resigned to protest his remarks, prompting Trump to officially disband the councils. Every member of the White House arts committee resigned. Trump ended plans for another advisory council on infrastructure last week. A science envoy for the State Department also sent a resignation letter to Trump on Wednesday that contained a not-so-subtle secret message: “IMPEACH.”"

On Tuesday night, DeMario Jackson, one of two cast members caught up in the controversy, opened up about the incident and its aftermath, and he had kind words for Corinne Olympios, the other contestant involved.“It just hurt me just knowing that she was probably going through the same thing I was, but a little more, a little bit more aggressive and intense,” said Jackson, speaking of the media scrutiny and the backlash from the public. In late June, he told E News, “I’m here for her. She’s experiencing the same thing that I am.” Jackson and Olympios became targets of social media harassment and rampant speculation after reports emerged June 11 that an encounter between the pair had led a third party to file a report of misconduct on the set. Later reports said that two producers on the show filed complaints about an alleged sexual encounter.In the midst of the controversy, both contestants were careful not to accuse anyone directly of any wrongdoing, though Olympios put out a statement on June 14, shortly after news of the shutdown emerged, describing herself as “a victim.” An investigation conducted by an outside firm ultimately found no misconduct by the cast.While the franchise has yet to clarify exactly what took place during the first night of filming or to show the footage of the encounter in question, media outlets initially reported a number of claims from sources close to the show, including allegations that the two had engaged in a sexual encounter while Olympios was blacked out from drinking. One particularly salacious article in the tabloid The Daily Mail claimed that, according to an anonymous crew member, Jackson assaulted her while she was unconscious in the pool. Both cast members faced sexist and racist vitriol, with slut-shaming and racist comments flooding Olympios’ Instagram account. Jackson shut off comments on his Instagram account. Jackson opened up to Harrison about how the news reports and online commentary affected him. “I know I’m not that monster they’re trying to portray on TV,” he said, getting emotional as he recalled some of the accusations he’d read. He was also hounded by reporters: “TMZ, Insider, they followed me from the gym. I was exhausted, mentally, physically.” He teared up while speaking of how his family coped with the media firestorm. “I love my mom more than anything in this world, and seeing her cry every single day... it was difficult.”In all this, Jackson said, he found solace in three things: “Family, friends and Kanye West.” Other cast members on the show, including Raven Gates, Alexis Waters and Taylor Nolan, stayed in close touch and offered support, he said.He said he had wanted to offered similar support to Olympios. “My main thing for her,” Jackson told Harrison, “is that I wish we could have spoken.... I felt bad for her because she was being slut-shamed.” Olympios will get her opportunity to speak out during next week’s installments of “Bachelor in Paradise,” in another studio interview with Chris Harrison.For more on “Bachelor In Paradise” check out HuffPost’s Here To Make Friends podcast below:Subscribe to Here To Make Friends: Apple Podcasts / Acast / RadioPublic / Google Play / Stitcher / RSSDo people love “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise,” or do they love to hate these shows?

After she spent seven years in prison and attempted suicide twice, then–President Barack Obama commuted her sentence. Manning was released from prison in May and immediately began documenting her new life of freedom on Instagram. Here, she shares exclusively with Yahoo Beauty what it’s like to finally be open in the world with her identity, and how her expression of that, through her approach to beauty and style, is ever evolving.When President Trump announced the transgender military ban, I happened to be 10 blocks from the White House. There was a spontaneous protest going on, and before going I spent a split second considering what I was wearing — all-black clothing, Doc Martens, women’s pants from 5.11 Tactical — and if I should change.But I realized I don’t have to dress a certain way, I can just be me.For the Instagram picture, I put on my dark lipstick, and I choose my lipstick colors carefully. I’m not just saying, “I like this edgy color.” This is an expression of my humanity. And beauty, to me, is self-expression.Now that I’m out and free, I love experimenting with makeup. I use it to project different moods and emphasize what I’m trying to say in a particular moment. Most days I put on a liquid foundation, some powder for highlights, eyeliner, a mascara base, and mascara, with either a lipstick or gloss for the day. I’m wearing a lot of bold lipsticks, because I’m trying to make bold statements: I’m here and I’m free and I can do whatever I want.The first time the world saw me as I see me is that picture that went viral of me in the blond wig, which I sent to my superior. I took that picture for myself when I was on leave in January of 2010. I took it as a little memento of who I was at that moment. I never intended it to be shared with the world.When I look at that picture now, I see me — but I see me in a phase of trying to figure myself out. I’m much closer to who I am today than I was in that photo. But it was a process to get here.By the time I enrolled in the military at 20, I had spent years in denial about who I really was. I was openly gay and would go through periods of cross-dressing, and had even thought about transitioning, but I was in such complete denial. To overcompensate — and because I was constantly being reminded of how inadequate I was as a male — I enrolled in the military. My thought was, “I must enlist and man up.”That thought really wears on you.The one place I never felt at all comfortable in the military was in private circles of conversation. There’s a tendency, especially among young men, to objectify and denigrate women behind closed doors. They’d say ridiculous, raunchy things about women — call them sluts and whores, basically just treat them like objects. It was a line I just couldn’t cross. I’d try to avoid those kinds of macho conversations, because that’s inevitably what would come up. I’d get very, very distant.That said, I loved my job and I took my military career very seriously. There’s this idea out there that, had I not been trans, the leaks and stuff would never have happened. But to my mind those are two completely separate things. Had I been out, I think I still would have been attracted to the military, but I would have been more comfortable and gotten along with people better. Being closeted often put me in situations where I couldn’t concentrate or even think straight.I loved my job, and had I been out, I think I would have been even better at it.Now I try to be bold. I try to be myself. I really believe in this notion that we can’t have anybody speak for us. But what’s happened over the last 20 years is that the queer and trans community has depended on people who are not queer or trans to speak for us in places of power, whether that’s a state legislature or a courtroom. We need to show up and speak for ourselves now more than ever.People ask if I’ll eventually run for office and be that voice, but the truth is I’m not ready to make bigger decisions just yet. Right now I’m just settling into my new apartment, I’m watching the Handmaid’s Tale. I’m not discounting any of the bigger things, but I need to buy a couch and a coffee table first.I’m also fine-tuning my style, perfecting my makeup skills. I suck at eyeshadow, and that’s why I haven’t worn it, but I’m watching YouTube videos and practicing. I’m borrowing a lot of elements of punk and pop culture and incorporating a lot of the cyberpunk look. People tell me I’m like the protagonist of a cyberpunk movie or something, so I may as well dress for it.But here’s the thing: There’s no public Chelsea and private Chelsea, there’s just Chelsea. I’m still the same person that I’ve always been on the inside. Everything I’ve gone through has just strengthened my sense of self and my sense of who I am. I can’t pretend to be anyone else. I don’t have a public persona. The person you see is the person I am.This story was originally published on Yahoo Beauty.Also from Yahoo Beauty:This 24-year-old woman lost 166 pounds with martial arts and CrossfitHaving high school BFFs lowers anxiety, depression risk in adulthoodPeople are still obsessed with the Baby Foot peel, but is it safe?"

I’m much closer to who I am today than I was in that photo. But it was a process to get here.By the time I enrolled in the military at 20, I had spent years in denial about who I really was. I was openly gay and would go through periods of cross-dressing, and had even thought about transitioning, but I was in such complete denial. To overcompensate — and because I was constantly being reminded of how inadequate I was as a male — I enrolled in the military. My thought was, “I must enlist and man up.”That thought really wears on you.The one place I never felt at all comfortable in the military was in private circles of conversation. There’s a tendency, especially among young men, to objectify and denigrate women behind closed doors. They’d say ridiculous, raunchy things about women — call them sluts and whores, basically just treat them like objects. It was a line I just couldn’t cross. I’d try to avoid those kinds of macho conversations, because that’s inevitably what would come up. I’d get very, very distant.That said, I loved my job and I took my military career very seriously. There’s this idea out there that, had I not been trans, the leaks and stuff would never have happened. But to my mind those are two completely separate things. Had I been out, I think I still would have been attracted to the military, but I would have been more comfortable and gotten along with people better. Being closeted often put me in situations where I couldn’t concentrate or even think straight.I loved my job, and had I been out, I think I would have been even better at it.Now I try to be bold. I try to be myself. I really believe in this notion that we can’t have anybody speak for us. But what’s happened over the last 20 years is that the queer and trans community has depended on people who are not queer or trans to speak for us in places of power, whether that’s a state legislature or a courtroom. We need to show up and speak for ourselves now more than ever.People ask if I’ll eventually run for office and be that voice, but the truth is I’m not ready to make bigger decisions just yet. Right now I’m just settling into my new apartment, I’m watching the Handmaid’s Tale. I’m not discounting any of the bigger things, but I need to buy a couch and a coffee table first.I’m also fine-tuning my style, perfecting my makeup skills. I suck at eyeshadow, and that’s why I haven’t worn it, but I’m watching YouTube videos and practicing. I’m borrowing a lot of elements of punk and pop culture and incorporating a lot of the cyberpunk look. People tell me I’m like the protagonist of a cyberpunk movie or something, so I may as well dress for it.But here’s the thing: There’s no public Chelsea and private Chelsea, there’s just Chelsea. I’m still the same person that I’ve always been on the inside. Everything I’ve gone through has just strengthened my sense of self and my sense of who I am. I can’t pretend to be anyone else. I don’t have a public persona. The person you see is the person I am.This story was originally published on Yahoo Beauty.Also from Yahoo Beauty:This 24-year-old woman lost 166 pounds with martial arts and CrossfitHaving high school BFFs lowers anxiety, depression risk in adulthoodPeople are still obsessed with the Baby Foot peel, but is it safe?"
32,POLITICS,Tax Reform Could Help The Working Class. Republicans Don't Seem Interested.,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tax-reform-eitc_us_599c8c9ce4b0a296083a924f,"The tax code offers powerful tool for boosting wages, which Republicans and Democrats have expanded in the past. That may be changing.",2017-08-23,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 24: Congressman Ro Khanna speaks at the 'Kill The Bill' Rally To Demand The House GOP Vote 'No' On Trumpcare at the United States Capitol Building on March 24, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images for MoveOn.org)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599c90f31f00003d001aa6ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans have said a lot about how they want to reform the tax code this year ― repealing taxes on large inheritances, cutting the number of tax brackets, and reducing tax rates for businesses. But they haven’t said a thing about what they want to do with a tax break for working-class Americans that, as of 2015, reached more than 28 million low-income households: the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC. Unlike tax breaks that reduce the amount of taxes a person owes, the EITC actually gives people money directly. Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly expanded this credit on a bipartisan basis since it was first created in 1975. Conceived as a ”work bonus,” the measure served as an alternative to proposals to that would have given poor families a guaranteed income. It was supposed to be temporary, but Congress has gradually increased the value of the benefits through a half-dozen pieces of legislation since then. “Almost always, when tax reform happens, there’s some piece thrown in for low-income families,” said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute. But this time seems different, so far. When HuffPost asked House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) office how the EITC may factor into current tax reform proposals, press aides referred questions to the House Ways and Means Committee, the panel traditionally responsible for writing tax legislation. Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) favors maintaining ― but apparently not expanding ― the policy, according to a spokeswoman.“Chairman Brady supports maintaining the EITC and ensuring that it is working effectively and efficiently,” Ways and Means spokeswoman Emily Schillinger said in an email. Chuck Marr, a tax policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed out that decades of wage stagnation became a dominant theme of the 2016 presidential election. Marr said it was surprising that working-class woes have been absent from the tax discussion in Congress so far. “They’re moving around lots of money, and for working-class people the EITC is one of the most ― if not the most ― important part of the tax code,” Marr said. “It’s also the main vehicle in the tax code to subsidize wages. It works. It’s been around for decades. There’s extensive research about how it helps encourage work.”The EITC originally gave low-income workers a 10 percent credit for their first $4,000 of income, with that credit diminishing as earnings rose beyond that level. Congress has since boosted the maximum benefit amount and raised the cap on earnings that are counted toward the credit, especially for people with children. A single parent with three kids who earns between $14,000 and $18,000 per year, for example, can now get as much as $6,318 back after filing a tax return. Since low-income workers tend not to have much tax liability, the vast majority receive the benefit as a check in the mail after they file their taxes. The IRS dished out $58 billion worth of EITC checks in 2015, making the policy comparable in size to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the second-biggest federal safety net measure after Medicaid. The EITC lifted more than 6 million people above the poverty line in 2015, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. HuffPost readers: Have you received an Earned Income Tax Credit refund? Tell us about it ― email arthur@huffpost.com. Please include your phone number if you’re willing to be interviewed. It’s a little surprising that Ryan hasn’t embraced expanding the EITC, because he has done so in previous years. He’s made alleviation of poverty a core part of his agenda and personal brand, proposing in 2014 to expand the EITC so that it would reach more people who don’t have children. (The benefit currently maxes out at just $510 for a childless tax filer.) Expanding the credit was a rare area of agreement between Ryan and President Barack Obama, but it didn’t happen.  The EITC may be losing its aura of bipartisanship, however, thanks partly to a high rate of improper payments ― or fraud, as conservatives are more likely to call it. More than 23 percent of benefits paid in 2015 went to people who weren’t eligible for the amount they received, according to the IRS ― an error rate much higher than for other safety net programs. The policy’s defenders attribute the error rate to the complexity of the tax code and honest mistakes by people claiming the credit. A person can misreport income, for example, or separated parents might mistakenly both file their own EITC claims. “There’s been a growing conservative concern about the amount of fraud in the program,” Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an interview. “I wouldn’t see the program expanded until the fraud issues are dealt with.”Congress approved a measure to reduce the error rate in 2015 by requiring that the IRS delay disbursement of EITC checks until February, even if a claim was filed much earlier, so that the agency has more time for vetting. Rector has championed several other measures that the Ways and Means Committee could include in future legislation. Democrats have remained committed to the idea of expanding the EITC to childless workers, and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) is drafting legislation that would raise eligibility thresholds and double the value of the benefits workers can receive. Under Khanna’s proposal, a family with three kids could still get a partial refund if it earns as much as $70,000; the current cutoff is $48,340. The broad outlines of Khanna’s proposal were sketched in part by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities as a way to make up for wage gains workers have missed out on over the past 30 years. “Productivity in this country has increased dramatically, but wages haven’t kept up, so American workers are not making what the returns on labor should be,” Khanna said. Khanna’s proposal has garnered interest from conservative think tanks, but not any Republicans in Congress so far, possibly because his idea would cost more than $1 trillion. Republicans are already trying to paper over at least $3 trillion in lost revenue from their own plan. “Instead of talking about a $3 trillion tax cut for the investor class, what they should be doing is talking about a tax policy geared toward a working and middle class,” Khanna said.

As of Aug. 1, Bell had the support of 54 percent of voters, compared with 17 percent for construction contractor Chris Woods and 14 percent for Woodfin, according to a poll conducted by Birmingham-Southern. Bell has presided over a revival in Birmingham’s downtown area, luring young professionals and middle-class families back to the city center. But even as the predominantly African-American city of about 212,000 residents has flourished overall, those on the city’s margins have not always shared in the gains. The poverty rate in the city jumped from 26.4 percent in 2010 to 30.9 percent in 2015.Using the slogan “we deserve better,” Woodfin promised a host of proposals to ensure that “all of Birmingham’s 99 neighborhoods” shared in the city’s growth and advancement. Some of his plans included a summer jobs program for the city’s youth, a repurposing of community recreation centers for workforce training and instituting a tax credit for businesses that hire ex-offenders.Woodfin accused Bell of wasting money on unnecessary mayoral staff and pricey development projects that could be used to buttress school funding, finance more pressing infrastructure needs and start new social programs. Perhaps most of all, Woodfin claimed the mantle of a new, progressive crop of African-American political leaders in the South; Bell began working in city government in 1979 – two years before Woodfin was born.“A certain generation is unwilling to let the torch of leadership go,” Woodfin told HuffPost in a July interview.Woodfin’s bold plans attracted the endorsements of Our Revolution, an organization that emerged out of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Collective PAC, a political action committee that supports black candidates at all levels of government. Our Revolution president Nina Turner spoke at a get-out-the-vote rally for Woodfin in Birmingham on Saturday.The alumni network of Woodfin’s alma mater, the historically black Morehouse College, opened the door to fundraisers across the country.Woodfin’s strong performance keeps alive another pickup opportunity for Our Revolution, which has had greater success since November with candidates it backs at the local and state levels. Victories for the left-leaning group include the elections of Chokwe Antar Lumumba as mayor of Jackson, Mississippi; Christine Pellegrino as a member of the New York state Assembly; and Larry Krasner as the Democratic nominee for district attorney of Philadelphia."

The version eaten in and around Venice is known as fish “in saor” (which curiously does not mean “sour”: it is Venetian for sapore, or “flavor”). The best fish for this are oily ones such as sardines, though some fancy-pants restaurant chefs use more prestigious fish such as sole, even though these are drier and blander.Jackie and I had a yen for fish in saor the other week; I’d hoped that the fishers at our farmers’ market would be selling mackerel, but I saw none (and sardines are usually too much to hope for in our Long Island waters). What I did see was lovely bluefish, full of flavor and not so delicate that it would be lost in this preparation. I bought three biggish fillets, which in the end were enough for, let me see, nine modest servings, some entailing second helpings. I cut them crosswise into modest portions, four or five per fillet depending on size; salted and peppered them; then dusted them with flour before pan-frying them briefly in lots of olive oil – a good half cup (120 ml) – over medium-high heat. I did this in two batches: about 90 seconds or two minutes on the skin side, until golden and slightly crisp, then a scant minute on the other side (less for the thinner pieces from the tail end). They were cooked, but not overcooked: hot liquid would later be poured over them. I put them on a plate without blotting off any oil (every drop is precious in this dish).Then, I lowered the heat to medium-low and added a large onion and a narrow-gauge carrot (not strictly correct in this dish, but I like it), both thinly sliced and seasoned with salt and pepper, to the same oil (which had taken on flavor from the fish). I cooked, stirring frequently, until the onions were limp and very lightly golden but not browned. I stirred in 1/3 cup (80 ml by volume) of white raisins (sultanas), 1/4 cup (60 ml by volume) of lightly toasted pine nuts and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of white wine vinegar, let it boil for just 15 seconds and checked for salt.In a non-reactive dish, I layered the fish with the onion-vinegar mixture (still hot) and finished by pouring the remaining mixture and all its liquid on top. Once it has cooled it can be eaten right away, but it is best to keep it for a day or two before serving at room temperature: cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until two or three hours before dinner time.

I cut them crosswise into modest portions, four or five per fillet depending on size; salted and peppered them; then dusted them with flour before pan-frying them briefly in lots of olive oil – a good half cup (120 ml) – over medium-high heat. I did this in two batches: about 90 seconds or two minutes on the skin side, until golden and slightly crisp, then a scant minute on the other side (less for the thinner pieces from the tail end).

Ardern, 37, was elected unanimously after the party’s Andrew Little stepped down, and, according to The Guardian, she is particularly popular among young people and women.Over the weekend, during an exchange on Twitter with a voter, Opportunities Party founder and leader Gareth Morgan tweeted that “Jacinda should be required to show she’s more than lipstick on a pig.” (Morgan launched the Opportunities Party in November, around a platform that includes eliminating fossil fuel use by 2050, stricter immigration laws, legalizing marijuana and providing free early childhood education.)Hours later, TV presenter and journalist Hilary Barry tweeted out a photo of herself applying lipstick, using the hashtag #lipstickonapig.The tweet took off, inspiring other Kiwi women to tweet out their own lipstick selfies in solidarity with Ardern and Barry. Many of the tweets explicitly called out Morgan’s comments, pointing out that just because a phrase is commonplace, that doesn’t mean it isn’t offensive or problematic.The tweets also sent a message that women in New Zealand won’t tolerate sexism in their political system ― something that American politicians could probably stand to take note of. *Cough, President Trump, cough.*And at least one man joined the lipstick selfie party:At a press conference on Sunday, Morgan said he wouldn’t apologize for his tweet, because he says he was talking about the Labour Party as a whole, not Ardern specifically. And according to Kiwi news site Stuff, Ardern was not bothered by Morgan’s comments.“I’m happy to add Gareth Morgan to our email list so that he gets updates on all of our policy announcements, because sadly it looks like he’s missing out of them,” Ardern said.Solidarity (and lipstick ... and policy proposals ...) forever.

And they are the driving force behind the current solo travel boom.Airbnb, the largest global home-sharing rental platform, is planning to hire additional personnel to its engineering team in China. In the next 12 months, its technical staff in Beijing will be quadrupled to more than 100. The expansion in China is aimed at catching up with the explosive growth in demand for Chinese millenials, Airbnb co-founder Nathan Blecharczyk told Bloomberg recently. Earlier in March, the home-sharing giant had already said it would double its investment in China and triple the number of employees in its China branch to 300. This move is intended to keep pace with over 400 million young Chinese people's tastes for independent travel. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Chinese millennial travelers are increasingly inclined to prefer a solo trip rather than package tours. Millennials, who can communicate in English and are skilled in using digital devices such as smartphones, can make their own travel plans by using various information online. According to a report released by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) in April, China has been ranking number one in terms of outbound tourists since 2012. 135 million Chinese tourists traveled abroad last year and spent $261 billion while American tourists spent only half of the spending of Chinese tourists. In particular, solo travel is a growing trend. According to consulting firm Fung Global Retail & Technology, 70.6 million Chinese are independent travelers, accounting for 52% of all outbound trips from China. This is equivalent to the overall outbound travelers from the United States. Only 35% was group tourists. The survey of 800 Chinese tourists found that individual travelers had spent an average of 16,527 yuan ($2,436) on their most recent trip. About 80% of them said they mainly get their travel information through online search, much higher than those in tour groups at 52%. While traveling, 65% used smartphones to search for places to shop. Millennials tend to consider trips as an important part of their lives and devote much more of their income to travel than previous generations. Instead of group tours, they prefer solo trips where they can plan your own trip even though it costs more money. This phenomenon is spreading not only in China but throughout Asia. Le Hai, a Vietnamese, plans to travel locally for her own trip. She celebrates her birthday by visiting different destinations in Asia every year. This year, her destination is the highland province of Dak Lak. She set the goal of learning about coffee plantations. Somsri Sukumpantanasan, who lives in Bangkok, set a personal travel destination. She decided to travel to the Kojima, the denim town in Kurashiki, in search of the origin of her 17-year-old son's favorite jeans upon her son's wishes. The small Japanese town produced jeans for the first time in Japan thanks to its developed textile industry. Along with Momotaro jeans, that they wanted to find, 34 other shops are located in Jeans Street. The Somsri family's choice of transportation to Kojima was the shinkansen bulletin train because she wanted to try out in advance after hearing that Thailand is trying to launch a high-speed train of its own. This type of travel is becoming more and more popular as the income of people increases, air fares are cheaper due to the popularity of budget air carriers, and the influence of social media grows.

Vincent B. Atkins, commander of the Coast Guard 14th District, said in a statement to HuffPost.“As we suspend the search we stand ready to support any future operations the Army conducts, and continue to provide any comfort we can for those suffering from this tragic loss.”A search was launched off the coast of Kaʻena Point immediately after one Black Hawk lost contact with the other helicopter on Tuesday. Search efforts expanded west beyond the islands of Kauai and Niʻihau over the weekend.The search efforts involved boat, air and shore patrols from the Coast Guard, Army and Marines; Honolulu and Kauai fire departments; Hawaii’s Ocean Safety and Lifeguard Services and Department of Land and Natural Resources; and residents of Niʻihau, a privately owned island restricted to public access.Army officials have updated the missing crew members’ status to “duty status ― whereabouts unknown,” which notes they have not been located and their deaths could not be confirmed. The Army formally identified the missing soldiers as 1st Lt. Kathryn Bailey of Hope Mills, North Carolina; Chief Warrant Officer 3 Brian Woeber of Decatur, Alabama; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Stephen Cantrell of Wichita Falls, Texas; Staff Sgt. Abigail Milam of Jenkins, Kentucky; and Sgt. Michael Nelson of Antioch, Tennessee.Two marine helicopters collided during a training in the same area in January 2016. None of the 12 crew members were found, and the Marine Corps declared them dead following a week of extensive searching.The accident raised concerns about an aging fleet plagued by maintenance and readiness issues, Marine Corps Commandant Gen.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599c75fd1f00003d001aa650.jpeg?cache=ZAWShzjmqx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The 1997 smash “My Best Friend’s Wedding” helped put Rupert Everett on the Hollywood map. As Julia Roberts’s gay best friend, he stole nearly every scene in the romantic comedy, which recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.The success of “My Best Friend’s Wedding” helped make gay best friends somewhat of a comedy trope, with similar characters popping up in movies like “Mean Girls” and “The Devil Wears Prada.” But when Everett attempted to repeat his success in 2000′s “The Next Best Thing,” the film received scathing reviews and bombed at the box office.Everett, now 58, said the failure of “The Next Best Thing,” in which he starred opposite Madonna, can be at least partially attributed to the film’s creative team hoping to use his sexuality to their advantage. “The studio who made it were completely into maximizing what they thought they could get out of me as a gay person,” Everett told The Guardian. “There had been posters on Sunset Boulevard; 20 million gay people in America, and they wanted to get to them. We had a huge weekend in Miami, and they asked all these little gay magazines with poppers ads in the back to try to reach out to this elusive 20 million audience, which would have made me, by the way, if I’d managed it, into a huge star.”After “The Next Best Thing” flopped, Everett said he struggled to land big screen roles. “Career death is rather like real death, so it gives you an opportunity to see what real death feels like,” he said. “One minute, you’re careering round the corridors of power, and everybody’s going: ‘That’s a fabulous idea.’ The next minute, you’re still careering around but you’re like the Canterville Ghost: everybody’s walking right through you and you’ve died, and you didn’t realize.” Now starring in the BBC comedy series, “Quacks,” Everett also looked back on his early years working as an actor in London, when he was “living in basic terror” because of the HIV/AIDS crisis. “I’d had a very promiscuous sex life from the moment I arrived in London. I’d thrown myself into the gay world, coming from this convent background, and then AIDS began and there was no way of finding out if you carried the virus until 1985, the HIV test,” he recalled. “Everybody was terrorized by the disease. Even people who loved you, your family, you’d notice them taking your plate and washing it separately.” Catch the latest in LGBTQ culture by subscribing to the Queer Voices newsletter. "
49,POLITICS,Phoenix Was Trump Country Long Before Trump,"Matthew Dallek, Yahoo! News",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phoenix-was-trump-country-long-before-trump_us_599cb231e4b0d8dde999a81d,"Phoenix provides Trump with a home to hard-right racial, anti-immigrant and conspiratorial politics.",2017-08-22,"Then-Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fountain Hills, Ariz., March 19, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599cb37d1f00003d001aa72b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Trump is in Phoenix for a campaign-type rally that is expected to draw some of his most fervent fans and bring thousands of anti-Trump protesters into the streets. His decision to go to Phoenix prompted Mayor Greg Stanton to urge Trump to stay away lest the president inflame racial tensions in the wake of white nationalist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. Even though Trump’s rally was planned before the racial violence in Charlottesville, the unpopular president is entering a surprisingly supportive space — one that defies our contemporary notions of a blue America confined to cities and a red America entrenched in rural counties.After all, Phoenix remains the place where Sheriff Joe Arpaio used his badge to harass, intimidate and round up Latinos. Phoenix is the city where during the campaign Trump called for mass deportations. Still, Phoenix has grown much more racially and ethnically diverse in the past two decades; approximately 40 percent of the city is now Latino, and, from his seat in City Hall, Mayor Stanton has offered a strong counterpoint to Trumpism, challenging the president’s attitudes and policies on his signature issues of trade and the border, and underscoring the evolving character of the city’s politics.In Stanton’s April 2016 State of the City address, he took a not-so-veiled jab at Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Defending a pro-trade, pro-immigrant vision rooted in social tolerance, Stanton boasted of how his city “began working to repair our relationship with Mexico — and create new jobs on both sides of the border.” He went on to note that “in partnership with the city of Tucson, we began the push for the Arizona Trade Office in Mexico City. We’ve teamed up with Phoenix and Arizona chambers of commerce and the consul general to conduct more than a dozen trade missions over the last four years. Late last year, six Arizona mayors traveled south to sign an agreement with Mexico City to promote two-way trade and student exchanges.”But there’s a reason Trump finds a reliable base of support here. Phoenix provides him with a home to hard-right racial, anti-immigrant and conspiratorial politics, past and present, making his decision to hold a rally in this post-Charlottesville moment likely to inflame both his base and worsen already raw racial divisions and ethnic tensions roiling the United States.Phoenix’s most famous son, Barry Goldwater, was the GOP’s 1964 presidential nominee, and in the early ’60s countless conservatives hailed Goldwater’s anti-big-government and unapologetic pro-business politics and policies. One of Arizona’s current Republican senators, Jeff Flake, in fact recently wrote an anti-Trump polemic that took its title from Goldwater’s 1960 call to arms, “The Conscience of a Conservative.”But what’s even more salient to Trumpism than Phoenix’s Goldwater traditions — the historical air that helped make Trumpism politically viable — is Phoenix’s far-right politics. In the post-World War II era, the city became an unlikely beacon to some of the forces that have brought us the Trump presidency. In Phoenix, newspaper kingpin Eugene Pulliam built his media empire, which included dozens of newspapers such as the Indianapolis Star and the Phoenix Gazette along with a handful of radio stations, and used the Arizona Republic to editorialize, for example, in defense of “right-to-work” laws curbing the power of unions. Pulliam’s distinct voice on behalf of “Americanism” provided one of numerous antecedents to staunchly pro-Trump media outlets such as Fox News and Breitbart.Other activists, ideas, and controversies inflamed the city’s extremist politics. Phoenix’s American Legion campaigned in the 1950s to expose communist sympathizers whom some Phoenicians believed were infiltrating the city’s high schools. The legion went to so far as to identify six teachers and accused them of having communist ties, and Pulliam’s Arizona Republic endorsed a like-minded campaign to ban textbooks that it deemed pro-socialist.Which brings us back to Trump’s rally. His appearance in Phoenix is more than just another in a string of presidential mind-melds with his fervent followers. The rally in Phoenix is an indication both of how Trump was able to run such an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim campaign and still win the White House and, as the anti-Trump protests suggest, a reflection of the still-considerable strength of Trump’s opponents. While some journalists, politicians and scholars have predicted that demographic trends in cities such as Phoenix will ultimately turn them “blue” and erode the strength of the forces that brought us Trumpism, the president’s inflammatory decision to go to Phoenix, and the support he enjoys there, signifies that this development is still in the future."
50,POLITICS,Chris Christie Leaves A Trumpian Legacy On Climate Change. But It Won’t Last.,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-climate-change_us_599c3103e4b04c532f445801,The New Jersey governor spurned climate action as he courted the Kochs. Now even the Republican running to succeed him -- his own deputy -- wants to reverse course.,2017-08-22,Gov. Chris Christie on the campaign trail with then-candidate Donald Trump in March 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599c35161900002500dd4c7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chris Christie’s defining moment on climate change came early in his first term as New Jersey’s governor. On May 26, 2011, the brash, trash-talking Republican acknowledged for the first time that humans were causing the climate to change. Then, just three minutes into his 14-minute speech, he announced the Garden State’s withdrawal from a popular and effective interstate pact to lower planet-warming emissions and raise money for energy efficiency projects. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, includes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont, which have put limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and created a cap-and-trade market that allows utility companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. The program is credited with reducing average utility bills by 3.4 percent across the Northeast, driving $2.7 billion in revenues reinvested into public projects and creating at least 30,200 new jobs over the past eight years. Yet Christie called it a “failure.” He insisted that the burden RGGI put on companies would drive job creators over the state line to Pennsylvania, New Jersey’s fossil fuel-rich neighbor and one of the few states in the region outside the group.  “RGGI does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens, tax our businesses with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment,” Christie said in the speech speciously titled “New Jersey’s Future Is Green.” “It doesn’t make any sense, environmentally or economically,” he added.  Months later, he vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic majority in the state legislature to rejoin RGGI. The next year, he rejected similar legislation. Last month, he struck down yet another bill, declaring, “The third time will not be the charm.” “It was … the most significant policy decision,” Matt Katz, author of the 2016 biography American Governor: Chris Christie’s Bridge to Redemption, told HuffPost. “His pro-environment promises to move toward solar and wind energy sources could’ve been a part of his legacy, but they turned out to be mostly empty efforts.”It’s a legacy that strikingly mirrors that of President Donald Trump, who made eliminating environmental regulations a top priority, aggressively courted fossil fuel interests, and withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord just five months after taking office. The White House’s decision to drop out of the agreement to lower carbon emissions, signed by every country except Syria and Nicaragua, drew similar condemnation, particularly for seeming to lack logic beyond shoring up support from his base in anticipation of the next election. Christie’s positioning on climate change has been a break from his predecessors in New Jersey, nearly all of whom have made conservation a key concern. Gov. Brendan Byrne (D) preserved the Pine Barrens in the 1970s. Gov. Tom Kean (R) increased protections for wetlands with a 1984 executive order and started a climate change task force. Gov. James Florio (D) set aside the Highlands, a geological formation running along the Delaware River, in the early 1990s. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman (R) drastically improved ozone levels, reduced beach closings to a record low and later went on to lead the Environmental Protection Agency under President George W. Bush. Gov. James McGreevey (D) expanded wetlands protections by nearly 400,000 acres in 2004. Under Gov. Richard Codey (D), New Jersey became a founding member of RGGI in 2005. Two years later, Gov. Jon Corzine (D) beefed up “stream encroachment” rules to keep development away from areas at high risk of flooding.“Christie’s legacy will be trying to roll back every other governor’s environmental legacy,” Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club’s New Jersey chapter, told HuffPost. “He’s been the most anti-environmental governor this state has ever seen.” A spokesman for Christie declined to comment, but referred HuffPost to the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. The agency in turn referred HuffPost to Christie’s May 2011 speech.“At the end of the day, RGGI allowance costs are passed along to New Jersey ratepayers,” Larry Hajna, a spokesman for the agency, wrote in a follow-up email to HuffPost. “We also estimate for every dollar we invest in RGGI, our ratepayers would only get about 50 cents in return.”Most politics watchers in New Jersey think it’s no coincidence that Christie pulled out of RGGI three months after meeting with fossil fuel tycoon David Koch in New York, one month before headlining the Koch brothers’ conference in Colorado and nearly a year ahead of the 2012 election. His initial meeting took place in secret, and the press was never notified that he was out of state. Audio obtained by Mother Jones revealed that Koch praised Christie for pulling out of RGGI. “Already at this point Christie was plotting a future presidential run, and to do so in the Republican field at that moment in history he needed a conservative environmental win,” Katz said. “He threaded that needle, preserving his chances for re-election in a blue state by claiming his pullout wasn’t about climate change.”But Christie’s unwavering opposition to RGGI proved so unpopular, not even his own deputy can defend it. Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, now running as the Republican nominee for governor, pledged to reinstate New Jersey as RGGI’s 10th member.Ricky Diaz, her spokesman, declined an interview request on Monday after four emails and three phone calls. But Guadagno, 58, maintained her support for RGGI even under blistering criticism from a Republican primary opponent who pilloried the program as a “job-killing cap and trade energy tax.” “If we are going to nominate a Republican who embraces cap and trade, and the excessive taxes and regulations it brings with it, what does our party stand for anyway?” Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican legislator who came in second for the nomination, said in May. “We need contrasts with Phil Murphy this fall, not a rubber stamp for bad policy ideas.”A spokesman for Murphy said the former Goldman Sachs banker who won the Democratic nomination in June would make rejoining RGGI “one of the first acts in office.” But he said he was still determining whether to do so through executive action or by signing legislation. “Whatever avenue is the one that is the most binding way is the way we would do it,” Derek Roseman, the spokesman, told HuffPost.He assailed Guadagno’s record of supporting Christie’s agenda, asserting she had an “extreme lack of credibility on this issue.”“She sat there when Christie pulled us out of RGGI, and for seven-plus years, never said anything or called the governor out for his error,” Roseman said. “That for us is not an act of omission, but an act of commission.” Diaz did not respond to questions about how Guadagno would renew New Jersey’s status in RGGI, but hit back with criticism of Murphy’s history as an investment banker. “Phil Murphy spent years profiting off oil and gas companies when he worked at Goldman Sachs, so he doesn’t have much credibility on these topics and his attacks ring hollow,” he wrote in an email. “Kim Guadagno is a strong believer that we must protect our environment and lead on things like renewable energy.”He declined to comment on whether she planned to sign legislation or reinstate RGGI through executive action.Murphy appears to be on track to deliver what The Atlantic called in June “a decisive victory” on Nov. 7. He led Guadagno 50 to 25 percent in a Quinnipiac poll from May.Contrary to what Christie said in 2011, New Jersey has lost money as a result of exiting RGGI. The state lost out on $130 million in proceeds from auctions where RGGI sells emissions permits and could miss out on another $359 million by the end of 2020 if it doesn’t rejoin, according to estimates by the Acadia Center think tank. If the sum of that money were invested in energy efficiency programs, as RGGI is designed to facilitate, New Jersey would save 15.3 million megawatt hours of electricity, more than all the power produced by the state’s coal-fired plants from 2010 to 2012.The state’s re-entry to RGGI would come at a critical point for the program. Last year, RGGI embarked on a full review to determine whether to adopt a lower cap and stricter standards. The results of that review could come in the next few weeks. Sources familiar with the negotiations told HuffPost last month that it was “imminent” and said the talks had accelerated following Trump’s drastic rollback of climate policies.The nine remaining states are deciding between three different options to ramp up the rate at which RGGI reduces emissions. But the states are split between those who want the most ambitious target, such as New York and Massachusetts, and those that want the more modest choice, including Maine and New Hampshire. The difference in cost between the most and least ambitious targets comes out to less than one-tenth of one penny more per kilowatt hour of electricity over the current standard, yet the impact would be huge. Choosing the most aggressive reduction rate would avoid 99 million short tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the Acadia Center. It’s unclear how the results of that decision would affect New Jersey. But, absent the goal of courting contributions from climate change-denying billionaires, the case for returning to RGGI becomes much stronger, said Jackson Morris, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s eastern energy director.“It didn’t make sense before other than that it was appeasing to the Koch brothers,” Morris told HuffPost last month. “It’s part and parcel of what we’ve seen, which was a hyperpartisan approach to not only the environment, but many issues.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

52,ENTERTAINMENT,Patton Oswalt Says He Would've Been A 'Shut-In Alcoholic' Without His Daughter,Jillian Capewell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patton-oswalt-playboy-interview_us_599c6093e4b04c532f44bbd6,"The comedian opened up on coping after the unexpected death of his wife, Michelle McNamara.",2017-08-22,"Patton Oswalt and his daughter attend the ""Inside Out"" premiere June 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599c693a1e00003c00c5ed05.jpeg?ops=crop_0_69_1771_1174%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Patton Oswalt shares a special bond with his 8-year-old daughter, Alice, one that intensified following the sudden death of Oswalt’s wife, Michelle McNamara, in 2016.In a new interview with Playboy, the comedian revealed the crucial role his daughter played in helping with his healing.“This is going to sound selfish, but I’m forever glad that I have Alice,” he told the magazine. “If I hadn’t had a daughter and my wife died, we wouldn’t be talking right now. I’m not saying I would be dead, but I would be a shut-in alcoholic.”Knowing he had to take care of his daughter kept Oswalt from plumbing the very depths of his grief.“With Alice, it was and is ‘You got to get up,’” he continued. “There are mornings when we’re late to school because I’m sad, but I’ve still fucking got to get up. A night when I’ve had maybe one scotch with some friends, I’ll say, ‘That’s it. I’ve got to take her to school tomorrow.’”The comedian told Playboy that Alice attends a grief group for children called Our House. He also explained how he managed being a single father immediately following McNamara’s death.“There were times when she was a little kid in a house with a father who was sort of shut down and having trouble talking,” he said. “There were times when I had to get her to play a game on her iPad or start a little project, and then I would say, ‘Oh, let me go upstairs,’ and I would go put my head in a pillow and just scream and cry because I didn’t want to break down in front of her.”Oswalt shared that he would wait nearby in his car after dropping Alice off at school following McNamara’s death, just in case she needed to be picked up.“I didn’t want to leave,” he said. “I just wanted to sit out there and wait. I know that kids go through sad stuff and scary stuff, so I called in favors like you wouldn’t believe just to give her little special moments. Yes, that was a bit of show-biz privilege, but fuck it. If you’ve got it, use it.”This isn’t the first time Oswalt has credited his daughter with helping him heal after grief. In a December 2016 essay for GQ, the comedian explained, “I’m moving forward — clumsily, stupidly, blindly — because of the kind of person Alice is. She’s got so much of Michelle in her. And Michelle was living her life moving forward. And she took me forward with her. Just like I know Alice will.”Though he’s had a difficult year and a half, the comedian appears to be finding joy in life again. Alice helped him propose to actress Meredith Salenger three months after the two made their public debut as a couple.Since then, Oswalt’s and Salenger’s social media feed has been filled with photos of the adorable new family."

Breitbart News’ Adam Shaw wrote that the president’s “‘America First’ base was the biggest loser” after Trump announced he would keep troops in Afghanistan and promised to take a more aggressive stance toward Pakistan.Soon after the president’s speech, Breitbart News splashed headlines on its front page saying the president had “flip-flopped” on his longtime position to end the war in Afghanistan. Trump acknowledged that he had changed his mind.“My original instinct was to pull out, and historically I like following my instincts, but all of my life I heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office,” Trump said during the speech.Two other lead stories on Breitbart focused on national security adviser H.R. McMaster’s role in Trump’s policy decision, while another pointed out that Trump’s speech was his first since former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon left the administration.The day Bannon departed, he rejoined Breitbart News and led an afternoon editorial meeting.Referencing Bannon’s absence in the White House, Shaw wrote that Trump’s speech “confirmed the fears of many on the right that without a strong nationalist voice in the West Wing, the President would revert to the same old fare that Americans had voted to reject in November.”Trump will appear before supporters in Phoenix on Tuesday night at a campaign-style rally."

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) asserted Monday that “most news is not fake.”Speaking at a Louisville Chamber of Commerce event, McConnell said he had no issues finding reliable news, according to Politico. “It is my view that most news is not fake. But I do try to look at a variety of sources,” he said. The president has tweeted about “fake news” more than 100 times since January, noted CBS News, citing the Trump Twitter Archive. On Monday alone, Trump sent out two tweets lambasting “fake news.”Falwell, one of Trump’s evangelical advisers, appeared on “Fox & Friends” on Monday to defend the president’s comments about the white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia.“President Donald Trump does not have a racist bone in his body,” Falwell said. “I know him well. He loves all people; he’s worked so hard to help minorities in the inner cities.”"

I was worried because I was applying to top tier institutions and didn’t think I was good enough to get in. I remember gathering every ounce of courage to say these words out loud, “UCLA is my dream school, so I’m doing everything I can to make myself as competitive as possible.” I knew it was an incredibly difficult school to get into; I was terrified. You let out a sigh; I watched as a frown and puzzled look quickly grew on your face. You commented, “I don’t know why counselors push students into these schools they’re not ready for.” My heart fell as you continued, “Students only get their hearts broken when they don’t get into those schools and the students that do get in come back as dropouts.”As one of the few in my family to make it to my senior year of high school and the first in my family to apply to college, I was devastated. I thought, maybe college isn’t for me. But I worked so hard. You let out a final sigh, “Start at a community college, kids from this community just aren’t ready for that, the counselors are just setting you up for disappointment.”I left the room after that. I walked away with no particular place in mind, but I knew that I needed to leave. I subconsciously landed into Mr. Palomo’s classroom, my old AP U.S. history teacher. With tears running down my face and an incredibly bruised ego, I told him what happened. I watched as his face grew red, “Mija, don’t let her be the reason to hold you back. Yes, UCLA is immensely difficult to get into, but you are an amazing student who has done so much already. I’m sorry to say this won’t be that last time you will face something like this, but don’t let people like that be the reason to hold you back.”Ms. High School Teacher, as a white teacher who was employed in a low-income and predominantly Latino community, you should be the last person advising students to discourage us. Yes, we lived in a low-income community with a school that didn’t always have the resources we needed, but that doesn’t mean we don’t deserve the same level of support students in Beverly Hills receive. We needed you to support us, I needed you to encourage me to apply to an institution that I honestly didn’t believe I had a chance at getting into. I was lucky enough to find another teacher to provide me with that support, but what about those students who didn’t? I remember hearing you advise my peers against taking AP classes, you said it was a waste of their time, but it wasn’t. I didn’t have the courage to stand up to you back then, but I do now.I want to thank you for believing in me, Ms. High School Teacher. Without your lack of encouragement, I would have never discovered the tenacity I need to survive higher education. I want you to know that I was accepted to UCLA during my senior year of high school. In fact, I just became the first in my extended family to graduate from college. !Primera pero no la última!You encouraged me to fight inequalities in education. You inspired me come back to LAUSD where I worked with students of my own. Low-income students don’t need educators who discourage them from pursuing their dreams, the media already does a tremendous job of doing that. We need people who are willing to believe in us and realize that we’re not broken. As students from low-income communities, we are powerful, intelligent, and worthy of educators who support our wildest endeavors.Lastly, Mr. Palomo I can never thank you enough for pushing me when I needed it the most. As a first generation student, I contemplated dropping out of UCLA countless of times, but your words of wisdom continued to push me even after I graduated high school. You are the example of the kind of educator I strive to be.Sincerely,A First Generation UCLA Alumna,Desiree MartinezOriginally posted on La Comadre "

59,POLITICS,Trump’s Arizona Rally Promises To Stoke Another Kind Of Racial Conflict,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-arizona-rally-immigration-conflict_us_599b6ac4e4b04c532f43d0b9,"After an explosive week, the president is returning to the divisive issue he knows best.",2017-08-22,"Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, supported Donald Trump's presidential campaign, joining him at a rally Jan. 26, 2016, in Marshalltown, Iowa. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599b6b801900002500dd4b5f.jpeg?cache=6gfaRGaZPQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHOENIX ― Even before taking the stage for a political rally scheduled for Tuesday night, President Donald Trump started trying to shift the national conversation back to his signature talking point: immigration enforcement. Trump hoped to find that “pivot” in Phoenix, as one congressman put it, after he sparked outrage and stirred racial conflict with his muddled responses last week to white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. But shifting to tough-on-immigration rhetoric is still racially divisive, even if it’s an issue that helped put him in the White House. Trump plans to hold his rally in the border state of Arizona in the hope of energizing his conservative base. Even before announcing the details of his speech, he’d broached his pet subject. Trump told Fox News last week that he was “seriously considering” the idea of issuing his first presidential pardon to former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who faces sentencing in October for a contempt of court conviction. A federal judge found that Arpaio’s office racially profiled Latinos when conducting its infamous immigration raids. Arpaio disregarded the judge’s order to stop. “When Trump comes to Phoenix, it’s no different than how he started his campaign, when he thought it was appropriate to call Mexicans ‘criminals’ and ‘rapists,’ and when he thought it was appropriate to keep going on about the wall,” Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told HuffPost. “Now he finds himself in trouble again, so he’s coming to Arizona for that pivot, and I suspect that he’ll speak about immigration again in harsh terms.” Trump’s benevolence toward Arpaio is driving allegations from critics that the president will use his visit to Arizona to keep stoking ethnic conflict ― this time by giving his tacit blessing to the profiling of Latinos. By late Monday, about 2,600 people had RSVP’d on Facebook to say they would attend a counter-demonstration organized by Trump’s opponents two hours before the president’s speech is scheduled to begin.Noemi Romero is among those who plan to protest the president’s rally. She was arrested in 2013 at a grocery store during one of the workplace raids later found to have illegally profiled Latinos and spent two months in jail, Romero, who is undocumented, said Monday on a call with reporters. When she was released, Romero found she was no longer eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals — the program implemented by President Barack Obama that allows undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children to work legally in the United States and avoid deportation for a renewable two-year period. “We’re not going to accept white supremacy,” Romero said. “We are not pardoning white supremacy under his administration.” Trump has also sounded the immigration theme by lashing out at Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on Twitter last week, calling him “WEAK on borders.” In the same tweet, Trump threw his support behind Flake’s primary challenger, Kelli Ward, a former state senator who is campaigning as a Trump devotee. Ward aired a television ad Monday that derided Flake’s conservative credentials, in large part for not supporting the construction of Trump’s proposed border wall enthusiastically enough. Even if Trump hadn’t floated the idea of pardoning Arpaio or unseating Flake, holding a campaign-style rally in conservative Arizona likely would have sent the message that Trump hopes to play to his base by resurfacing the contentious and ethnically divisive issue that has defined him as a politician since the day he launched his presidential bid by referring to Mexicans as “rapists” and “killers” who are bringing crime into the U.S. The last time Trump held a rally in Phoenix was in August 2016, in the heat of the presidential race. He used the event to dismiss a series of reports indicating he might adopt a softer tone on immigration after winning the Republican Party primary. “Every trip he’s made to Arizona, immigration was the issue,” Grijalva said. “He wants to coddle and comfort the alt-right and extremists in his base at the expense of the rest of us.” Arizona’s Republican-dominated Legislature cast itself as the vanguard of the immigration debate in 2010 by passing Senate Bill 1070, which requires police to check the immigration papers of those they stop. While the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately gutted that law and the business community pressured state leaders to tone down their rhetoric on immigration, the state distinguished itself as a conservative bastion willing to challenge the federal government when it comes to the border. That independent sensibility and tough-on-crime mindset often appeals to both mainstream Republicans and more extremist and openly racist groups here. Some 18 hate groups operate in Arizona, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the state is home to vigilante groups that patrol the border in their free time. At least one prominent neo-Nazi, J.T. Ready, was active in Republican politics and associated with the author of SB 1070, former state Sen. Russell Pearce. (Ready killed himself and four others, including a 15-month-old child, in a 2012 murder-suicide.) Many immigration hard-liners in Arizona bristle at the notion that their views indicate racial hostility. Glenn Spencer, the founder of the American Border Patrol, told HuffPost that Latino political leaders had made racially charged comments toward him in the past, when describing the declining place of white Americans as the country’s demographics shift. (The SPLC classifies Spencer’s organization as a hate group, which he disputes, saying his group focuses on technological solutions to border security.) “We’re in a struggle over the issue of immigration,” Spencer told HuffPost. “Any time we get this ‘racism’ cry, there’s always some purpose to it. It’s usually to defeat any attempt to secure our borders or enforce our immigration laws. It’s to intimidate people.” Trump has had more political success pushing his contentious views on immigration than with his admiration for Confederate statues. But the debate over immigration bears similar racial undertones to the debate about whether to keep Confederate monuments standing in public places, according to Lee Bebout, a professor at Arizona State University who specializes in the study of white identity. “There’s an extreme white supremacy, what we think of as the [Ku Klux] Klan, mainstream Nazi groups,” Bebout told HuffPost. “But then there are mainstream white supremacists that would never consider themselves white supremacists… You have people who are elected officials who enact policies that support the same agendas as those groups, whether they identify as white supremacists or not.”Bebout pointed to racially neutral laws like Arizona’s SB 1070 and a law passed the same year to outlaw a Mexican-American studies curriculum in Tucson public schools that some conservatives viewed as offensive toward whites. While neither law mentions race specifically, they both overwhelmingly affect Latinos, with little effect on Anglos. “Trump was really baldfaced about that,” Bebout said. “He’s able to speak to the mainstream white supremacists and the extreme white supremacists.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated Lee Bebout’s professional affiliation. He is a professor at Arizona State University, not the University of Arizona."

Once I decided,2017-08-22,"Elisha Wilson Beach - Stay-at-home mom of 4 kids and 4 step-""adults"". Yes, you read that right... 8 kids.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5776ba7d1800001b00fa3988.jpg?ops=100_100,"It’s pretty common knowledge that having children is a huge adjustment both physically and emotionally. Once I decided to start having kids, I knew there were going to be some major changes in my life and I was prepared to let some things go and kind of “role with the punches.” What I didn’t realize is that motherhood was going to completely knock me on my butt and all my so called “needs” would become secondary or nonexistent. So here is my list of things that motherhood forced me to give up onShowering. When I had my first baby, showering was the first thing I gave up on. If I managed to get my little one to sleep and not pass out myself, it often came down to a choice of eat, sleep, completely zone out or shower. Usually one of the first 3 won out because frankly, why shower when you are guaranteed to get either spit up, pee or poop on you 15 minutes later. When I did finally shower, I would hear phantom cries and feel a terrible combination of anxiety and mom guilt if my shower went longer than a couple of minutes. I have since mastered the art of showering in 5 minutes or less and baby wipes have become a regular part of my hygiene regimen. When I do manage to get a hot 15-minute shower by myself it feels like a trip to the day spa.Sleep. While showering is something I chose to give up on for a while, sleep was just flat out taken from me. None of my babies liked to sleep at night and to this day, if I let them, they can stay up longer than I can. Combine that with night feedings, sick kids, nightmares, peeing the bed and random 3 am scares of waking up to a kid staring me in the face and that adds up to constantly interrupted sleep for at least 10 years. And when I do manage to sleep through the night, I wake up in a panic not quite clear what day it is and sure that something had to have happened to one of the kids. I am not even going to get started on the sleep you lose when they become teenagers.Romance. Before kids, there were candles and music, regular dinner dates, lots of foreplay and plenty of time for spooning. I had nice lingerie and shaved legs. And now our version of romance is an eyebrow arch and a wink that leads to a quickie behind a locked bathroom door while some random cartoon plays on the T.V. in the living room. This may be t.m.i. but you know it’s true.Folded Laundry. Like most people, I don’t like participating in chores but I actually did enjoy folding loads of laundry while watching movies and having all clothes folded and put away on the same day they were washed. However, that is a luxury that rarely occurs in this house anymore. It is impossible to fold laundry surrounded by a kid that thinks he is a professional ninja and a toddler that thinks it’s hilarious to unfold everything in her path. And folding clothes after the kids go to bed is just not going to happen. So, to be honest, clean laundry just hangs out in my crib that none of my kids have ever slept in until somebody wears it and it needs to be washed again. And so goes my never-ending laundry cycle.Silence. I never knew how much I appreciated silence until it was no longer a regular part of my day. Before having kids, I took quiet morning walks with my dog, could completely engross myself in a book in a quiet corner of the house and sometimes drove in silence after a long day. It was just something I could choose at any moment of the day. Now… It’s almost never quiet and when it is there is probably trouble brewing and mom radar goes off. My ears have become so accustomed to noise that they ring when I sit in silence but I have a new understanding of how sitting in silence contributes to my sanity. For the most part, it’s the joyful noises of kids and I love it but sometimes I just need 5 minutes…please…be quiet…for just 5 minutes.Personal Space. Kids don’t understand the concept of personal space at all. I haven’t enjoyed much personal space since the day I realized I was pregnant and the little body invaders haven’t stopped since. In the beginning, I can’t get enough of snuggles and I could spend all day under the warm weight of a sleeping baby. Suddenly they start to wiggle and squirm and the next thing you know they are kicking you in your sleep and climbing up your limbs while you try to make dinner. Then they just become hot clingy leeches that will not leave you alone. I have to remind myself I should probably enjoy all these moments because I know the day is coming when I will beg, barter and steal just for hugs and kisses from them.Did I miss something or did I cover it all? What have you given up on for now?For more from Elisha Wilson Beach visit:mylifeisabeach.comfacebook.com/mylifeisabeachinstagram.com/mylifeisabeach/twitter.com/mylifesabeach"

Skrein, who played the villainous strongman, Ajax, in “Deadpool,” is white. The news left many observers chagrined, especially as the casting choice comes in the aftermath of several similar controversies. Over the past few years, major studios have been called out for a number of whitewashed casting choices, from Emma Stone in “Aloha” to Scarlett Johansson in “Ghost in the Shell.”While studio executives often attribute their questionable casting choices to the need for a bankable and established (read: white) star in order to guarantee big box office numbers, activists and critics have pointed out that whitewashed films often underperform those expectations. Jeff Yang assessed the risks in Quartz in April, noting that of 18 major studio films “that prominently feature ‘racially dysmorphic’ casting” over the past decade, only six made money ― and all together, they’ve “collectively lost nearly half a billion dollars for their studios.” The growing outcry over the erasure of Asian characters in Hollywood films finally seemed to be penetrating in recent months. A Paramount executive even blamed “the conversation regarding casting” after “Ghost in the Shell” garnered poor reviews and lackluster ticket sales. Vanity Fair’s Joanna Robinson agreed, asking, “Is a disappointing ‘Ghost in the Shell’ the nail in the coffin of Hollywood whitewashing?”Skrein’s “Hellboy” casting suggests not. Coming after these high-profile whitewashing scandals, the casting of Skrein as Daimio shows how willing studios are to risk another controversy and, possibly, another box office flop by casting a white actor in a role that was Asian or Asian-American based in the source material. Representatives for Millennium, Lionsgate and Skrein did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment."

It’s hard to believe that was me.”Aitcheson said he was moved to share his story after images from the white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Va. “brought back memories of a bleak period” in his life.A release from the Arlington diocese later clarified that Aitcheson came forward with his story after a freelancer reporter contacted the diocese saying the priest’s name matched that of a man arrested in the 1970s.“Fr. Aitcheson was approached about this, he acknowledged his past and saw the opportunity to tell his story in the hopes that others would see the possibility of conversion and repentance, especially given the context of what occurred in Charlottesville,” the statement read.As a 23-year-old University of Maryland student in 1977, Aitcheson was charged with six cross-burnings, one count of making bomb threats and two counts of manufacturing pipe bombs, according to an article published in The Washington Post that year. At the time he identified as an “exalted cyclops,” or leader, of the local Robert E. Lee Lodge of the Maryland Knights of the KKK.“While 40 years have passed, I must say this: I’m sorry. To anyone who has been subjected to racism or bigotry, I am sorry. I have no excuse, but I hope you will forgive me,” he wrote on Monday.Aitcheson was reportedly sentenced to time in prison for mailing threatening letters to Coretta Scott King, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s widow, as well as for several cross burnings, reports CBS News. In one incident, Aitcheson placed a burning cross outside the Maryland home of Barbara and Phillip Butler. He was ordered to pay the family $23,000 in damages ― a fee he still owes the Butlers.“We are coordinating with Father Aitcheson in his efforts to seek reconciliation and make restitution,” a release from the Diocese of Arlington stated.Aitcheson, who was ordained a priest in 1988, denounced the white supremacy in his editorial, calling it a “false belief” that flies in the face of Christ’s teaching. “He teaches us that we are all his creations and wonderfully made — no matter our skin color or ethnicity,” the priest wrote. “Realizing this truth is incredibly liberating.”He also addressed white supremacists directly, saying: “You will find no fulfillment in this ideology. Your hate will never be satisfied and your anger will never subside. I encourage you to find peace and mercy in the only place where it is authentic and unending: Jesus Christ.”Bishop Burbidge called Aitcheson’s history with the KKK “sad and deeply troubling,” in a statement released by the Diocese of Arlington on Monday.“I pray that in our current political and social climate his message will reach those who support hate and division, and inspire them to a conversion of heart,” Burbidge said.The statement noted that no accusations of racism or bigotry have been made against Aitcheson since he joined the Diocese of Arlington in 1993. The diocese also acknowledged that the priest’s voluntary request to take a temporary leave from public ministry “for the well-being of the Church and parish community” was approved. Aitcheson wrote: “Our actions have consequences and while I firmly believe God forgave me — as he forgives anyone who repents and asks for forgiveness — forgetting what I did would be a mistake.”This article has been updated with additional information about Aitcheson’s past."

But the data shows otherwise.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599c6e591f000015001aa626.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mark Twain was prescient when he said, “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.”Twain understood that, because lies don’t require proof, they can be packaged as simple sound bites and spread more quickly than evidence-based truths. Twain also understood what Blaise Pascal concluded in the 17th century: that people tend to form their beliefs based on what they find attractive rather than what the evidence shows. Hence, most of us are primed to believe statements that sound good—even if they aren’t true.Twain, however, couldn’t have imagined our current electronic world, in which someone with money or position could tweet that “global warming is a hoax” and people would believe it. Neither could he have imagined millions would re-tweet such a lie or that it could overcome decades of evidence to the contrary—while denial of the problem is, in fact, the hoax.Because polar bears depend on a sea ice habitat that literally melts as temperatures rise, they have become a target of global warming deniers. By falsely claiming polar bears will be fine—and taking information about the bears out of context—these contrarians hope to cast doubt on global warming threats and the urgent need to take action. But they lack evidence to support their claims. What Does the Science Show?I’ve studied polar bears most of my adult life, and have added greatly to our understanding of the bears and the threats they face. The evidence that my colleagues and I have collected, clearly shows that polar bears rely on sea ice to catch their seal prey. All available evidence confirms Earth is warming due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, and that warming is melting the sea ice. It is clear, therefore, we must halt greenhouse gas rise if we want to save polar bears.In 2007 my research team and I presented our findings to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Kempthorne; the evidence convinced him to designate polar bears as a threatened species. Ten years on, however, we have done little to protect polar bears, and their sea ice habitat has continued its precipitous decline. Yet, internet and social media claims, made without evidence, wrongly suggest that sea ice is recovering and global polar bear numbers may even be growing. Worse yet, our government’s leaders have falsely stated that global warming may not be real(!) and that “there is too much uncertainty to take action.”Nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, there still are uncertainties about some impacts of warming. But we understand the driving forces of human-caused global warming as well as we understand gravity. There still are details regarding gravity that we don’t fully understand, but we don’t doubt for a second that if we miss a step we’ll fall down the stairs! Likewise, we know that the world can only continue to warm and more ice must melt as long as greenhouse gas concentrations rise.Denying global warming and the threats it poses for polar bears, is, as science writer Michael Specter says, “rejecting obvious truths for more comfortable lies.” Discerning the truth, of course, goes way beyond polar bears, and gets to the core of how we understand, respond to, and indeed manage our world. But with so much misinformation out there, how do we recognize the truth?Separating Fact from FictionIn their insightful essay, The World at Our Fingertips, Stuart Pimm and Jeff Harvey offer a set of basic guidelines to assess what we hear and read:Follow the data. Is the statement supported by evidence or does the data trail go quickly cold?With the constant bombardment we now face in electronic media, these guidelines are ever more important in helping us separate evidence-based truths from unsubstantiated opinions and lies. We live in an amazing era, where we can dive into any subject with a few mouse clicks. But we need to remember that words are not necessarily information and just because a statement is comforting doesn’t mean it is true. If we really care about the world we’re leaving our children, we must be wary of letting ourselves be swayed by lies that may appeal to our wishes for the world rather than recognizing how the world really is.It may be comforting to believe human activities are not warming the planet or that polar bears are not threatened with extinction. But the evidence shows both claims are false. We’ve long known what we need to do to ensure a future for polar bears. If we stop atmospheric greenhouse gas rise we can stabilize sea ice and prevent polar bears from disappearing over much of their range. The evidence also is clear that if we act in time to save polar bears, we’ll benefit the rest of life on Earth, including ourselves. And, that is how the world really is!Dr. Steven C. Amstrup is the chief scientist at Polar Bears International."

McCain collided with the merchant vessel Alnic MC while “the ship was transiting to a routine port visit in Singapore”.“Initial reports indicate John S. McCain sustained damage to her port side aft,” the Navy said. A search-and-rescue mission was under way.The Navy says 10 sailors are missing and five are injured, the Associated Press reports.The U.S. Navy said last week it had removed the two senior officers and the senior enlisted sailor on a U.S. warship that almost sank off the coast of Japan in June after it was struck by a Philippine container ship.That collision killed seven U.S. sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer the USS Fitzgerald.The Alnic MC is a Liberian-flagged, 183 meter-long oil or chemical tanker of 50,760 deadweight tonnes, according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon.Shipping data showed it last sent a transponder signal at 2258 GMT Sunday and has since come to a halt 10-20 km (6-12 miles) off the east coast of the Pengerang peninsula in Johor, southern Malaysia. The ship data showed it was “ballasting”, meaning that it was not loaded full of oil for cargo.The U.S. Navy vessel is named for John S. McCain, Sr., and John S. McCain, Jr., both Admirals in the United States Navy.“Cindy & I are keeping America’s sailors aboard the USS John S McCain in our prayers tonight - appreciate the work of search & rescue crews,” their son and grandson, U.S. Republican Senator John McCain, said on Twitter.Senator McCain is a Vietnam War-era naval aviator who was shot down and held prisoner for five-and-a-half years.

Once he came around, he saw his rescuers fiercely duking it out with his attackers in the middle of the street.“Like Destiny’s Child they strutted in and saved me. Punches were flying. Hair was flicking. Nails were breaking,” Flinn wrote on a GoFundMe page he created for his heroines. “I was stunned on footpath, thankful drag queens exist.”Luke Waqa, who performs as Coco Jumbo, also recalled the melee to news.com.au.“A guy pushed Ivy so I picked him up and threw him into the gutter,” Waqa said. “I don’t think they knew what they were getting themselves into. I used to play rugby league. Plus I have an older brother.”“There comes a time when you fight back and you don’t care if you’ll get hurt or what happens to your wig,” added Karakia.Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that they were investigating a related incident and said they take homophobic attacks very seriously.Flinn said he felt so indebted to his “modern gay heroes” that he created an online fundraiser to raise money to replace their damaged clothes, hair and nails. As of Monday, his fundraiser has collected more than $6,800.“I hope to replace my hero’s hair, ruined because of her good heart. To replace her nails, broken because of her courage. To get her new heels because she stood up for what is right,” his page reads. “She risked herself for me. I could’ve been [anyone.] It’s the only thing I can think of to properly thank her.”Flinn, reached by HuffPost on Sunday, said that as far as his own injuries, “physically, I am fine now.”“I couldn’t really eat for five days and was on painkillers,” he said by email. “Mentally and emotionally, I’m still on the mend but very happy to know I am blessed with such a supportive and protective community.” Ivy Leaguee reached out to thank Flinn for his generosity on his Facebook wall, writing: “I’m just happy you’re ok (apart from your jaw) and that you will dance the night away yet again in the safety of one of our fabulous gay venues!”Flinn told HuffPost that police have not pressed any charges but that the case remains under investigation."

A spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which established the panel in 2015, confirmed Sunday that the Department of Commerce would not renew the charter for the Sustained National Climate Assessment’s Federal Advisory Committee.“Per the terms of the charter, the [committee] expired on August 20, 2017,” the emailed statement read. ”The Department of Commerce and NOAA appreciate the efforts of the Committee and offer sincere thanks to each of the Committee members for their service.”The National Climate Assessment (NCA), which has been published three times since the passage of a 1990 law mandating its publication, includes findings gathered by scientists from multiple federal agencies and has shown the devastating impact of human activity on rising global temperatures and related natural disasters in the U.S. NOAA did not return inquiries into the possibility of the charter’s renewal but said the disbandment would “not impact the completion of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, which remains a key priority.” It’s scheduled for release next year.The committee ― a panel of scientists, local government employees, corporate representatives and experts in related fields ― was tasked with decoding the findings from the climate assessment and developing guidelines for climate change-related endeavors, such as risk management and assessment efforts, economic policies, technology development and communication practices. Members of the committee denounced the decision not to renew the committee’s charter and its wider implications. “This is incredibly unfortunate for our country, and particularly the most vulnerable populations across the U.S.,” Maxine Burkett, a law professor at the University of Hawaii serving on the committee, wrote. “Allowing our charter to lapse ends the process of providing recommendations on how to better support and strengthen our communities,” she said. The NAACP’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program, she pointed to as an example, had been sharing the committee’s information with “those at the crosshairs of sea-level rise, flooding, and extreme heat” ― all disasters linked to rising global temperatures. “The work of our committee would have brought us closer to smart climate decisions on the ground and, with an equity lens, supported our communities to remain resilient together,” Burkett said.Jessica Whitehead, the coastal communities hazards adaptation specialist for the North Carolina Sea Grant and another member of the committee, said she received confirmation of the committee’s expiration on Friday. The panel, she lamented, wasn’t given enough time time to carry out the work with which it had been tasked. ″[G]iven that our first meeting was in September 2016 and we received our charge to craft these recommendations from NOAA just in March 2017, we needed a renewed charter to give us enough time to really refine those concepts into actionable steps for NOAA and [the U.S. Global Change Research Program] to improve the NCA process,” she said.  Letting charters expire is a kind of “action by inaction,” committee member Jerry Melillo, a scientist and director emeritus at the Marine Biological Laboratory’s Ecosystems Center, said. And he’s worried that may be a pattern emerging in the Trump administration. Earlier this summer, he noted, the Department of the Interior let the charter for a similar Obama-era panel, the Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Science, expire.“The shutting down of the Sustained National Assessment Federal Advisory Committee will lessen our ability to manage climate risk, with the big losers being the American people,” Melillo warned. The last NCA report, released in 2014, made those implications for U.S. residents clear, and many of the threats it predicted ― more triple-digit temperatures, increased precipitation catastrophes and the failing of dated infrastructure ― have already begun to emerge. Burkett, for one, hopes the work of committee may continue in an unofficial capacity. “The decision not to renew the charter seriously jeopardizes the potential for the NCA to serve our communities,” she said. “But committee members are undeterred ― and I suspect there will be more from us in our individual capacities.”"

Calling the events “a test of our moral clarity,” Ryan attempted to present a contrast to Trump’s equivocation on the groups.“There is no other argument. We will not tolerate this hateful ideology in our society,” Ryan said.“That is why we all need to make clear there is no moral relativism when it comes to neo-Nazis. We cannot allow the slightest ambiguity on such a fundamental question,” he continued.According to Ryan, “the immediate condemnations from left, right, and center affirmed that there is no confusion about right and wrong here.”Yet Trump took more than 48 hours to call out the white supremacist, Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups.Politicians of both parties widely condemned Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville, with a growing number of GOP lawmakers questioning Trump’s leadership and character. However, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) issued far more tempered statements that denounced the violence ― but didn’t refer to Trump directly.Following Trump’s combative press conference Tuesday, in which he defended the protesters as “very fine people,” Ryan responded on Twitter, saying that “there can be no moral ambiguity.”On Thursday, two days after Trump’s remarks, McConnell was reportedly “upset” about the president, but then issued a similarly standard statement, which made no mention of Trump.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story.This article has been updated to include Ryan’s comments Monday night."

In 2015, President Obama required new infrastructure to be built two feet above the 100 year flood plain and three feet for critical infrastructure like hospitals and evacuation centers, and also updated standards that guide flood insurance rates. Beyond undoing these regulatory actions, President Trump announced a new effort to streamline environmental review processes for new infrastructure projects.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimates flooding has caused some $260 billion in damages from 1980 to 2013. And in the past decade, flood insurance claims now total $1.6 billion annually, putting further pressure on the already deeply-indebted flood insurance system. As climate change increases both inland flooding and coastal sea level rise, scientists expect flooding to only worsen.To address increased risks, the Obama administration required federally-financed projects to factor in climate change projections. Now, with a stroke of a pen, the Trump administration has not only put communities at greater risk, but likely reduced the lifespan of infrastructure in flood-prone areas, and their financial efficiency and effectiveness as well.Former FEMA official Rafael Lemaitre, told Reuters the Obama-era rules were “‘the most significant action taken in a generation’ to safeguard U.S. infrastructure. ‘Eliminating this requirement is self-defeating; we can either build smarter now, or put taxpayers on the hook to pay exponentially more when it floods. And it will.'”And in New Jersey, which was hard hit by Hurricane Sandy, there was disbelief. John Miller, New Jersey Association of Flood Plain Management, told NJ Spotlight the Obama-era rule was a “solid idea.” He added: “We are going to have worsening conditions. We have to build to future conditions.’’According to Reuters, both the American Petroleum Institute and the National Association of Home Builders praised the move to roll-back the flood risk management standards to the earlier version established by President Carter in 1977, arguing that the Obama-era rules on managing flood risk increased housing costs.The Obama administration stated that the new standards would only raise housing costs by 0.25 to 1.25 percent, but Republican Congressman Ralph Abraham, from Louisiana, who sponsored legislation that would have blocked Obama’s flood standard, told The New York Times the new rules “would have increased the cost of a new home in Louisiana by 25 percent to 30 percent, because most of the state would be put in a federal flood plain.” The overall effect, however, may be to increase risk, as communities continue to live and build in flood plains not be characterized as risky, and then fail to qualify for federal assistance when disaster invariably strikes. In a new fact sheet on infrastructure that lays out the Trump administration’s vision for investing $200 billion in the 2018 budget, Trump administration officials took aim at what they describe as onerous environmental review processes for infrastructure projects. “The environmental review and permitting process in the United States is fragmented, inefficient, and unpredictable. Existing statutes have important and laudable objectives, but the lack of cohesiveness in their execution make the delivery of infrastructure projects more costly, unpredictable, and time-consuming, all while adding little environmental protection.”At his shocking press conference, Trump said a complex highway project can take up to 17 years (but didn’t cite an actual example of this). He called the current approach a “disgrace.” His goal is to reduce environmental reviews for a project to two years and centralize management through a “one Federal review” in which one government agency takes the lead on a project.Trump said: “It’s going to be quick. It’s going to be a very streamlined process. And by the way, if [a project] doesn’t meet environmental safeguards, we’re not going to approve it — very simple.”According to BloombergPolitics, the new order “allows the Office of Management and Budget to establish goals for environmental reviews and permitting of infrastructure projects and then track their progress — with automatic elevation to senior agency officials when deadlines are missed or extended. The order calls for tracking the time and costs of conducting environmental reviews and making permitting decisions, and it allows the budget office to consider penalties for agencies that fail to meet established milestones.”Environmental groups were uniformly opposed to the effort to streamline federal environmental reviews, arguing that a two-year time frame may result in more wasteful and risky projects with damaging environmental impacts.Republicans argue that excessive regulations are holding up infrastructure projects, while Democrats may agree that some regulations could be streamlined, but, really, the primary issue is there isn’t enough public investment. ABC News reports that a Treasury Department report released earlier this year found “a lack of public funding is by far the most common factor hindering completion” of infrastructure projects.In other federal environmental and climate news: Scientists from 13 federal agencies released a draft of the National Climate Assessment, which Congress mandates be updated every four years. The New York Times writes: “The study examines every corner of the United States and finds that all of it was touched by climate change. The average annual temperature in the United States will continue to rise, the authors write, making recent record-setting years ‘relatively common’ in the near future.” Perhaps the best that can be hoped for with this administration is the draft review process will be allowed to continue on auto-pilot without political interference.At the department of interior, The Nation writes, a purge of climate experts is underway, while the word “climate” is being scrubbed from program titles.And at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): the agency is now implementing national ambient air quality standards, rules created by the Obama administration in 2015, after 15 states and a number of leading organizations sued. Still, there are other worrying developments: Administrator Scott Pruitt’s agenda to reduce regulations and cut staff is largely happening in secret. But that may change: the California attorney general just sued the EPA in attempt to force them to explain how Pruitt will handle conflicts of interest with the fossil fuel industry."

Greg Gianforte had gone to court in an effort not to give up his prints and mug shot.,2017-08-21,"Rep. Greg Gianforte appeared in court in Bozeman, Montana, on June 12 to face a charge of misdemeanor assault for attacking a reporter on the eve of his election.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5972337d15000020008b2f6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) went to jail on Friday so authorities could take his fingerprints and mug shot following his June conviction for assaulting a reporter. Gianforte was booked into the Gallatin County Detention Center in Bozeman, Montana, at 6:37 a.m. local time and released less than 30 minutes later. Earlier this week a county judge denied the congressman’s request to not be fingerprinted and photographed. In an Aug. 17 ruling, Judge Rick West ordered that Gianforte report to the jail no later than Sept. 15.“Greg has fulfilled the terms,” Travis Hall, a spokesman for Gianforte, told the Bozeman Chronicle on Friday. “The matter is resolved. He remains 100 percent focused on serving the people of Montana.”Gianforte, 56, was charged May 24 with misdemeanor assault for body-slamming The Guardian’s Ben Jacobs. The Republican politician was not fingerprinted or photographed at the time, nor was he arrested and booked. He was simply given a citation.The incident occurred the day before Montanans elected Gianforte, a wealthy tech entrepreneur, to the U.S. House.Gianforte entered his guilty plea June 12, and Judge West of the Gallatin County Justice Court gave him a six-month deferred sentence and ordered him to perform community service and attend anger management counseling. Gianforte was also ordered to appear at a local jail to be photographed and fingerprinted. But his legal team filed a motion later in June arguing that the court did not have the authority to require this, as Gianforte was not arrested or charged with a felony, among other things. One legal expert told HuffPost that he found the congressman’s argument credible. Gianforte “argues correctly that courts do not have carte blanche to order defendants to do something that the court personally thinks is reasonable,” Jeffrey Renz, a retired law professor at the University of Montana, wrote in an email to HuffPost last month. “This applies to the accused pre-trial and to the defendant after conviction.” But Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert, in a response filed in July, noted that the court “apparently found that fingerprinting and photographing [the] defendant was a reasonable condition needed for rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society.” As a result, he added, Gianforte “should obey this court’s order.”Lambert told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle that, in his time working at the Gallatin County Attorney’s Office since 1983, he “can’t recall anyone raising this particular argument before.” (He declined to comment to HuffPost on Monday.) By denying Gianforte’s motion, the court sided with Lambert. Renz, the retired professor, had predicted that outcome last month, because he thought the judge wouldn’t “want to give [Gianforte] what might be perceived as special treatment.”Gianforte’s spokesman and attorneys did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comments on the ruling. When HuffPost asked the congressman at the U.S. Capitol last month whether he believed other Montanans cited for misdemeanor assault also shouldn’t be fingerprinted and photographed, he walked into his office without responding.This story has been updated to note that Gianforte was booked into jail Friday for fingerprints and a photograph."

Yet, some people protesting the removal of confederate statues and supporting the “alt-right” have attempted to disconnect their motivations from racism. One of the protesters blogged that the heart of the matter was “white culture.” Another of the white pride protestors in Charlottesville, Peter Cvjetanovic, claimed that the purpose of the march was to assert Europeans’ rights to be in the United States. The debate about removing monuments in the name of whiteness shows that many Americans don’t understand the basic premise of ancestry. Also, this seems an appropriate time to once again highlight how racial categories are not based in biology. As an important social construction, race is always specific to geographic and historical contexts. Public memorials, commemorative art, and statues help us see how communities create their public histories. As I tried to understand the events in Virginia last week, I can’t help but approach them from my own experience in the other South, the U.S. Southwest. After centuries of moving around, and most of our ancestors having sex, we shouldn’t be surprised that so many people are not able to trace their ancestry to one particular group. We are slowly becoming mutts, as some have stated elsewhere. It seems that the evolution of homo sapiens is starting to upset some white nationalists, making the Scientific American look like a Jerry Springer show. There and other outlets have been describing how white nationalists don’t understand genetics and DNA. Perhaps what we see, then, while watching young men and women take to the streets to oppose the removal of confederate statues is a tangible fear of not having an identity. Their marching seems a sign of fragility. But by their fetishizing an object, such as a statue, perhaps we’re seeing the most obvious form of whiteness, valuing things over people. By marching in the streets with armed militia about these public memorials, the alt-right are asserting that the memory of whiteness is under threat. I guess they haven’t picked up many history books, turned on the TV, or looked at their country’s leadership. Which of these focal points don’t express a narrative of Europeans as the central actors in a worldwide story of progress from “dark” ages and “dark” continents, bringing enlightenment to savage lands through capitalist modes of extraction? On the other hand, when I see well-intentioned progressives arguing for the Confederate statues to come down, I am happy to see us on this slippery slope. It’s a fine time for states, cities, and schools to ask themselves what and who they choose to commemorate. What we call “American culture” is a projection of European fantasy. The fantasy started by calling the hundreds and hundreds of tribes one name, “Indians,” and then proceeding to stamp out their languages, governments, territorial rights, rituals, and food ways. If the leaders of the confederacy shouldn’t be memorialized, what about those colonizers and missionaries who tried to stamp out Native people’s cultures? That process did not come to full fruition of course. But if we want to make public spaces safe for everyone, our collective sites of memory should reach farther back than the Civil War. Since I have never lived in “the south,” nor spent considerable amount of time there, I will not dwell on the Southern states. I was born and raised in New Mexico, went to college in Arizona, and now live in California. Like most states, the Western States include many American Indian communities. Those tribal members, young and old, drive on streets named after people who sought to extinguish their ancestors. Across the U.S. Southwest, Native American kids go to schools named after conquistadors and missionaries who displaced their ancestors and often sought the end to their culture. So while we’re removing the monuments to violent oppressors, let’s include Junipero Serra, Francisco Coronado, and Juan de Onate. (We also have a confederate memorial near Los Angeles, but like many others it has more to do with late 20th century racism than southern independence since it was built in 2004). Serra oversaw a campaign of brutality and slave labor. Coronado attacked several Native communities, including Zuni. Juan de Onate was convicted for his leading the Acoma massacre and other atrocities. Their statutes still stand, as do many other sites of memory. Surely the memories are about more than whiteness. In New Mexico, for example, “white” meant Spanish on birth, marriage, and death certificates. Those white Spanish families did not speak “English only,” since most of them had settled not in the United States, but rather in the northern frontier of Mexico. Their culture was one of oppositional squatting. They were competing with ranchers from the East who wanted their land for cattle grazing, prospecting, and farming. They fought various indigenous groups in order to stay settled. They knew who they were by who they were not, and by hopes of recreating a Spanish caste system in their new land, freshly stolen from Indians. They used religious conversion to help in the “civilizing” process. That’s one of the conundrums of growing up in the U.S. Southwest. Many of us from that area have Spanish blood, but grew up in Mexican culture. Some Mexicans consider themselves indigenous too. And some indigenous people attend Christian, evangelical, protestant, and Catholic churches. Moreover, as my own bloodline and oral history attest, some Spanish, Mexican, and Indigenous communities sold, bought, captured, adopted, married, raped, and had consensual sex with people from other communities.Trying to empathize with white nationalists, I guess I could say that the Spanish conquistadors and missionaries made my current life possible. And maybe white nationalists think that their existence, freedom, and culture can be traced back to the acts of these historic figures now cast in stone and metal. But as with the Spaniards, their way of life entailed the subjugation of others. If their cultures and religions continued, they mostly did so by forced conversion. Some might see heroic acts of exploration and bravery; but others are standing in the statues’ shadows of attempted genocide. The basic reason that “white culture” should not be memorialized is that it does not exist. White nationalism has no basis in biology. That’s why ancestry tests are making the news again this week. The haplogroups researched by ancestry tests (in my case below, 23andme) are literally provided to tell you about the “. . . the origins of some of our ancestors and on their migrations over tens of thousands of years.” The influences are Iberian (a geographic region), not the country of Spain. The influences are Indigenous to the Americas and South Asia, not Apache or Comanche (specific nations). Ancestry from current day Britain is not the same as being British. Thus, the ancestry tests have little relevance to current nation-states. America was an invention, built upon the theft of indigenous property. Like the blood coursing through our veins, we will not find a “pure” America, nor a “white” America. The indigenous people have never not been here during the formation of the current nation state. White culture in Southwestern USA, is like elsewhere in the country: mixed. The statues celebrating the lives of confederates are no more or less atrocious as those commemorating the conquistadors, and even many missionaries. We are in an opportune moment to take these small steps toward reconciling the past by renaming schools, mountains, and streets. We should also think about the symbolic violence of certain mascots. However pluralistic and egalitarian we hope this country to be, we will fail if Indigenous peoples and experiences are ignored. "

76,BLACK VOICES,Black UVA Grads Rally 100 Alumni In Charlottesville To Support Incoming Students,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-uva-grads-rally-100-alumni-in-charlottesville-to-support-incoming-students_us_599b39a8e4b06a788a2aff96,"""My first concern was ... to let students know that we’re here and we care,"" one grad told HuffPost.",2017-08-21,A group of alumni gather on campus and stand in solidarity with their fists raised. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599b53be1f00003d001aa3be.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of black graduates from the University of Virginia were so rattled by the recent white supremacist-led march on the school’s grounds that they rallied together to take meaningful action against it. Quentin Washington, an alumnus of the school, told HuffPost that he and a small group of graduates decided to bring together other UVA alumni and return to the school on Friday to show their support to new students and stand in solidarity against the acts of hate that unfolded the week prior.“My first concern was to make sure these kids were safe and felt supported, to let students know that we’re here and we care,” Washington told HuffPost on Monday.Washington, a 2004 black graduate of the school who studied mechanical engineering, said he and nearly 100 alumni arrived on campus Friday, which marked the beginning of “move-in” weekend for freshmen. Washington said two of his fellow alumni, Cameron Webb and Gregory Jackson Jr., returned to the school earlier in the week to check in on matters at the campus. Washington then reached out to other graduates, and they collectively decided that the weekend would be a great time to have more alumni head to campus and show support to new students, who may feel apprehensive or worried about starting classes in light of the terrorism that occurred in the city just days before.It was the first time alumni had ever returned to help incoming freshmen move in, Washington said, marking a memorable moment for students as well as their parents, who he said were grateful for their presence. “When parents realized we were alumni who were there to help, their guard went down,” Washington said. “We answered general questions students had and talked about our experiences when we were there.” The school, which had a student population in 2016 that was just over 6 percent black, is no stranger to battling racism, Washington said. He shared some of the experiences he and other students of color had while on campus, including having to deal with frequent microagressions and racially charged comments white students would often make.“We always felt safe, even though there were racial tensions,” he said. “The black community of students at the time was very tight and it was easy for us to come together.”Washington said this is why he believes rallying support among alumni in such short time felt like a seamless effort.

77,BLACK VOICES,Black UVA Grads Rally 100 Alumni In Charlottesville To Support Incoming Students,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-uva-grads-rally-100-alumni-in-charlottesville-to-support-incoming-students_us_599b39a8e4b06a788a2aff96,"""My first concern was ... to let students know that we’re here and we care,"" one grad told HuffPost.",2017-08-21,UVA alum Quentin Washington helps incoming freshmen move into their dorms. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599b538b1900002500dd4b3f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of black graduates from the University of Virginia were so rattled by the recent white supremacist-led march on the school’s grounds that they rallied together to take meaningful action against it. Quentin Washington, an alumnus of the school, told HuffPost that he and a small group of graduates decided to bring together other UVA alumni and return to the school on Friday to show their support to new students and stand in solidarity against the acts of hate that unfolded the week prior.“My first concern was to make sure these kids were safe and felt supported, to let students know that we’re here and we care,” Washington told HuffPost on Monday.Washington, a 2004 black graduate of the school who studied mechanical engineering, said he and nearly 100 alumni arrived on campus Friday, which marked the beginning of “move-in” weekend for freshmen. Washington said two of his fellow alumni, Cameron Webb and Gregory Jackson Jr., returned to the school earlier in the week to check in on matters at the campus. Washington then reached out to other graduates, and they collectively decided that the weekend would be a great time to have more alumni head to campus and show support to new students, who may feel apprehensive or worried about starting classes in light of the terrorism that occurred in the city just days before.It was the first time alumni had ever returned to help incoming freshmen move in, Washington said, marking a memorable moment for students as well as their parents, who he said were grateful for their presence. “When parents realized we were alumni who were there to help, their guard went down,” Washington said. “We answered general questions students had and talked about our experiences when we were there.” The school, which had a student population in 2016 that was just over 6 percent black, is no stranger to battling racism, Washington said. He shared some of the experiences he and other students of color had while on campus, including having to deal with frequent microagressions and racially charged comments white students would often make.“We always felt safe, even though there were racial tensions,” he said. “The black community of students at the time was very tight and it was easy for us to come together.”Washington said this is why he believes rallying support among alumni in such short time felt like a seamless effort. He said he and his peers all wanted to do what they could to help. “Students were excited to see us,” he said. “We did some self-care practices, we brought back some cultural experiences. Hopefully we can keep this tradition alive.” Washington said he helped to write a letter on behalf of concerned black alumni that was addressed to the incoming class of 2021; the letter fully condemned the white supremacist march and shed light on the real dangers of racism.

I knew it was more work, but instead of answering as I always did, I stared at my cell phone, sat on the ground and started crying. I needed a break from my crazy work schedule, but I also knew that just going on a holiday wasn’t going to cut it. I needed much more than a temporary change of scenery. What I needed was to take better care of myself.So I started to change how I worked, and in the process, created what I now call my Daily Self-Care Ritual  — a set of 5 rules that I turn to daily, to make sure I don’t end up on that floor again.Here’s what they are:#1: GIVE YOUR BODY WHAT IT NEEDS Self care that works starts with this first rule, because without a body that's willing and able, everything else falls apart.It doesn't mean that you need to have the perfect body or become the word’s fittest (although if that’s what drives you, all the better) — it just means that you’ve got to give your body what it needs so that you can live the life that you want.Groom yourself so you feel good about how you look. Eat mostly foods that come out of the earth, not out of a box, so your body has all the elements it needs to work the way it should and stay resilient. Strengthen your heart, muscles, ligaments, tendons and bones so they can withstand the wear and tear of living. Let your body rest and rejuvenate when it's tired.Make this happen regularly by keeping things simple.#2: BUILD A FLEXIBLE, COMPASSIONATE MIND We practice physical hygiene to get a beautiful, healthy and flexible body. But our mental hygiene rarely gets just as much attention. The result can often be a mind that's neglected, rigid and critical, which in turn, creates a life that's tortured, difficult and painful.Ease the pain by opening your mind up to new ideas and ways of thinking. Stop allowing your thoughts to consume you. Do this by questioning them and developing compassion for yourself, because guess what? You’re human — a human who's prone to fuck ups, big and small.But because you choose to be flexible and kind in how you see yourself, you learn from your mistakes so they don't happen again, and you do this without making excuses. You know that who you were was yesterday doesn't have to be who you will become tomorrow.#3: LET GO OF WHAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL This crucial rule allows you to see that while there are plenty of things that you want to make go your way, you can't. You'll realise that although you may feel that there are lots of things you're responsible for, the truth is...you're not. Like the things others choose to do and whether or not they like you. And the (sometimes) hurtful truth is, the answer isn't always going to be what you want to hear.Accepting that you have a circle of control and that not everything can fit into it, then living accordingly isn't just healthy — it's fucking liberating.#4: PROTECT YOUR ENERGY Being around the wrong people can suck your precious, finite energy.And if you were wondering, here's my definition of 'wrong': Emotional vampires who hang around you for their own selfish purposes, eating up your energy without ever offering anything meaningful in return.Right now, you probably already have a good idea of who these people are in your life are, but you've also probably been avoiding doing something about it. Here’s what you can do: Quietly keep a healthy distance from them. No unpleasant or heated exchange of words required. The smart ones will get the hint. The ones who don't are either too narcissistic or weren't paying enough attention to you in the first place — both signs that you need to keep walking in the opposite direction.Preserve your energy for the ones whom you matter to, and who really matter to you. Give them your all.#5: LEARN HOW TO BECOME A BETTER HUMAN BEING Filling your cup is essential for your well-being. You DO need to put your own oxygen mask first before assisting others.But once you do, that's where the 'others' come in, specifically, making sure that you're constantly building your awareness of how you’re living your life, considering how it’s affecting the people around you, and then taking responsibility for it.Have a tendency to speak before you have a chance to think and usually end up hurting people because of it? You might want to spend some time learning how to take a deep breath (or ten) so you don't say something that you can't take back and will likely make you look like a jerk.Find yourself indulging in a bad habit that gives you temporary relief from pain and discomfort, like compulsive shopping or eating? This isn't good news for your finances, health or relationships.Everything you do and every decision that you make has an impact on who you become as a person, and ultimately, your happiness as well that of the people around you, which makes taking responsibility for who you are your ultimate act of self care.If you’re too busy surviving, chances are, you’re not thriving. You’re feeling tired, unhealthy, unmotivated and just plain worn-out from life.

The campaign features compelling stories from people across the United States who have been affected by mental illness, including Joe’s story below.By Joe F.Since elementary school, I have had trouble with something that comes so naturally to most people—sleep.I would be up until two in the morning, rolling around in bed. At 3am, I would get up, get dressed for school, and go back to bed in my clothes for a few hours. That way, when my alarm went off, I could just run to the bus stop.Despite my sleep patterns, good grades always came easily to me. I played music and was good at sports. Yet I frequently felt anxious. Just days after I started college, the 9/11 attacks happened and placed a cloud over daily life. One night, I felt unmotivated to do schoolwork, and a friend introduced me to the drug Adderall.I finished a five-page paper in just a few hours. I went to the doctor and told him I had tried it. I walked out of there with a prescription for Adderall, along with a benzo for anxiety and an antidepressant.It was the start of a decade-long love/hate relationship with medication. The drugs would help for a year or so, then the upper and downers would impact my sleep. I’d have major depressive episodes and wind up in detox and the hospital. The cycle would repeat again and again. Making matters worse, I began having psychotic episodes, talking to myself about spaceships and someone trying to kill me. Doctors prescribed more medication.My insides were numb, melting. I wanted to kill myself every second.It was 2013 when I decided there must be another way. I found a new doctor who taught me meditation techniques and proper nutrition and referred me to an herbalist to help manage my symptoms. I repaired relationships with friends and family. I wanted to give back and looked to the diary entries I made over the years as a possible way to help others.When I was a mess, people were handing me 300-page self-help books. I wanted to write something short that described how I was feeling and what I learned.I have since published three books of insight and poetry about my illness, with part of the proceeds going to mental health organizations. I still see a psychiatrist regularly. Someday, I want to work with kids with learning disabilities or mental health issues.Writing helped me find some light and some peace. Hopefully, it can help others out there feel like they aren’t alone.Joe is a 33-year-old author from New York.

Just 19 percent approve of the way Bannon handled his job, while 42 percent disapprove, with the remainder unsure.One reason for the relatively high level of uncertain responses: Many people were paying relatively little attention to the development. Just about one-third of those polled say they heard a lot about Bannon’s firing, while 20 percent say they’ve heard nothing at all.Immediately following his dismissal, Bannon returned to a post at Breitbart News, a site that espouses white nationalist views, pledging that he was “going to war for Trump against his opponents ― on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America.”But the split raises a question about where the loyalties of Trump’s far-right nationalist followers might fall if Bannon ever directs his ire against Trump himself.Trump voters are more likely to feel positively about Bannon, but are far less loyal to him than to the president. They approve of Trump by a wide margin, 86 percent to 10 percent, but support Bannon by a much smaller 40 percent to 21 percent margin. Only 15 percent approve “strongly” of Bannon, compared to 57 percent who approve strongly of Trump.Bannon “represented a clear ideological wing within the Trump White House and in the GOP electorate more broadly,” FiveThirtyEight’s Harry Enten noted, asking, “If Bannon wages a media campaign against Trump, or if Bannon’s departure leads the White House to turn away from Bannon’s nationalist agenda, how much political trouble could Trump have?”Bannon’s 15 percent strong approval rating in the HuffPost/YouGov poll lines up with FiveThirtyEight’s analysis, which found about 15 percent of Trump voters share five key positions with Bannon ― a vocal pro-police stance, support for increased infrastructure spending, and opposition to free trade, undocumented immigration and involvement in international affairs.The percentage of Trump voters willing to side directly with Bannon and against Trump is even smaller, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. Just 6 percent of those who voted for the president say that Trump made the wrong decision in firing Bannon.But many also aren’t willing to outright line up behind Trump and against Bannon the way they might against a Democrat or a liberal. While 48 percent of Trump voters say the president was right to fire Bannon, a roughly equal 46 percent say they aren’t sure. (By comparison, in a survey taken earlier this month, Trump voters overwhelming supported Attorney General Jeff Sessions: 47 percent of them said that Sessions shouldn’t be fired, while just 12 percent said he should.)The latest poll also found that 52 percent of Americans believe Trump has not done enough to condemn the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia ― at most a modest uptick from the 48 percent who said so immediately after his first statements on the tragedy.A full 38 percent of the public, however, now believes that the president personally supports white nationalism, up from 31 percent in the survey taken largely before Trump soft-pedaled his denunciation of the Charlottesville marchers in a press conference last Tuesday.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug.18-19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

On Tuesday, Booth shared a lovely Facebook tribute to Quattrone’s second wife, Dakota Pitman, and the role she plays in helping to raise their daughter. Booth posted a photo of herself and Pitman walking Rachel into her first day of school. “Often times I have people ask me how my ex, his wife, my husband and I co-parent so flawlessly,” wrote Booth. “My answer is always the same ― We just love our daughter.”Booth emphasized that for her family, it’s just that simple ― they all love Rachel and nothing can change that. The mom then shared an important message about co-parenting. “No child deserves to be tossed around back and forth, used as a bargaining chip, or to be put in the middle of any adult drama,” she wrote. “She didn’t choose to be born, and she certainly never chose for her parents to get divorced. Why would we make her life any harder by making her choose which set of parents to love?”Booth noted her daughter refers to her “bonus mom,” Pitman, as “Mommy” and that doesn’t bother her at all because “she IS her mommy.”Said Booth, “She is there for her always, she takes care of her, she plays with her, she teaches her life lessons and how she should behave, she gives her hugs and kisses goodnight, she does everything any mother would do ... But most of all she loves her like she is her own. It takes a very special woman to take a child that they didn’t give birth to, under their wing and become their mother.”Though Booth understands the emotions that can come into play with breakups and blending families, she said she thinks it’s selfish to push out your child’s bonus parent. “If you are lucky enough for your ex to have a woman who loves YOUR child or children like their own, and one who helps raise them and shape them, why would you not allow them to call a woman they love mommy?” she asked. “Why would you put your child in the position to feel like they have to choose who they love?”“Sometimes you just have to put the petty little things aside, to raise your child to be the amazing human being they are meant to be,” she added.Booth’s post received over 14,000 likes on her Facebook profile, plus an additional 18,000 likes on the popular page Love What Matters. The mom told HuffPost she posted the photo because she’s seen separated and divorced couples struggle with co-parenting because they use their children against each other and try to make them choose between parents. It’s extra personal to Booth because she says her own father tried to turn her against her mother. “I never want to see my daughter or anyone else’s child go through that. It’s extremely damaging and changes the view you have of your parent as you get older,” she said. “I have a lot of resentment toward my father to this day for the things he made me believe about my mother.”Rachel has known her bonus parents since she was 15 months old, and the four adults have worked hard to maintain good relationships with each other. Though they weren’t able to work as a married couple, Booth said she and her ex-husband promised they would always be a team when it comes to parenting, no matter what. Although the four parents have good relationships, Booth emphasized that this did not happen overnight, and she did not intend her post to come off as judgmental toward couples who struggle with co-parenting. “It was just meant to be eye-opening and inspiring,” she said. “It was hard to let another woman into my daughter’s life, much less love her like her own,” Booth admitted. “There were many nights of heartache and deep thoughts and lots of praying. But one morning I woke up and just felt as though letting another woman love my daughter wasn’t so bad, that maybe she could help shape her heart and love her hard. After all, she deserves nothing but the best ... and what’s one more person to love her?” Booth added she thinks every child deserves as much unconditional, unending love as they can get. She urged couples who have trouble with peaceful co-parenting to keep trying: “It may take time, but for those struggling, never give up hope, never stop trying for you child(ren) because they deserved it.”Ultimately, the mom hopes parents in her situation realize it’s OK to let other mother and father figures shape their children’s lives with love and care, and that they remember to put their kids first. “They learn from you and see everything you do,” said Booth. “They’ll never forget who birthed them or who was there the day they were born, but they will remember how you treat those who they love ― and they will thank you every day for allowing them to love their bonus parents.”"

Bruzzese Jr. was airlifted to a hospital in Pittsburgh for emergency surgery and is expected to recover.The bystander was hit by a ricocheting bullet, according to WTRF-TV. The unidentified person was treated at a nearby hospital and wasn’t seriously injured.Richmond “laid in wait, for our judge, and ... it just hurts. First thing on a Monday morning,” Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said at a press conference. “This was ambush and attempted murder on our judge.”“Thank God he’s not that good a shot,” Abdalla added.Nathaniel Richmond is the father of Ma’Lik Richmond, one of two former Steubenville High School football players convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl in August 2012. The case drew national attention and outrage, in part because of the use of social media during the sexual assault. Some Steubenville residents also complained that attempts were made to cover-up the crime to protect the football teamAuthorities said they don’t believe Monday’s shooting is connected to the rape case. Ma’Lik Richmond’s trial was overseen by a visiting judge from a different county, not Bruzzese. Jefferson County Prosecutor Jane Hanlin told the AP investigators are still looking for a motive for the shooting.The younger Richmond was in the spotlight earlier this month for being allowed to be on the football team at Youngstown State University in Ohio. Students at the school circulated a petition seeking his removal from the roster. School officials responded by announcing that the 20-year-old wouldn’t play in any games this year, but would remain on the team and participate in practices. "

A federal judge ordered Qu to eliminate the magnets as part of a long-running battle over the magnets' safety. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/599218382200002d001a5e96.jpeg?cache=qLkwlZika8&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Shihan Qu stood before an industrial gas furnace in a cavernous metal treatment plant on the outskirts of Denver wearing a novelty tuxedo T-shirt and dark-framed hipsterish glasses. He was there to hear a eulogy for his magnets.“Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today in solemn remembrance and fond celebration of the lives of these perfectly good, not-at-all-defective magnet spheres,” said Eric Sigurdson, Qu’s most loyal employee. He addressed the tiny orbs directly, barely audible above the rumble of the huge machines. “May you one day be reforged as part of a spaceship to effect your ultimate homecoming among the supernovas that once begat you billions of years ago.”A federal judge had ordered thousands of Qu’s BB-sized metal balls ― once among America’s most popular novelty gifts ― to be destroyed because Qu had bought them from a company that promised to stop all sales as part of a government effort to protect children. Their end came in a 1,000 degree Fahrenheit furnace, where they would demagnetize, their shiny coatings would melt, and they would be left charred and dark and useless. Qu, his girlfriend, Sigurdson, furnace workers and a federal regulator looked on.The April meltdown was the latest dramatic turn in 30-year-old Qu’s relentless five-year legal fight against the federal government to save his magnets. They have been linked to horrifying injuries ― gleaming spheres swallowed by unsuspecting children can snap together inside their intestines, boring holes in the tissue or causing their bowels to twist and leading to potentially fatal consequences. But how regulators tried to protect the vulnerable ― convincing every major domestic seller, except for Qu, to take the magnets off the market, and then banning the magnets entirely ― struck many as the regulatory state run amok.Qu has seen himself labeled a reckless purveyor of products that hurt children and watched the entire industry of super-strong novelty magnetic playthings crumble around him. It has even put him before Neil Gorsuch ― then an appeals court judge, now President Donald Trump’s first Supreme Court pick ― in an effort to prove that the ban should be overturned. But while Qu was becoming the poster child for what some saw as evidence of Obama-era regulatory overstep, he was actually winning.With a soul patch and a direct manner of speaking, Qu seems more like an overly earnest college student than a scorched-earth litigant. He and his mother immigrated to Colorado from China when he was 3. They settled into Denver life easily. His mother worked as a database manager for a professional association in the health care field. He was an early entrepreneur, selling popsicles to fellow elementary school students for a small profit. In college, he posted an instructional video online of how to make a bong out of a glass bottle.He found his life’s calling on a camping trip eight years ago. Just before setting out, he had bought a set of unusually powerful magnet balls made from “rare earth” elements on the internet. While his friends enjoyed the natural splendors on the trip, Qu could not stop twisting and stacking magnets into an array of shapes. He was entranced. “Magnets,” he realized, “are a kind of magic.” Not long after, he and his then-girlfriend pooled their money – $800 – to import a batch of magnets from China. From that, Zen Magnets was born.Another young entrepreneur, Craig Zucker, realized around the same time that these magnets could be a goldmine. He launched Buckyballs, a set of small, round magnets pitched to consumers as a fun office accessory and stress reliever, in 2009. From an initial order of 100 magnet sets, Buckyballs soon had a distribution network of more than a thousand stores. Sales of the high-powered magnet balls went from nothing to millions in just three years ― Zucker has said annual sales reached $18 million by 2011, and regulators estimated average total industry revenues around $20 million ― with about 2.7 million sets (comprising hundreds of millions of individual magnets) sold by the end of 2012. Zucker controlled more than 90 percent of the growing magnet ball industry. Magazines put Buckyballs on holiday gift guides, and shoppers loved the moldable magnets they could fidget with when bored. Zucker dreamed of the big time, of making the leap from fad to American icon. “We coulda been a Lego! We coulda been a Rubik’s cube!” he later told Inc. Magazine.As an upstart in a quirky industry, Qu had to get noticed fast. So he went after his biggest competitor directly, mercilessly mocking Buckyballs in YouTube videos that claimed to show proof of Zen Magnets’ superiority. Buckyballs took the bait. Zucker’s co-founder, Jake Bronstein, left Qu a voicemail message threatening lawsuits from an “army of lawyers.” Qu turned the voicemail into another taunting video, with Bronstein’s words playing over a montage of every embarrassing picture of Bronstein he could find. It was viewed nearly half a million times ― which is a lot for a video that was essentially an airing of beef between two players in a niche business. Buckyballs continued to outsell Zen by a factor of 40 to 1, but Qu said the spat made his company more widely known and showed him irreverence works. “It’s a little sophomoric in tone, but it was probably a good marketing move,” Qu said. “Sarcasm and being flippant is a large part of what we’ve been known for. It makes [Zen Magnets] interesting to read [about].”But then magnet balls’ meteoric rise hit a wall: the Consumer Product Safety Commission. From its creation in 1972 through the late 2000s, the CPSC was a regulatory backwater, working largely out of the public eye. An independent federal agency, it is run by a group of five commissioners (currently, three Democrats and two Republicans), each appointed by the president to staggered seven-year terms, that sets policy for and oversees the work of career employees. The CPSC’s public profile changed in 2007, dubbed the “Year of the Recall” by, among others, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Consumers Union (publisher of Consumer Reports), when the commission pulled tens of millions of toys manufactured in China off U.S. shelves because of dangerous lead paint. The Chicago Tribune also published a series of Pulitzer Prize-winning articles that year about CPSC complacency in the face of reports that children were dying from swallowing strong magnets that easily broke free of their plastic housing in a popular construction toy. Public outrage led to action. In 2008, Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. The new law significantly increased the agency’s staff and funding, increased the agency’s enforcement powers and the size of penalties that could be used against noncompliant companies, and increased testing requirements, particularly for children’s products. The mandate was clear and bipartisan: Protect kids, and everyone else. “The CPSC used to be this sleepy little agency, and people thought they could just call the agency and work things out,” said Inez Tenenbaum, chair of the CPSC from 2009 to 2013. “After the [new law], it wasn’t business as usual.” In 2010, the CPSC started hearing complaints about kids swallowing magnets from an entirely new source: high-powered magnets sold not as encased components of other toys but as free-standing sets of hundreds of individual spheres, which could be shaped into sculptures. The numbers of potentially loose magnets for kids to swallow was staggering, and the initial injury reports were troubling. Dr. David Brumbaugh, a gastroenterologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, works less than 2 miles from Zen Magnets’ headquarters, and he keeps a baggie in his office with four magnet balls similar to those he has removed from the intestines of young patients, tools to demonstrate safety risks to anyone who will listen. The magnet balls, he said, really are a “unique and special risk.” Not only are the magnets powerful enough to rip through tissue, Brumbaugh said, but early symptoms of ingestion seem common and benign, like a stomach ache. Doctors with little reason to suspect magnets would not know to rush kids into invasive treatment, thus giving the magnets more time to cause serious harm. According to the CPSC, more than 2,900 people were hurt swallowing similar magnets from 2009 to 2013, with most requiring interventions like snaking a scope through the patient’s intestinal tract to locate and grab the magnets or performing surgery to remove them. Teenagers occasionally swallowed magnets too, sometimes after they used the powerful magnetic pull of the spheres to mimic tongue and lip piercings.The CPSC first tried to address the issue in 2010 by working with some of the companies, like Zucker’s, to improve warnings and packaging. In 2011, the agency had helped launch a public awareness campaign and safety videos aimed at kids and parents ― one tagline was “Magnets go in easier than they come out” ― and issued a press release that November with companies explaining the dangers and urging parents who had bought magnets for younger kids to return them for a refund. Some of the magnet companies began trying to develop their own voluntary standard for sales and packaging to avert further clampdowns. But while warnings and age restrictions got better, injury reports kept coming in. Unlike some other products the CPSC had addressed, like the construction toys detailed by the Chicago Tribune that had obvious design flaws that could be improved with better manufacturing or engineering, the high-powered magnets were operating exactly as intended when they stuck together. It was only when kids swallowed those magnets that problems arose. In that way, for magnet supporters, the playsets are more like brightly colored laundry pods or batteries ― things that are extremely dangerous when eaten but still widely available.The agency faced a decision of whether it was better to keep trying to work with companies to make warnings ever bigger and bolder, and to make the packaging more difficult to pry open, or to deem the magnets so inherently dangerous that much more aggressive action was the only way forward. Less than a year after the agency launched its public awareness campaign and issued the press release, it had made up its mind that the high-powered magnets could never be made safe. So the agency went after the entire industry.The CPSC had four main options for getting these magnet balls off the market: It could issue a new regulation banning the sale of magnet balls, seek an injunction from a federal court if it deemed the risks posed a true emergency, sue companies individually in administrative court to force them to recall their products, or simply negotiate a voluntary recall with the companies directly. Issuing a new regulation is difficult ― it draws on a lot of agency resources, involves a long public comment period and must meet other legal requirements ― and injunctions require a lot of proof, fast. Now convinced that high-powered magnet spheres were an immediate, and unfixable, threat, but electing not to prove its case with an injunction, the CPSC decided to write to individual retailers ― places like Brookstone and Amazon ― to tell them the products they were selling were dangerous. It was a bold but rare decision. While such letters do not actually require a retailer to do anything, it is an atypical company that fails to take immediate action as a result, both because businesses see no reason to jeopardize children’s lives and because failing to take corrective action in the face of a direct government warning might raise the risk of future lawsuits. Magnets started disappearing from store shelves. Then, the CPSC tried to negotiate voluntary recalls with 13 of the most prominent players in the industry. One by one, the major U.S. companies selling high-powered magnet balls all took the deal and pulled out of the market. But there were holdouts: Buckyballs and Zen Magnets. For Zucker and Qu, the process was infuriating: Magnet balls had been kneecapped without the agency offering any proof that a compromise was impossible. Surely some solution could be reached, Qu believed. “Nobody around me thought magnets should be harder to obtain than guns or cars.”But for Scott Wolfson, a former spokesman for the CPSC, with lives on the line the agency had to act fast. “[Magnets are] a serious hazard that was known and there was an increasing number of incidents, and we sought to take the swiftest action possible to mitigate risks to stop any other child or tween from going to the emergency room and having their chest opened up to have magnets removed,” Wolfson said. “It’s a child safety issue. It’s not an issue about the business community.”Things escalated quickly. In July 2012, the CPSC sued Zucker’s company. In August, it sued Zen Magnets. These were the agency’s first lawsuits in 11 years, and it was difficult to remember one the agency had ever lost. In September 2012, the agency also decided to move ahead on the regulatory side, issuing a notice of a proposed regulation that would effectively prevent the sale of small magnets more than a fraction as powerful as those already being sold. The rule would essentially ban Zen Magnets and Buckyballs, as the world knew them, forever. This legal onslaught was unprecedented for the agency. “Only the most extreme and aggravated cases have litigation or rule-making,” said Charles Samuels, chairman of the consumer product safety practice at the law firm Mintz Levin. “In this case you have both.” The agency had chosen to bring the intense pressure of litigation against the only corporate holdouts while also going after future product lines.“The flip side of it is that frankly it’s hard to look at the total commission involvement without having the feeling that they wanted to wipe out this product category and that was their determination from the beginning,” Samuels said.By then, some doubt had even started to surface among the commissioners. Nancy Nord, a George W. Bush-nominated former CPSC commissioner who left the agency in late 2013 and has become a vocal critic of its aggressiveness toward magnet spheres, said the commission’s tactics may have reflected that the decisions were about more than just safety and were also a value judgment about whether society really needs what the companies were selling.“In their view, they were also dealing with an adult desk toy, for Pete’s sake. How necessary is that in our modern world? How do you balance that utility?” Nord said. But one person’s frivolity can be another’s deep passion, and, Nord wonders, why is a federal agency making that call? “Maybe the federal government isn’t the right entity to be making those decisions. Maybe the marketplace is better.”As he faced total corporate collapse, Zucker punched back. He started a cheeky campaign called Save Our Balls (and later, United We Ball) and targeted the CPSC’s commissioners personally with a full-page ad in The Washington Post. He released caricatures of them, published their phone numbers, and challenged Wolfson, the agency spokesman at the time, to debates and arm-wrestling matches. Media coverage swirled, and the narrative of government overreach started to gain traction. Zucker was featured on the Fox Business Network and “Nightline” ― HuffPost too. He was on “CBS This Morning.” Rush Limbaugh gave him a shoutout.Tenenbaum, who was chair of the CPSC at the time, said in an interview that the pushback didn’t sway her. “You look at stories of children behind the data,” she said by phone from South Carolina, where she now practices law. “They have life-altering colostomies, near-death experiences, and at least one death. That is a substantial product hazard.”Nor did the commission budge. In December 2012, Zucker threw in the towel and dissolved his company. (Zucker’s company that sold Buckyballs was called Maxfield & Oberton.) But instead of declaring victory, the CPSC added Zucker to the lawsuit as an individual, arguing that a company should not be allowed to simply walk away when millions of its products remain in homes. But it also exposed Zucker, personally, to nearly $57 million in liability. This new legal strategy caught the attention of some powerful business interests like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which feared that one core reason corporations exist ― to limit personal liability ― was suddenly at risk. While the legal arguments were novel, an administrative law judge went along with the argument. One small-government group, Cause of Action, sued the CPSC on Zucker’s behalf in late 2013, arguing that the agency had maliciously targeted Zucker because he had the gall to speak out against it (which the agency denied). Meanwhile, Qu went on his own small-bore irreverence offensive after getting sued. He started selling his magnets as only a Denver native could: in marijuana dispensaries, where sales could be restricted to adults. He took out a billboard advertisement and spoke with anyone who would listen. He turned up the snark on the warnings he put on his magnets: “OMFG READ ME,” said one. “The grumpy CPSC is about to BAN magnet spheres in the US because they are an ingestion hazard. They don’t trust that you are capable of understanding and following warnings. Prove them wrong or we all can’t have nice magnets.” He also started organizing his customers and fans, hoping to stop the proposed regulation before it could become final. The CPSC received more public comments on the regulation ― on both sides of the issue ― than almost any other proposed rule in its history. And Qu found a local lawyer, David Japha, who was willing to work with a client whose only income stream was in regulatory crosshairs.By the middle of 2014, as administrative lawsuits persisted and the CPSC inched toward a regulatory ban, the anti-regulatory ferment Zucker had invited for almost two years became too crazy, and expensive, for him to handle. A self-described “lifelong Democrat,” Zucker was overwhelmed. “I ended up at the Koch brothers’ annual fundraising convention as an opening speaker, sitting next to Mitch McConnell. Before and after the speech, I kept thinking, ‘What the fuck? I was a guy who wanted to sell a fun desk toy. How did it lead to this?’ I asked myself that question a lot.” Zucker settled with the CPSC, setting aside $375,000 to cover a recall and shutting his doors. At least one product liability suit from a severely injured child still lingers. With Zucker gone, Qu became the sole heir to the cause.To prove that its proposed regulation to ban high-powered magnets should actually be adopted, the CPSC had to show that the costs of such an act justified the benefits. So it tried to calculate them. The balls had caused 2,138 injuries from 2009 to 2012, at an estimated cost of $28.6 million in medical expenses. Taking them off the market would mean $6 million in lost profits for the balls’ proprietors, regulators projected. Action, the agency said, was clearly justified.But the CPSC was at a loss for determining what the societal cost would be of removing the magnets from stores. What is the joy of playing with pointless magnets really worth, anyway? “We have no information … on the amount of utility that would be lost from a magnet rule,” the agency wrote in support of the final regulation. And if consumer love for the magnet balls turned out to be “faddish,” love of magnets would quickly fade. If the regulation went through, Qu would be unable to import any new magnets, on top of dealing with the original lawsuit the agency had filed against his company, which would force him to stop selling the magnets he already had and give refunds. In the months before the final vote on the regulation, “I was already in the mindset that none of this is going to work out, that I should put it behind me” and end the business, Qu said. Things were dark. “The world isn’t a fairy tale. We were in negative money, running off a credit line, off saved income.” Qu went to China to develop even tinier, far weaker magnets he hoped would satisfy the CPSC, but they could not hold together for the elaborate designs he thought magnet buyers needed and wanted. Still, he started selling them.In 2014, the CPSC’s anti-magnet rule became final. After the vote, then-CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye spoke about the horrors endured by the family of one young girl who died as a result of ingesting magnets. They had made the trip to the CPSC hearing to watch the rule become final. Then he addressed Qu: “I hope your dreaming will continue and that inspiration will strike again, and that there is a path forward that secures for you that elusive childhood wonder, but in a way that can endure.” Qu filed an appeal in federal court instead. The odds were long. No CPSC rule had been overturned on appeal in more than 30 years. Other countries took notice, though not the way Qu would have liked. Canada also went after the magnets, issuing its first-ever mandatory consumer product recall on the basis that the magnets were a “danger to human health and safety.” New Zealand and Australia banned them, too.Soon after the regulation was approved, CPSC’s lawsuit against Zen Magnets rumbled toward a two-and-a-half-week trial.The agency’s arguments hadn’t changed. The CPSC argued again and again what seemed to it to be obvious: Magnet balls are inherently defective, and allowing the sale of the novelty toys ― even if they are marketed to adults ― was just not that important when balanced against the lives of children, who would never see warnings on a package when they came across loose magnets lying on the floor and inevitably ate them. The CPSC put forward a string of experts, who stressed the magnets’ dangers and the futility of warnings. Qu chiefly relied on a single expert: Boyd Edwards, a physics professor at Utah State University who had befriended Qu when he contacted Zen Magnets’ customer service to complain about inconsistently sized magnet balls. Edwards was a magnet lover, and had been uploading tutorial videos to YouTube about his elaborate creations, such as a “three-level fractal Sierpinski Tetrahedron” and a hollow cube that he used, inexplicably, to encase a bottle of Kraft reduced fat mayonnaise with olive oil. Edwards told the judge the magnets were important ― teachers used them, and many people drew inspiration from them. “Like all good science, magnet spheres engage both the analytical and the artistic centers of the brain, echoing Henri Poincaré’s sentiment, ‘The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing,’” Edwards wrote in his testimony to the court. (He also told the court that “At a 2013 New Year’s party with family members and friends, I used a PowerPoint presentation to teach partygoers about the Platonic solids, and taught them how to use Zen magnets to build an icosahedron.”) As Qu waited for a decision, his company was falling apart. He’d had to lay off all his employees except Sigurdson, and he’d moved the Zen Magnets headquarters from an office and small warehouse to a bedroom in his house. Then things got even worse for Qu’s business. Just before one of the other magnet companies had settled with the CPSC back in 2014, he’d bought up its entire stock of magnets, which he intended to sell. But then in 2015 the Department of Justice filed a separate suit against Qu and Zen Magnets, saying the purchase of the magnet stock violated the law and flouted the spirit of the regulator’s agreement. A federal judge agreed, later approving a $5.5 million penalty against Qu and ordering him to destroy the magnets. Qu was broke, so he reached a deal with DOJ to pay only $10,000. It was that order that led Qu to find the metal treatment plant on the outskirts of Denver this April to roast his hundreds of thousands of now-illicit magnets. Not one to pass up a chance for spectacle, Qu had convinced the plant’s manager to custom-design a furnace door with see-through windows to allow for filming and, hopefully, another viral video. That April day, Qu upped the ante further, piloting a drone past amused workers and a decidedly unamused CPSC observer to capture the magnet destruction from the air.“I am taking nothing away from this except video and scrap metal,” Qu said. But despite losing that fight, Qu is winning the bigger battle over high-powered magnet balls. In March 2016, Judge Dean Metry, the administrative law judge in the CPSC’s mandatory recall lawsuit against Qu, handed Qu a stunning win. Though magnets are dangerous when swallowed, the judge said, magnets aren’t defective just because they act like magnets and stick together. Or as the judge put it: “[T]he attractiveness of the [magnets] to each other is the sine qua non of their essence. Without the ability to attract each other, the product is worthless.” Importantly, the judge also found the magnets did have utility, even if only to spark interest in science, and said warnings about them did what they were supposed to do.Going even further, the judge found that the estimated several hundred swallowing incidents per year ― the most the CPSC could claim to show, and a number that included all brands of magnets, not just Zen Magnets ― was “insignificant” compared to the millions of magnets sold, especially where there was little evidence linking any particular injury to Zen Magnets in particular. The CPSC was floored. The agency filed an appeal a month later, charging that the judge “misconstrued, misapplied, and misunderstood the law and regulations.” (In a quirk of the administrative process, the appeal will be decided by none other than the CPSC’s commissioners themselves, most of whom already voted in favor of the separate regulation to rid the market of the magnets entirely, a turn of events that leads some to see a conflict of interest, something the majority of the commissioners deny.)More bad news for the agency came later that year. Two federal appellate judges ― including Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump would soon pluck off the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit to serve on the highest court in the land ― vacated the regulation prohibiting the sale of Zen Magnets. It was the CPSC’s first such loss in more than 30 years. The problem, as the court saw it, came down to the data. The agency had already eviscerated the market for magnets, so how could data from a few years ago show that a rule banning magnet balls was necessary today? Plus, the data on injuries was too unreliable. To figure out just how many people were hurt by magnets, the CPSC had taken a statistical sample of injuries from hospitals around the country, combing through injury “narratives” written by doctors. But because doctors often only write that they extracted “magnets” and not “Zen Magnets” or “magnet balls,” most of the injuries were only “possibly” connected to the product. This, the court ruled, wasn’t good enough. Finally, the agency had given too little thought to how useful magnets really were ― in other words, they needed to take people like Edwards more seriously. Magnet balls were suddenly legal again. Qu raced to fill orders. He hired staff and moved his office out of the bedroom. “For a while, there was celebration, but it was also kind of surreal,” Qu said. The CPSC was “an unforeseeable goliath. We had been promised by many people there was no way we could succeed. ... Obviously it is not easy to say retrospectively that it was worth it.”In March of this year, the CPSC commissioners got together to figure out what to do next. Magnets were still dangerous when they were swallowed ― they always had been ― but was compromise possible after all these years of fighting? The mood was starting to shift.At that public hearing, one of the CPSC commissioners, Joseph Mohorovic, indignantly rejected a proposal that the agency start the fight over again. “I think this is a factor of pure ego. And this agency has taken the thoughtful opinions of the 10th Circuit personally, and we just want to win for winning’s sake,” he said. “It’s an exercise in pure regulatory hubris to ignore that criticism and stitch together the tattered scraps of this rule and run it back up the flagpole.” It was a remarkable change for a commissioner who, when voting in favor of the magnet ban three years earlier, called magnet balls a “quintessential latent hazard.” The proposal passed, but on party lines ― a change from the anti-magnet unanimity of the past. The current commission consists of three Democrats and two Republicans all nominated by President Barack Obama, a lineup unchanged in the years since the 4-0 vote to adopt the anti-magnet regulation. (Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican former congresswoman, abstained from the regulation vote because the commissioners themselves would have to serve as appellate judges for any challenge to the lawsuit against Qu, and she thought it would be difficult to be seen as impartial if they were simultaneously voting to ban that same product.) Following President Trump’s election, Buerkle became the commission’s acting chair, and in July, Trump nominated her for the permanent position and another seven-year term. But the political balance is set to shift soon: The next opening set to come up is that of a Democrat. That could prove decisive as both Buerkle and Mohorovic have made their skepticism known. Following the vote, the agency started its statistical work again. For those in favor of banning the magnets, the CPSC’s attempt to rework the regulation isn’t just about clarifying the statistics they used to write the original ban. It’s about proving the regulatory process works. “Industry always fights the data on every single issue. Industry is always looking for a reason why it’s not their product,” said Rachel Weintraub, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. “As a society, where do we want to place that burden?”And Robert Adler, a CPSC commissioner since 2009, fears the future could prove even more dangerous, especially as new retailers swoop in to the now-regulation-free market. “The hazards of this product have not disappeared, and if recent information is correct, the hazard is extremely likely to grow significantly as new firms enter the magnet market,” Adler said at the March hearing. Wolfson, the former agency spokesman, put it more bluntly: “For anyone to raise doubts about the risk to children is disrespecting families that suffered incredible trauma, seeing children rushed into surgery, children after surgery continuing to be hooked up to different monitors and fed intravenously because their small intestines are so damaged.”After his long, single-minded fight against the CPSC, Qu wonders if all the time and money might have been better spent on something else ― public awareness campaigns, perhaps, or child-proof packaging. The magnet balls are still magnet balls, and they’re dangerous or they’re not, depending on your perspective. One thing, though, is clear: Qu may have been the last man standing in the fight against the CPSC, but he’s no longer alone in selling the novelty products. Magnet vendors from overseas have flooded the online market, selling products that appear to be similar and often seem to come with no warnings at all.While CPSC staffers are now back at work trying to figure out if a new, revised regulation to stop future sales of the high-powered magnets is something the agency should one day adopt, the market is once again open. But the lawsuit against Qu to force him to recall his old magnets continues. Following Qu’s March 2016 victory in front of the administrative law judge, the commission filed its appeal.In early June of this year, Qu, his lawyer and a large group of observers from the CPSC converged on a hearing room in an office tower in Bethesda, Maryland, to hear arguments. No one quite knew what was going to happen. There hadn’t been an appeal like this in decades, and the kinks were still being worked out. The presentations began. The CPSC said the dangers of magnets were clear to everyone by now, and the law was clear too: “We don’t need a body count” to take action, said the CPSC’s lawyer. Qu’s lawyer, in response, played a video, called “Childhood Wonder,” that showed Qu constructing sculptures with his magnets. The hearing ended after two hours. Qu left, unsure of his fate.But he’s vowed to keep pressing his case ― and selling magnets. Qu originally thought he would hedge his bets. In February, he helped launch Speks, a new brand of “compliance magnets” that meet the now-vacated CPSC safety standard. They aren’t as strong as Zen Magnets and can’t make the same types of fantastic shapes, but they seem to make people happy. And he has an unexpected new partner in the venture: Craig Zucker. With the help of Zucker’s old contacts, Speks are already appearing in stores across the country, raising the prospects of a lucrative future. (Zucker enthusiastically claims sales are at “close to Buckyballs levels.”) But recently, Qu decided to significantly reduce his role in the arrangement. Speks, he said, was taking too much time away from the thing he really loves: super-strong Zen Magnets.Qu hopes the magnet era will come roaring back, but whether it is already over remains to be seen. At the June hearing, Qu listened intently, his hands moving restlessly in his lap. But he wasn’t playing with magnets. He was whirling a fidget spinner, the hottest toy of 2017.
