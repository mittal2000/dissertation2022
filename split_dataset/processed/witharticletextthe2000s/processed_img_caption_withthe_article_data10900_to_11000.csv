0,THE WORLDPOST,Afghanistan’s Entrenched Systemic Torture Must Be Stopped,"Patricia Gossman, ContributorSenior researcher, Human Rights Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afghanistans-entrenched-systemic-torture_us_58f7b504e4b071c2617f01f6,Afghanistan faces its first review in 20 years under the UN Convention Against Torture at a session in Geneva next week.,2017-04-19,"Suspected Taliban militants in Nangarhar province, Afghanistan, Dec. 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f8b4a62600004500c46b1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani really doesn’t want to talk about torture. He made that clear this month when, in a scene that could have been scripted for U.S. President Donald Trump, he tried to shut down veteran Tolo news reporter Sharif Amiry for daring to ask what the Afghan government was doing about allegations that first Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum had abducted, tortured and sexually assaulted a rival. But Ghani’s refusal to answer won’t make those concerns go away. And it begs an even more awkward question: Is his administration really incapable of enforcing the rule of law in even such a blatant case of alleged torture by one of its own top officials?It has been four months since the politician Ahmad Ishchi accused Dostum of abducting him and imprisoning him in Dostum’s stronghold in Shiberghan, where guards allegedly beat him and raped him with a rifle barrel.At the time, Ghani assured Western diplomats that he would see justice done. In January, the attorney general ordered the arrest  of nine of Dostum’s guards, but when Dostum refused to hand them over, the attorney general settled for interviewing seven of them in Dostum’s compound in Kabul. Today, the case remains stalled, with both Dostum and his bodyguards waiting out political negotiations over what has become not only a test case for Ghani’s ability to ensure justice, but a clear example of the power strongmen wield over Afghanistan’s future.Dostum, however, is only part of the sordid picture of impunity for torture in Afghanistan.In January 2015, Ghani wrote to Human Rights Watch in response to our report on widespread impunity for Afghan security force officials responsible for torture, extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances. In Ghani’s words, the “Afghan government would not tolerate torture,” and he was “committed to addressing allegations of torture.” Further evidence of Ghani’s personal abhorrence for torture emerged when he read the U.S. Senate torture report. Ghani reportedly demanded details on the number of Afghans tortured at U.S. “black sites,” and condemned the methods used as “shocking” and “inhumane.” When the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan released its February 2015 report showing that one-third of Afghan detainees had been tortured, Ghani announced a national action plan aimed at ending torture.That was two years ago. Fast forward to now.Draft legislation on torture is finally emerging after years of political and bureaucratic battles, but torture is on the rise. In a few cases police have been dismissed or relocated following investigations, but in places were torture is used systematically, the Afghan government has done nothing to hold the most egregious offenders accountable. Afghanistan’s strongmen, and the forces loyal to them, remain above the law. These include not only Dostum, but also Lieutenant General Abdul Raziq, the police chief of Kandahar, and others. Human Rights Watch has documented  cases of torture by other prominent political figures, including Asadullah Khalid, the former head of the National Directorate of Security.When I was in Kabul two weeks ago, a senior administration official tried to explain away the government’s failure to show any genuine improvements in combatting torture. He instead fell back on excuses for inaction, such as that the victims lie, the research methodology used to document torture is flawed, the Taliban fabricate stories of torture by government forces. But in truth, the Ghani administration has failed to curb torture because those implicated in such crimes wield sufficient power to ensure they are never prosecuted and are free to continue to commit such abuses without any fear of accountability.Afghanistan faces its first review in 20 years under the UN Convention Against Torture at a session in Geneva next week. The Afghan government delegation is expected to dispute evidence that UNAMA and human rights organizations, including the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, have provided.But the fact remains that those who torture get away with it. When he read the U.S. Senate torture report, President Ghani rightly observed that: “When a person is tortured in an inhumane way, the reaction will be inhumane. There can be no justification for these kinds of actions and inhumane torture in today’s world.” He called it “a vicious cycle” — prophetic words, perhaps, but a cycle he can break only by acknowledging what human rights investigators have said: “Torture continues because there’s no real deterrent.” Impunity for the use of torture means that torture will continue."

The claims emerged April 1 when a Russian opposition newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, reported that at least 100 men had been detained “in connection with their nontraditional sexual orientation,” with three of those men possibly killed.A second Novaya Gazeta article published April 4 doubled down on those reports, with a source telling the publication that the Muslim-majority region’s anti-LGBTQ efforts include concentration camps.Despite repeated denials by Chechen authorities, the claims ignited an international media firestorm, which prompted Haley to speak out Monday. “We continue to be disturbed by reports of kidnapping, torture, and murder of people in Chechnya based on their sexual orientation and those persecuted by association,” she wrote in a statement. “If true, this violation of human rights cannot be ignored ― Chechen authorities must immediately investigate these allegations, hold anyone involved accountable, and take steps to prevent future abuses.”She went on to note, “We are against all forms of discrimination, including against people based on sexual orientation. When left unchecked, discrimination and human rights abuses can lead to destabilization and conflict.” A number of LGBTQ rights advocates were quick to praise the ambassador’s effort. Among them was GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, who applauded Haley for “taking the right step” days after the queer rights group had urged her to condemn the “humanitarian crisis.”“This is a powerful sign that the U.S. Mission to the United Nations will continue to prioritize LGBTQ acceptance,” Ellis wrote in an email statement sent to The Huffington Post, “and fight discrimination and human rights abuses around the world.”Ellis reiterated her support on Twitter Monday. Human Rights First offered similar words.“A comprehensive international response to the situation in Chechnya is crucial to asserting the international community’s values and advancing human rights,” Elisa Massimino, the group’s president and CEO, had written in a letter addressed to Haley Monday. “I strongly support your initiative to use the U.S. presidency of the U.N. Security Council to advance international thinking on the clear links between upholding universal values and the maintenance of international peace and security, and hope that you will use this effort to call attention to an ongoing outrage that has no place in the modern world.”Though details of the Chechen allegations remain frustratingly vague, celebrities like Ellen DeGeneres, Matt Bomer and Billy Eichner have condemned the reports on Twitter. Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden said he was “disgusted and appalled” by the reports in an April 14 statement. “When faced with such crimes of hate and inhumanity, it is the responsibility of every person of conscience to speak out—to oppose this campaign of violence before it continues further,” Biden wrote in the statement. “Unfortunately, the human rights abuses perpetrated by Chechen authorities and the culture of impunity that surrounds them means that these hate crimes are unlikely to ever be properly investigated or that the perpetrators will see justice. But that does not mean that we should fail to defend basic human rights, fundamental freedoms, and universal values.”For the latest in LGBTQ news, check out the Queer Voices newsletter. "

The mom of two is on a mission to end the taboo surrounding these topics and ensure women have the resources they need to manage them. Clinton wrote that she’s “very lucky” she has been able to afford a breast pump and have control of her pumping schedule. Over the years, she has at times felt milk leaking from her breasts and was grateful it was soaked up by disposable pads. Other times, she has also found herself nursing in airport and train bathrooms and in some public places because there were no other options. In 2015, she spoke to E! News about her somewhat difficult experience with breastfeeding.“It also just took lots of, like ... it’s swallowing my pride and being comfortable with pumping in airport bathrooms and kind of wherever I needed to get it done,” she said.Clinton shared her breastfeeding experiences to point out that many mothers around the world don’t have access to pumps, disposable pads and flexible schedules. On top of this lack of resources, many women face the pressure of being judged for feeding their child in public. “All of these challenges, coupled with the cultural stigma around breastfeeding (or pumping) in public, often lead women to choose to feed supplementary formulas or to stop breastfeeding their children altogether ― even when they want to continue breastfeeding,” she wrote. She stressed that breastfeeding “is not the right answer for everyone.” She simply wants women to feel encouraged to make the “best choices” for their families and to have the ability to follow through with them.Like breastfeeding, menstruation holds a certain stigma in our culture. Clinton noted the hush-hush attitude associated with periods and pointed out that pads and tampons are treated as luxury items instead of necessities.“Remember how awkward you felt in school each time you carried a tampon or pad to the bathroom?” she wrote. “Did you haul your whole backpack into the stall with you, like I did? For many girls and women around the world, there are no safe, sanitary stalls to use, and no pads or tampons.”Clinton, who is working on a children’s book titled She Persisted, hopes that expanding the conversation around breastfeeding, pumping and menstruation will generate more encouragement for women and mothers. “Too often, in too many places, we don’t support girls and women who are menstruating and mothers who are breastfeeding,” she wrote.

Date and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-foreign-policy-tweets_us_58f533aae4b0b9e9848dc8a4,"On North Korea, NATO, Jerusalem and the Iran nuclear deal -- the new president’s policies are shaping up to be similar to those of the last president.",2017-04-18,"President Donald Trump departs after delivering a statement on Syria from the Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida, on April 6. The president has talked tough when it comes to foreign policy, but so far appears to be acting based on policies similar to that of his predecessor.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f5363c14000049001b4bce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The new sheriff in town had a message for North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on Monday: “Gotta behave.”What did President Donald Trump’s warning, issued during his first White House Easter Egg Roll, mean, exactly, coming after a weekend in which the rogue nation tested another ballistic missile?That’s what the world is still trying to figure out.Three months into Trump’s term, the United States has ramped up bombing campaigns in Syria and Yemen, used a gigantic non-nuclear bomb on an actual target for the first time, and fired dozens of cruise missiles in response to a chemical weapons attack ― giving the impression of an unleashed military.He’s tweeted that if China doesn’t “properly deal with North Korea,” the U.S. will, and said China will get a better trade deal with the U.S. if the Chinese “solve the North Korea problem.”And yet, for all of his bluster, the new president has taken foreign policy positions not terribly different from the consensus positions of the past few administrations.Despite campaign vows to tear up the nuclear deal with Iran, move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and perhaps pull out of NATO because it was obsolete, Trump has done none of those things ― aggressive tweets notwithstanding. The dissonance has left foreign policy observers scratching their heads.“I think he’s just settling in to the idea that he is commander in chief, and likes being the tough guy in the room,” said Eliot Cohen, a top State Department official under President George W. Bush and a participant on his National Security Council. “He has not been tested yet.”Vice President Mike Pence perhaps illustrated the “talk tough but act more or less the same” approach most clearly during his visit to South Korea over the weekend. At the Demilitarized Zone marking the border with North Korea, Pence declared: “The era of strategic patience is over.” In those remarks, though, Pence also said the United States would pursue its goals “through peaceable means, through negotiations. But all options are on the table as we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of South Korea.”That latter part suggests a continuation of the policy under former President Barack Obama, whose administration used similar language in regard to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile programs.Susan Thornton, the State Department’s acting assistant secretary for the region, made that message clear during a conference call Monday afternoon. “We are definitely not seeking conflict or regime change,” she said, adding that the administration had decided “to maximize pressure, economic pressure on the North Korean regime to try to get it to make tangible steps to roll back their illegal programs.”Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and the NSC spokesman under Obama, said Trump’s suggestion that it was his own idea to bring China in as a partner is absurd.“The Obama administration worked around the clock to forge a coalition to address North Korea,” Price said. “And yes, the most important player there is China. And that’s why the Obama administration cultivated the relationship with Beijing, treating it as the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world.”Indeed, distilling Trump’s foreign policy into a distinct and readily explained synopsis is proving a challenge, even for those whose job it is to do exactly that.When asked about a “Trump Doctrine,” his NSC spokesman, Michael Anton, responded to Politico with a jumble of words that appeared to suggest there really isn’t one.“I don’t know if there’s a way you can state it, the way you could state in one sentence the Truman Doctrine or the Reagan Doctrine, or some famous doctrines of the past. His doctrine, I think, it’s still emerging, it’s still coming together, but the outlines of it were clear in the campaign,” Anton said. “It was: There’s an approach to the use of force, there’s an approach to putting American interests first, an approach to putting especially the interest of American workers and the American economy first in trade negotiations.”Anton did not respond to a Huffington Post request for an interview. But in the Politico interview, he went on to add: “All these things, I think, have a coherence that unites them, and the NSC with our interagency partners are currently in the beginning stages of working on a document that’s required by Congress, called the National Security Strategy, that when that is eventually published ― probably in the fall ― will be the Trump doctrine, but it won’t be a sentence. It’ll be ― I don’t know how many pages, but a number of ― a couple dozen pages that explain this in some detail.”In some areas, Trump has clearly given the military freer rein to pursue long-standing objectives without worrying as much about civilian deaths or negative publicity. American forces, for example, have stepped up airstrikes in Yemen compared to what had been taking place under Obama.The country received a good deal of attention as the site of a botched commando raid that took the life of a Navy SEAL and dozens of civilians barely a week into Trump’s presidency. Less prominent has been increased American help for Saudi Arabia in its war against Yemen’s Houthi rebels, as well as the intensified air campaign against the group AQAP, or Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.In eastern Afghanistan, the Air Force dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb on a series of tunnels they said were being used by the Islamic State group ― the first time the weapon has been used in combat even though it has been available for 15 years.And in Syria, Trump ordered a cruise missile strike against an airfield under the control of dictator Bashar Assad after U.S. intelligence determined it was used to launch a sarin gas attack on civilians ― an action that Republicans, including Trump, warned Obama not to take in 2013 after Assad used chemical weapons then.To Cohen, though, those incidents of military force do not by themselves offer either Americans or other countries a clear idea of future actions.“I would stress that this is no big deal yet. The 59 cruise missile salvo was a safe, minimal response to an egregious crime,” Cohen said. “The real test will be altogether more complex and difficult, and we have no idea how he will react to that.”And in foreign affairs, particularly when it could involve military force, clear statements of principle are critical, said Price.“We’ve seen how this has devolved, with little explanation, little compunction on the part of the administration to explain to the American people what it is they’re doing and what they will be doing in the future when it comes to the use of force,” Price said."

The flyer was supposed to be put up around campus, published on the conference’s website and sent out to students by email. The Guardian reported that Stanford barred Dauber from printing the poster with Trump’s image because it went against school policies surrounding political activity on campus. The university believed the flyer could be “seen as partisan,” according to The Guardian.Lisa Lapin, Stanford’s vice president of communications, initially told The Guardian that Dauber had “not been barred” from using Trump’s image and demanded the article be retracted. The publication, however, had emails provided by Dauber that proved the university had prohibited her from using the photo for months. Lapin then amended her statement and said that the law school “did not believe that the photo was appropriate.” “As a nonprofit the university must comply with the law that prevents it from engaging in certain partisan activities,” Lapin told The Huffington Post on Monday morning. “While the university does not take positions, individuals on our campus are encouraged to share their ideas.”Below is the poster Dauber created for the sexual assault awareness conference. After months of back and forth with the university, Dauber told The Huffington Post this is about way more than a poster.“I think what we’re dealing with is the chilling of free speech under Donald Trump, especially in the context of sexual assault,” Dauber said. “This really is an issue about academic freedom and censorship. It’s important for professors to know that this is what the future of academic freedom under Donald Trump may look like.” Dauber is no stranger to speaking out against the powers that be: the law professor is currently leading the fight to recall the judge who sentenced former Stanford student Brock Turner to only six months in county jail for three felony sex abuse convictions. According to Dauber, the same day the university censored her flyer, the faculty senate had a discussion with Stanford’s president about budget concerns under Trump’s administration.“I think it’s important for the public to understand that we count on universities to be the bulwark of critical thought and free speech but university budgets, for example, depend so heavily on government subsidy,” Dauber said.Although Stanford’s logo appeared on the flyer, Dauber told HuffPost she raised most of the funds for the conference herself, and that the university had very little to do with creating and planning the event. Dauber said she offered to pay for the flyers and distribute them, but Stanford would still not budge.“This is an important issue that goes to Stanford’s integrity,” Dauber said. “But also beyond Stanford to the integrity of American universities and the importance of free speech and academic freedom under a president who has shown over and over again that he’s very thin-skinned, very sensitive to criticism and will lash out at critics.”In an email to HuffPost on Monday morning, Lapin disputed Dauber’s story.“The law school believed the use of the image, at an event with institutional sponsorship, created ‘an appearance of partisanship’ that it seeks to avoid,” she said. “However, the school was willing, and in fact offered to the professor, to seek a final decision from the university authority on the matter, which is the Office of the General Counsel.

9,WOMEN,Stanford Backtracks After Prohibiting Use Of Trump Photo For Sexual Assault Conference,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stanford-backtracks-after-prohibiting-use-of-trump-photo-for-sexual-assault-conference_us_58f4c49fe4b0da2ff861cb6a,Law professor Michele Landis Dauber had been trying to get the photo approved for months.,2017-04-18,"The drafted poster with a screenshot from the ""Access Hollywood"" video, provided by Dauber.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f50e882600003600c46110.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Stanford University is making headlines again ― this time for allegedly censoring a poster promoting a sexual assault awareness conference that featured an image of President Donald Trump.Created by veteran law professor Michele Landis Dauber, the poster included a screenshot of Trump, Billy Bush and actress Arianne Zucker from the now-infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump boasts about kissing women without their consent and grabbing them “by the pussy.” Dauber, who has been teaching at Stanford Law for 16 years, created the poster to promote a conference she’s co-hosting in May titled “The Way Forward: Title IX Advocacy In The Trump Era.”Although Dauber created the poster in January, she says she’s still fighting with the university to get it printed and disseminated before the conference date, which is now just two weeks away. The flyer was supposed to be put up around campus, published on the conference’s website and sent out to students by email. The Guardian reported that Stanford barred Dauber from printing the poster with Trump’s image because it went against school policies surrounding political activity on campus. The university believed the flyer could be “seen as partisan,” according to The Guardian.Lisa Lapin, Stanford’s vice president of communications, initially told The Guardian that Dauber had “not been barred” from using Trump’s image and demanded the article be retracted. The publication, however, had emails provided by Dauber that proved the university had prohibited her from using the photo for months. Lapin then amended her statement and said that the law school “did not believe that the photo was appropriate.” “As a nonprofit the university must comply with the law that prevents it from engaging in certain partisan activities,” Lapin told The Huffington Post on Monday morning. “While the university does not take positions, individuals on our campus are encouraged to share their ideas.”Below is the poster Dauber created for the sexual assault awareness conference. After months of back and forth with the university, Dauber told The Huffington Post this is about way more than a poster.“I think what we’re dealing with is the chilling of free speech under Donald Trump, especially in the context of sexual assault,” Dauber said. “This really is an issue about academic freedom and censorship. It’s important for professors to know that this is what the future of academic freedom under Donald Trump may look like.” Dauber is no stranger to speaking out against the powers that be: the law professor is currently leading the fight to recall the judge who sentenced former Stanford student Brock Turner to only six months in county jail for three felony sex abuse convictions. According to Dauber, the same day the university censored her flyer, the faculty senate had a discussion with Stanford’s president about budget concerns under Trump’s administration.“I think it’s important for the public to understand that we count on universities to be the bulwark of critical thought and free speech but university budgets, for example, depend so heavily on government subsidy,” Dauber said.Although Stanford’s logo appeared on the flyer, Dauber told HuffPost she raised most of the funds for the conference herself, and that the university had very little to do with creating and planning the event. Dauber said she offered to pay for the flyers and distribute them, but Stanford would still not budge.“This is an important issue that goes to Stanford’s integrity,” Dauber said. “But also beyond Stanford to the integrity of American universities and the importance of free speech and academic freedom under a president who has shown over and over again that he’s very thin-skinned, very sensitive to criticism and will lash out at critics.”In an email to HuffPost on Monday morning, Lapin disputed Dauber’s story.“The law school believed the use of the image, at an event with institutional sponsorship, created ‘an appearance of partisanship’ that it seeks to avoid,” she said. “However, the school was willing, and in fact offered to the professor, to seek a final decision from the university authority on the matter, which is the Office of the General Counsel. Professor Dauber understood she had an option for this final opinion, but said she wanted to ‘think about it.’ She never in fact sought this final decision from the university prior to going to the press with her claims.”Lapin said the university sent an email late Friday night giving permission to Dauber to use the photo.

Now, the victim's family is asking the suspect, identified by authorities as Steve Stephens, to come forward and face justice after shooting Godwin and posting a video of the murder on Facebook. And despite the painful loss Godwin’s family has suffered, relatives say their Christian faith compels them to forgive the killer.“Each one of us forgives the killer, the murderer,” Godwin’s daughter Tonya Godwin-Baines told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “We want to wrap our arms around him.”Godwin-Baines said that it was her dad who instilled that incredible faith in his children ― by showing them how to forgive, and not just telling them about forgiveness. “The thing that I would take away the most from my father is he taught us about God, how to fear God, how to love God and how to forgive,” Godwin-Baines said.She reiterated that she holds no animosity towards Stephens. “My dad would ... want this from us. And he would say, ‘Tonya, forgive him’ because they know not what they do,” the daughter added, quoting words that Jesus said on the cross.Robby Miller, Godwin’s son, echoed his sister’s statements in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon.“No, I don’t want that man to die, I want him brought to justice,” Miller said. “One thing I do want to say, is that I forgive (the killer).”A nationwide manhunt for Stephens was ongoing Tuesday morning, after a few false leads led police to search for the suspect in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Federal authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Stephen’s arrest. The public nature of Godwin’s death has left the Cleveland family reeling. Stephens recorded the shooting in its entirety and posted the video to his Facebook page. It remained there for more than two hours before Facebook took it down. But during that time, it had been shared and viewed more than 1 million times. Miller said that the taping of his father’s death “stripped him of his dignity.”“And to post it online for the whole world to see? I’m just angry,” Miller told CNN. The family is asking social media users to stop reposting the video. Godwin’s former wife, Dorothy Crumpton, told CNN that at this point, the family just wants Stephens to come forward. “I don’t want to him to take his life. I don’t want the police to have to take his life,” said Crumpton. “I want him to give himself up, because at the end of the day Jesus died for his sins too, just like he died for mine.” "

The high court issued its order denying the state’s request around 11:45 p.m. Monday, 15 minutes before the execution warrant for prisoner Don Davis expired. The flurry of court rulings will continue as Arkansas pushes on with its unprecedented attempt to execute eight prisoners in an 11-day span. Critics have blasted the state’s “conveyor belt” plan for multiple executions as inhumane and a denial of the prisoners’ due process. The execution warrant for one prisoner has expired and individual stays have been issued for two more, but the state has five other men it will attempt to execute by April 27. The next attempt is scheduled for Thursday, when Stacey Johnson and Ledell Lee are set to die in a double execution. The state is aggressively moving to cull its death row before its supply of midazolam ― a controversial sedative in the lethal-injection cocktail ― expires later this month. Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) has said he’s unsure whether the state could get more.Before the high court made its late-night decision, Monday’s legal battle was the state’s attempt to reverse decisions made over the weekend that would temporarily halt all the executions.Instead, the Arkansas Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision on Monday, granted stays of execution for Bruce Ward and for Davis.“There will be no executions tonight. We are deeply grateful that the Arkansas Supreme Court has issued stays of execution for Bruce Ward and Don Davis,” Scott Braden, assistant federal defender in Arkansas, said in an email statement.State Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said she would immediately appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court before changing course to say she wouldn’t appeal Ward’s stay “at this time.”Hutchinson criticized the state Supreme Court for sparing the two men.Soon after the Arkansas Supreme Court ruling, a federal appeals court lifted stays for five of the condemned inmates that had been put in place on Saturday. That case challenges the state’s method of performing the executions. A stay for prisoner Jason McGehee was granted in a separate case on Friday.In Monday’s ruling, the U.S. Eight Circuit Court of Appeals said the five inmates had ample time already to file objections to the execution protocol, and only acted at the last minute. Judge Jane Kelly, in a dissent, argued the the case was about more than which drugs are used to put inmates to death, and questioned whether Arkansas was in line with the Eight Amendment’s “evolving standards of decency.”Despite the federal appeals ruling, a state court ruling that blocks the state Department of Corrections from using pancuronium bromide ― a second drug in the lethal three-drug mixture ― remains in place.The state temporary restraining order was granted Friday by Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen, who has since become controversial for attending a death penalty protest hours after his ruling. Drugmaker McKesson Medical-Surgical sought the order to prevent the state from using the drug after learning the corrections department had obtained it for executions, which the company doesn’t permit. A day after winning the restraining order, the company filed to withdraw its petition, saying the federal ruling that stayed the executions made the state court order unnecessary. Griffen drew criticism from Republican lawmakers for taking part in Friday’s protest. Griffen faces potential disciplinary action and was removed from all death penalty-related criminal and civil cases in Pulaski County.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f664651b0000330016c2a2.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_720_634%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"An Atlanta-based theater company has been hit with a barrage of criticism for staging a play that re-imagines biblical figures as queer. The Out Front Theatre Company’s production of “The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told” doesn’t officially open until April 27, but has already deemed “blasphemous” by America Needs Fatima. Paul Rudnick’s 1998 comedy follows Adam and Steve, a gay couple who navigate the centuries with Jane and Mabel, who are lesbians. Along the way, they encounter Noah’s ark, the first Christmas and other well-known Bible stories before traveling to present day New York. America Needs Fatima members, however, took specific issue with the play’s portrayal of the Virgin Mary as a lesbian. The conservative Catholic group, which is based in Pennsylvania, launched an online petition asking Out Front Theatre’s Artistic Director Paul Conroy to cancel the production, The New York Times reported Monday. “I vehemently protest your showing the blasphemous play ‘The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told,’ which, among other blasphemies, refers to the Virgin Mary as a lesbian,” the petition, which had over 42,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon, reads. “The Holy Mother of God is most pure and holy. To refer to her as a lesbian, or even to insinuate it, is an unspeakable blasphemy, which I reject with all my soul. I fear God’s wrath will fall upon us if reparation is not made.” The group then threatens to oppose the play “loudly, peacefully, and legally in as large a protest as we can help make possible” if Conroy chooses to stage the play. Even though the theater company had been planning to mount “The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told” for over a year, Conroy told The New York Times that the pushback didn’t begin until March 27, possibly in response to America Needs Fatima’s petition. Since then, he said he and his team have been inundated with letters, emails, phone calls and Facebook messages condemning the production. Still, he vowed not to bow down to the criticism. “I think everyone has their individual beliefs and they are entitled to that,” Conroy told Georgia radio station WABE. “If that’s what they believe, they don’t have to come and see our production, but to disrupt a production is where I don’t think it’s okay.”In a Tuesday Facebook post, he thanked the theater’s patrons for their support, but acknowledged that the controversy had “taken its toll” on the play’s cast and creative team. “To put it blunty, our creative expression is under attack,” he wrote. “People who have never seen or read ‘The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told’ are telling us what is wrong with the show, and people who have never met us are telling us what they think is wrong with us... I can promise that you will laugh, cry and think ― all the things theatre should do.”Meanwhile, the Out Front Theatre Company cited a statement it had received from Rudnick himself on its official Facebook page. The playwright, who is best known for 1993’s “Jeffrey,” praised the theater, which is dedicated to telling “stories of the LGBTQIA experience and community,” for its decision to move forward with his show in spite of the complaints it had thus far received. “The play has always attracted a certain amount of controversy, mostly from people who haven’t read or seen the play, like the Fatima organization,” Rudnick wrote. “Blessedly, all sorts of people, gay and straight, and everyone from atheists to the most devout, most often end up truly enjoying themselves once they’re in the audience.”For the latest in LGBTQ entertainment, check out the Queer Voices newsletter.

The beverage is made with mango syrup, a sour blue drizzle and topped with vanilla whipped cream and sweet pink and sour blue powder.Prior to the official announcement, employees around the country were already spreading the news on social media. Some locations say the Unicorn Frappuccino will be available on April 19, while others insist the big release date is April 20. Either way, it’s happening this week and is available for a limited time.Early reviews of the drink from those who say they’ve gotten their hands on it say the colorful concoction is about what you’d expect: Intensely sweet, sour, and it looks better than it tastes. Hopefully it tastes better than last year’s limited-release Fruitcake Frappuccino.Snacktaku’s Mike Fahey, whose wife has worked at Starbucks for over a decade, said Monday that he expected the drink to taste like a sour berry situation, based on its purple, pink and blue hue. But it actually has a mango base. The sparkly sugar sprinkles on top are basically sour candy, he wrote, and the blue wave is more sugary syrup. “It tastes nothing like unicorn,” he added.This article has been updated with information from Starbucks."

Capital punishment in several states was stymied by problems with lethal-injection drugs and legal questions over their protocols.Davis and fellow inmate Bruce Ward, both of whom have spent more than 20 years on death row, were scheduled to die on Monday night before the Arkansas Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, stayed the executions after their lawyers raised questions about their mental competency.Rutledge’s office declined to challenge the stay ordered for Ward.“While this has been an exhausting day for all involved, tomorrow we will continue to fight back on last minute appeals and efforts to block justice for the victims’ families,” said Governor Asa Hutchinson in a statement.In a separate ruling on Monday, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis overruled a lower court decision that had blocked the state’s original plan to put eight inmates to death.On April 6, U.S. District Judge J.P. Marshall halted one of the executions, saying the expedited schedule did not allow proper time for considering clemency for inmate Jason McGehee, who is one of the inmates set to die on April 27.Critics have contended that Arkansas’ rush to the death chamber was reckless. The state has said it had to act quickly because one of the drugs in its difficult-to-obtain lethal injection mix, the valium-like sedative midazolam, expires at the end of April.Attorneys for the eight were likely to appeal the federal appeals court ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. They filed a separate petition for stays on Monday with the U.S. Supreme Court over a procedural matter.The state also argued that U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker abused her discretion on Saturday when she ruled about potential harm from midazolam.The drug has been used in flawed executions in Oklahoma and Arizona. Critics contend it does not put a person in a deep enough state of unconsciousness and should not be used in executions.In 2014, Oklahoma was the last state to try carrying out two executions on the same night, an effort that went awry. Texas conducted the last successful dual executions in the United States in 2000."

It’s unfortunate, but it’s the nature of the game.”Trump was responding to a question about golfer Rory McIlroy, who came under fire on social media after playing a round of golf with the president. Trump’s father, of course, is known for using Twitter as a platform to hurl insults. The New York Times has a list of 325 people, places and things Trump has insulted on Twitter since he declared his candidacy.Eric Trump also complained that politics is “mean.”“Politics is a mean game,” Trump told the Independent. “I always said real estate is the most cut-throat industry in the world ― but it is nothing compared to some of these politicians.”His father on the campaign trail incited violence against protesters, criticized the family of a fallen soldier, and suggested that the father of then-rival Ted Cruz had a role in the assassination of JFK.

The board of 21st Century Fox, Fox News’ parent company, was to meet Thursday and was likely to discuss O’Reilly, according to CNN. Sources at the company told the Wall Street Journal that the decision could come as early as this week.The reports came as a new claim against O’Reilly was raised by attorney Lisa Bloom, who said the TV host used to call a black woman who worked as a clerical worker at Fox News “hot chocolate” during her time at the network in 2008. O’Reilly would reportedly make her feel uncomfortable in other ways as well. “He would never talk to her, not even hello, except to grunt at her like a wild boar,” Bloom told The Hollywood Reporter. “He would leer at her. He would always do this when no one else was around and she was scared.”Bloom, who said she verified the woman’s story with three witnesses, claims the woman feared she would lose her job if she complained at the time. She added that the woman wants no money, but has registered a complaint with the Fox News hotline in light of recent news about the host ― a service that apparently many female employees at the network only recently came to learn about. Later on Tuesday in a statement provided to CNN’s Dylan Byers, O’Reilly lawyer Marc Kasowitz argued that the claims were part of an “orchestrated campaign by activists” to bring O’Reilly down.“It is outrageous that an allegation from an anonymous person about something that purportedly happened almost a decade ago is being treated as fact, especially where there is obviously an orchestrated campaign by activists and lawyers to destroy Mr. O’Reilly and enrich themselves through publicity driven donations,” Kasowitz said. In a second statement to Beyers, Kasowitz said his client “has been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America,” and “irrefutable” evidence of a smear campaign would be unveiled soon. O’Reilly, who remains cable news’ most dominant figure, went on vacation last week as advertisers dropped him by the dozens following a New York Times investigation that revealed the Fox News Network and the host had paid at least $13 million to settle five claims of sexual harassment.More claims have continued to surface about the host’s actions ― some of them from the most unlikely of sources.At least 70 advertisers have decided to no longer advertise on “The O’Reilly Factor,” which remains Fox News’ biggest show by far. But “O’Reilly Factor” viewers remain committed to their host. A recent HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 65 percent of people who watch the show still hold a favorable view of him, and only 9 percent of his Republican viewers think the show should be canceled.The show’s ratings also dropped 26 percent in the first three days he was gone, further proof of O’Reilly’s influence, both nationally and internally at Fox News. Sherman reports that James Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch have been arguing to their father, Rupert, that the network must rid itself of O’Reilly, but Rupert remains unsure, not wanting to appear to be bowing to outside pressure from outlets like The New York Times. But on Tuesday, even Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report couldn’t help but think that O’Reilly’s days might be numbered.

Produced by the pair’s production company, Revelations Entertainment, the series will examine King’s life spanning from his adolescent years growing up with an alcoholic father to the events proceeding his 1991 beating by Los Angeles police, according to multiple reports.Featuring exclusive interviews with family members, attorneys and close friends Dr. Drew Pinsky and the Rev. Al Sharpton, the series will also include never-before-seen home video footage of King, which was filmed over a 12-year period prior to his accidental drowning in 2012.McCreary told Variety that presenting King’s life story through the series is in line with Revelations Entertainment’s mission of telling untold stories.“Our company is about revealing the truth, and we thought this would be a great way to reveal the truth about who this man was,” McCreary said. “We’ve had such a narrow view of who he was. There’s so much more to the story. I’m excited to finally be able to reveal the truth.”“Telling this story from the perspective of people who knew him and in his own words, we’ll see a different Rodney King — a generous, intelligent, loving man,” she said. She added that the pair is planning on pitching the project to “A&E, Amazon, CNN, HBO and Netflix” in the coming weeks.The announcement of the untitled series follows a string of upcoming events and documentaries coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the 1992 acquittal of the four officers involved in King’s assault, which sparked a week of riots across the Los Angeles area. The developing docuseries premieres in 2018."

Forget about it!,” a man passing by yelled out.",2017-04-18,"Postcards handed out at the UltraViolet demonstration urging Fox News to ""drop O'Reilly.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f662d92600003596c4650f.jpeg?cache=JyGv5Xoesv&ops=crop_0_1063_3000_2651%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK, NY ― On Tuesday, a few dozen women and men gathered outside of Fox News headquarters to send one simple message: fire Bill O’Reilly.“Hey hey, ho ho, Bill O’Reilly’s got to go,” chanted protesters, holding signs with slogans like, “Talk to me about revolution and a world without rape!!,” and the more straightforward, “Fox: Fire Sexual Predator Bill O’Reilly.” Women’s group UltraViolet staged the protest in response to the allegations of sexual harassment made against the “O’Reilly Factor” host, which the New York Times first reported on earlier this month.Fox and O’Reilly have reportedly paid out a collective $13 million over the course of 15 years to settle the claims of five different women. The allegations against O’Reilly included “verbal abuse, lewd comments, unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if Mr. O’Reilly was masturbating.” (Two of the settlements were reached after former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left the company in the wake of his own sexual harassment scandal.)Tuesday morning, The Hollywood Reporter reported that a new accuser came forward with allegations of harassment through the Fox News hotline. The woman, who has been identified as an African-American clerical worker at the network, said (through her attorney, Lisa Bloom) that O’Reilly would “leer at her,” and called her “hot chocolate.”O’Reilly is currently on a two-week vacation, which he claims had been planned since last year. In his absence, advocates have been vocal in their insistence that he not be allowed to return to air. The Intelligencer reported that “while no final decision has been made, the Murdochs are leaning toward announcing that O’Reilly will not return to the air.”Speakers at today’s demonstration connected a culture of condoning workplace sexual harassment with President Donald Trump, an accused sexual predator who has publicly defended O’Reilly. “It is outrageous that Fox News is even considering whether or not they should fire Bill O’Reilly. It’s not a question,” said speaker Melissa Quesinberry of NOW-NYC, who is a rape crisis advocate and sexual assault survivor. “We have a man in the highest position of power right now ― our president ― who is a serial sexual predator who came out and said, immediately without hearing the details of what’s going on, with this Bill O’Reilly scandal that he did nothing wrong; that he was a nice guy. Well, that’s not the story that we’re hearing from all of these women. So by not condemning this behavior, Fox News is elevating it to a pervasive level, demonstrating to all of their employees that this is acceptable, that it is expected and allowed. It is not.” The atmosphere outside of Fox headquarters was tense, as several men passing by the protest became verbally combative with protesters. “Bill’s a good guy! Forget about it!,” a middle-aged man in a gray suit yelled as he walked by. “Bill O’Reilly’s a legend!,” fist-pumped another, younger, suited man. “Stop acting like fools, people,” said diamond wholesaler Auri Ambalu, who stopped to engage with protesters. “It happens in life, what are you going to do? There’s nothing you can do about this, that’s world that we live in today. You have to accept certain things the way they are and that’s the way it is.”But the protesters, including 69-year-old Brooklyn resident Sally Moses disagreed with Ambalu’s sentiments.“There are a lot of people who are part of the problem and they’re not in touch with their own personal power,” she said. “They don’t understand what can happen with a voice... If I can say one thing that might wake someone up and there’s no guarantee but I’m willing to take five minutes, then I’m willing to try.”Moses explained to HuffPost why she had made the time to come out and demonstrate:For one thing, I don’t want people to get away with things that are so hurtful, as is misogyny [and] sexual assault. And I made the time to be here because I’ve been subjected to this kind of thing and I know how pervasive it is.In addition to staging the demonstration, UltraViolet launched two online petitions, one calling on Fox to fire O’Reilly, and another asking “O’Reilly Factor” advertisers to pull their ads from the show. (Dozens of advertisers, including H&R Block, Lexus, BMW, Invisalign, Mitsubishi, Jenny Craig and Advil, have pulled their ads since the allegations surfaced.) The organization also published an open letter to 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch, signed by nearly 300 survivors of sexual assault and their allies. Despite the significant media attention that the allegations against O’Reilly have received, his core audience’s loyalty has not seemed to waver.According to a HuffPost/YouGov survey, 65 percent of “The O’Reilly Factor” viewers still approve of O’Reilly, and just 17 percent reported that they believe the show should be canceled in light of the controversy. That number is even lower among viewers who identify as Republicans.“I’m not sure why people continue to watch his show, but I do know that Fox News has an obligation to protect everyone, all of their employees, from a sexual predator,” Karin Roland, Chief Campaigns Officer at UltraViolet, told HuffPost. “It doesn’t matter what [O’Reilly’s] ratings are. He’s repeatedly assaulting and harassing women at Fox. He needs to be stopped and he has no place in their workplace.”CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect the correct name of the speaker at the demonstration, Melissa Quesinberry of NOW-NYC.

20,CRIME,Etan Patz's Killer Sentenced To At Least 25 Years In Prison,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/etan-patz-killer-sentencing_us_58f50988e4b0bb9638e58433,Pedro Hernandez was convicted for the infamous 1979 New York abduction of the child on the milk carton.,2017-04-18,A poster with the writing of accused Pedro Hernandez is pictured in this undated evidence handout photo provided by defense attorney Alice Fontier. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f520742600003600c4618c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A former New York City deli clerk was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison on Tuesday for the 1979 abduction and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz, one of the first missing children to be pictured on a milk container. The case began nearly 38 years ago when Etan disappeared on the first morning that his mother permitted him to go to school unaccompanied from the family’s Manhattan apartment. Convicted killer Pedro Hernandez, 56, received the maximum sentence of 25 years to life for choking Etan and then leaving him to die. “I will never forgive you. The God you pray to will never forgive you,” Etan’s father Stan Patz said to Hernandez at the sentencing.Hernandez’s attorney, meanwhile, said Hernandez had nothing to do with Etan’s disappearance, though in 2012 he confessed to attacking the boy.Jurors convicted Hernandez in February of kidnapping and second-degree murder after his first trial resulted in a hung jury.Etan’s disappearance alarmed parents from coast to coast and contributed to increasing levels of supervision of children. Etan was one of the earliest, if not the first, missing children to have his photo included on a milk carton. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan declared May 25, the day of Etan’s disappearance, as National Missing Children’s Day.Police pursued other suspects for decades before a break came in 2012 when Hernandez’s brother-in-law in New Jersey shared his suspicions with authorities. The brother-in-law claimed that Hernandez had told a prayer group that he’d killed a child in New York City. In a recorded confession to police in 2012, Hernandez said he used the promise of soda to lure Etan into his deli where he worked near the Patz apartment in the SoHo neighborhood. Inside the shop’s basement, he said, he choked Etan and placed his still-breathing body into a plastic bag inside a box that he discarded a few blocks away.Etan’s remains have never been found. Jurors in the first trial saw video of the confession, but the prosecution lacked physical evidence tying Hernandez to the crime, and defense attorneys argued Hernandez confused reality and fantasy because of a mental illness, making the confession unreliable. They argued that police coerced Hernandez during an interrogation, and pointed to evidence suggesting an earlier suspect who is now a convicted pedophile in Pennsylvania was the culprit.A deadlock ensued at the 2015 trial when one juror refused to convict Hernandez, leading to the mistrial. The retrial began in October 2016 with prosecutors and defense lawyers presenting a similar case. This time the jury returned a guilty verdict after deliberating for nine days. Jurors told The New York Post that they were convinced by Hernandez’s confession and by members of the church group who testified about incriminating things he’d said. But the defense challenged the conviction. Some jurors knew that members of the first trial’s jury sat in the audience of the second trial as supporters of Patz’s father. The defense argued that this unfairly tainted their deliberations by revealing how some previous jury members had decided. A judge, however, disagreed and let the conviction stand on April 4. "

And that is just what residents and visitors of California's Central Valley have experienced this week. After the Bureau of Land Management posted an Instagram picture of the lush landscape yesterday, the Internet took notice as images began spreading throughout the web. ""The show is simply indescribable...like something out of a storybook,"" the Bureau's caption read. ""The Valley floor has endless expanses of yellows and purples from coreopsis, tidy tips, and phacelia, with smaller patches of dozens of other species.""Generally, California's ""Super Bloom"" occurs in locations such as the Anza-Borrego Desert outside of San Diego and Walker Canyon near southern Los Angeles. This year, however, the blooming moved some 50 miles north of L.A. in and around Carrizo Plain. This has caused residents and tourists alike to flock the generally quiet valley. As a result, officials have been forced to place signs urging visitors to stay on marked trails as there have been reports of flowers being trampled.And for those visiting the Carrizo Plain, please heed the Bureau's advice: Drive with as much gas in your tank as possible. Since the valley is in a remote location, there are no service stations nearby.More from Architectural Digest: See What's Inside Donald Trump's Former Superyacht14 of the Most Luxurious Yacht Decks10 Incredible Ski ResortsThe 10 Best New Luxury CruisesThe World’s Best Oceanfront Hotels10 Hotels with Unbelievably High-End Amenities"
22,WOMEN,Jenna Bush Hager's Praise Of Her Dad's 'Feminism' Speaks To A Common Misconception,Emma Gray,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jenna-bush-hagers-praise-of-her-dads-feminism-speaks-to-a-common-misconception_us_58f62bfae4b0bb9638e69b58,"Unfortunately, that feminism didn’t extend to policy when he was POTUS.",2017-04-18,"President George W. Bush and Jenna Bush Hager prior to her wedding on May 10, 2008. Hager says her father was a feminist.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f62c851b0000330016c193.jpeg?cache=rBpb3ktO8W&ops=crop_232_146_1768_1200%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Jenna Bush Hager, “Today” correspondent and daughter of former President George W. Bush, gushed about her parents in a recent interview with People Magazine. “I think the thing that my parents did so well and might surprise people, although I don’t know why, is that they really wanted us to be curious, independent thinkers,” she told People. “They wanted to raise us to have our own views and to be able to articulate them.”Bush Hager specifically highlighted the way her father contributed to her strength, telling People that the former president “led [Jenna and her twin sister Barbara] to believe that [they] were the smartest, most capable kids out there.”“People laugh at this,” continued Bush Hager, “but I think my dad was a feminist. He showed us that we could be whatever we wanted to be. I want my girls to feel that way. I want them to feel strong and capable and feel like they can conquer the world.”These are lovely sentiments, to be sure. And if Bush Hager credits her father with raising her to be a strong, independent-thinking, outspoken woman, then that is certainly laudable.However, feminism is about more than respecting (or raising or loving) individual women and girls, and promoting that watered-down definition is harmful to women at large. It’s about social, political and economic equality for all ― something that can only be achieved if addressed systemically. Bush Hager’s warm words come during a time when her father is experiencing a period of nostalgia-induced image rehab.As HuffPost’s Ryan Grim wrote in March, “[President] Trump has shifted Americans’ vantage point on Bush, who seems competent, well-spoken, tolerant and humane by comparison,” and yet, “missing amid much of the reaction to Bush’s sensible words was the memory of his deeds.”Former President Bush may have raised self-declared feminist daughters, but he does not have a great track record when it comes to enacting feminist policies that would have benefitted women outside of his immediate family.One of the first things he did when he took office in 2001, was reinstate the global gag rule, which blocks U.S. funding to international health care groups that provide abortion or abortion counseling. His administration backed a Family Time Flexibility Act, which was roundly criticized for benefiting employers far more than workers who needed overtime pay to support their families. His administration’s U.N. delegation continuously promoted abstinence over contraception and sexual education. In 2003, President Bush signed into law the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which prohibits physicians from performing a specific method of late-term abortion, more accurately termed intact dilation and extraction.In March 2004, Laura Flanders wrote in The Guardian about the way the Bush camp was using its female members to create a more palatable view of President Bush’s more anti-woman views and policies.“Without a legislative record to attract the majority of female voters, the Bush/Cheney campaign is deploying its female faces,” Flanders wrote. “While Bush courts so-called Nascar dads at the Daytona car-races and slaps the backs of cowboys at rodeos, the first lady makes her appeals to women. A self-proclaimed former Democrat, who appeared on TV shortly before her husband’s inauguration to say she didn’t believe abortion should be banned, Laura Bush’s job is to lull social moderates. The White House isn’t really in the clutches of religious extremists, she reassures.”This commentary feels uncomfortably familiar in light of the way that President Trump has deployed his daughter (and advisor) Ivanka, as well as First Lady Melania Trump. Last July, Ivanka Trump declared that her father was a feminist in an interview with the Sunday Times: My father is a feminist. He’s a big reason I am the woman I am today. People talk about gender equality. He has lived it, he has employed women at the highest levels of the Trump Organization for decades, so I think it’s a great testament to how capable he thinks women are and has shown that his whole life... He always told me and showed me that I could do anything I set my mind to if I married vision and passion with work ethic. He’s also surrounded me with strong female role models who have done just that since I was a little girl.Whether or not President Trump made Ivanka feel that he believes women are “capable” and “strong,” his first months in office have certainly not extended these warm and fuzzy sentiments to the American public. The danger of labeling any man who respects an individual woman “feminist,” is that the term begins to lose all meaning. Raising a strong daughter is one thing, but having the power to impact the health and opportunities of 162 million American women is quite another. "

This adds a more luxurious consistency and infuses flavor right into the grain. Freshness and texture can then come from chunks or dice of the same vegetable added toward the end of cooking. I’ve taken this approach for mushroom risottos, but never to quite the extent that I did the other day, when I used a total of a pound and a quarter (570 g) of mushrooms for just enough risotto to feed Jackie and me plus a friend.I began with a clump of hen-of-the-woods (maitake) weighing around 10 ounces (285 g). I cut the numerous caps from the stalk and set them aside, then chopped the stalk and simmered it in a quart (liter) of diluted chicken stock, along with a sprinkle of salt, a scrap of kombu for extra savoriness/umami and a few sage leaves to remind myself that an Italian-style dish was in the offing. When this had simmered for half an hour, I left it to steep until tepid, then strained it.As it was cooling, it occurred to me that this prospective risotto – which would be subtly mushroomy – would benefit from the intensified flavor of mushroom mush cooked along with the rice. So I went to the supermarket on our corner and bought a 10-ounce (285 g) package of ordinary white mushrooms. I wiped them (fairly) clean and finely minced them in the food processor with a couple of leaves of sage; they were just about pureed. After melting a tablespoon of butter in a skillet, I added the pureed mushrooms and some salt and cooked them over medium heat, stirring frequently, until they had reduced to a thick, brown mass – in effect, an allium-free duxelles. Mushrooms being what they are (mostly water), even this dense, thickened, delicious puree remained very moist.(Remember: Ordinary mushrooms are wonderful things – it’s nice to have the exotica, but I’d use the everyday variety for this entire dish. In a flash.)To make the risotto I used the old-fashioned method of constant stirring. Nothing new here: I sweated a big shallot, minced, in olive oil; stirred in the rice (something less than a cup of the carnaroli variety – say 225 ml by volume – for the three of us) and cooked it in the oil for half a minute before adding a scant quarter cup (50 ml, say) white wine and reducing it. I then incorporated all of the mushroom puree and began the pleasant task of adding heated-up mushroom-scented stock a little at a time and stirring the risotto energetically. Et cetera: see any old-fashioned risotto recipe or take a look at the story I wrote after a risotto lesson in Venice.While this was happening, I gave the maitake caps a sauté in minimal olive oil, using highish heat to slightly crisp their edges; they cooked quickly: compared with the stalk, the caps are very tender. You could do this before starting the rice if you’re uneasy about stirring and sautéing at the same time.When the rice was done, I checked for seasoning (pepper was called for), added the sautéed maitake caps, covered the pan and left it alone for three minutes, at which point I vigorously stirred in a scant ounce (20 or 25 g) of butter and a small handful of a mixture of parsley and sage, chopped. Parsley alone would be fine, and, throughout the recipe, you could use a wee bit of thyme in place of the sage, but only a wee bit lest it take control of the entire dish. At this point I also beat in a little more stock to attain a properly fluid consistency – this may be unnecessary, but be ready for the possibility.Between all those mushrooms and the kombu-tinged stock, the risotto was so savory that I added no grated parmesan. But I did bring some to the table; after experimental spoonsful, everyone agreed that cheese would be superfluous. But offering it would be neighborly, so you might as well give people the option.When the Great Mushroom Varieties are available – porcini, chanterelles and a few others – we eat wonderful risottos at home and, occasionally, in restaurants. But they rarely beat this one, with its supermarket-mushroom base. "

At this point I also beat in a little more stock to attain a properly fluid consistency – this may be unnecessary, but be ready for the possibility.Between all those mushrooms and the kombu-tinged stock, the risotto was so savory that I added no grated parmesan. But I did bring some to the table; after experimental spoonsful, everyone agreed that cheese would be superfluous. But offering it would be neighborly, so you might as well give people the option.When the Great Mushroom Varieties are available – porcini, chanterelles and a few others – we eat wonderful risottos at home and, occasionally, in restaurants. But they rarely beat this one, with its supermarket-mushroom base. "

I’ve run up and down Syracuse University campus, through muggy Michigan fields and towns, down the lakeshore of Chicago, up steep hilly trails of Marin County, along long New England roads. I’ve jogged across the magnificent Golden Gate Bridge and beside the banks of a misty gray Lake Zürich in Switzerland, at the foot of the Alps.I’ve squinted and huffed through snow, rain and sleet. I’ve pressed my fists and mind through disapproval, heartbreak, depression, job loss, sexist bosses, through a squishy postpartum body, insomnia, parental stress, an ill child, through crime and betrayal.“What are you running from?” one trainer once asked me as she rubbed a knot in my hip. “Your body isn’t made for this,” she added. “You shouldn’t have so much pain.”But my running isn’t about avoiding discomfort. I run to press through hard stuff – to feel bones and muscles, alive against pavement, upright in a big, complicated world. I run to pump and sweat out false messages and expectations that hang on me, blind me and confine me from living the life I’ve been blessed to receive.Sure, I run to stay fit. But also I run from hopelessness – I run from the myths that moms should be sweet and tidy and happy and smooth and young and beautiful; that bad schools can never change; that hunger and poverty and homelessness will never end; that a mother can’t help her child without giving him medication. I run from racism and stereotypes about women, kids, classes, religions, races and political parties. I run from all the stupid things I’ve said and done and from every thought of mine that has growled, “You can’t do that. You can’t change that.” I run from lack of faith, from broken friendships, from selfishness; from jealousy and pride and self-hate, from guilt and greed.When I run, I always find a destination. But the trick is, the end place evolves as I move forward. It unveils as I stretch my limbs, warming up with the sky, as I abandon all that holds me back – my destination comes as I live.I run toward the sound of my breath sucking oxygen inward. I run toward birds calling, the breeze blowing, toward the voices of people whom I couldn’t hear before. I run toward light breaking through thousands of lacy branches and snowflakes scattering on hillsides I was too distracted to notice. I run to the places where I’m needed but I’ve ignored; the child overlooked, the mom who could use a phone call, the stranger alone, the family suffering whom I should ask, “How can I help?” I run toward the person whom I must forgive, toward the story I’ve got to write, toward the true voice I’ve shoved down inside of me itching to shirk off the burdening concept of popularity and shout, “That’s WRONG to discriminate. That’s wrong to mock, to judge, to lie. That’s wrong to hate.” “You need to breathe. Calm down. Relax,” someone might say. But for me, running is relaxing. It’s where I finally acknowledge the truth, where I find God.“I hate running,” A friend says.“I can’t run. My knees,” Another says.“Then don’t run,” I reply.But seek that thing your body and mind must do to sift out the broken, jagged pieces of our world cutting and dragging you down. Sing or swim, pray or walk, write or paint or do downward dogs. Take a million photos. Dance the hula. Do something until you ache, until you taste your own salty sweat, until you touch your soft soul – free again.As for me, when I’m sick or injured or when I’m really, really old – I’ll keep running, even if only in my mind. I’ll huff and puff and fight toward the bright, gorgeous hope waiting for me every day – if I run relentlessly toward it.The First version of this piece was published on the MOPS International Blog"

Now, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates will carry the distinction of yet another record: the world's most extreme taxi ride.It was recently announced that by the summer of 2017, Dubai will be the first location in the world to allow passenger-carrying drone taxis. The company responsible for this futuristic innovation is EHang, a Guangzhou-based firm that first made waves at CES 2016 with a personal drone that could fly 11,000 feet without the necessity of a pilot manning the controls. EHang's 184 model, which can carry up to 255 pounds of weight (with enough room for an adult and one small carry-on), were recently ordered by local authorities in Dubai.The way the technology works is that, once seated in the EHang 184, passengers will use a mobile application to enter their desired GPS destination and then press a launch button. From there, the 440-pound drone will lift off and begin flying with a top speed of 100 miles per hour, and a top distance of roughly 31 miles on a single charge. Naturally, safety is a major concern in any motor vehicle, let along a self-flying drone taxi. Yet EHang says that its drone will be an extremely safe ride. The flying machine is programed with multiple emergency plans that, in theory, have the ability to safely fly its passenger to the nearest landing location in the event of an emergency.The Chinese drones are due to be delivered in July and are said to be part of a grand strategy that aims to see roughly one fourth of all Dubai’s traffic become driverless by 2030. And the company is not wasting any time to reach that ambitious goal: Unlike most futuristic models, this one will be off the ground in a few months. Indeed, test flights are reportedly ongoing in Dubai this month.More from Architectural Digest: See What's Inside Donald Trump's Former Superyacht14 of the Most Luxurious Yacht Decks10 Incredible Ski ResortsThe 10 Best New Luxury CruisesThe World’s Best Oceanfront Hotels10 Hotels with Unbelievably High-End Amenities"
28,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Throws His Hat In With Montana Populist Rob Quist,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-rob-quist_us_58f508e0e4b0da2ff8625337,Top party officials had until now largely ignored the banjo-strumming House hopeful.,2017-04-17,Montana Democrat Rob Quist is well known around the state for his decades-long music career. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f50a5f1b0000320016be8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced plans Monday to campaign with Rob Quist, the banjo-strumming populist Democrat running for Montana’s open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. “Rob Quist is the only person in this race who understands that we need a government in Washington that works for all Montanans and all Americans and not just the special interests and the billionaire class,” Sanders said in a statement. “I look forward to campaigning with him in May and working with him in Congress.” Quist, a legendary folk musician who co-founded the Mission Mountain Wood Band, won his party’s nomination in March after barnstorming the state, encouraging supporters to organize Democratic committees in counties long dominated by the GOP. He defeated a handful of state legislators to win the nomination for the special election called for May 25 after Ryan Zinke, who had won re-election for the House seat, became President Donald Trump’s secretary of the interior. Until recently, top Democratic officials had largely ignored the Montana campaign, even as voters clamored for the party to focus on down-ballot races that could flip historically red congressional seats. But Sanders’ organization, Our Revolution, recently endorsed Quist. And earlier this month, the Vermont senator, who caucuses with the Democrats, told The Huffington Post he’d offered to make a stop in Montana on his national tour with Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez sometime after Easter. The campaign has yet to announce dates for Quist’s appearances with Sanders, but voters can sign up with their contact information to receive alerts.“I’m excited that Bernie Sanders recognizes that our grassroots campaign is building momentum and has the best chance in decades to take back Montana’s U.S. House seat for the rest of us,” said Quist, who endorsed Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary last year, in a statement. “In the U.S. House, I’ll be a voice to protect our public lands, fight for working families, work for better health care, and stand up to Wall Street and special interests.”The Quist campaign initially bristled at comparisons to Sanders, despite the two men’s shared support for single-payer health care and abortion rights, and their similar dismay over the ongoing concentration of wealth and power among a small class of elites. Quist, 69, is selling himself as a hometown maverick and champion of public lands access, a core issue in a state where the federal government owns 29 percent of all acreage.Greg Gianforte, the tech millionaire running against Quist on the Republican ticket, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sanders won Montana’s Democratic primary last June. Trump won the Republican nomination in Montana and went on to handily defeat Hillary Clinton in the state in November.Gianforte lost his bid to unseat Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) in November. It was a costly defeat: Gianforte spent at least $5.1 million of his own money on the campaign, which aired 30,661 television ads, more than any other state candidate in the country. Quist has sought to depict Gianforte, whose last campaign left him with strong name recognition, as an out-of-touch rich guy from out of state. Born in California, Gianforte lived for years in New Jersey, a fact of which Democrats have been quick to remind voters. Gianforte had a reported income of $220.5 million between 2005 and 2014 on his tax returns, and in 2011, he sold his software firm RightNow Technologies to the tech giant Oracle Corp. for $1.5 billion.Quist, by contrast, is the son of ranchers from Flathead County, Montana. He struggled financially due to a pre-existing condition that prevented him from getting health care, forcing him to pay out of pocket for a series of surgeries in the early 2000s.“Congress right now is dominated by politicians who worry about the needs of their wealthy campaign contributors,” Sanders said. “We need members of Congress like Rob who will work to rebuild the shrinking middle class, who will fight all attempts to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and will oppose tax breaks for the very rich.”CLARIFICATION: Language has been amended to reflect that Quist is from Flathead County, not a town called Flathead."

Khatib, who comes from a family of Syrian immigrants, used the race as an opportunity to help refugees who have resettled in her home state of Michigan. The athlete managed to raise $16,000 through the race for the Syrian American Rescue Network, a Michigan-based nonprofit that helps refugees adjust to life in America.In a pre-race Instagram post, Khatib revealed that she was “tossing and turning all night” before the race. But, she wrote, she knows “God brought me here for a reason.”“I’m honored and thrilled and know this will be an incredible experience inshallah [God willing].”Monday’s race put her halfway toward achieving her ultimate goal of competing in all six of the world’s largest and most renowned marathons. She has previously run the Berlin and Chicago marathons. Khatib was born in Damascus, Syria, and later came to the United States with her family. She started running five years ago and has developed a following through her Instagram account, @runlikeahijabi, where she inspires Muslim women to get active.In an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this year, Khatib said that she believed the chance to compete in the Boston Marathon was sent to her from God.“I want to make an impact on the Ummah [the worldwide Muslim community], no matter how small, it’s my way of giving back to society and humanity,” she said.

Lee, the chief of the biggest, Samsung Group, was arrested suspected of bribing Park and her friend, Choi Soon-sil.Lee, Park and Choi are being held at detention centers.Lotte, South Korea’s fifth-biggest conglomerate, is grappling with the Chinese shutdown of dozens of its stores in China, after it agreed to provide land for the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system outside Seoul.South Korea, which accuses China or discriminating against some South Korean companies working in China, and the United States say the sole purpose of THAAD is to guard against North Korean missiles. China says its powerful radar can penetrate its territory and undermine its security and spoke out against it again on Monday.Lotte’s chief Shin is also on a separate graft trial involving family members charged with embezzlement and breach of trust.Prosecutors accused Park of colluding with Choi to receive 7 billion won ($6.16 million) from Lotte for favors, they said in a statement. Park was also charged with abuse of power and coercion by pressuring big businesses to contribute funds to non-profit foundations, the prosecutors said.Park is also charged with taking bribes worth about 29.8 billion won from Samsung scion Lee in exchange for supporting his succession, according to the prosecutors’ statement.Lotte denied allegations that it made improper deals with Park, or those linked to her, for favors, but said it would explain itself at court to resolve suspicions.“We find the decision on the indictment regrettable,” Lotte Group said in a statement.Park, Lee, Choi and Samsung Group have also denied wrongdoing."

Quist is campaigning for the House of Representatives seat vacated by newly appointed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in a special election that will take place on May 25, 2017. Quist, 69, is a popular singer and songwriter who performed with the Mission Mountain Wood Band.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f4f1071b0000320016be0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Greg Gianforte, the tech millionaire running for the Montana congressional seat vacated by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, doubled down on his stance rejecting the theory of evolution in a radio interview aired Monday.Asked three times by a Montana Public Radio host if he believes biological species developed through natural selection over time, the Republican repeated a straightforward, if vague, response.“I personally believe, as many Montanans do, that God created the Earth,” Gianforte, who made a failed bid in November for the Montana governor’s mansion, said in the 15-minute interview. “I believe that God created the Earth. I wasn’t there, I don’t know how long it took, I don’t know how he did it exactly. But I look around me at the grandeur in this state and I believe God created the Earth.”“And, so, evolution is not something you believe in,” the host, Sally Mauk, asked to clarify. “Um,” Gianforte replied, “I think I’ve answered your question.” Shane Scanlon, a campaign spokesman, did not immediately respond to questions from The Huffington Post about whether Gianforte was open to theistic evolution, the belief among some Christians that God catalyzed the scientific processes that lead to evolution.Rob Quist, the legendary folk singer and populist Democrat running against Gianforte, believes in evolution, his campaign manager told HuffPost. Quist’s campaign hopes Gianforte’s hard-line stances can become a wedge-issue for voters in a state that Trump handily won in November. During his gubernatorial run last year, Gianforte distanced himself from an Idaho pastor, Douglas Wilson, who once wrote that “one could argue that the black family has never been stronger than it was under slavery,” and maintains that women are “created to be responsive and dependent to a man.” Gianforte served on the board of the pastor’s education nonprofit. The race has been largely ignored on the national stage even as Democratic voters urge the party to focus efforts on flipping traditionally red congressional seats. The Democratic Party plans to step up its support for Quist’s grassroots-driven campaign ahead of the May 25 special election, with campaign trail appearances by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the party. “Rob Quist believes in evolution and science,” a Quist spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost. “As a product of public schools, Rob supports evolution being taught in schools as part of the science curriculum.”In 2006, Gianforte launched the Gianforte Family Foundation with his wife “in response to God’s great goodness to them.” The foundation focuses on “improving education, lifting people out of poverty, protecting the unborn, and Christian outreach,” according to text on the foundation website cited by HuffPost in 2015. The website appears to have since changed. The foundation now describes itself as a “faith-based organization engaged in outreach work, strengthening families, and helping the needy,” doling out $51.7 million over the past 11 years.The foundation donated the T. rex, Acrocanthosaurus and mastodon exhibits to the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum, an institution that cost $1.5 million to build and was opened in 2009. The Billings Gazette noted at the time that it was “the largest donation for a specific exhibit.”Robert Canen, the museum’s director, told HuffPost on Monday that Gianforte donated the dinosaurs in 2008 and the hairy elephantine mammal in 2009. The donations were valued at about $295,000, he said.The museum rejects Darwin’s theory of evolution and promotes the idea, contrary to scientific consensus, that the planet is about 6,000 years old and dinosaurs and people walked the Earth around at the same time. The museum has its own dig site and performs what Canen called the “science of paleontology” in a biblical context. “We believe the Bible is an accurate history, so we look at it from that perspective,” Canen said. “We think the Earth is thousands of years old, not millions of years.” Just 11 percent of evangelical Protestants believe humans evolved due to natural processes, according to the Pew Research Center’s most recent poll on religious beliefs. That number inched slightly higher to 16 percent among historically black Protestants. About 31 percent of Catholics shared that belief. Slightly more believe humans evolved due to God’s design: 25 percent of evangelical Protestants, 31 percent of historically black Protestants and 31 percent of Catholics.

Labor and immigration advocates also plan to demonstrate around the country on May 1. Leaders of the education protests say they are joining the other groups in solidarity and expect hundreds of thousands of people to participate in events held at more than 2,000 schools nationwide. AROS represents a coalition of national and grassroots education groups across the country. Since Trump’s election and the confirmation of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, members have been exceptionally mobilized, according to Keron Blair, AROS’ executive director. The latest campaign, which launches Tuesday, seeks to capitalize on this momentum and link the movements for education and immigrant justice.In the upcoming weeks, AROS’ campaign plans to call on leaders to end the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, and to ensure that schools are safe places for all students ― no matter what their immigration status.“For us, it is really about the vision that instead of investing billions of dollars in a wall that divides our community, what we really should be doing is investing heavily in great public schools for our children,” said Blair, whose coalition represents groups like the Advancement Project and the Center for Popular Democracy. The campaign plans to kick off at a high school in Dearborn, Michigan, with leaders like Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). The Dearborn school is “fairly well-resourced,” Blair said, but it is not representative of the overall state of public education in Michigan.Michigan, which is DeVos’ home state, has low rates of academic achievement. Critics say this is partly because of policies pushed by DeVos herself. DeVos is a proponent of policies that expand access to charter schools and private schools. Critics say such policies hurt traditional public schools.In response to DeVos’ confirmation, Blair said there has been an increase in engagement from people who want to protect public education.“She’s really awakened activists,” Blair said. “We see incredible participation from educators, parents and students.”"

She’s an avid death metal fan who dresses mostly in black and lives with her husband in a house so deep in the woods they can’t see any neighbors. They call their home the Fishbowl, its giant windows offering sweeping views of their land.She has long known that her home is something she wants to protect. “I’ve always seen the township as almost supernaturally beautiful: tranquil, lush, green,” Long said. “Any time of the night, you can see every star.” Her family’s roots in the township go back four generations. Her mother, retired school teacher Judy Wanchisn, lives a mile away. Neither woman was thrilled about Pennsylvania General Energy’s plan to pump millions of gallons of water and toxic solvents into the well. They worried that the wastewater would leach into Little Mahoning Creek, the source of Grant’s pristine drinking water. At first, no one paid Stacy Long and her mother much mind. But three and a half years later, PGE’s project is still tied up in the courts. With the help of a crusading law firm, Long and Wanchisn have taken a novel approach to keeping the well out of their town ― essentially changing Grant’s charter to declare it an independent legal entity with the authority to define civil rights for its citizens, even if those rights conflict with state laws. They’ve challenged PGE’s permit applications at every step, claimed their watershed should be recognized as having the same legal rights as a human being, and even helped legalize civil disobedience in their town to protect anyone who takes direct action to stop PGE’s plans. Long and Wanchisn’s fight has inspired similar efforts in other communities facing fracking companies that want to set up shop within their borders, creating a new a blueprint for resistance that dozens of other towns have taken up. The women never expected any of this. To them, this fight was always about safeguarding the citizens of Grant Township.“We’re up against an industry that enjoys every advantage,” said Long. “We’re tiny, we’re impoverished. Our economy is hanging by a thread. We’re the easiest and cheapest way for the gas industry to get rid of its crap.” “But Grant is special,” she continued. “It’s the reason we’re fighting so hard.”Hundreds of fracking wells dot the verdant hills and valleys of Indiana County, which were once the heart of coal country. The nearby Little Mahoning is a jewel of the landscape, and the source of Grant’s drinking water for as long as anyone can remember. The creek, which managed to avoid the ravages of the coal industry, remains the thriving home to a variety of fish, freshwater mussels and the largest aquatic salamander in North America.Wanchisn first learned about the proposed wastewater injection well in October 2013, when a member of the local League of Women Voters called her about a public hearing at PGE’s request for a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees wastewater injection under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The company was seeking to convert an old gas well on Grant resident John Yanity’s property into a deep depository for fracking brine. PGE agreed to pay Yanity $20,000 for the rights to use his existing structure, which sits on a triangular piece of grass-covered land abutting the East Mahoning Baptist Church. The company offered Yanity an additional undisclosed amount for every 42-gallon barrel of wastewater it injected, projected to be 30,000 barrels each month. “They’d planned to have the hearing under the radar, but the league got wind of it,” said Wanchisn.Wanchisn began researching injection wells and interviewing experts on the subject. Dan Fisher, a geologist with the Wetstone Solutions environmental consulting firm in Freedom, Pennsylvania, agreed to work up a report on the seismology of the region, since fracking-related operations have been linked to spikes in earthquakes in some parts of the country. He found a fault line within a mile of the defunct well. She also dug through piles of research into wastewater, finding that it commonly includes a mix of chemicals ― benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene ― that have been linked to leukemia, respiratory illness and diseases of the liver, kidney and reproductive organs. Wanchisn presented these findings at the hearing, but officials from the EPA’s regional office and PGE shrugged them off. Another resident expressed her concern that the old well might not hold up under the pounding pressure of disposal, but a PGE representative assured the group that any leak into the town’s aquifer was highly unlikely ― and even if one did occur, layers of rock would contain it. The PGE rep pointed out that his firm’s contract with Yanity allowed the company to use the well as it saw fit. (Yanity did not respond to requests for comment for this story.) Wanchisn reached out to other Grant residents after the hearing. Many had heard nothing of PGE’s plans. Among those who had, some were fearful. “There are a number of people here who used to haul fracking wastewater,” she said. “And they were saying, ‘Oh my god, you don’t want that here.’” They pointed out that a convoy of trucks would rumble through Grant’s narrow roads 12 hours a day, starting at 7 a.m., seven days a week, bringing tanks of wastewater to the disposal site. Despite those concerns, the EPA quickly approved PGE’s permit request. Long and Wanchisn appealed that decision, on the grounds that the issues raised at the hearing had not been “fully and adequately answered.” But the agency rejected their appeal in April 2014, which left PGE with only one more hurdle: It needed a permit from the state’s Department of Environmental Protection to activate the well. Long and Wanchisn realized they needed help to make sure PGE didn’t get that last approval. They summoned their friends and neighbors to form an activist group, which they dubbed the East Run Hellbenders Society after the eastern hellbender, an orange-and-black salamander native to Little Mahoning that has been around for 65 million years. Because it breathes through its skin, the salamander would likely be the first casualty should the creek become contaminated.The Hellbenders then contacted the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit located just two hours away in Mercersburg with a reputation for battling oil and gas producers. Its founder, fiery former EPA researcher Thomas Linzey, put one of his top assistants on the case.The group said Grant’s best chance was passing a local law, an ordinance known as a community bill of rights, to make it illegal to dump wastewater in Grant. Theirs would not be the first ― Pittsburgh famously barred waste injection in 2010 ― but Long and Wanchisn planned to add additional measures to their bill of rights that would also nullify any disposal permits that had already been awarded. “All residents of Grant Township, along with natural communities and ecosystems within the Township, possess the right to clean air, water, and soil, which shall include the right to be free from activities which may pose potential risks to clean air, water, and soil within the Township, including the depositing of waste from oil and gas extraction,” the bill of rights stated.They presented the proposed ordinance to the town’s three-person board of supervisors on June 3, 2014.PGE had apparently gotten word of the Hellbenders’ plans and sent an employee to the meeting as well, who warned that there would be legal action if the town adopted the bill of rights. “They slapped down a sample complaint on the supervisors’ desk and said, ‘Don’t pass this, or you may get sued,’” said Chad Nicholson, the CELDF organizer who worked with Grant. “They tried to intimidate them.” But Grant’s leaders weren’t swayed, and unanimously approved the bill of rights. Two months later, PGE made good on its threat, filing a lawsuit against the township in federal court. Hydraulic fracturing, which was invented in the 1860s, works by firing a highly pressurized stream of water, chemicals and sand into shale and other types of rock to crack it open and free the natural gas trapped inside. The wastewater then gets pumped back to the surface, picking up contaminants like lead, minerals and radium, which is radioactive, as well as petroleum chemicals from drilling machinery. An average well churns through 4.5 million gallons of this brackish broth ― enough to fill seven Olympic-sized swimming pools ― in the two weeks it typically takes to withdraw all the natural gas from a drilling site.Up until the 1980s, untreated fracking wastewater was routinely discarded into public waterways, but concerns about the safety of that practice led the EPA to assume authority to permit, inspect and enforce operations in accordance with amendments to the Clean Water Act. But some states allow treated wastewater to be used in ways that alarm health advocates. For example, Pennsylvania and New York spread brine on wintry roads as a de-icer. In drought-stricken California, farmers have watered crops with it.Municipal sewage treatment plants aren’t set up to handle fracking wastewater, which prompted the EPA to bar oil and gas companies last year from sending their waste there. And custom treatment facilities are expensive and still don’t sufficiently clean the water, according to Environment America and other watchdog groups. In 2013, a Duke University team found elevated levels of radium, chloride and bromide in the Blacklick Creek of Indiana County, downstream from a treatment plant that discharged brine into its waters. This is why drillers and regulators alike have a strong preference for injection wells. In Pennsylvania ― the second largest producer of natural gas after Texas ― there are only seven active deep-injection sites for fracking waste. The state sends most of its wastewater to neighboring Ohio for disposal. (By comparison, Texas has 50,000 injection wells.) Injection wells make sense on some level. Many of the potentially hazardous elements of wastewater come from the soil anyway, industry proponents argue. And drillers employ steel-lined concrete pipes to inject the water, a system meant to prevent brine from seeping into porous rock as it travels thousands of feet below groundwater aquifers, where it’s supposed to remain in perpetual quarantine.But well records and state and federal documents show that leaks, broken pipes and spills plague this process and can contaminate groundwater. Between 2007 and 2010, state environmental agencies cited 1 in 6 disposal wells for “integrity violations,” according to ProPublica, with a total of 17,000 such violations nationwide. For years, the EPA refused to acknowledge that injection wells could pose a public health threat. Then, last December, the agency released a much-anticipated final report that found that the fracking process does, in fact, pollute groundwater. “We found scientific evidence of impacts to drinking water resources at each stage of the hydraulic fracturing water cycle,” said Tom Burke, who was the deputy assistant administrator of the EPA’s office of research and development at the time. Industry lobbyists, however, denounced the EPA’s findings, claiming that reports of contamination were exaggerated and that injection disposal was largely safe.All of this only added to Long and Wanchisn’s determination to keep injection wells out of their town. But the growing controversy over wastewater also fueled PGE’s desire to secure permits and get the well going as quickly as possible. In court filings against the town, PGE claimed that Grant’s ordinance violated its civil rights by impinging on guarantees in the First and 14th amendments, which ensure free speech and equal protection under the law, respectively. The township’s action was “deliberate, arbitrary [and] irrational,” PGE claimed, and “exceeds the limits of governmental authority, amounts to an abuse of official power, and shocks the conscience.” The company’s argument relied on court precedent establishing that corporations are entitled to the same legal protections as individuals — such as in the 2010 Citizens United ruling. PGE’s lawyers asked federal magistrate Judge Susan Paradise Baxter of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to invalidate Grant’s ordinance and order the township to pay damages and cover PGE’s legal bills, an estimated $1 million.The company’s insistence on its constitutional right to inject fracking wastewater gave the Grant activists an idea. If the court could grant companies civil rights, why not ecosystems as well?In a hastily arranged conference call in October 2014, Linzey suggested that maybe they should try to intervene on behalf of the Mahoning watershed ― and offered to represent the creek as a person with a vested interest in the dispute. It was a daring legal gambit, one that asked courts to consider the “rights of nature” as on par with those of humans and corporations. Even most mainstream environmentalists saw it as a tough case to make, though Linzey’s group and others have used similar arguments successfully in Ecuador and India. What he didn’t know was whether this position would work in the U.S. Wanchisn took the conference call in a Pittsburgh hospital room, where her husband Paul had just learned he needed quintuple bypass surgery. Linzey’s enthusiasm tempered the family’s health worries. She and her daughter loved the idea. “My initial concern was for the watershed, anyway,” said Wanchisn. The lawyers felt that the court recognizing the creek as a party ― and thus having civil rights guarantees ― would change the dynamic of the case. So the Hellbenders got to work on a motion to add their group and the Little Mahoning as parties in the case PGE had filed against the township. They also prepared a countersuit against PGE, alleging that in challenging their ordinance, the company was denying Grant residents the right to “community self-government.” In October 2014, however, the DEP quietly approved the PGE’s permit to convert the well, giving the company everything it needed to proceed. Wanchisn and Long fought back. They asked the DEP to investigate whether the PGE permit conformed to guidelines for deep-injection wells as outlined in the state’s Clean Streams Law. Six months later, the DEP revoked the permit, admitting it had not looked into this issue and needed time to do a review.  No one could recall the department ever having canceled a permit previously. Linzey said it was likely because the state had elected a new governor, Democrat Tom Wolf, that November, and he’d taken a tougher stance on drilling activities during the campaign than his predecessor. The change brought PGE’s plans to a halt once again.At that point, the company tried a new tactic: winning over the people. The firm, working with the DEP, arranged for a fresh public hearing, where they hoped to calm the locals and get their project back on track.Wanchisn and Long saw this a new opportunity to drum up public outrage.There was a packed house at the East Run Sportsman Club for the June 1, 2015 hearing. Residents filled rows of metal folding chairs, facing a row of representatives from PGE and the DEP. The company executives began the meeting by explaining how they would build the well and emphasizing how unlikely they thought it was that leaks or groundwater contamination would result.The room was tense. Mark Long, seated in the back of the club, noticed several armed security men ― out-of-towners whom he figured PGE had hired. “I think they were afraid of physical violence,” he said.“What’s in this fracking water?” asked one older man bluntly. A PGE representative assured him that issue was covered by the EPA permit. Others wanted to know about PGE’s record, after finding out the company had been fined $120,500 violations in 2014 ― more than all but eight other oil and gas companies in Pennsylvania. The less information residents got, the louder the rumble of unrest grew. Bill Woodcock, a friend and neighbor to the Longs, inquired about chemicals in the wastewater, mentioning hydrochloric acid, which has been found in fracking waste samples in other states. “Corrosive to flesh,” he announced. Woodcock named another potential contaminant, methanol: “Highly toxic, poisonous to the central nervous system.” The PGE reps remained stone-faced.Sandy Kenner, a Grant resident, rose and glared at them. “If you lived here,” she said, “would you want to have an injection well?”They looked at one another or the floor. “I can tell you that we have 10 professionals reviewing this,” one finally replied.“I want a yes or a no,” Kenner insisted, marching to the front of the room to stand directly in front of the PGE representatives. “I may be a redneck, but I want to hear from each of you.” They declined. Meanwhile, PGE’s lawsuit against the township was slogging along, delayed by vacancies on the federal bench in the district and several reassignments of the case.Baxter finally reached a decision in October 2015, in favor of PGE. “Although defendant wishes it were not so,” Baxter wrote, “the development of oil and gas (which necessarily includes the management of waste materials generated at a well site) is a legitimate business activity and land use within Pennsylvania.” The judge struck down Grant’s ban on extraction waste and rejected Little Mahoning and the Hellbenders as parties to the suit, ruling that their interests were already represented by Grant’s municipal government. Baxter made no statement about whether the watershed could be considered a person. “She punted on that question,” said Linzey.That was good news for Grant, as was the judge’s decision not to award damages or legal fees to PGE ― though her finding that the township had overstepped its authority meant the fracking firm could pursue a monetary judgment later. CELDF quickly filed an appeal.Fortunately for the Hellbenders, they had another plan to stop the well. If there’s one distinguishing aspect of the law in Pennsylvania, it’s a provision set forth by its founding father, William Penn, who in creating a state government worried it might intrude on the rights of small towns. So in 1681, Penn authored a decree that allowed any municipality to establish “home rule” ― to in essence govern itself ― if a majority of residents voted in favor of it. By doing so, a town was entitled to pass any local laws it wanted, so long as they didn’t allow activities specifically prohibited by the state.The state didn’t get around to actually codifying Penn’s proposal until the early 20th century, when lawmakers passed a series of new measures, the latest coming in 1972. That law came with a caveat: Pennsylvania reserved the right to overrule a municipality if it believed a local law unfairly impinged on state interests. Even so, that was Grant’s lifeline. It would not be the first city or town to adopt home rule ― 70 others in Pennsylvania had already done so, including Philadelphia. Wanchisn and Long set out to create a new town charter that would not only give Grant Township broad power to legislate, but also include the wastewater ban and rights to clean air and water they’d outlined in the earlier ordinance that PGE and Baxter had challenged. “They basically told this federal judge, ‘Screw you,’” said Linzey. As a practical matter, their proposed change would challenge the DEP’s authority over well permits in Grant and render Baxter’s ruling moot, since PGE had filed its lawsuit against a township with standing only as an ordinary municipality.Even so, there was uncertainty as to whether Grant’s residents would go for it.Wanchisn and Long knew home rule had a downside: an escalation of the conflict with PGE, one of the county’s bigger employers, at a cost some feared could bankrupt the township. But they got their measure on the ballot for Nov. 3, 2015, and began lobbying residents for support. The two women arrived at Grant’s polling place early on Election Day, setting up a welcome gazebo a permissible distance away to greet a steady flow of voters and ask them to check the home-rule box on their ballot.  “They’re going to inject the waste right between two tributaries,” Wanchisn told one resident, tapping on a homemade posterboard map of Grant with a red dot for every natural gas well in its 27 square miles ― a total of more than 400 wells ― along with a pink circle marking the proposed well site. Thirteen hours later, the Hellbenders got the news they wanted: Home rule passed in a landslide. Of the total 257 ballots cast, 103 people voted for the measure and 25 against. “We screamed and hollered,” said Long. In the year and a half since Grant’s residents approved home rule, the town and PGE have continued to spar in court. Most of the news has not been good for the township and the Hellbenders.A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld Baxter’s decision last summer, siding with her ruling that Grant’s ordinance violated PGE’s civil rights and that the township’s watershed and activists shouldn’t be allowed to join as parties in the case, because their interests were adequately represented.Meanwhile, the DEP re-approved PGE’s permit last month, though it required seismic-reading monitors to be installed to make sure the new well doesn’t cause earthquakes. The DEP also filed its own lawsuit against Grant and another township ― Highland, which had instituted home rule in order to ban injection disposal ― arguing that the state governs fracking waste operations under Pennsylvania’s Oil and Gas Act, not these towns. The suit challenges the idea that home rule can be used to block oil and gas operations. “The state is asking for the courts to validate their own authority since they’ve already issued the permit,” said Linzey. “They’re contending that the home rule charter is invalid because the state has complete control over oil and gas extraction. It’s pitting the state directly against the locality.”The DEP more or less agreed with that assessment. “State law says injection wells are a legal thing and DEP issues permits for them, and home rule says, ‘No, you can’t have them,’” said the agency’s press secretary, Neil Shader. “The reason we filed the petition was really for the court to make a judgment as to which set of laws stand here. We are not trying to retaliate against them for passing this home rule charter.”PGE also asked Baxter to review its damage claims again, and in a March 31 ruling, the judge found PGE is entitled to compensation. Just how much they might get is yet to be decided; the jury trial on that subject awaits.If they lose that case, Long says Grant likely can’t afford to pay. “We’re broke,” she said.A PGE spokeswoman declined to comment on these cases or to make company officials available to be interviewed for this story. “It’s our company policy not to release information with regard to current projects that are in litigation,” said Karen Thomas, vice president of human resources.But the Grant case has clearly struck a nerve.One oil and gas industry advocate has suggested that Grant officials should face criminal charges for “official oppression” in denying PGE’s rights, a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by two years in prison and a $5,000 fine. “[T]hese officials are voting for ordinances that are based on a right to self-government that simply does not exist,” Kevin Moody, general counsel for the Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last fall. “Local governments aren’t sovereigns. They can’t have local constitutions.”Though PGE could start work at the Yanity well any time, Long and Wanchisn aren’t out of options. If construction were to begin, the company would be in violation of Grant’s new charter, and to date, no court has ruled against their home-rule declaration. Linzey is encouraged that Baxter, despite ruling against Grant, twice issued opinions saying that the state’s Oil and Gas Act does not trump the township’s laws.Grant residents, meanwhile, are ready to resist. Last May, the local board of supervisors, which by then included Long, voted to make civil disobedience legal in the town ― a first-of-its-kind law allowing residents to defend the town’s new charter with any “direct action,” as long as it’s not violent. But their fight has gotten a lot bigger than Grant. The battle between the rights of a corporation that wants an injection well and a town that wants to define for itself the rights of its citizens could have implications for other places that have tried to bar fracking-related activities. “Grant is at the forefront of something new that’s exciting,” said Linzey. “They are giving birth to a new movement, to expanding certain civil and political rights. We’re at the core elements of constitutional government, which emphasizes property and commerce above all else. In my opinion, that only changes with revolt. And that’s what Grant is doing.”Whatever new court decisions might come, Long and Wanchisn say they’re not backing down. They recently joined a group of Grant residents in marching onto Yanity’s property to place flowers in his well ― before he called the cops and had them kicked off his land. “Somebody said, ‘This is such a horrible thing. Why don’t you just move?’” said Wanchisn. “But here, you don’t move from the area where you were born and raised.” This story was produced by the Contently Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit for investigative reporting."

Long and Wanchisn appealed that decision, on the grounds that the issues raised at the hearing had not been “fully and adequately answered.” But the agency rejected their appeal in April 2014, which left PGE with only one more hurdle: It needed a permit from the state’s Department of Environmental Protection to activate the well. Long and Wanchisn realized they needed help to make sure PGE didn’t get that last approval. They summoned their friends and neighbors to form an activist group, which they dubbed the East Run Hellbenders Society after the eastern hellbender, an orange-and-black salamander native to Little Mahoning that has been around for 65 million years. Because it breathes through its skin, the salamander would likely be the first casualty should the creek become contaminated.The Hellbenders then contacted the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit located just two hours away in Mercersburg with a reputation for battling oil and gas producers. Its founder, fiery former EPA researcher Thomas Linzey, put one of his top assistants on the case.The group said Grant’s best chance was passing a local law, an ordinance known as a community bill of rights, to make it illegal to dump wastewater in Grant. Theirs would not be the first ― Pittsburgh famously barred waste injection in 2010 ― but Long and Wanchisn planned to add additional measures to their bill of rights that would also nullify any disposal permits that had already been awarded. “All residents of Grant Township, along with natural communities and ecosystems within the Township, possess the right to clean air, water, and soil, which shall include the right to be free from activities which may pose potential risks to clean air, water, and soil within the Township, including the depositing of waste from oil and gas extraction,” the bill of rights stated.They presented the proposed ordinance to the town’s three-person board of supervisors on June 3, 2014.PGE had apparently gotten word of the Hellbenders’ plans and sent an employee to the meeting as well, who warned that there would be legal action if the town adopted the bill of rights. “They slapped down a sample complaint on the supervisors’ desk and said, ‘Don’t pass this, or you may get sued,’” said Chad Nicholson, the CELDF organizer who worked with Grant. “They tried to intimidate them.” But Grant’s leaders weren’t swayed, and unanimously approved the bill of rights. Two months later, PGE made good on its threat, filing a lawsuit against the township in federal court. Hydraulic fracturing, which was invented in the 1860s, works by firing a highly pressurized stream of water, chemicals and sand into shale and other types of rock to crack it open and free the natural gas trapped inside. The wastewater then gets pumped back to the surface, picking up contaminants like lead, minerals and radium, which is radioactive, as well as petroleum chemicals from drilling machinery. An average well churns through 4.5 million gallons of this brackish broth ― enough to fill seven Olympic-sized swimming pools ― in the two weeks it typically takes to withdraw all the natural gas from a drilling site.Up until the 1980s, untreated fracking wastewater was routinely discarded into public waterways, but concerns about the safety of that practice led the EPA to assume authority to permit, inspect and enforce operations in accordance with amendments to the Clean Water Act. But some states allow treated wastewater to be used in ways that alarm health advocates. For example, Pennsylvania and New York spread brine on wintry roads as a de-icer. In drought-stricken California, farmers have watered crops with it.Municipal sewage treatment plants aren’t set up to handle fracking wastewater, which prompted the EPA to bar oil and gas companies last year from sending their waste there. And custom treatment facilities are expensive and still don’t sufficiently clean the water, according to Environment America and other watchdog groups. In 2013, a Duke University team found elevated levels of radium, chloride and bromide in the Blacklick Creek of Indiana County, downstream from a treatment plant that discharged brine into its waters. This is why drillers and regulators alike have a strong preference for injection wells. In Pennsylvania ― the second largest producer of natural gas after Texas ― there are only seven active deep-injection sites for fracking waste. The state sends most of its wastewater to neighboring Ohio for disposal. (By comparison, Texas has 50,000 injection wells.) Injection wells make sense on some level. Many of the potentially hazardous elements of wastewater come from the soil anyway, industry proponents argue. And drillers employ steel-lined concrete pipes to inject the water, a system meant to prevent brine from seeping into porous rock as it travels thousands of feet below groundwater aquifers, where it’s supposed to remain in perpetual quarantine.But well records and state and federal documents show that leaks, broken pipes and spills plague this process and can contaminate groundwater. Between 2007 and 2010, state environmental agencies cited 1 in 6 disposal wells for “integrity violations,” according to ProPublica, with a total of 17,000 such violations nationwide. For years, the EPA refused to acknowledge that injection wells could pose a public health threat. Then, last December, the agency released a much-anticipated final report that found that the fracking process does, in fact, pollute groundwater. “We found scientific evidence of impacts to drinking water resources at each stage of the hydraulic fracturing water cycle,” said Tom Burke, who was the deputy assistant administrator of the EPA’s office of research and development at the time. Industry lobbyists, however, denounced the EPA’s findings, claiming that reports of contamination were exaggerated and that injection disposal was largely safe.All of this only added to Long and Wanchisn’s determination to keep injection wells out of their town. But the growing controversy over wastewater also fueled PGE’s desire to secure permits and get the well going as quickly as possible. In court filings against the town, PGE claimed that Grant’s ordinance violated its civil rights by impinging on guarantees in the First and 14th amendments, which ensure free speech and equal protection under the law, respectively. The township’s action was “deliberate, arbitrary [and] irrational,” PGE claimed, and “exceeds the limits of governmental authority, amounts to an abuse of official power, and shocks the conscience.” The company’s argument relied on court precedent establishing that corporations are entitled to the same legal protections as individuals — such as in the 2010 Citizens United ruling. PGE’s lawyers asked federal magistrate Judge Susan Paradise Baxter of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to invalidate Grant’s ordinance and order the township to pay damages and cover PGE’s legal bills, an estimated $1 million.The company’s insistence on its constitutional right to inject fracking wastewater gave the Grant activists an idea. If the court could grant companies civil rights, why not ecosystems as well?In a hastily arranged conference call in October 2014, Linzey suggested that maybe they should try to intervene on behalf of the Mahoning watershed ― and offered to represent the creek as a person with a vested interest in the dispute. It was a daring legal gambit, one that asked courts to consider the “rights of nature” as on par with those of humans and corporations. Even most mainstream environmentalists saw it as a tough case to make, though Linzey’s group and others have used similar arguments successfully in Ecuador and India. What he didn’t know was whether this position would work in the U.S. Wanchisn took the conference call in a Pittsburgh hospital room, where her husband Paul had just learned he needed quintuple bypass surgery. Linzey’s enthusiasm tempered the family’s health worries. She and her daughter loved the idea. “My initial concern was for the watershed, anyway,” said Wanchisn. The lawyers felt that the court recognizing the creek as a party ― and thus having civil rights guarantees ― would change the dynamic of the case. So the Hellbenders got to work on a motion to add their group and the Little Mahoning as parties in the case PGE had filed against the township. They also prepared a countersuit against PGE, alleging that in challenging their ordinance, the company was denying Grant residents the right to “community self-government.” In October 2014, however, the DEP quietly approved the PGE’s permit to convert the well, giving the company everything it needed to proceed. Wanchisn and Long fought back. They asked the DEP to investigate whether the PGE permit conformed to guidelines for deep-injection wells as outlined in the state’s Clean Streams Law. Six months later, the DEP revoked the permit, admitting it had not looked into this issue and needed time to do a review.  No one could recall the department ever having canceled a permit previously. Linzey said it was likely because the state had elected a new governor, Democrat Tom Wolf, that November, and he’d taken a tougher stance on drilling activities during the campaign than his predecessor. The change brought PGE’s plans to a halt once again.At that point, the company tried a new tactic: winning over the people. The firm, working with the DEP, arranged for a fresh public hearing, where they hoped to calm the locals and get their project back on track.Wanchisn and Long saw this a new opportunity to drum up public outrage.There was a packed house at the East Run Sportsman Club for the June 1, 2015 hearing. Residents filled rows of metal folding chairs, facing a row of representatives from PGE and the DEP. The company executives began the meeting by explaining how they would build the well and emphasizing how unlikely they thought it was that leaks or groundwater contamination would result.The room was tense. Mark Long, seated in the back of the club, noticed several armed security men ― out-of-towners whom he figured PGE had hired. “I think they were afraid of physical violence,” he said.“What’s in this fracking water?” asked one older man bluntly. A PGE representative assured him that issue was covered by the EPA permit. Others wanted to know about PGE’s record, after finding out the company had been fined $120,500 violations in 2014 ― more than all but eight other oil and gas companies in Pennsylvania. The less information residents got, the louder the rumble of unrest grew. Bill Woodcock, a friend and neighbor to the Longs, inquired about chemicals in the wastewater, mentioning hydrochloric acid, which has been found in fracking waste samples in other states. “Corrosive to flesh,” he announced. Woodcock named another potential contaminant, methanol: “Highly toxic, poisonous to the central nervous system.” The PGE reps remained stone-faced.Sandy Kenner, a Grant resident, rose and glared at them. “If you lived here,” she said, “would you want to have an injection well?”They looked at one another or the floor. “I can tell you that we have 10 professionals reviewing this,” one finally replied.“I want a yes or a no,” Kenner insisted, marching to the front of the room to stand directly in front of the PGE representatives. “I may be a redneck, but I want to hear from each of you.” They declined. Meanwhile, PGE’s lawsuit against the township was slogging along, delayed by vacancies on the federal bench in the district and several reassignments of the case.Baxter finally reached a decision in October 2015, in favor of PGE. “Although defendant wishes it were not so,” Baxter wrote, “the development of oil and gas (which necessarily includes the management of waste materials generated at a well site) is a legitimate business activity and land use within Pennsylvania.” The judge struck down Grant’s ban on extraction waste and rejected Little Mahoning and the Hellbenders as parties to the suit, ruling that their interests were already represented by Grant’s municipal government. Baxter made no statement about whether the watershed could be considered a person. “She punted on that question,” said Linzey.That was good news for Grant, as was the judge’s decision not to award damages or legal fees to PGE ― though her finding that the township had overstepped its authority meant the fracking firm could pursue a monetary judgment later. CELDF quickly filed an appeal.Fortunately for the Hellbenders, they had another plan to stop the well. If there’s one distinguishing aspect of the law in Pennsylvania, it’s a provision set forth by its founding father, William Penn, who in creating a state government worried it might intrude on the rights of small towns. So in 1681, Penn authored a decree that allowed any municipality to establish “home rule” ― to in essence govern itself ― if a majority of residents voted in favor of it. By doing so, a town was entitled to pass any local laws it wanted, so long as they didn’t allow activities specifically prohibited by the state.The state didn’t get around to actually codifying Penn’s proposal until the early 20th century, when lawmakers passed a series of new measures, the latest coming in 1972. That law came with a caveat: Pennsylvania reserved the right to overrule a municipality if it believed a local law unfairly impinged on state interests. Even so, that was Grant’s lifeline. It would not be the first city or town to adopt home rule ― 70 others in Pennsylvania had already done so, including Philadelphia. Wanchisn and Long set out to create a new town charter that would not only give Grant Township broad power to legislate, but also include the wastewater ban and rights to clean air and water they’d outlined in the earlier ordinance that PGE and Baxter had challenged. “They basically told this federal judge, ‘Screw you,’” said Linzey. As a practical matter, their proposed change would challenge the DEP’s authority over well permits in Grant and render Baxter’s ruling moot, since PGE had filed its lawsuit against a township with standing only as an ordinary municipality.Even so, there was uncertainty as to whether Grant’s residents would go for it.Wanchisn and Long knew home rule had a downside: an escalation of the conflict with PGE, one of the county’s bigger employers, at a cost some feared could bankrupt the township. But they got their measure on the ballot for Nov. 3, 2015, and began lobbying residents for support. The two women arrived at Grant’s polling place early on Election Day, setting up a welcome gazebo a permissible distance away to greet a steady flow of voters and ask them to check the home-rule box on their ballot.  “They’re going to inject the waste right between two tributaries,” Wanchisn told one resident, tapping on a homemade posterboard map of Grant with a red dot for every natural gas well in its 27 square miles ― a total of more than 400 wells ― along with a pink circle marking the proposed well site. Thirteen hours later, the Hellbenders got the news they wanted: Home rule passed in a landslide. Of the total 257 ballots cast, 103 people voted for the measure and 25 against. “We screamed and hollered,” said Long. In the year and a half since Grant’s residents approved home rule, the town and PGE have continued to spar in court. Most of the news has not been good for the township and the Hellbenders.A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld Baxter’s decision last summer, siding with her ruling that Grant’s ordinance violated PGE’s civil rights and that the township’s watershed and activists shouldn’t be allowed to join as parties in the case, because their interests were adequately represented.Meanwhile, the DEP re-approved PGE’s permit last month, though it required seismic-reading monitors to be installed to make sure the new well doesn’t cause earthquakes. The DEP also filed its own lawsuit against Grant and another township ― Highland, which had instituted home rule in order to ban injection disposal ― arguing that the state governs fracking waste operations under Pennsylvania’s Oil and Gas Act, not these towns. The suit challenges the idea that home rule can be used to block oil and gas operations. “The state is asking for the courts to validate their own authority since they’ve already issued the permit,” said Linzey. “They’re contending that the home rule charter is invalid because the state has complete control over oil and gas extraction. It’s pitting the state directly against the locality.”The DEP more or less agreed with that assessment. “State law says injection wells are a legal thing and DEP issues permits for them, and home rule says, ‘No, you can’t have them,’” said the agency’s press secretary, Neil Shader. “The reason we filed the petition was really for the court to make a judgment as to which set of laws stand here. We are not trying to retaliate against them for passing this home rule charter.”PGE also asked Baxter to review its damage claims again, and in a March 31 ruling, the judge found PGE is entitled to compensation. Just how much they might get is yet to be decided; the jury trial on that subject awaits.If they lose that case, Long says Grant likely can’t afford to pay. “We’re broke,” she said.A PGE spokeswoman declined to comment on these cases or to make company officials available to be interviewed for this story. “It’s our company policy not to release information with regard to current projects that are in litigation,” said Karen Thomas, vice president of human resources.But the Grant case has clearly struck a nerve.One oil and gas industry advocate has suggested that Grant officials should face criminal charges for “official oppression” in denying PGE’s rights, a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by two years in prison and a $5,000 fine. “[T]hese officials are voting for ordinances that are based on a right to self-government that simply does not exist,” Kevin Moody, general counsel for the Pennsylvania Independent Oil & Gas Association, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last fall. “Local governments aren’t sovereigns. They can’t have local constitutions.”Though PGE could start work at the Yanity well any time, Long and Wanchisn aren’t out of options. If construction were to begin, the company would be in violation of Grant’s new charter, and to date, no court has ruled against their home-rule declaration. Linzey is encouraged that Baxter, despite ruling against Grant, twice issued opinions saying that the state’s Oil and Gas Act does not trump the township’s laws.Grant residents, meanwhile, are ready to resist. Last May, the local board of supervisors, which by then included Long, voted to make civil disobedience legal in the town ― a first-of-its-kind law allowing residents to defend the town’s new charter with any “direct action,” as long as it’s not violent. But their fight has gotten a lot bigger than Grant. The battle between the rights of a corporation that wants an injection well and a town that wants to define for itself the rights of its citizens could have implications for other places that have tried to bar fracking-related activities. “Grant is at the forefront of something new that’s exciting,” said Linzey. “They are giving birth to a new movement, to expanding certain civil and political rights. We’re at the core elements of constitutional government, which emphasizes property and commerce above all else. In my opinion, that only changes with revolt. And that’s what Grant is doing.”Whatever new court decisions might come, Long and Wanchisn say they’re not backing down. They recently joined a group of Grant residents in marching onto Yanity’s property to place flowers in his well ― before he called the cops and had them kicked off his land. “Somebody said, ‘This is such a horrible thing. Why don’t you just move?’” said Wanchisn. “But here, you don’t move from the area where you were born and raised.” This story was produced by the Contently Foundation, a New York-based nonprofit for investigative reporting."

His doctors believe he may be the first person with his type of heart condition to complete the famously challenging 26.2-mile race, which he finished in just over 6 hours and 14 minutes.Prario was born with a rare congenital heart defect that prevents the muscle’s fourth chamber from functioning properly, meaning his heart might operate at 75 percent of its capacity or less under stress.“[Doctors] told us that with surgery, Austin could lead a normal life, but that he would never be a varsity athlete or be able to finish something like the Boston Marathon,” Prario’s dad, Dave Prario, told Runner’s World earlier last week.That message didn’t sit well with him. He was determined to have his son cross the Boston Marathon finish line one way or another.In 1998, Dave Prario ran the Boston Marathon to raise money for the Boston Children’s Hospital, which had diagnosed his son just one year earlier. He carried the 1-year-old boy across the finish line while wearing a shirt that read “You gotta have heart!”Austin Prario had a difficult first 18 months of life, undergoing three open heart surgeries that left him with a scar running the length of his chest.Nevertheless, he defied his doctors’ predictions for his life and became an avid athlete and sports fanatic. He ran cross-country in elementary school ― despite losing every race ― and went on to play a few sports in high school. Today, he’s a sophomore at Community College of Rhode Island and an assistant track coach at a local high school.Prario made the decision to follow in his father’s footsteps last summer. His cardiologist OK’d the ambitious endeavor, recommending at least two years of training to prepare. But he didn’t want to wait any longer.Less than a year of training later, Austin has defied all odds. He completed the course by early Monday afternoon before taking another finish line photo next to his dad, who ran the race as a guide for mobility impaired runners.Prario also raised more than $17,000 for Boston Children’s Hospital to honor the doctors who saved his life ― and was 90 percent toward his $20,000 goal as of Monday afternoon.“This is for all the people that said I could do it and for all the people that said I couldn’t,” he told Runner’s World last week. “I only have one life and doctors fixed it to the best of their ability. Why not show them everything I can do with it?”"

Middletown-based state Rep. Candice Keller, who represents Ohio’s 53rd District, posted a meme on her official Facebook page Thursday.“One day we will look at this,” the image reads, with an arrow pointing to the Planned Parenthood logo, “the same way we look back at this” ― with an arrow pointing to a Nazi flag. Keller captioned the meme with one word, “This,” implying her agreement with its message. Many on Twitter were quick to react and call for Ohioans to “vote her out.”Keller defended the post to WKRC, a Cincinnati-based news station.“Just as the Nazis took the lives of millions of innocent people and sold their valuables for profit, Planned Parenthood has done likewise as we have seen in hidden camera videos,” she said in a statement. “Planned Parenthood is a horrific industry that profits from the innocent and the American people should be appalled at their unconscionable activities. They deserve not one more penny of either federal or state monies.”The “hidden camera videos” that Keller mentions were found to be a baseless and misleading smear campaign after a costly and lengthy investigation. In March, the anti-abortion advocates who made the videos were charged with 15 felonies in California for “violating the privacy of health-care providers by recording confidential information without their consent.” On Saturday, Keller tweeted that her Facebook page was not deleted, but put into “unpublished” status. She also said that Facebook is “investigating violations of Community Standards Policy by others.”She told WKRC that the page will be back up and running soon. "

Declan Walsh, the Times’ Cairo bureau chief, on Saturday took issue with Stephens having once described anti-Semitism as the “disease of the Arab mind.” “Not cool,” Walsh tweeted in reference to a line Stephens wrote in an August column for the Wall Street Journal.In that column, Stephens argued that an Egyptian athlete refusing to shake hands with his Israeli counterpart at the Olympics was indicative of the “long-abiding and all-consuming hatred of Israel” in the Arab world.Stephens probably wouldn’t have caused much controversy, then or now, if he had gone on to argue that anti-Semitism is prevalent, even pervasive, in the Arab world. But he wrote that the Olympics incident demonstrated “the disease of the Arab mind.” Stephens responded to criticism at the time by saying he used the word “mind” as a “figure of speech, not biology.” But the conservative columnist’s “Arab mind” characterization has been given a second life since he landed the high-profile position at the Times on Wednesday. And Stephens defended that eight-month-old column on Saturday in tweets to Walsh. “That’s a fair point,” Walsh responded. “Ascribing a pathological condition to an entire race of people is not.”“Which the column doesn’t do, except in a tendentious reading of it,” Stephens tweeted, adding that “readers can judge for themselves.”But the Times’ “Interpreter” columnist Max Fisher also expressed concern with the line. Opinion writers are never going to please everyone. But it’s unusual for Times staffers on the news side to publicly challenge the work of a new hire in the opinion section. And specifically, the two Times staffers’ criticism with Stephens’ writing stemmed not from a political viewpoint, but from whether the language he used to make it was acceptable. Meanwhile, the most persistent criticism of Stephens outside the Times has been that his views on climate change are outside the realm of responsible discourse. At the Wall Street Journal, Stephens called global warming a “mass neurosis” and declared it “dead” two years later. He has mocked liberals’ concerns over climate change, which he has dubbed an “imaginary enemy.” On television, he has dismissed the “the so-called ‘consensus science’ of global warming.”The Times editorial board, by comparison, argued last month that the “rock-solid scientific consensus” on climate change demands “swift action.”Times editorial page editor James Bennet told The Huffington Post on Friday that Stephens is not a “climate denialist,” as he’s been described by some critics. In a statement to HuffPost, Stephens identified himself as a “climate agnostic.”“To pretend like the views of a thinker like Bret, and the millions of people who agree with him on a range of issues, should simply be ignored, that they’re outside the bounds of reasonable debate, is a really dangerous form of delusion,” Bennet said. But Joe Romm, the editor of ThinkProgress’s “Climate Progress” vertical, responded Saturday by saying that certain views should be dismissed, even if they’re shared by millions. “With that ‘logic,’ the Times could hire as a columnist former Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke — or a flat earther or someone who thinks vaccines pose a health hazard,” Romm wrote. “After all, millions agree with them.”"

So there you go.,2017-04-17,"Alec Baldwin played Bill O'Reilly in a recent episode of ""Saturday Night Live."" ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f4fb9f2600003600c460b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An overwhelming majority of Bill O’Reilly’s viewers still approve of the controversial Fox News pundit despite a rising tide of sexual harassment allegations against him, according to a HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted over the weekend.Slightly more than 85 percent of Americans polled who sometimes or regularly watch “The O’Reilly Factor” say they’re aware of the recent controversy surrounding its host. Earlier this month, a New York Times investigation revealed that five women who had accused O’Reilly of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior over the past 15 years received a combined $13 million to settle their claims. The alleged behavior included verbal abuse, unwelcome sexual advances and calls in which O’Reilly could be heard masturbating over the phone.Most “O’Reilly Factor” viewers are unfazed: 65 percent hold a favorable view of O’Reilly, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. Just 17 percent say they think his show should be canceled in light of the controversy. Among Republican viewers, only 9 percent want to see the show canceled.A man accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women now sits in the White House, so perhaps O’Reilly’s continued popularity isn’t too surprising. Among respondents who said they watch “The O’Reilly Factor” sometimes or regularly, 60 percent are men, 66 percent lean or identify as Republican and 52 percent voted for President Donald Trump. The ratings for O’Reilly’s primetime show have been strong throughout the controversy, and his new book, Old School ― about “old school” values ― is at No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list.Other things have gone less well for O’Reilly since the Times bombshell. More than 50 companies have pulled advertising from his show. Dr. Wendy Walsh, a former guest on the show, accused him of retaliating against her after she turned down his sexual advances. Parent company 21st Century Fox has launched an internal investigation, conducted by an outside law firm, into O’Reilly’s behavior.O’Reilly is currently on vacation as Fox executives reportedly ponder his fate. He’s scheduled to return next week. The 67-year-old earns a salary of $18 million a year and his show brought in $178 million in advertising revenue in 2015, according to one estimate. “The O’Reilly Factor” has been the most popular cable news show for years, with around 3 million viewers.In other words, paying out a few million to the women who say O’Reilly harassed them worked just fine for Fox for more than a decade.But the accusations against O’Reilly’s have other costs. Companies send a strong signal to their employees ― and the world ― when they continue to defend men against a preponderance of sexual harassment charges: We don’t really care how you’re treated here. It’s similar to what O’Reilly himself said last year when his boss, Roger Ailes, was facing a raft of harassment allegations. “If you don’t like what’s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave,” he told viewers. Of course, women are unlikely to go to the human resources department to complain about the CEO ― the man who runs the HR department. Journalist Megyn Kelly abandoned her perch at Fox partly because of these comments from O’Reilly, The New York Times reported this weekend. She was instrumental in Ailes’ ouster and was fighting for women inside the company to come forward with their stories, but reportedly thought O’Reilly’s remarks would discourage them.Ailes was ultimately ousted, receiving a $40 million severance from Fox. Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox host who accused him of harassment and sparked his removal, received a reported $20 million.The move was considered a victory for women. But paying the accused harasser twice as much as the accuser sends a slightly less positive message.

He defended 15-year-old patient Justina Pelletier when many feared she’d be killed due to malpractice by Boston Children’s Hospital doctors. More information about him is available on FreeMartyG.com as well as the FreeMartyG Facebook page and @FreeMartyG Twitter account. A teenage girl ends up admitted to a psych ward at a leading children’s hospital, but her psychiatrists come to believe her problems aren’t mental. Instead, they become convinced she’s “being influenced by, speaking with, and being hurt by evil spiritual entities.” They consult with the hospital chaplain, give the girl a cross to wear, and one of them brings her to his church. Does this sound like real life, or a B-movie cross between The Exorcist and One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest? Well, if you answered real life, pat yourself on the back.According to the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine, a year before the now infamous Pelletier case, another misdiagnosis was made by mental health doctors at the renowned research hospital; a spiritual one. In the Pelletier case, a physical diagnosis was incorrectly challenged by doctors, parents were falsely reported to state authorities for child abuse, and stripped of custody. It resulted in their daughter being locked in the psych ward and kept from her family, religious practices, as well as the medications she actually needed for the actual disorder that she actually has. However this earlier case was nearly the polar opposite. Instead, a mentally ill teenager was apparently misdiagnosed by a group of three hospital psychiatrists as “possessed.” Rather than obeying the law by informing social services that they had been told the girl’s mother pushed her down a flight of stairs and tried to strangle her, one of the mental health M.D.s appointed himself her “spiritual mentor.” He took the girl to his church, and even let her sleep over at his home. Also, unlike the highly publicized Pelletier scandal, this earlier incident barely made a media blip at the time, even in the local papers. According to state documents, available here and here, it started when Boston Children’s attending psychiatrist Dr. Raymond Kam began going to sessions with the girl and a psychiatry fellow who had been having a hard time getting her to open up. She appeared more talkative with Kam around, and the doctor started to believe her condition had spiritual aspects to it. So, Kam began talking about the case with people from his church. Eventually, the girl was locked in the psych ward, and while she was there, after meeting with her alone, Kam began believing the spiritual component of her condition was more and more significant. He shared this view with both the senior attending psychiatrist on the case, Dr. Enrico Mezzacappa, as well as the psychiatry fellow, and all three agreed there could be spiritual aspects to the girl’s condition. However, while Mezzacappa did compliment Kam for having the courage to come forward with the unusual spiritual diagnosis, the senior attending also noted that not all doctors “would entertain” such a possibility. So, Kam, the psychiatry fellow (who isn’t named in the state documents), and Mezzacappa kept it to themselves, neither notifying other physicians nor recording their beliefs in hospital logs and records. While she was in the psych ward, Dr. Kam eventually gave the patient a cross, in exchange for a different, undisclosed religious symbol she had been wearing, perhaps a Star of David. The day after that, he apparently decided her problems weren’t in any way psychiatric at all, and announced he was taking himself off the case. Subsequently, the three doctors seem to have agreed that Dr. Kam would take on the role of being the girl’s “spiritual mentor.” He began operating under the notion she was “being influenced by, speaking with, and being hurt by evil spirits,” and that the “conditions were not psychiatric in nature but were caused by evil spirits.” Mezzacappa told Kam to seek a consultation for the girl with Kam’s own church, and also directed and introduced Kam to the hospital chaplain for the same purpose. Following the girl’s discharge from the psych ward, Kam exchanged text messages “of a personal nature” with her. He also indeed took the girl to his church and met with his own assistant minister as well as the hospital chaplain to develop a “plan to address” her spiritual issues, which at least sounds a bit like an exorcism.When she told him her father had kicked her out and she had nowhere to sleep at night, Kam and his wife invited her to spend some nights at their house, and when she reported that her mother pushed her down a flight a stairs and tried to asphyxiate her, he failed to notify authorities, as required by state law. Though Mezzacappa was aware of the girl’s situation, he too failed to make the required report to social services. When all of this eventually came to light, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine suspended Kam from practicing and reprimanded Mezzacappa. Both were sanctioned for failing to report the alleged abuse, but also for engaging in conduct that undermines the public’s confidence in medicine. While Kam was fired before the board’s decision though, Mezzacappa continued in his role as a senior attending. BCH said his reprimand “does not affect his ability to practice at Boston Children’s Hospital and he remains a member in good standing in the Department of Psychiatry.” Ironically, the state board required Kam to undergo a psychiatric evaluation himself in order to get his license back. This case is a stark reminder that while Boston Children’s enjoys a stellar reputation as a whole, individual or even small groups of practitioners there still engage in inappropriate and decidedly unscientific behavior. Like the Pelletier scandal, this incident involved the cooperation of multiple hospital physicians and is especially relevant, as here too they were mental health professionals. Many people are dubious that a few such doctors could evade hospital oversight or so largely escape meaningful consequences for such behavior. However perhaps the most surprising aspect common to both otherwise inverted cases is that the majority of the doctors responsible for the two debacles continued to practice at Boston Children’s Hospital afterwards. If you ran BCH, might you have done something more? Perhaps if someone had, Justina Pelletier wouldn’t have lost the use of her legs a year later. "
50,WOMEN,"Yes, I Can Be A Zionist And A Feminist","Andrea Cantor , ContributorStudent at Sarah Lawrence College",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-double-standards-of-anti-zionism-and-sexism_us_58f410a9e4b04cae050dc8ac,I am tired of people pitting my identities against one another.,2017-04-17,<p>A side-by-side of Mayim Bialik (left) and Linda Sarsour (right).</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f416ed2600001400c45f16.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Linda Sarsour, the Palestinian-American political activist, expressed back in March how feminists need to care for Palestinian women, and alluded to the sentiment that Zionism and feminism are incompatible. Sarsour said to The Nation, “It just doesn’t make any sense for someone to say, ‘Is there room for people who support the state of Israel and do not criticize it in the movement?’ There can’t be in feminism. You either stand up for the rights of all women, including Palestinians, or none. There’s just no way around it.”Big Bang Theory actress and Orthodox Jew, Mayim Bialik, retaliated by writing an article for Grok Nation, which outlined how Sarsour’s statements were not only offensive, but also false. Bialik wrote on her Facebook page, where she also apologized for making it seem as though Sarsour directly said that Zionism and feminism are incompatible, “[The] conversation surrounding Zionism finally went too far for me to keep my big mouth shut.” Bialik vocalized her frustrations, and now I am following suit. I am tired of the discrimination against my people and of activists, such as Sarsour, who think they can pit my identity as both a Zionist and feminist against each other.The headline-making feud between Sarsour and Bialik made me start to think about the correlation between my feminism and my support of Israel. Zionism is the belief that Jews have the right to a state, just as feminism is the right to equality. But both definitions have been shanghaied by anti-Semitic and misogynistic rhetoric. This is where I realized that the ways in which people express anti-Zionism are very much alike to sexism.My stances with Israel are not straightforward, because sociopolitical realities are complex. As a liberal Zionist I do not support Likud or Netanyau, just as I do not support Trump. But as a Jew, I was raised to love my Jewish homeland and to appreciate it as the only true sanctuary for my people. My view is further complicated because as an academic I praise the country for being the only democracy in the Middle East. Most importantly for me, as a feminist, I value Israel for its progressive stances on women’s and LGBTQIA’s rights.As a Zionist and a feminist my stances have been relegated to black and white understandings, leaving me a blank canvas for others to picture me. Once people at my liberal arts college, Sarah Lawrence, discovered the dark truth that I do not despise Israel, I was labeled as a Zionist-extremist. Similarly, as a female, I am labeled as a slut or prude, dumb or overbearing—the latter being when they realize I have a brain. It is this labeling of my Zionism and of my womanhood that reduces the beauty of belief to something ugly and untrue.Beyond the labels themselves, it is the mindset behind them that is disturbing. It is as though they are created in a moral-complex vacuum, which only spouts double standards but refuses to take in any insight. If a woman speaks her mind she is considered angry, whereas a man is deemed intelligent and forthright. Similarly, Israel is constantly under threat of destruction by surrounding countries, but Israel is seen as the Goliath perpetrator.The Israel-Palestine conflict cannot be reduced to good and evil. This is not to relegate the human rights violations that have occurred, but to contextualize them. We are dealing with Likud, a right-winged government, and Hamas, a UN recognized terrorist regime. I am critical of the government just as I am with most current countries. But Israel is more than a government. It is a country that allows trans people into the army, has Arab women representation in government, and maintains women’s rights, such as education, in their legislature.It is absurd, especially when one looks to any country North, South, East, or West of Israel and understands their human rights violations, that I am told my feminism and Zionism are incompatible. Our allegiances should be with the people—both Israeli and Palestinian—and not focused on demonizing either, that is unless we demonize the entire Middle East for their relatively greater human rights violations. People call Israel an ethnic cleansing, apartheid state but Israel has a more diverse population than its surrounding countries and, unlike South Africa apartheid, has laws of nondiscrimination within its constitution. Yes, racism exists within Israel, as it does in most parts of the world. But singling out the Jewish State above the rest shows how these double standards are a projection of anti-Semitism as opposed to true concern for the people.To be a feminist is to accept that women have a choice. Bialik said on her Facebook page,“And the slow - and not-so-slow - forcing out of liberal Jews from our own political identification as liberals is the most divisive, un-American, un-feminist, disturbing turn of events in my life as a liberal Zionist.” Sarsour should reevaluate her feminism, because as it stands right now, she excludes and outcasts a large portion of liberal Zionist women. I would implore Sarsour to widen her lens to the Jewish women, a group of people that are a speck of the population on this planet.The Jewish people have been through a history of oppression and discrimination, and yet, despite people like Sarsour, we are still here. Just as I should have the right to choose what is right for my body, I should have the right to choose what is right for my mind. I choose the Jewish state and my fellow women—no incompatibility found."

Watmough, European University Institute; Ahmet Erdi Öztürk, Université de Strasbourg; David Tittensor, Deakin University, and Ihsan Yilmaz, Deakin UniversityUnofficial results from Turkey’s April 16 constitutional referendum show that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has won the right to expand presidential power. The “yes” campaign has won 51.37% of the votes while “no” has secured 48.63%, with 99.45% of ballots counted. The electoral board has declared a victory for the former but the country’s two main opposition parties are challenging the results, demanding a recount of 60% of the votes. Official results are expected in 11 to 12 days.Erdoğan can now create an executive presidency that will make him the head of state and head of government, ending the country’s current parliamentary political system. The changes could mean that Erdoğan retains power until 2029 in the highly divisive country that has been further polarised in the run-up to the referendum.The Conversation Global asked scholars what they made of the results and what lies ahead for Turkey.Ihsan Yilmaz, Professor & Research Chair in Islamic Studies and Intercultural Dialogue at Deakin UniversityDespite controlling 90% of media coverage, using all sorts of stick-and-carrot mechanisms via the state, imprisoning the leaders and parliamentarians of Turkey’s third-largest party and more than 200 hundred journalists, Erdoğan could not get a clear win. He has reached the limits of his electoral power and, in the 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections, he may lose all power. But, as this referendum has shown once more, he is not prepared to lose and electoral fraud will likely take place in 2019. Despite the clearly-worded law that was enacted in 2010 upon the request of the ruling Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (AKP), which Erdoğan co-founded, the High Electoral Board made a last-minute change that validated 1.5 million unstamped ballots. The margin between the “yes” and “no” votes is less than this figure. The opposition is contesting the result and Erdoğan’s first speech shows he is concerned that the international community may not accept the results as legitimate.Instead of bringing stability, the referendum has divided the already polarised country further. Secularist and Westernised sections of society (about 30% of the population) hate the AKP. Around 15% of the country’s non-Sunni Muslims (Alevis), who have a hybrid faith of Shia Islam, Turcoman Shamanism and Anatolian Sufism, are afraid that a Salafised, increasingly Sunni-ist AKP will crush them. And the majority of Turkey’s Kurds (around 20% of the population) who voted “no” will never vote in favour of Erdoğan and AKP. Turkey’s fault lines have deepened and the now undemocratic country, without EU membership aspirations, is no longer unified – if it ever was. Erdoğan is left with around 45% to 50% of a coalition of conservative, Turkish nationalist and practicing Muslim voters. Even many of those who voted for him for economic reasons may prefer a potential centre-right party if it can be established. Erdoğan cannot blame the country’s forthcoming economic troubles on the “no” vote as he won. So he is likely to do two things. First, he may continue to suppress Kurdish dissidents and start seriously crushing the secularist sections (White Turks) in addition to Alevis. The anti-Gulenist witch hunt and leftist purges will continue. The AKP will be Erdoğanised further and party heavy weights, such as Abdullah Gul (former foreign minister, prime minister and president and AKP co-founder); Bulent Arinc (former deputy prime minister and speaker of the parliament, and AKP co-founder); Ahmet Davutoglu (former foreign minister and prime minister) and their affiliates now face the prospect being purged and even imprisonment. Potential rivals, all were sidelined by Erdoğan and did not vote for the “yes” campaign.Second, in order to entice Nationalist Movement Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi) and Islamist Saadet Party voters who did not vote in his favour, Erdoğan could increase the volume of his anti-Western and pro-Islamist rhetoric, coupled with some actions along the lines of opening the Hagia Sophia museum as a mosque, declaring his caliphate, bringing back the death penalty, giving up Council of Europe membership and ending the EU membership process once and for all. He is likely to continue to demonise European countries and will try to get full US support for his undemocratic regime. To secure that, he may well try to deepen his relations with Russia. Buying Russian missiles is one of the options.Turkey was never a fully democratic country but there were hopes that it could become one. The April 16 referendum showed decisively that Erdoğan will not allow free and democratic elections, independent media and judiciary. Simon. P. Watmough, postdoctoral researcher in international relations and comparative politics at European University Institute:Despite a threatened challenge to results from Turkey’s opposition groups, it is clear that President Erdoğan has eked out a narrow victory in the April 16 constitutional referendum. Make no mistake: this win marks a turning point in Turkey’s political development. Turks have narrowly voted to end their own democratic system and Turkey’s slide into “electoral authoritarianism” has been cemented. The result will see all executive power centralised in the hands of one man, an unprecedented degree of control not seen since Turkey’s period of military rule in the early 1980s.In the short run, it is clear that Erdoğan will use this opportunity to strengthen his grip on the state and attempt to advance his vision of a New Turkey. But in the longer term, things may not be nearly as bleak for dissent and political pluralism as they appear at present. Despite his victory, there are distinct chinks in Erdoğan’s armour. For one thing, there is a deep tradition of political pluralism and competitive partisanship in Turkey that will not simply evaporate now that Erdoğan is an executive president. The extremely narrow win for “yes” shows that Turkey is deeply polarised and that there is only the slenderest majority in support of this transition. Half the country is ready to oppose Erdoğan. These factors are likely to underpin a galvanising of political opposition parties in Turkey, particularly the Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi (Nationalist Movement Party) but also the Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (People’s Republican Party). They will regroup and organise for dissent, prepared to take advantage of any weakness that presents in the president’s standing.Turkey’s electorate has shown remarkable support for Erdoğan and the AKP (Justice and Development Party), which he co-founded, during the long period of economic growth between 2002 and 2015. But economic storm clouds are gathering on the horizon. With the economic tide turning, the chances of the country experiencing an economic crisis – as has so often been the case in the past – has increased. A debt crisis and economic collapse could be the trigger for widespread social and political mobilisation against Erdoğan’s New Turkey project.Ahmet Erdi Öztürk, research assistant in the Faculty of Law, Social Science and History at the University of Strasbourg: It is fair to say that Turkey is divided in regard to the results of the referendum. Even though we don’t have the official results yet, it is obvious that the “yes” votes are narrowly leading despite the “no” vote being ahead in the country’s biggest cities – İstanbul, Ankara and İzmir. It should be noted though that, despite allegations of serious vote rigging, blunders by the High Election Council and strong evidence of undemocratic practices in the run up, the race was very tight. The main opposition party has objected and this means that even if the result remains “yes” after official results are declared, this will be one of the most debated elections of Turkey. Erdoğan has been controlling the state apparatus for a long time now and would have disallowed any result other than “yes”. While Erdoğan supporters may see the results as the official kick-off of the “New Turkey” era, their enthusiasm may be premature.First of all, the results show that polarisation in Turkey has reached its peak. While half of the population is willing to deliver power to Erdoğan, the rest are strongly standing against him and his authoritarian and pro-Islamic policies. Second, with the results, Erdoğan has indeed constitutionalised the one-man rule, but it is also crystal clear that the educated classes and young generations will still fight him in the months to come. And it might not be as easy for him to run the country with his previous authoritarian habits. In this regard and against general belief, the result of the referendum is not an end; it is the start of a new era of struggle between pro-Erdoğanists and the rest for the country. David Tittensor, Lecturer in Studies of Religion at Deakin UniversityTurkey has, unsurprisingly, voted yes in the referendum to grant President Erdoğan sweeping new powers that includes issuing decrees and the appointment of judges and officials who will scrutinise his decisions. It’s unsurprising because the vote took place in a state of emergency following mass purges that began even before the July 15 2016 failed coup attempt. Erdoğan and his party waged an aggressive campaign that involved intimidating the opposition. Erdoğan regularly stated that those who vote “no” are terrorist supporters, and limiting the airtime for opponents. And, of course, there are allegations of vote tampering. But in spite of all these tactics the outcome has been far from resounding, with the “yes” vote reportedly only narrowly carrying the day. This indicates that there is still staunch opposition to Erodğan’s “one-man rule” and that the further repression that is likely to follow more centralised government will not lead to promised stability. A more likely outcome is the stoking of further disunity in an already highly polarised society, which will be amplified by the serious challenges that Turkey currently faces. These include the Syrian refugee crisis, two terrorism campaigns waged by Kurdish insurgents and ISIS, and the Syrian war. While Erdoğan has achieved his aim of using democracy, which he once famously described as a bus one eventually disembarks from when the desired stop is reached, the road ahead looks far from smooth.Simon P.

Shane Harris, National Action Network San Diego President </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f440c114000029001b4923.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Inner cities across the country have been getting hit with a duplicitous economic combination. They are getting hit with the overhand right jab of an inequitable share of public sector contracts and the lethal left hook of exclusion from workforce participation with the companies that do get the contracts. This combination has helped to economically knock out and lock out communities of color.An egregious example of this resurfaced during the “State of Economic Opportunity in San Diego” Forum hosted by National Action Network San Diego President Reverend Shane Harris. During the session, the National Black Contractors Association revealed 2013 data showing that there were only 36 African American workers out of 2,066 on city funded construction projects, with most companies not having any Blacks at all.This may be just the tip of a larger iceberg of economic exclusion and disparity. Elected officials need to be pressed to find the updated data, pull it out, dust it off, publicize it, and explain it. They should be talking about the numbers and attention should be placed on the fact that this is information is not common knowledge. The masses need to know.Given the economic conditions of urban communities in cities across the country, every speech that politicians representing these communities in San Diego and other cities give should contain data on what percentage of jobs and contracts and jobs are going to whom.This explicit approach is needed to deal with the economic crisis in urban America. We are past the time of fooling ourselves into believing that the kumbaya method is going to work. Elected officials and power brokers must be pressed and held accountable. We are past the time of just being happy with incremental change. We need to call a timeout on the days of celebrating for years about getting two or three people hooked up. Incremental change will not suffice.The data is too drastic in many communities and the conditions are too severe. There must be a sense of urgency. A policy monopoly has dominated the distribution of public sector contracts and resources in most cities. Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones consider a policy monopoly to be a fairly closed and concentrated system of a few important actors in policy making. Such a monopoly has an interest in keeping policy making closed, because a closed system benefits the interests of those in the monopoly.There must be a concentrated effort to bust open policy monopolies that have helped to control and destabilize the economic conditions of working class and poor communities. There should be an ongoing discussion about how communities can affect the levers of government to alter the current distribution of jobs, contracts, and other resources.Entry points into gainful employment should be highlighted and created for all of those who are currently blocked by formal and informal structures. Elected officials need to make the data on workforce participation and contracts plain to their constituents every chance they get and it should be demanded of them.There is need for a revival of interest in these disparities in order to bring the issues of economic justice to the forefront. The root of a great deal of violence and substance abuse in urban communities is financial frustration and hopelessness. Many crimes are committed not just out of moral bankruptcy, but also out of economic desperation. The public policy making process should be opened up to a broader population. Casting a vote every two and four years cannot be the extent of wide public participation in the political process.Many politicians seem to have gotten comfortable with the status quo and fear no harm from an organized vote. If communities don’t start holding even their favorite politicians accountable for monitoring and moving the numbers on contracts and workforce participation then minority communities are destined to be a permanent underclass.Marcus Bright, Ph.D. is a Scholar and Activist"

The winners get a gooey, cheesy feast.In the South Texas town of Mission, pizza parties have long gone to the top-performing elementary, middle school and high school classrooms in a district-wide Food Drive Challenge benefitting local food pantries.That is, until this year.As part of an overhaul of the health and wellness value in everything they do, school district leaders realized that what seemed like simple, harmless fun isn’t so harmless. One less greasy, salty meal is a good thing, of course. But the real aim of the change in Texas is rewiring the thought process. Unhealthy foods can no longer be dangled as prizes.Best of all, their new prize is something active.A few weeks ago, this year’s winners received a bowling party – without traditional bowling alley grub, of course.Kids loved it. Adults, too. Just like that, a new tradition began.Swapping a few slices of pizza for a few games of bowling won’t cure childhood obesity or diabetes, the rates of which are especially high in the Rio Grande Valley. But a turnaround must start somewhere. Small steps like these move the district, the school, the classes and – most importantly – the students in the right direction.The Mission Consolidated Independent School District is a becoming a leader in the fight to improve the health of our next generation.A few years ago, superintendent Ricardo Lopez made this a priority. His team began working with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, an organization dedicated to reducing childhood obesity and empowering kids to develop lifelong, healthy habits. I’m proud to say the Alliance began as a partnership between my organization, the American Heart Association, and the Clinton Foundation. In a short span, the results in Mission are quite fantastic.All 22 traditional schools in the district have earned bronze, silver or gold status from the Alliance’s Healthy Schools Program. Only a handful of districts in the country can boast honors for 100 percent of their campuses, a feat that’s even more impressive considering the socioeconomic challenges in Mission.“This is extremely encouraging, especially for people like me who have been doing this for 25 years,” said Howell Wechsler, EdD, MPH, the Chief Executive Officer of the Alliance who previously served as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Director of the Division of Adolescent and School Health. “It always stems from great local leadership – boots-on-the-ground, high achievers who go out and get things done.”Everyone wants kids to be healthy, and schools are a natural place for them to learn how. The school day sets up perfectly to offer nutritional meals, lessons about healthy eating and opportunities to be active.However, school administrators must balance those aims against other priorities. The reality is, setting aside time for anything but academics can set themselves up for second-guessing, especially if standardized test scores fail to dazzle.But academics and health don’t have to be an either-or proposition. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Boosting health can boost academic performance.Studies show that students who eat healthy meals and remain active are better learners. Pausing an academic session for as little as 30 seconds of jumping jacks can energize young minds, making them more likely to absorb the rest of the lesson. (It’s not just young minds; try adding mini-activity in the midst of a long effort and see if it boosts your attention level.)Small changes can have a big impact. For instance, schools that move recess to immediately before lunch find that kids arrive hungry and eat more. Think about it: when recess follows lunch, kids are more likely to dump their tray quickly to get more time on the playground.Some moves may bring backlash, but they’re worth it, such as finding healthier alternatives to cakes and cookies for birthday and holiday celebrations, selling something other than sweets for fundraisers and, of course, replacing pizza parties with something fun and active. (Another example: Many schools are hosting 5K races as fundraisers.)Best practices are readily available. In addition to the Alliance, the CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are eager to help.Now is a great time, too.Through May 5, the Alliance and Voices for Healthy Kids — an initiative powered by the AHA and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation — are running the Wellness Wins campaign to celebrate success stories and to ensure that schools are meeting national requirements.Since 2004, districts participating in federal school meals programs have been required to establish wellness policies. Those requirements were boosted in 2010, but confusion followed about what to do, who should do it and how to maintain the policies.Last summer, the USDA clarified those issues by issuing a final rule. The USDA also required districts to meet the requirements by June 30. Many district have been working on this all year, but if any are lagging or need a push, this campaign is a reminder that many resources and supports are available to help.“Our message is, `Don’t be afraid of these changes,’” Wechsler said. “You can do this. And it’s going to be a great success.”One worthy of a bowling party."

While rising unrest in Belarus is unlikely to result in the near-term displacement of Lukashenka’s hold on power or a marked pro-Western shift in Minsk’s foreign policy, it is clear that Belarusians are critically evaluating their political system and international alignments to a greater degree that at any other time in recent history. To understand the historical underpinnings of Belarus’s shifting domestic politics and international identity, I interviewed Belarus’s first president, Stanislav Shushkevich, during his visit to the University of Oxford on March 28. During our interview, Shushkevich reflected on Belarus’s transition towards consolidated authoritarianism, Minsk’s increasingly tentative embrace of Eurasian integration, and his visions for Belarus’s post-Lukashenka political future. One striking takeaway from my discussion with Shushkevich was his belief in the immutability of the Belarusian political identity. Shushkevich had previously highlighted his thoughts on Belarus’s authoritarian trajectory in his 2002 book entitled Neo-communism in Belarus: Ideology, Practices and Perspectives. In our interview, he lamented the lack of political change in the fifteen years that followed this seminal work on Belarusian politics. Shushkevich attributed Belarus’s predilection towards authoritarianism to cultural characteristics formulated during the Soviet era. He argued that Belarus developed more effective governance structures than most other Soviet republics due to the hard-working nature of the Belarusian people. This emphasis on achievement at any cost had pernicious long-term consequences, as it caused Belarusians to ignore the importance of political processes. This neglect hindered Belarus’s ability to transition towards democracy, like Ukraine and the Baltic states. The pervasiveness of Soviet culture in contemporary Belarus has also contributed to authoritarian persistence. During our interview, Shushkevich recalled an old Soviet joke that “Belarusians were more Soviet than Russians.” Belarus’s commitment to the Soviet state was highlighted by its willingness to proportionally sacrifice more troops during the 1980-88 Soviet War in Afghanistan than any other Soviet nationality. The Belarusian political establishment’s retention of ex-communist nomenklatura members ensured that this ideological fervor endured after the USSR’s demise in 1991. As Belarusian communist elites maintained close links with Moscow, the Belarusian people had comparatively few political grievances, and were willing to maintain the status quo with little backlash. This tacit acceptance of authoritarianism prevented high-level Belarusian policymakers from implementing radical reforms. Shushkevich noted that his prestigious job within the political establishment deterred him from joining reform movements and made him almost unaware of their existence. But eventually, Shushkevich recognized that reformists were contributing many positive ideas that would advance Belarus’s prospects of national resurrection. The reform of higher education was an area that was of particular interest to the Belarusian People’s Front, though disagreements on the best way to revitalize Belarus’s economy and institutions continued to prevail in the years that followed. This lack of consensus ensured that reformist groups were ineffective in converting their ideas into the implementation of actual reforms. Political apathy also undercut democratic consolidation in Belarus. Shushkevich joked that when he first entered presidential politics, he told his colleagues that he would withdraw his nomination, but he never did and was elected. When Shushkevich took office, his experience in the Soviet system left him more prepared to deal with Belarus’s political challenges than the Belarusian People’s Front, who in his view had “failed to realize that state-building was a prerequisite for national revival.” Shushkevich realized that ex-nomenklatura members should not be chastised for being communist, as embracing communism was often not their ideological choice but an unfortunate consequence of a political environment that did not tolerate dissent. Shushkevich’s attempts to explain this political reality to more radical reformist groups fell on deaf ears. By the time the next elections began in Belarus, 30 candidates had entered the field with Shushkevich staying above the political fray as an independent. Belarusian reformists’ refusal to listen to Shushkevich’s advice on how to be elected proved costly. Their resounding defeat ensured that Belarus would embrace Alexander Lukashenka, a populist authoritarian leader who swiftly dismantled Belarus’s fragile democratic institutions. The Belarusian People’s Front’s ability to resist Belarus’s slide towards authoritarianism after Lukashenka’s victory was limited, as its leadership had lost the confidence of the people. This lack of confidence in democratic institutions persists to this day. In our interview, Shushkevich described Belarus as a country with “many protesters but few people who understand politics, and too many people who think they can rule the country.” In Shushkevich’s view, the multiplicity of inept politicians entrenched the “stable but bad political situation” Belarus faces today. The ineffectiveness of opposition leaders has been compounded by the tendency of European leaders to accommodate and financially support, rather than aggressively isolate Lukashenka’s regime. Authoritarianism in Belarus been further strengthened by the effects of Belarusian and Russian propaganda. Even though this propaganda largely detached from empirical realities, Shushkevich believes that it has deterred Belarusians from embracing Western values, and caused Belarusians to pay more attention to negative political examples in Europe, like the Poland’s right-wing government. While radical political change in Belarus is unlikely in the near future, Shushkevich expressed optimism that the younger generation’s Internet use and educational opportunities in liberal democracies like England and the Czech Republic could result in Belarus adopting a European identity. Shushkevich contended that by developing a European consciousness, Belarus would be able to improve its “people’s economic wellbeing and facilitate the process of political liberalization.” Recent unrest in Belarus suggests that opposition forces are dynamic enough to bring about political change in the long-term. Shushkevich’s belief that political change in Belarus is probable in the long run is strengthened further by his experience overseeing the dissolution of the Soviet Union after the Belovezh Accords. But the road to political transformation is likely to be an arduous one, as Belarusian liberals will need to overcome the pernicious legacies of decades of indoctrination in communist ideology for their dreams to come to fruition.

But there is another problem plaguing some American companies: poor corporate governance. And this one should be easier to fix. All it requires is that board members faithfully represent shareholder interests.Exhibit A is the governance failures unearthed by activist hedge fund Elliot Management in its battle with the management of Arconic, part of the aerospace and automotive parts manufacturer formerly known as Alcoa. These failures exemplify the way that outdated corporate governance structures can harm the competitiveness of American companies. Shareholders, employees, and countless other Americans suffer as a result.Alcoa was a prototypical rust-belt manufacturing company. It opened production in New Kensington, Pennsylvania in 1891, and its successes benefited millions in Pittsburgh and around the country.The trouble for Alcoa started in 2008. The company’s stock had a horrific year of returns falling from over $100 to around $10. Around this time, Dr. Klaus Kleinfeld stepped in as CEO, with a plan to rebuild the business and make strategic acquisitions. The plans largely failed, producing shareholder returns at the very bottom for large American companies. Nevertheless, Kleinfeld kept his job and earned millions in pay.Last year, Alcoa spun off its aluminum production business into a new company called Alcoa, re-naming the parent company Arconic. The tale of these two companies is a case study in the impact corporate governance can have.This spinoff created two very different companies—New Alcoa was given “a much better governance structure” than Arconic, in the words of Alcoa CFO William Oplinger. Specifically, Alcoa incorporated in Delaware, the preferred choice of shareholders seeking to unlock corporate value. Alcoa also established an annual election of the board of directors, separated the chairman and CEO role, and lowered the voting requirements for removing directors.Arconic did not follow suit. It remained a Pennsylvania corporation, thus enabling it to enact management friendly policies that would be off limits in Delaware. Arconic also retained its staggered board despite mounting evidence that such a structure leads to entrenchment and reduced firm value. It is now one of only a handful of large corporations with this outdated governance structure. Finally, Kleinfeld continues to serve as both CEO and Chair of the board, which is responsible for overseeing management.While of these old-school governance approaches might be in the interests of shareholders in some cases, Arconic has refused to modernize despite increased shareholder pressure for it to do so. This flies directly in the face of recent empirical evidence indicating that when governance that diminishes shareholder power is unilaterally imposed by the board, firm value suffers.A good board might be able to overcome these structural failures, but Arconic is a poster-child for a bad board too. The Arconic board is plagued with severe conflicts of interest. The lead independent director, Pat Russo, also serves as the as the chair of the HP board, of which Kleinfeld is also a director. Russo is charged with overseeing Kleinfeld’s compensation at Arconic, while Kleinfeld oversees Russo’s compensation at HP. This perverse relationship may help explain the fact that both Kleinfeld and Russo continue to reap huge sums, while shareholders and others at both companies suffer.There’s also evidence that the Arconic board has been asleep at the wheel. The board appears to have been unaware of a voting agreement that put nearly nine million shares of Arconic stock in the effective voting control of Kleinfeld for two years. To make matters worse, the voting agreement was only revealed to Arconic shareholders after a dead-hand provision had kicked in causing these shares to be voted for management no matter who owned them.Enter Elliot Management. Since taking an activist stake in 2016, Elliot has successfully put three independent directors on the Arconic board and has proposed a long-term strategy, unlike some activist shareholders only interested in stock buybacks or other short-term fixes.But Elliot, which has a 13 percent stake in Arconic, now seeks more dramatic changes: ousting Kleinfeld, nominating four more independent directors, and revamping the company’s governance. It also seeks operational changes, including reducing high expenditures associated with Arconic’s presence in Manhattan. On Tuesday, Elliot released a 300-page presentation detailing its grievances and its plans for Arconic. This presentation called for Arconic to move its headquarters out of New York City altogether, suggesting as one possibility that the headquarters be moved back to Pittsburgh.Arconic responded by threatening shareholders with a “poison put” – arguing with no legal foundation that a contract with an employee pension trust required a payment of $500 million in the event Elliott is successful in its campaign. The threat reeks of entrenchment.For this reason alone, the May 16 proxy contest is sure to be a close one, despite Arconic’s clearly deficient leadership and governance structure that is keeping down a once-proud American manufacturer."

It’s only going to make you sad. It’s not going to bring her back.”By the time he was in his 20s, Harry said he felt like he was going to explode.“I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle,” he said.Harry spoke about his experiences as part of The Telegraph’s series of “Mad World” podcasts about how people grapple with mental health issues. The prince participated in order to battle the stigma surrounding opening up about personal problems and to encourage people to get help.Harry and his brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have also set up the charity Heads Together to promote mental health.Harry gained a reputation known as the wild brother, particularly after photos of his nude hijinks in a Las Vegas hotel room came to light in 2012. But now he’s involved in numerous charitable projects such as supporting the Invictus Games for wounded warriors, working to eliminate hidden land mines, encouraging HIV testing and helping to save elephants in Africa.As for his emotional struggles, including two years of “total chaos,” Harry said he finally sought counseling at the age of 28 and started opening up about his feelings. He also said boxing lessons helped after he came very close to “punching someone.” Now, he’s in a “good place.”Harry encouraged others to learn from his struggles.“The experience I have had is that once you start talking about it, you realize that actually you’re part of quite a big club,” he said.Click here to listen to the podcast."

It was a rubber stamp on one-man rule.,2017-04-17,"Erdogan greets the crowd, who were waiting to celebrate the results of the referendum, after he arrived in the Esenboga International Airport in Ankara, Turkey on April 17.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f4d6ca14000021001b49f9.jpeg?cache=V5vBeppJxk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL — In 1946, members of Turkey’s ruling party made the momentous decision to transition to a multi-party system and usher in democracy to Turkey. In the eyes of political scientists, this is an event with few precedents elsewhere in the world. The political theorist Samuel Huntington, in an article concerning authoritarian regimes, defines Turkey as “the most clear-cut instance of the shift from an exclusionary one-party system to a competitive system.”And now with more than seven decades of experience with multi-party politics, Turkey has been largely successful at preserving its self-imposed democratic system, regardless of its imperfections and despite a handful of military coups. But Sunday’s referendum, which approved a change from a parliamentary system to a presidential one and will allow the winner of the next presidential election to take full control over the government, was arguably one of Turkey’s most problematic political votes to have been held under an elected, non-military administration.The referendum will have far-reaching implications for Turkey. The position of the prime minister has now been abolished. It is clear that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has run Turkey for almost 15 years, has no desire to share power with a political partner. Moreover, the referendum took place under a state of emergency proclaimed after last year’s attempted coup. Since that traumatic event, more than 100,000 public sector employees have been dismissed, the rule of law has been suspended and numerous media outlets have been shut down by force.In such an atmosphere, there are serious concerns about the democratic legitimacy of any debate about altering the country’s political system. Indeed, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe expressed concern about the validity of the vote, saying the referendum had taken place on an “unlevel playing field.”For one thing, the co-chairs of the HDP (the third-largest party in Turkey’s parliament and the one whose main base of support is Turkey’s Kurdish population) are currently under arrest, as are numerous HDP deputies and mayors. The HDP was unable to conduct an effective campaign leading up to the referendum. In addition, Turkey’s media and academia — which would normally take a leading role in weighing any changes to the country’s political system — have been operating under severe constraints due to the state of emergency. As a result, the task of campaigning against the proposed changes mainly fell to Turkey’s main opposition party, the CHP. But the center-left CHP’s influence over Turkey’s electorate was limited.Erdogan’s referendum strategy was based on consolidating his appeal to right-wing voters. He formed a partnership between his party, the Justice and Development Party, or AKP, and the nationalist MHP. Sunday’s vote was less a referendum, which occurs when a society decides to make a change to its political system through meaningful debate in a democratic setting, than a plebiscite, which is merely meant to test public opinion rather than to have a binding effect.With little room for real debate, the “referendum” merely serves as a rubber stamp for the country’s leader. Throughout the two-month-long campaign, there was scarcely any discussion of the proposed constitutional changes. Instead, everything was reduced to the question of whether to end or to prolong Erdogan’s tenure. On the final day of the campaign, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim effectively admitted as much: “There wasn’t a chance to talk about the content [of the referendum].”Everywhere in Turkey — in the streets, in public squares, on television, in the newspapers — the “yes” campaign dominated. Making full use of the public funds at its disposal, the AKP appealed to voters’ emotions, portraying itself as full of valor and zeal. There was no sign of the skeptical, critical, deliberative atmosphere that is a precondition for any constitutional referendum. Leaders of various parties never appeared on television to debate each other in front of the nation. Even more troublingly, those in the “no” camp were, at times, accused of being terrorists or coup supporters. In the absence of free debate and other democratic conventions, the referendum simply became a plebiscite validating the country’s transition to one-man rule.But despite the unequal, unfair conditions that prevailed, Erdogan achieved his objective by only a hair’s breadth, with only 51 percent of the vote. Opposition parties made allegations of voting irregularities and questioned the legitimacy of the result. A majority of voters in Turkey’s big cities (including Istanbul and Ankara) and in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions voted no. Even the district of Uskudar in Istanbul where Erdoğan has a house voted no. His steadiest support came from the more conservative Anatolian heartland and the Black Sea provinces. Given that Turkey has been governed under a state of emergency for nine months — with the rule of law suspended, heavy pressure on the media and a campaign environment that was neither free nor fair — it is all too obvious what kind of presidential system awaits Turkey. Opposition parties have described Turkey’s new political order as a one-man regime. Erdogan has described it as a “Turkish version” of the presidential system. This system is undoubtedly quite different from its U.S. counterpart — it has more in common with the dysfunctional presidential systems of Latin America. Under Turkey’s new presidential system, the president will have ultimate authority over all three branches of government: legislative, executive and judicial. Any checks and balances will be ineffective. The new system can only be expected to lead to further uncertainty and instability in Turkey over the coming years. Since being president in 2014, Erdogan has effectively governed the country singlehandedly, and serious political and economic problems have resulted. Turkey is reeling from last year’s coup attempt, terrorist organizations are carrying out gruesome attacks and the Turkish lira is steadily depreciating. It is worth asking whether one man is likely to solve all these problems or only exacerbate them further.Who will be vindicated in the years to come? The residents of Turkey’s big cities and coastal areas, who desire a more pluralistic political model as well as integration into the global system? Or conservative voters from the Anatolian heartland, who have eagerly adopted the government’s populist message and see one-man rule as the answer to Turkey’s woes? The shift to one-man rule opens Pandora’s Box for Turkey because, despite using state resources for the “yes” campaign, Erdogan’s referendum still only passed with 51 percent of the vote. Such a narrow win despite the cards tipped in his favor equates to a defeat — a Pyrrhic victory. This realization was clear in Erdogan’s subdued rather than celebratory tone when he gave his “victory” speech on election night. Given that about half the population is not behind him, he knows this will not end well for him when he is unable to resolve Turkey’s myriad of challenges all on his own."

According to The Hill, press vans took the usual shorter route, passing the protesters. On the bridge, demonstrators held signs that read “Show your taxes!” and “Don the Con.” Many expressed anger when they realized Trump wouldn’t see their protest. “We’re very disappointed,” Sharon Adams told the Palm Beach Post. “He’s scared. He’s avoiding everybody. He is avoiding taking responsibility.”An estimated 700 people attended the West Palm Beach protest. Across the country, tens of thousands gathered for more than 100 rallies, the largest events being held in Washington, D.C., and New York City.Organizers planned the marches for April 15 — the date that individual tax returns are usually due. This year, however, tax day falls on Tuesday, April 18, since the 15th is a Saturday and Monday is a legal holiday in the District of Columbia.After Saturday’s marches, Nelini Stamp, a keynote speaker at New York’s Tax March rally, said in a statement, “Trump says only the media cares about this taxes. Today, we’ve proved him wrong.

We never lost faith that this day would come.”Colon-Ortiz, who is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday, was arrested on charges of aggravated assault and battery and assault with attempt to rape, though more charges, including murder, are expected. He is being held on $10 million bail, Early said.Marcotte was working for Google in New York City when she went to visit her mother. Her family, in a statement obtained by the Boston Globe, called working for Google “her dream job.”“After eight long months, we’re able to take the first step toward justice for Vanessa,” they said, responding to news of a suspect’s arrest. “She was a beautiful, intelligent, and generous young woman whose passion for giving back to the community will always be remembered.”"

There were roughly the same number of Republicans and Democrats who voted when early voting ended on Friday, according to New York Times election expert Nate Cohn.Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, came up with similar figures.The virtually even turnout among Democrats and Republicans in the district is a major change from the first week of early voting, in which Democrats enjoyed a significant lead.The makeup of the early voting electorate is a notoriously flawed predictor of general election outcomes. For one thing, Democrats tend to turn out in higher numbers to vote early than on Election Day.And the lack of party registration in Georgia makes tea-leaf reading that much harder. To identify partisans, Cohn and McDonald looked at the last party primary that each of the voters participated in, which may not reflect a consistent party affiliation.On its face, however, the surge in Republican early voting is an ominous sign for Democrats. The party’s leading candidate, 30-year-old documentary filmmaker Jon Ossoff is hoping to walk away with the majority he needs to win outright in the first round of voting this Tuesday, where he is up against multiple candidates from both parties.If Ossoff fails to receive 50 percent, he will head to a June 20 runoff, where he will likely face a steeper climb in a head-to-head battle with a Republican. Ossoff currently has the support of 47 percent of the district’s voters, according to a Revily poll conducted from April 10 to 12.Nate Cohn, nonetheless, highlighted some early voting trends that look favorable for Ossoff. Infrequent voters, who Ossoff needs to turn out, are voting at roughly the rates they would in higher-turnout midterm elections.And former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would have received 57 percent of the district’s vote if the general electorate in November had been composed of those who voted early in the special election, according to Cohn.The national Democratic Party and liberal grassroots groups have poured Democrats are hoping the Atlanta-area special election will showcase their ability to translate popular backlash to President Donald Trump into victory at the ballot box.The congressional seat became available when Trump tapped Tom Price to become Secretary of Health and Human Services. While Price won reelection in the district by 23 points in November, Trump won it by just 1.5 points."

Kelly made his claim Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” during a discussion about the government’s efforts to stem the influx of illegal drugs into the United States. He said his agency is focusing on cutting off the transport and sale of methamphetamine, heroin and cocaine.Together, meth, cocaine, heroin and other opiates resulted in the deaths of some 52,000 Americans in 2015, Kelly said. “It’s a massive problem. 52,000 Americans. You can’t put a price on human misery. The cost to the United States is over $250 billion a year,” he said.But “the solution is not arresting a lot of users,” the secretary continued. “The solution is a comprehensive drug demand reduction program in the United States that involves every man and woman of goodwill. And then rehabilitation. And then law enforcement. And then getting at the poppy fields and the coca fields in the south.”Over 25 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized the use of marijuana. Last November, voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada approved ballot measures legalizing recreational use of the drug. Several other states passed measures liberalizing their medical marijuana laws. A number of Trump administration officials, most notably Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have expressed reservations about this nationwide trend. “Experts are telling me there’s more violence around marijuana than one would think,” Sessions said in February, despite evidence that liberalization of marijuana laws does not lead to increased levels of violence. However, Sessions has not called for an outright reversal of state laws governing marijuana use. In March, he said that Obama administration guidance advising a hands-off policy toward enforcing federal marijuana laws in states with more liberal laws is mostly “valid.” Politics hurt too much?

He said he had tried to video Wednesday’s traffic stop after recognizing one of the Gwinnett County officers from a prior arrest. But before he could activate his phone, he was manhandled and forced out of his car.“He start[ed] shoving me in my car and telling me that I was never going to have a video, that I was never going to make the phone call to my mom,” Hollins told NBC News.But other motorists did capture parts of the incident on video.In one video, Hollins is seen exiting his car with his hands in the air when the officer, identified as Sgt. Michael Bongiovanni, suddenly clocks him in the head. After delivering the blow, Hollins said Bongiovanni pulled out a Taser and used it on him.“I thought that he was going to at least grab one of my arms and put me in handcuffs, but I didn’t realize he was going to punch me in the face,” Hollins said.The second video, taken by another driver, shows Hollins lying facedown on the ground in handcuffs. As Bongiovanni is holding him, Officer Robert McDonald runs up and appears to stomp on his face.Asked if he’d seen the videos, Hollins said, “It’s actually very difficult. ... Seeing that I’m getting manhandled, not just ― how could I say this? Assaulted.”“What if that had happened to somebody else,” he asked, “if they was in my shoes?”McDonald was the first officer to be fired, after the video of his actions appeared. Gwinnett County Police Chief Butch Ayers said that McDonald owned up to what he’d done. After the other video surfaced showing Bongiovanni’s role, he too was fired. Ayers said Bongiovanni expressed no remorse. “He felt the force was justified,” Ayers told NBC News.In the police report filed by the officers, Hollins was accused of refusing to exit his vehicle when asked. The report didn’t mention Bongiovanni’s use of physical force. Ayres said that omission amounted to lying.Thanks to the cell phone videos, both officers are facing criminal charges. Meanwhile, the initial charges against Hollins ― which included obstruction of a law enforcement officer, driving without a license plate, not using a turn signal and carrying less than an ounce of marijuana ― have been dropped.The police department said it is also dismissing 89 unrelated criminal cases in which Bongiovanni or McDonald was the principal officer or a necessary witness.“The actions of these officers completely undermine their credibility and they cannot be relied upon as witnesses in any pending prosecution,” the police department stated in a release on Friday.

70,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's Campaign Turns Over Email List To DNC,Sam Levine and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-dnc-email-list_us_58f278b9e4b0da2ff8613acf,The list has over 10 million names not in the party's files.,2017-04-16,Hillary Clinton had promised to help rebuild the Democratic Party's infrastructure.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f368342600003600c45e77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic National Committee announced on Sunday that Hillary Clinton’s campaign had turned over its email list, giving the party a major boost as it rebuilds under a new chair and prepares for the midterm elections next year and the 2020 presidential race.The list, provided as an in-kind contribution from the Hillary for America campaign organization, includes more than 10 million new names that the DNC did not have on its voter files, according to both Clinton and DNC aides. The contribution was valued as $3.5 million, according to data from the Federal Election Commission.“This information will help candidates up and down the ballot engage with voters and win seats from the school board to the Senate,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the DNC. “We’re seeing momentum and energy across the country, and this investment will help us harness the energy and turn it into votes.”The decision to turn over the email list ― in addition to providing the DNC with its analytics and voter modeling tools ― fulfills a campaign promise that Clinton made. During the primary, the former secretary of state pledged that if she were nominated, she would focus her resources on rebuilding a Democratic Party infrastructure that had decayed under President Barack Obama. “[P]utting the DNC on a strong footing is something that she’s been very focused on since the campaign, when she set out to leave the DNC in the black and did so,” said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill. “But in addition to a strong financial footing, sharing campaign data and resources is something she views as critical to electing Democrats in 2017, 2018 and beyond. It is an important and unprecedented step toward a strong, unified Democratic Party going forward.”Obama’s win in 2008 had bolstered the party’s elected ranks. But his own outside group, Organizing for Action, attempted to play much of the traditional role of the DNC, fostering frustration within party ranks. National and state party officials worried that local races were neglected in favor of Obama-specific ones. And they chaffed that they were not given complete access to the OFA email list until 2015.Clinton’s email list will allow the party and its state affiliates to more effectively target voters in the lead-up to the 2018 midterms. But the party still does not have the crown jewel of email lists: that collected by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2016 campaign, which has the names of millions of individuals who do not associate with the Democratic Party and were brought into the political process largely because of their affinity for the independent Vermont senator. Sanders’ team has been reluctant to hand that information to the DNC out of fear that the list will be misused by the committee and under the belief that the individuals on it did not sign up as Democrats but as supporters of Sanders."
71,THE WORLDPOST,Why You Should Pay Attention To Jean-Luc Mélenchon And The French Election,"Willa Frej and Geoffroy Clavel, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jean-luc-melenchon-french-election_us_58efa908e4b0b9e9848a224f,The leftist candidate's meteoric rise makes it impossible to predict what will happen on Election Day.,2017-04-15,"Mélenchon's rally in Lille on April 12 drew around 25,000 spectators.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f126d814000049001b462b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It wouldn’t be a French presidential election without high drama. And Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the 65-year-old leftist candidate who has unexpectedly surged in the polls in recent weeks, is rejiggering the state of the race and complicating matters for his three rivals. Mélenchon, once a distant fifth place in the polls, this week was polling at 20 percent, beating the scandal-ridden conservative François Fillon by 1 percentage point, according to an Ipsos-Sopra Sterna poll for Le Monde newspaper. Centrist Emmanuel Macron was tied in the lead with far-right leader Marine Le Pen at 22 percent.Mélenchon, a self-proclaimed populist who likens himself to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and idolizes Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez and Cuba’s Castro brothers, joined the Socialist Party in the 1970s and later became a senator. He said in 2008 that he saw himself as the person who would reinvent the left in the face of a “crisis of capitalism.” So, he formed his own Party of the Left, but abandoned it to form another party in 2016: “La France insoumise,” which translates to “a France that won’t bow down.” He drew inspiration from populist anti-liberal movements, like the Spanish Indignados.“France has always had a history of radical thinking, which for a long time originated from the Communist Party,” Roger Martelli, a historian specializing in communism, told HuffPost France. “When that party fizzled, Jean-Luc Mélenchon espoused that radicalism, but without ascribing to communist thinking.”Mélenchon, a skilled orator whose newfound popularity has been attributed by many to animated performances in the last few debates, has rested his campaign on the abolition of France’s system of government, the Fifth Republic. He aims to create a new republic defined by the people and not the “oligarchy” now in control, according to his website.He’s also proposing a 100 million-euro (about $106 million) economic stimulus; a “Frexit” from the European Union; a NATO pullout; dropping the retirement age to 60; and a 32-hour work week. He wants to tax those who make more than 400,000 euros a year, or $425,000, at 90 percent.The irony is that voters drawn to Mélenchon’s populist views could, in a sense, be supporting much of what they would get from a candidate on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum.Le Pen is a populist herself. She’s more of a hard-liner when it comes to immigration and terrorism. But like Mélenchon, she’s committed to bringing jobs back to the French and withdrawing from the European Union and international treaties. Both Le Pen and Mélenchon have suggested they would hold referendums to let the people of France weigh in before taking action.Mélenchon has tried repeatedly to refute these supposed similarities.“I’m not a nationalist,” he told Le Point magazine in reference to Le Pen. “I’m a patriot. I’m prepared to negotiate with other countries, not shut France in.”A first round of voting will take place April 23. The second round, which will whittle the race down to two candidates, happens on May 7. Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Madaya evacuees said they heard the blast."

The other side included self-described “patriots” and “nationalists”, Trump supporters, free speech advocates, and other groups.Daryl Tempesta, 52, who said he served in the U.S. Air Force near the end of the Cold War, went to the rally to show his support for Trump.“As a veteran, I like the track America is on, and that Trump is willing to stand and say we are still America and we are not going to be globalist, we’re not going to be a communist country,” Tempesta said. “That’s a message I can get behind.”A weekly farmers market was canceled ahead of the rally due to concerns about violence.

The other side included self-described “patriots” and “nationalists”, Trump supporters, free speech advocates, and other groups.Daryl Tempesta, 52, who said he served in the U.S. Air Force near the end of the Cold War, went to the rally to show his support for Trump.“As a veteran, I like the track America is on, and that Trump is willing to stand and say we are still America and we are not going to be globalist, we’re not going to be a communist country,” Tempesta said. “That’s a message I can get behind.”A weekly farmers market was canceled ahead of the rally due to concerns about violence. Even so, a stall selling fresh vegetables remained open for business amid the fist fighting, explosions from firecrackers and smoke wafting through the air.“We decided to show up anyway because this is our livelihood,” said Tim Mueller, a farmer who owns the stall, surrounded by protesters on both sides.At least 100 people from both camps eventually moved out to the park and into one of the city’s main intersections, where they continued to fist fight, hurl insults and chant at each other.The police presence was light there, and only two or three officers were seen near the crossroads.Berkeley has a long history of liberal activism and the University of California, Berkeley was a center of protests in the 1960s.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Sandra Maler)"

(Reuters) - The state of Arkansas on Friday ran into a pair of new legal obstacles to its plan to carry out lethal injections on seven murderers in an unprecedented series of executions before the end of the month.The Arkansas Supreme Court granted an emergency stay of execution for Bruce Ward, 60, who was convicted of killing a convenience store clerk, and less than two hours later the executions of six other murderers were put on hold when an Arkansas circuit judge issued a temporary restraining order.The judge’s restraining order barred the state from administering one of three drugs it planned to use in the executions, which are scheduled to begin on Monday and stretch over 11 days.Attorney General Leslie Rutledge plans to file an emergency request for the Supreme Court to vacate that order, a spokesman said, allowing the injections to commence.The state, which has not carried out an death sentence in 12 years, scheduled the fast-paced executions in order to beat the expiration date on its batch of one of the drugs used in its lethal injection cocktail.An eighth inmate who had been scheduled to die also won a stay earlier, removing him from the list for April execution.Lawyers for all of the convicts have asked a federal court in Little Rock to block the executions, arguing the state’s rush to the death chamber was unconstitutional and reckless. The U.S. judge has yet to issue a ruling on the broader case.The state Supreme Court offered no comment in staying Ward’s execution. His lawyers had argued he was schizophrenic and the court should take that into consideration before any final decision on his execution.“He deserves a day in court for that, but in Arkansas the rules do not permit that,” Scott Braden, a lawyer with the Arkansas Federal Defender Office, said after the stay was granted.The attorney general was evaluating how to proceed in Ward’s case, a spokesman said in a statement.Arkansas uses potassium chloride in combination with vecuronium bromide and midazolam. The latter drug is intended to render the inmate unconscious before the other two chemicals are administered to paralyse the lungs and stop the heart.Governor Asa Hutchinson has said the state must act quickly because the efficacy date for midazolam expires at the end of the month.But Judge Wendell Griffen, an outspoken opponent of capital punishment, issued an order blocking the state from using a second drug, vecuronium bromide, after a petition from its maker, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc.The company said the Arkansas prison system failed to return a supply of the drug when it learned the state intended to use it for executions, a violation of an understanding between the two, according to McKesson.“As a public opponent of capital punishment, Judge Griffen should have recused himself from this case,” said Judd Deere, spokesman for the attorney general.Two other drug makers on Thursday asked a federal court to block Arkansas from using their drugs for upcoming executions, claiming that doing so would violate contractual controls and create a public health risk, court documents showed.The companies did not disclose which of their drugs Arkansas will use during the executions.(Additional reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee and Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Writing by Frank McGurty; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Bill Trott)"

State lawmakers are taking steps to make sure that doesn’t happen again when he runs for re-election.Lawmakers in 26 states have introduced legislation to require presidential and vice presidential candidates to publicly disclose their tax returns to get on the ballot. If future candidates should fail to release their tax returns under this legislation, they would not be allowed to appear on the ballot.Trump claims that he can’t release his tax returns because they are under a routine audit ― an assertion that is false. President Richard Nixon, the first to disclose his tax returns, released them in 1973 even though they were under audit at the time.Trump’s refusal to disclose his tax returns has only increased speculation about what could be in them. His returns would detail the amount he paid in taxes, how much he donated to charity, whether he paid foreign taxes, whether he has foreign bank accounts and the profits and losses of his many businesses.Two pages of Trump’s 2005 tax returns were disclosed to journalist David Cay Johnston, which did nothing to stymie public interest in the issue. Thousands of people are expected to protest in dozens of cities across the country on April 15 to demand Trump release his tax returns.While state lawmakers are seeking to force Trump to disclose his tax returns, Republicans in Congress have blocked three of Democrats’ amendments to obtain them.States Where Presidential Tax Return Bills Have Been IntroducedDemocratic New York state Sen. Brad Hoylman introduced the first legislation to make Trump disclose his tax returns to get on the 2020 New York state ballot. His bill ― the Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public, or TRUMP ― would require all presidential and vice presidential candidates to release the past five years of their taxes 60 days prior to the election. If a candidate failed to meet this requirement, they would be excluded from the ballot.“We thought, given the barriers in Washington, that states could take up the effort to require presidential and vice presidential candidates to release their taxes in order to qualify for the ballot,” Hoylman told The Huffington Post.He added, “Ballot qualifications are a time-honored responsibility of states, and at the same time, the current president had broken with over four decades of political tradition.”Lawmakers in another 25 states have introduced nearly identical legislation since Hoylman first released his bill in December. These include Democratic strongholds and states Trump won.In New Jersey, legislation to force Trump to disclose his tax returns has passed both chambers of the legislature with support from both Democrats and Republicans. It faces a likely veto from Gov. Chris Christie (R), a Trump ally. But Christie’s term in office will end in 2017 and he’s likely to be replaced by a Democrat. That means there is higher likelihood the state could approve this bill in 2018.New Jersey is not the only state in which Republicans have voted for or sponsored this type of legislation. In Georgia, New Mexico and Minnesota, Republican lawmakers have introduced bills to require candidates to disclose their tax returns to gain ballot access.Groups supporting the disclosure legislation emphasize that it is not just about Trump, but any future candidate, now that the current president has broken the 40-year norm.“This is more than just about Donald Trump,” Aaron Scherb, the director of legislative affairs at the nonpartisan nonprofit Common Cause, told HuffPost. “This is about ensuring the American public can have a full understanding of the presidential candidates moving forward, to make sure that any current or future presidents do not have conflicts of interest.”There is, however, the question of the legality of forcing candidates to disclose their tax returns to gain ballot access. Rick Hasen, an election law expert at University of California, Irvine School of Law, argued in Politico that one legal argument that would allow such laws is the Supreme Court’s 2000 Bush v. Gore decision.Hasen writes, “the Court wrote that even though state legislators have given each state’s voters the right to vote for presidential electors, at any time a state legislature can ‘take back the power’ to appoint electors.”This means that states could theoretically change the rules about how members of the Electoral College can or cannot vote as they see fit. If a state wanted to take away the power from electors to vote for president and give that power to the state legislature, that would be allowed. At least, so goes an argument that has never faced further constitutional scrutiny outside of the supposed one-off case of Bush v. Gore.But Hasen further argues that Republicans could retaliate with their own ballot access rules to negatively target Democratic candidates.“Democrats should consider the Pandora’s box they might be opening here,” Hasen writes. “Will solidly Republican states allow electors to vote only for Republican candidates for president? If the tax gambit is OK, then such a law might also be constitutional.”“I say bring it on, if it results in voters having informed choices in the next election,” Hoylman said about possible retaliatory legislation."

The brand has always doubled as an educational tool for young children, and it sounds like Netflix has no interest in moving away from that.It seems to be part of a larger Netflix push to reboot some of America’s favorite educational children’s shows. In February, for example, Netflix revealed that “Saturday Night Live” cast member Kate McKinnon would be voicing Ms. Frizzle for a reboot of “Magic School Bus.”The original PBS “Carmen Sandiego” game show ran for five seasons in the early 1990s."
