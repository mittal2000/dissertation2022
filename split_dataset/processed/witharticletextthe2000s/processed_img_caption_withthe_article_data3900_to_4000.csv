0,POLITICS,Does Trump Have The Business Sense To Pull The Financial Plug On Nuclear Power?,"D.A. Barber, ContributorIndependent Journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/does-trump-have-the-business-sense-to-pull-the-financial_us_58c3a185e4b0c3276fb78536,"Six years after the Fukushima nuclear power plant triple meltdown left Japan with a $235 billion clean-up bill, President",2017-03-11,"<p><strong>Beaver Valley Power Station, Shippingport, PA</strong> </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c3aeaa27000022007496aa.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Six years after the Fukushima nuclear power plant triple meltdown left Japan with a $235 billion clean-up bill, President Trump ― the number-crunching businessman ― should give second thought to propping-up an industry neither the market nor the taxpayer can afford to support.As a “builder,” it is doubtful Trump would pour money into projects where billion-dollar cost over-runs have become the norm and it costs more to dismantle a facility than to build it.The March 11, 2011, Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident sent global firms and regulators scrambling in search of better designs. Meanwhile, the decontamination costs of the surrounding Fukushima area reached some $22.7 billion by the end of 2016 and the total cost evacuee compensation and the reactors’ dismantling will exceed $236 billion, says Japan’s Economy Ministry.Trump has expressed tepid support for nuclear energy, though his pick to lead the Department of Energy, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, supported nuclear waste storage in Texas.Trump’s transition team surveyed the Energy Department on how to keep aging US nuclear reactors “operating as part of the nation’s infrastructure,” as well as how to reduce bureaucratic red-tape on exporting US nuclear energy technology and finishing the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository.But the US nuclear energy industry is facing its own financial meltdown, and throwing more money at propping up the industry won’t solve the financial issues nuclear power has had from the start.That’s because old nuclear power plants are too expensive to operate in a market dominated by plummeting natural gas and renewable energy costs, forcing many nuclear reactors to the brink of closure.And the first company to build a US nuclear power plant since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident is now facing delays, costs over-runs and bankruptcy, instead of leading the much-touted nuclear renaissance.Toshiba’s Westinghouse Electric subsidiary received $6.5 billion in US government loan guarantees in 2014 from the Obama administration to build reactors in Georgia and South Carolina using a new generation AP1000 reactor from Westinghouse. But three years late and over budget by billions, Westinghouse - one of the last US nuclear plant builders ― is considering bankruptcy while parent company Toshiba’s CEO resigned as the firm took $6.3 billion in losses.The nuclear industry says soaring costs to build new plants combined with the overdue retirement of older plants is why it needs fresh government subsidies to keep existing plans operating.The argument has worked in New York and Illinois, which have anted up billions of dollars to save their state’s nuclear plants, prompting the Electric Power Supply Association and American Petroleum Institute to sue the states for perverting the electric market. Nuclear energy lobbyists are now trying to convince other states to adopt similar policies.The nuclear lobby is also trying to convince states with renewable energy mandates to amend their standards to include the term “emission-free” in order to include nuclear power.During the Obama Administration, the nuclear industry pushed the idea that it offered emission-free electricity to cater to concerns over climate disruption.But Trump has dismissed climate change concerns, forcing lobbyists to dust-off old arguments touting nuclear power’s economic benefits in a letter to the Trump administration urging financial support of aging reactors.The industry is also raising concerns that the United States may get left out of exporting nuclear technology to a global market as China, India and Russia seek to increase their nuclear power capacity, and countries in sub-Saharan Africa are looking to join the nuclear club.Nuclear Energy Institute President and CEO Maria Korsnick throws in jobs, trade and a sprinkling of world dominance, saying: “To preserve its ability to shape global use of nuclear technology, the US must have both a strong domestic nuclear power program and an aggressive nuclear trade and export program.”Even Westinghouse - after blowing the only US-funded nuclear deal in decades ― still hopes to complete projects in China and an Obama Administration-backed deal with India.But these arguments melt down when you factor in all the true costs of nuclear power through the entire mine-to-waste life-cycle, a cost the tax-payer has been saddled with since the 1950s.The on-going cost of cleaning up the mess of creating the fuel used for nuclear energy becomes a real buzz-kill for the argument of nuclear as “clean” energy.Nearly 30 million tons of uranium ore were extracted from the Navajo Nation in Arizona and New Mexico between 1944 and 1986 leaving over 500 abandoned mines the US government has still barley cleaned-up after spending over $1.7 billion.Nobody knows how to deal with the 84,250 tons of used-up radioactive fuel just from commercial reactors that have piled up. Questions remain whether Trump will support continued interim storage of nuclear waste in some 35 states already temporarily holding waste from various nuclear projects, or if he will continue to pour more money into the financial black-hole of the unfinished $30 billion Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository in Nevada.So far, the government’s liabilities for nuclear clean-up is estimated at $447 billion, which doesn’t include what future clean-up costs are expected to be with some 100 nuclear power plants in the United States that all will eventually need decommissioning and proper disposal, according to a GAO report.Looking at other countries, it’s clear the potential costs are staggering:Decommissioning Taiwan’s three nuclear power plants will cost $20 billion, nearly double the initial estimates by the state-owned utility, and the French Parliament has balked at French utility EDF’s $80.8 billion estimate as too low for closing the utility’s fleet of reactors.And none of those plants ever had a Fukushima ― or Three Mile Island-like accident.With the Trump administration in their sights, the big push now from the nuclear industry is advanced nuclear development ― designs that supporters claim use less fuel, produce less waste, cost less and are safer.Flour Corporation’s NuScale is waiting for design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop small modular reactors - SMRs - supporters claim are so safe that emergency evacuation requirements should be all but eliminated.But what developers of small modular reactors are really targeting is the deep-pocketed military since the US Defense Department has indicated plans to replace their diesel field generators with portable SMRs as recommended by a Defense Science Board task force under President Obama last year.In other words, SMR developers want the Trump Administration to fund the development of SMRs so they can sell SMRs to the Trump Administration.Other current arguments for resurrecting nuclear power actually get pretty fringe, including the claim that seawater uranium extraction - promoted by Obama’s former US Secretary of Energy and Nobel Prize recipient Steven Chu - can morph nuclear power into “renewable energy.”America’s aging nuclear power reactors are also now being touted as a part of the nation’s infrastructure and deserving of some of the Trump Administration’s promised trillion-dollar infrastructure money.These are all arguments calling for one form of financial subsidy or another.And that’s nuclear energy’s ongoing problem: An industry where the technology is meant to do nothing more than boil water still cannot finance itself after 60 years while hugely underestimating the cost of cleaning-up after their profits have melted down.Trump ― the number-crunching developer - needs to ask the question: Why support an industry that uses a fuel of such long-term high cost from mine-to-grave over a renewable energy industry where the “fuel” ― wind and sun ― costs nothing and never runs out?It doesn’t take a nuclear physicist to figure out that continued funding of nuclear power is a really bad deal."
1,HEALTHY LIVING,What I Learned After Losing A Parent At A Young Age,"Chenelle Covin, ContributorEditor-in-Chief of Unheard Voices Magazine",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-i-learned-about-losing-a-parent-at-a-young-age_us_58c3fc7ce4b070e55af9ef5e,I hate when people complain about their parents.,2017-03-11,"<p>My mother and I (left), my mother’s glamour shot(right)</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c3fef81e00002b0077f305.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One day, someone asked me whether I was a mommy’s girl or a daddy’s girl. I said daddy’s girl. They said “oh no I’m a mommy’s girl at heart. I could never imagine losing my mother. I wouldn’t know what to do if she were to pass away”.She didn’t know my mother had passed away at that time almost 12 years ago. At first I wasn’t going to tell her. The pride in her voice that she was a mommy’s girl resonated so loud to me. If I was to tell her mine passed away when I was at the tender age of 14, I felt it would dampen her appropriation of reality. But I told her anyway. She immediately said sorry to hear that. Until this very day, we never had a conversation about my mother or anything about being a mommy’s girl or daddy’s girl.The reason why I said daddy’s girl wasn’t because I didn’t have a close relationship with my mother. My mother and I were actually close. My closeness to each parent was different. As my family marks the 17th year my mother passed away August 14th, the reason why I said daddy’s girl reverberates so loudly for me today. I have now known my father longer than my mother. And during that time through our trials and tribulations we’ve gotten closer. The way she said ‘mommy’s girl’ made me feel ashamed that I couldn’t say it. But her saying she’s a mommy’s girl reminded me what I learned about losing my mother at a young age and the person I’ve become today.My mother was 41 years young when she passed away due to complications from Lupus. She was one of the most resilient person(s) I knew. Honestly, I haven’t met a person quite like her. My mother never wanted people to feel sorry for her. As she made friends she often didn’t tell them she had Lupus. My brother and I didn’t know she had Lupus until her last days on earth. My mother didn’t want us to worry. She just wanted to live and that she did to the fullest.My mother had attended Howard University and finished at Monmouth University graduating with a degree in Business Administration : Accounting. She would go on to be an Accountant for the Federal government until she had to retire because the complications from Lupus began to get worse. She was devastated because my mother loved to work and loved the people she worked with; but she knew her health was more important.I can remember about two years after her being home from work she went to go get glamour pictures made. It was single pictures of herself and she had them all framed. The bigger ones she put around the house and the smaller ones she gave to myself, my brother, and sat one on the living room table. I remember when she came in my room and gave me the picture. I said to her “why is the picture only of yourself?”. She said so I can always have something to remember her by. I thought it was so strange. But I didn’t question her anymore. I heard her go to my brother’s room and overheard her tell him a similar thing. About six months later should would suffer a massive stroke and six months after that died from those complications by having a heart attack at home.My mother knew she was going to transition and she was preparing us. She prepared us first with the Christian foundation that she instilled in us. We always knew that no matter what, to always pray and to look to God. I also knew she was preparing specifically me, the oldest. When I was about 9 years old a classmate of mine mother had passed away. I remember my mother coming to talk to me about it and said sometimes God has a bigger plan and calls us to come home. I remember very vividly saying to my mother I wouldn’t have to worry about that ever happening because you’ll be here forever. But she knew there wasn’t always a forever.The way I could describe my childhood was pure innocence. I would look at other peers’ parents or situations and say that would never happen to me. That was ultimately what I was saying when my classmate’s mother had passed away; that it would never happen to me. I say innocence because I just wanted to remain a child and never have to worry about those things. But at 14 years old, two weeks before I was to start my sophomore year of high school, I was now faced with that reality. For the rest of my life, I would learn what it’s like to lose a parent at a young age.I became very reserved and quiet after the death of my mother. I didn’t notice it then, but now as an adult, I look back on my experience and realized her death took a toll on me. The reason being was because there were very few people that understood what I was going through. On the first day of school, very few people knew my mother had passed away. Many saw the changes in me and I felt like an outcast because of it. For those who did know of mother’s passing, their parents were still here. They couldn’t relate me.Our conversations were awkward. I hated my time in high school because of it. I breezed through, graduated with honors and tried to move on, with a new environment.Once I got in my mid-20s, I found more people that could relate to me but at that point they were just losing their parents. I had already lost my mother 13 years prior.When my mother first passed away I did not grieve intensely. I didn’t immediately understand why but I do know I was still very upset of her passing. I learned later that everyone processes their emotions differently. The only explanation I had was immediately after the death of my mother I felt I had to step up in a big way, especially for my younger brother. It wasn’t until I was an adult and things calmed down more within my family dynamics that it hit me that my mother was no longer here.It is now as an adult as I watch my friends and peers get married, have babies, graduate from college where their mother is always there, that my grief sometimes intensifies. My mother is now a grandmother and she will never experience that physically. I can admit sometimes when I think about it, I hurt bad internally. But one thing that my family instilled in me at a young age was the foundation of having faith and believing in God. I know God’s plan for my mother was bigger there than here on earth. I no longer think selfishly.One time I witnessed someone on social media saying really negative things about their mother. I didn’t know their situation, but it enraged me. Here you are talking about the things you and your mother can’t agree on and there are many people like me who have lost their parent(s) at a young age. I always tell people to appreciate your loved ones now while you have the pleasure of having them. No argument is worth losing that relationship and situations can be mended.The death of my mother allowed me to learn very quickly who’s real. The ability to be there for someone in their time of need is something I respect and admire greatly in a person. It was the support of my few friends and family that showed me the importance of loyalty. Unfortunately, many can’t handle that type of tragedy and will walk away from you. But I was appreciative of the friends and family who were there for me to help me during the process.After the death of my grandmother (my mother’s mother), who was the glue that held my family together, holidays were never the same. But once my mother had passed away, that overall emotion was experienced on another level. My mother died in August and the holidays were not shortly after that. My family had decided to have Christmas at our home.I know my family meant well to provide comfort but it proved to be a hard time for us. Reality had set in that our mother and for my father, his wife, was no longer here. Thereafter, holiday’s have never been the same.At first I was upset at that person who said “oh no I’m a mommy’s girl. I don’t know what I would do without her”. I used to hold grudges against the people I thought should have been there for me but weren’t. I used to have a lot of bitterness in my heart. Over time, I had a clearer understanding they can’t comprehend what it is to lose a parent at a young age and that’s okay. I would never wish my experience on anyone however, I can honestly say my experience has made me into the strong woman I am today.Before the death of my mother, I was always a daddy’s girl but after her death our bond became stronger. Naturally I gravitated to my father more as a child because he always introduced me to interesting technology things and he taught me A LOT about race and life. My mother taught me to never take anything from anyone. My bonds to each were different.My brother and I all suffered greatly because of the death of our mother and for my dad, his wife/best friend. Because of it, it made our family bond stronger through the trials and tribulations that we faced afterwards. Knowing my parent’s story has given me a greater appreciation of love and life, and I wholeheartedly appreciate the man my father is. I wouldn’t trade my father or my brother for anyone in the world.Looking back on how my mother lived until her death gave me a greater appreciation on life now. Within her 41 years on earth, she did more than people that have lived 40 plus years more than her.I know my mother would never want my brother and I to be sad but to live our lives. If my mother was alive today, I can hear her telling me “Chenelle, you need to live more”.And she’s correct. I have since took the bitterness out of my heart. I learned my mother is not coming back, and I’m okay with that. She taught me no matter the circumstances, time is always going to go by. It’s all about how you manage that time.I learned it’s best to live while time keeps going. My mother certainly did.This post is part of Common Grief, a Healthy Living editorial initiative. Grief is an inevitable part of life, but that doesn’t make navigating it any easier. The deep sorrow that accompanies the death of a loved one, the end of a marriage or even moving far away from home, is real. But while grief is universal, we all grieve differently. So we started Common Grief to help learn from each other. Let’s talk about living with loss. If you have a story you’d like to share, email us at strongertogether@huffingtonpost.com."
2,POLITICS,Irish And American Progressives Are Organizing A St. Patrick's Day Rally Against Trump In New York,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/st-patricks-day-anti-trump-rally-new-york_us_58c43028e4b0ed71826d0b27,An Irish senator whose anti-Trump speech went viral will be among the speakers.,2017-03-11,"President Donald Trump will meet with Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny on St. Patrick's Day, but other Irish citizens will be protesting the president in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c4319b1d000037037cdded.jpeg?cache=bLv1TnzO80&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the hopes of amplifying their objections to President Donald Trump and his policies, Irish and American progressive activists will host an event calling for human rights and welcoming immigrants on St. Patrick’s Day in New York City.“Irish Stand,” as organizers are calling it, will take place in the Riverside Church on Manhattan’s West side on Friday evening. It will feature speeches from a number of Irish civil rights advocates, including Irish Labour Party Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, actor Gabriel Byrne, comedian Maeve Higgins and author Colum McCann, as well as prominent American faith leaders, artists and activists like Shaun King of the movement for black lives.Tickets are $15 and the proceeds will go to the American Civil Liberties Union.It was especially important for Irish people to hold a rally on St. Patrick’s Day, Ireland’s national holiday, according to Sen. Ó Ríordáin, whose impassioned appeal for the Irish government to criticize Trump’s xenophobic rhetoric went viral in November.“We have a strong voice and we need to use it,” Ó Ríordáin said. “We have to say, ‘Look, on this day, on the day that everyone considers themselves a little bit Irish, we have to speak up for immigrants everywhere.’”Several activists, including King, contacted Ó Ríordáin after his famous November speech with the goal of collaborating on transatlantic civil rights efforts. Ó Ríordáin saw Trump’s election as the culmination of a nationalist wave sweeping Western countries that included the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, commonly known as Brexit.“We feel it keenly in Ireland because we’re right between Trump and Brexit. We’re right between the two major earthquakes in the Western world over the last year or so,” he said.After Trump implemented the first travel ban in January, Ó Ríordáin, King and others settled on doing an event on St. Patrick’s Day. King recommended Riverside Church, according to Ó Ríordáin, since it was the site of Martin Luther King Jr.’s historic speech against the Vietnam War almost exactly 50 years earlier.St. Patrick’s Day has historically been a politically important day for U.S.-Irish relations. For decades, Irish prime ministers have visited the White House on or near St. Patrick’s Day to present the U.S. president a bowl of shamrock as a gesture of friendship. During difficult times, such as the Troubles in Northern Ireland, it was an opportunity for Irish officials to discuss peacemaking efforts with American lawmakers.The tradition will continue this year under Trump, which makes it essential that other Irish people show their displeasure with Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, according to Ó Ríordáin. “It’s a big deal,” Ó Ríordáin said of the shamrock ceremony. “But the fact that this is the first Patrick’s day since Trump’s election, and the fact that the focus of this administration seems to be ... a very negative view of immigrants, we feel is an affront to our people as Irish people. If they are to have a critical view of any immigrant people, then they have a critical view, to be honest, of us too.”“Irish Stand” is also intended to signal that the Irish-Americans collaborating with Trump are out of touch with the national history of Irish people as immigrants fleeing persecution, Ó Ríordáin said. There are currently an estimated 50,000 undocumented Irish immigrants living in the United States as well, he noted.“What we’re really conscious of, and what I’m really conscious of, is that quite a number of Irish-Americans surround Trump ― Bannon, Conway, Pence, Spicer, Flynn, Kelly ― these are all Irish-Americans, these are all Irish names ― Ryan,” Ó Ríordáin said, referring to top Trump administration officials and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). “These are all people that in my judgment have completely forgotten their family history, because the Irish story is one that has been replicated now by other people… We were once the people who came to America as refugees. We were viewed by the British as being terrorists. We were people who suffered sectarian discrimination in the United Kingdom and [in the U.S.] as well.”"

When their February 2017 cloud of the month turned out to be a flying saucer-shaped lenticular cloud, it absolutely inspired us to seek out more of these breathtaking images of clouds from around the world that have caused people to report seeing alien visitors. The Weather Channel has referred to lenticular clouds as “Mother Nature’s UFOs.” These altocumulus lenticularis clouds ― appearing to our senses as disc-shaped objects ― often form in mountainous regions where stable moist air flows upward and then, when it becomes colder, it descends, forming a disc-like cloud that can appear to hover in the air.They’re also seen in non-mountain areas, formed by the strong winds resulting from a storm front.We’ve gathered some remarkable images here that might make you think twice about whether people have been lucky enough to capture amazing UFO pictures, or the more credible explanation of lenticular clouds."
4,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders' Campaign Faced A Fake News Tsunami. Where Did It Come From?,Ryan Grim and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-fake-news-russia_us_58c34d97e4b0ed71826cdb36,The trolls set out to distract and divide the invigorated left.,2017-03-11,Facebook groups backing Sen. Bernie Sanders were slammed with fake news links last year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c355e71d00001d107cdd1e.jpeg?cache=jKCBTuvvv1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Last June, John Mattes started noticing something coursing like a virus through the Facebook page he helped administer for Bernie Sanders fans in San Diego. People with no apparent ties to California were friending the page and sharing links from unfamiliar sites full of anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda.The stories they posted weren’t the normal complaints he was used to seeing as the Vermont senator and the former secretary of state fought out the Democratic presidential primary. These stories alleged that Clinton had murdered her political opponents and used body doubles.Mattes, 66, had been a television reporter and Senate investigator in previous lives. He put his expertise in unmasking fraudsters to work. At first, he suspected that the sites were created by the old Clinton haters from the ‘90s ― what Hillary Clinton had dubbed “the vast right-wing conspiracy.”But when Mattes started tracking down the sites’ domain registrations, the trail led to Macedonia and Albania. In mid-September, he emailed a few of his private investigator friends with a list of the sites. “Very creepy and i do not think Koch brothers,” he wrote.Mattes and his friends didn’t know what to make of his findings. He couldn’t get his mind around the possibility that trolls overseas might be trying to sway a bunch of Southern Californians who supported Sanders’ run for president. “I may be a dark cynic and I may have been an investigative reporter for a long time, but this was too dark ― and too unbelievable and most upsetting,” he said. “What was I to do with this?”By late October, Mattes said he’d traced 40 percent of the domain registrations for the fake news sites he saw popping up on pro-Sanders pages back to Eastern Europe. Others appeared to be based in Panama and the U.S., or were untraceable. He wondered, “Am I the only person that sees all this crap floating through these Bernie pages?”He wasn’t. Bernie supporters across the country had been noticing dubious websites and posters linked back to Eastern Europe long before Mattes did ― and even before The Washington Post reported in mid-June that Russian government hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee. They had been warning each other that something weird was going on, posting troll alerts and compiling lists of fake news sites.There is enough real news to fight over, they thought, without arguing over anti-Hillary conspiracy theories from Macedonia.Sometimes it was hard to tell who was doing the trolling and for what purposes. Aleta Pearce, 54, who lives in Malibu, California, was an administrator of half a dozen pro-Sanders Facebook groups and a member of many others. In May 2016, she posted a memo to various Facebook groups about the fake news issue, warning of bogus sites.“The pattern I’m seeing is if a member is repeatedly posting articles that are only from one URL that person is just there to push advertising,” Pearce wrote. “They probably have a sock account with little to no content. They are often from Russia or Macedonia.” (A “sock” or “sock puppet” account uses a false identity to deceive.)Pearce added, “Please share this with other Bernie groups so we can put an end to this spam bombing that’s filling up our pages and groups. It’s time to chase the mice out of the hen house and send them a message. They don’t know who they are messing with.”The first tidal wave of spam was mostly anti-Bernie, Pearce recalled, posted by Clinton backers. (David Brock’s Clinton-backing super PAC had likely paid for some portion of those.) But after Clinton became the Democratic nominee in July, Pearce noticed a switch to anti-Hillary messages with links to fake news and to real news with obnoxious pop-up ads.“Every site publishing those ― you clicked on the article, you would be slammed with ads and strange articles,” Pearce told HuffPost. “It was overwhelming. It was 24/7.”She kept a list of fake news sites to watch for ― it grew into dozens. There were posts on the Clinton-has-Parkinson’s conspiracy and the Clinton-is-running-a-pedophilia-ring-out-of-a-pizza-shop conspiracy.On the Sanders campaign, it was Hector Sigala’s job to connect with all the organic Facebook groups. He recalled seeing “a lot of trolls” try to convince people of something “that was obviously fake.”Many of the interlopers, Sigala said, claimed to be Sanders fans who had decided to vote for GOP nominee Donald Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the general election and tried to convince others to do likewise. “It made it seem like the community as a whole was supporting that, but that wasn’t the case,” he said.Sigala thinks most of them were just your average internet trolls. He said he found many were members of 4chan, a gathering place for the alt-right, white nationalists and plain old nihilists from which has sprung all manner of mischief.The Sanders campaign had begun seeing this particular brand of fake news starting in early 2016. “The first time that we kind of fell for it, for like two minutes, was this link from what seemed to be ABC News,” Sigala said. It turned out to be ABC.com.co, a fake site that has no affiliation with the real news network. It had “reported” that the pope himself had endorsed Sanders.In trying to wade through the flood of fake news, Sanders supporters had some serious trust issues. There was good reason to be skeptical of Clinton and the WikiLeaks dump of DNC emails was real, after all. But a steady diet of stories fabricated out of thin air can also feed into paranoia and flame wars.Bev Cowling, 64, saw a sudden deluge of requests to join the Sanders Facebook groups she administered from her home in Toney, Alabama. All of a sudden, they were getting 80 to 100 requests to join each day. She and the other administrators couldn’t vet everyone, and the posts started getting bizarre. “It came in like a wave, like a tsunami,” she said. “It was like a flood of misinformation.”Cowling, a retired postal worker, said some of her Facebook group members were ready to believe the bogus news links. “People were so anti-Hillary that no matter what you said, they were willing to share it and spread it,” she said. “At first I would just laugh about it. I would say, ‘C’mon, this is beyond ridiculous.’ I created a word called ‘ridiculosity.’ I would say, ‘This reeks of ridiculosity.’”But Cowling got pushback. She was called a “Hillbot” and a Trump supporter. She ended up removing dozens of members who refused to stop pushing conspiracy theories. “I lost quite a few friends,” she said.Matthew Smollon, a 34-year-old copy editor and page designer based in Knoxville, Tennessee, noticed an influx of posts linking to fake news as early as January 2016. So much of it, Smollon noticed, came from the same accounts. Almost all the sites he traced went back to Veles, Macedonia, which Wired magazine has since dubbed the “Fake News Factory to the World.” There wasn’t a single link he found that went to a pro-Clinton fake news story.None of the fake stories stood out to Smollon. He described the Facebook groups as “being in a room filled with blasting televisions.” It was hard to pick out the loudest noises. “The ultimate goal of this wasn’t so much misinformation as distraction from valid info,” he concluded.But Smollon had a hard time convincing other Bernie supporters that they were being played. “No one cared,” Smollon said. “At that point, you were a Hillary shill. It was like an echo chamber of anger.”Even when pointing out that something like NBCPolitics.org was a fake site ― the real site is NBCNews.com/politics ― he drew criticism. He was eventually removed as a moderator from one of the pro-Sanders Facebook groups. “It’s the closest I’ve been to being gaslit in my life,” he said.In June, Smollon posted a piece on Medium with the headline, “Dear Bernie Supporters: Stop sharing posts from dumpster fire websites.” He urged his fellow Sanders fans to wake up:Guys, I sincerely love you. I love your passion. I love your fire. I love all of that. But when 400 people are circle-jerking clickbait links in between wondering how Hillary Clinton is behind the FEMA Earthquake drill that happens on several days with one of them being primary day?Some people “liked” his Medium piece on Facebook and posted it on their walls, he said. Others did not. Smollon later updated his article to say he’d been banned from the group “Bernie Believers” because of it.“This is a pretty solid case for admins/mods being part of the spam,” he wrote. “Not all of them obviously, but it only takes one person running with an ulterior motive to ensure the whole thing goes to shit.”In San Diego, Mattes was intrigued by a Facebook user named “Oliver Mitov” whom he saw constantly posting anti-Clinton propaganda.Mattes first noticed Mitov posting in his Facebook group in September. But when he searched the page’s archives, he found that Mitov had been in the group since late July. He soon realized there wasn’t just one Mitov but four. Three had Sanders as their profile picture. Two had the same single Facebook friend, while a third had no Facebook friends. The fourth appeared to be a middle-aged man with 19 Facebook friends, including that one friend the other Mitovs had in common.All combined, the four Mitovs had joined more than two dozen pro-Sanders groups around the U.S., including Latinos for Bernie Sanders, Oregon for Bernie Sanders 2016 and Pennsylvania Progressives for Bernie Sanders. Together, those groups had hundreds of thousands of members.The Mitov posts would have been explosive if they’d been true. In one Aug. 4 post to Mattes’ page, Mitov wrote, “This is a story you won’t see on Fox/CNN or the other Mainstream media!” He then linked to a post claiming falsely that Clinton had “made a small fortune by arming ISIS.” On Sept. 25, he posted on several pro-Sanders pages a link promising game-changing information: “NEW LEAK: Here is Who Ordered Hillary To Leave The 4 Men In Benghazi!” The link went to a fake news site called usapoliticsnow.com.The aim of Mitov’s activity seemed pretty obvious to Mattes: to depress the number of Sanders supporters who voted for Clinton in November.“He was a ringer,” Mattes said.Mattes tried to friend the various Mitovs and message them. None of them responded, he said. Attempts by HuffPost to reach Mitov were similarly unsuccessful.Keegan Goudiss, who ran digital advertising for Sanders’ presidential bid, had a different perspective on the trolling. He launched paid campaigns on social media and around the internet, so he was very familiar with the way that money can drive a meme.Bots and trolls that spread fake news shouldn’t be ignored, he said, but “it’s like pissing in the ocean. There’s a lot of noise online.” One way to help your message cut through the noise is to spend money with Facebook, Google or an ad targeting platform that spreads links all over the internet, often at the bottom of stories. (Scroll down far enough on this page and you’ll probably see some of them.)Goudiss recalled one telling example of how this worked: A Clinton ad appeared in the middle of a row of links, clearly paid for by a pro-Clinton group targeting potential donors and voters. To its left was a story making bogus claims about an illegitimate Clinton child. To its right was a piece on presidential mistresses. “There seems to have been a concerted effort to tarnish Hillary and people in her campaign’s reputation using paid placement,” he said.He can’t prove who was doing that, Goudiss said, but it’s probably worth trying to figure out.“Was there a Russian entity supporting those websites that popped up?” he said. “That’s important and people deserve to know who influences our democracy.”Some level of foreign participation in spreading disinformation about the left was comically apparent. The names of a few suspect Facebook groups reek of poor translation. One group with more than 80,000 members, claiming to be from Burlington, Vermont, is called “Bernie Sanders Lovers” ― the kind of name a non-English speaker might think makes sense, but that sounds wrong to native ears.Throughout the campaign, the Bernie Sanders Lovers page saw heavy engagement, and nearly every article it shared was from Bients.com, the pieces posted there by one Maximilian Gottlieb. Gottlieb, in turn, pulled articles from other sources, some more and some less reliable.On Oct. 29, for instance, he put up 11 articles. A few praised Trump or gave Trump’s advisers space to attack Clinton. Others attacked Clinton’s campaign directly: adviser Huma Abedin had ties to radical Islam (false), the DNC email leak was authentic (true), campaign manager Robby Mook had deleted his entire Twitter feed (false).Since the election, the Bernie Sanders Lovers page has shifted to urging the senator to run for president again in 2020. It no longer shares Bients.com stories. Instead, they all come from ThePredicted.com. Both sites were registered by a person name Hysen Alimi in Albania. (Feel free to check out the sites yourself, but Chrome will warn you your connection is “not secure,” so don’t enter any information there.)There had been rumblings that the Russians were specifically behind the DNC hack since last June. In early October, the U.S. intelligence community said it was “confident” that President Vladimir Putin’s government had both directed the hack and made sure the emails found their way to WikiLeaks. In January of this year, a more detailed intelligence report concluded that the Russian government had blended covert intelligence operations with overt efforts by, among others, “paid social media users or ‘trolls’” to try to influence the U.S. election.A separate dossier on Russia’s role, assembled by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele and made public by BuzzFeed, claimed that the DNC leak had been an attempt to “swing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hillary Clinton and across to Trump.”“These voters were perceived as activists and anti-status quo and anti-establishment and in that regard sharing many features with the Trump campaign, including a visceral dislike of Clinton,” Steele wrote.The intelligence report also said that the DNC hackers seemed to have financial ties to the Internet Research Agency, a Saint Petersburg, Russia, company that has taken state-sponsored trolling to an industrial level. Its likely financier is “a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,” the report stated.“Russia’s information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history,” wrote The New York Times in a 2015 profile of the firm, “and its target is nothing less than the utility of the Internet as a democratic space.”The “Internet as a democratic space” is the very thing that allowed the energy of the Sanders campaign to snowball into a movement for change. It was also the thing that allowed Oliver Mitov and his ilk to thrive.Could the fake news tsunami have swung the election? It’s impossible to say for sure, but a YouGov survey recently asked people who voted for Sanders in the primary how they thought other people they knew who backed Sanders ended up voting in the general election. Thirteen percent said all of those folks voted for Clinton, and 48 percent said most of them did. But 20 percent said only some, 9 percent said just a few and 4 percent said none voted for Clinton.In the survey, only 7 percent said that most or all of the Bernie people they knew wound up helping raise money or otherwise volunteering for Clinton. Fifty-four percent said that applied to just a few or none of the Bernie people they knew. Sanders backers were by far the most energized element of the Democratic coalition during last year’s campaign. Clinton’s inability to motivate them more broadly to back her candidacy undoubtedly hurt.Asked what they themselves did, 12 percent of those who voted for Sanders said they went on to volunteer or raise money for Clinton. Only 16 percent of those who voted for Clinton in the primary said they also volunteered for her.Of course, the propaganda didn’t create the chasm dividing left-wing voters. The belief that the DNC favored Clinton was widely held. Fifty-eight percent of all the survey respondents agreed on that. Among Democrats, the number was 55 percent. In the Midwest, which essentially elected Trump president, 67 percent agreed. Even 62 percent of those who voted for Clinton in the primary said that the DNC favored her.But the legitimate skepticism opened the door to believing the more demented propaganda. And the more the fake news was passed around, the harder the divisions became. Clinton backers would charge Sanders supporters with being obnoxious, sexist “Bernie bros.” Many of those bros may have been trolls, not real Sanders supporters. Tell that to a Clinton backer, however, and you can be accused of dismissing the hostility they faced.Aidan King set up a popular Reddit page for Sanders beginning in 2013 and went to work for the campaign in January 2016 as Sigala’s deputy. He dealt directly with many of the Facebook groups. After the Democratic convention, he said he noticed a strong shift away from the party in the tone of many of those pages.“I’ve gone back and forth on it,” King said. “I wouldn’t feel comfortable saying with any authority it’s a coordinated effort by trolls, but also wouldn’t feel confident saying it was exclusively pissed-off Bernie supporters.” It might not actually matter if Vladimir Putin or a kid in Macedonia masterminded the flood of fake news. What matters is that it happened ― and it is still happening. People are deliberately seeding misinformation into the left-wing conversation. That’s a real fact. (Trying to measure the size and scope of the operation could make for a useful political science dissertation.)For a wide swath of Sanders backers, the primary is still far too raw to even start to think about Russia. Mentioning foreign sabotage sounds like you’re throwing up a smokescreen to obscure the Democratic establishment’s own failure. But Mattes has tried to argue that two things can be true at once: Clinton was a terrible candidate and Russia intervened in the U.S. election.“It’s wildly distressing that we were played,” Mattes said. UPDATE: March 13 ― The Facebook page “Bernie Sanders Lovers” responded to this article on Sunday, saying: “We were never linked up with Russians and we will never be with them.”“How come that we would write of Trump’s advantage and support him when we are democrats,” the page administrator wrote. “Even though we are democrats we do not support Hillary Clinton. We are not linked with the government to support someone that we do not like, to be encouraged to support someone, but we are those who desire and want progress.”After reading this story, we’re curious what your view is on Russia’s role in the election. Take this brief survey, and we’ll post the results here on Sunday night.CORRECTION: Keegan Goudiss ran digital advertising, not all digital efforts, for Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid."
5,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders' Campaign Faced A Fake News Tsunami. Where Did It Come From?,Ryan Grim and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-fake-news-russia_us_58c34d97e4b0ed71826cdb36,The trolls set out to distract and divide the invigorated left.,2017-03-11,Bernie Sanders' supporters started seeing fake news in early 2016.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c42e0a1e00002a0077f371.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Last June, John Mattes started noticing something coursing like a virus through the Facebook page he helped administer for Bernie Sanders fans in San Diego. People with no apparent ties to California were friending the page and sharing links from unfamiliar sites full of anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda.The stories they posted weren’t the normal complaints he was used to seeing as the Vermont senator and the former secretary of state fought out the Democratic presidential primary. These stories alleged that Clinton had murdered her political opponents and used body doubles.Mattes, 66, had been a television reporter and Senate investigator in previous lives. He put his expertise in unmasking fraudsters to work. At first, he suspected that the sites were created by the old Clinton haters from the ‘90s ― what Hillary Clinton had dubbed “the vast right-wing conspiracy.”But when Mattes started tracking down the sites’ domain registrations, the trail led to Macedonia and Albania. In mid-September, he emailed a few of his private investigator friends with a list of the sites. “Very creepy and i do not think Koch brothers,” he wrote.Mattes and his friends didn’t know what to make of his findings. He couldn’t get his mind around the possibility that trolls overseas might be trying to sway a bunch of Southern Californians who supported Sanders’ run for president. “I may be a dark cynic and I may have been an investigative reporter for a long time, but this was too dark ― and too unbelievable and most upsetting,” he said. “What was I to do with this?”By late October, Mattes said he’d traced 40 percent of the domain registrations for the fake news sites he saw popping up on pro-Sanders pages back to Eastern Europe. Others appeared to be based in Panama and the U.S., or were untraceable. He wondered, “Am I the only person that sees all this crap floating through these Bernie pages?”He wasn’t. Bernie supporters across the country had been noticing dubious websites and posters linked back to Eastern Europe long before Mattes did ― and even before The Washington Post reported in mid-June that Russian government hackers had stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee. They had been warning each other that something weird was going on, posting troll alerts and compiling lists of fake news sites.There is enough real news to fight over, they thought, without arguing over anti-Hillary conspiracy theories from Macedonia.Sometimes it was hard to tell who was doing the trolling and for what purposes. Aleta Pearce, 54, who lives in Malibu, California, was an administrator of half a dozen pro-Sanders Facebook groups and a member of many others. In May 2016, she posted a memo to various Facebook groups about the fake news issue, warning of bogus sites.“The pattern I’m seeing is if a member is repeatedly posting articles that are only from one URL that person is just there to push advertising,” Pearce wrote. “They probably have a sock account with little to no content. They are often from Russia or Macedonia.” (A “sock” or “sock puppet” account uses a false identity to deceive.)Pearce added, “Please share this with other Bernie groups so we can put an end to this spam bombing that’s filling up our pages and groups. It’s time to chase the mice out of the hen house and send them a message. They don’t know who they are messing with.”The first tidal wave of spam was mostly anti-Bernie, Pearce recalled, posted by Clinton backers. (David Brock’s Clinton-backing super PAC had likely paid for some portion of those.) But after Clinton became the Democratic nominee in July, Pearce noticed a switch to anti-Hillary messages with links to fake news and to real news with obnoxious pop-up ads.“Every site publishing those ― you clicked on the article, you would be slammed with ads and strange articles,” Pearce told HuffPost. “It was overwhelming. It was 24/7.”She kept a list of fake news sites to watch for ― it grew into dozens. There were posts on the Clinton-has-Parkinson’s conspiracy and the Clinton-is-running-a-pedophilia-ring-out-of-a-pizza-shop conspiracy.On the Sanders campaign, it was Hector Sigala’s job to connect with all the organic Facebook groups. He recalled seeing “a lot of trolls” try to convince people of something “that was obviously fake.”Many of the interlopers, Sigala said, claimed to be Sanders fans who had decided to vote for GOP nominee Donald Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the general election and tried to convince others to do likewise. “It made it seem like the community as a whole was supporting that, but that wasn’t the case,” he said.Sigala thinks most of them were just your average internet trolls. He said he found many were members of 4chan, a gathering place for the alt-right, white nationalists and plain old nihilists from which has sprung all manner of mischief.The Sanders campaign had begun seeing this particular brand of fake news starting in early 2016. “The first time that we kind of fell for it, for like two minutes, was this link from what seemed to be ABC News,” Sigala said. It turned out to be ABC.com.co, a fake site that has no affiliation with the real news network. It had “reported” that the pope himself had endorsed Sanders.In trying to wade through the flood of fake news, Sanders supporters had some serious trust issues. There was good reason to be skeptical of Clinton and the WikiLeaks dump of DNC emails was real, after all. But a steady diet of stories fabricated out of thin air can also feed into paranoia and flame wars.Bev Cowling, 64, saw a sudden deluge of requests to join the Sanders Facebook groups she administered from her home in Toney, Alabama. All of a sudden, they were getting 80 to 100 requests to join each day. She and the other administrators couldn’t vet everyone, and the posts started getting bizarre. “It came in like a wave, like a tsunami,” she said. “It was like a flood of misinformation.”Cowling, a retired postal worker, said some of her Facebook group members were ready to believe the bogus news links. “People were so anti-Hillary that no matter what you said, they were willing to share it and spread it,” she said. “At first I would just laugh about it. I would say, ‘C’mon, this is beyond ridiculous.’ I created a word called ‘ridiculosity.’ I would say, ‘This reeks of ridiculosity.’”But Cowling got pushback. She was called a “Hillbot” and a Trump supporter. She ended up removing dozens of members who refused to stop pushing conspiracy theories. “I lost quite a few friends,” she said.Matthew Smollon, a 34-year-old copy editor and page designer based in Knoxville, Tennessee, noticed an influx of posts linking to fake news as early as January 2016. So much of it, Smollon noticed, came from the same accounts. Almost all the sites he traced went back to Veles, Macedonia, which Wired magazine has since dubbed the “Fake News Factory to the World.” There wasn’t a single link he found that went to a pro-Clinton fake news story.None of the fake stories stood out to Smollon. He described the Facebook groups as “being in a room filled with blasting televisions.” It was hard to pick out the loudest noises. “The ultimate goal of this wasn’t so much misinformation as distraction from valid info,” he concluded.But Smollon had a hard time convincing other Bernie supporters that they were being played. “No one cared,” Smollon said. “At that point, you were a Hillary shill. It was like an echo chamber of anger.”Even when pointing out that something like NBCPolitics.org was a fake site ― the real site is NBCNews.com/politics ― he drew criticism. He was eventually removed as a moderator from one of the pro-Sanders Facebook groups. “It’s the closest I’ve been to being gaslit in my life,” he said.In June, Smollon posted a piece on Medium with the headline, “Dear Bernie Supporters: Stop sharing posts from dumpster fire websites.” He urged his fellow Sanders fans to wake up:Guys, I sincerely love you. I love your passion. I love your fire. I love all of that. But when 400 people are circle-jerking clickbait links in between wondering how Hillary Clinton is behind the FEMA Earthquake drill that happens on several days with one of them being primary day?Some people “liked” his Medium piece on Facebook and posted it on their walls, he said. Others did not. Smollon later updated his article to say he’d been banned from the group “Bernie Believers” because of it.“This is a pretty solid case for admins/mods being part of the spam,” he wrote. “Not all of them obviously, but it only takes one person running with an ulterior motive to ensure the whole thing goes to shit.”In San Diego, Mattes was intrigued by a Facebook user named “Oliver Mitov” whom he saw constantly posting anti-Clinton propaganda.Mattes first noticed Mitov posting in his Facebook group in September. But when he searched the page’s archives, he found that Mitov had been in the group since late July. He soon realized there wasn’t just one Mitov but four. Three had Sanders as their profile picture.

In one Aug. 4 post to Mattes’ page, Mitov wrote, “This is a story you won’t see on Fox/CNN or the other Mainstream media!” He then linked to a post claiming falsely that Clinton had “made a small fortune by arming ISIS.” On Sept. 25, he posted on several pro-Sanders pages a link promising game-changing information: “NEW LEAK: Here is Who Ordered Hillary To Leave The 4 Men In Benghazi!” The link went to a fake news site called usapoliticsnow.com.The aim of Mitov’s activity seemed pretty obvious to Mattes: to depress the number of Sanders supporters who voted for Clinton in November.“He was a ringer,” Mattes said.Mattes tried to friend the various Mitovs and message them.

It had “reported” that the pope himself had endorsed Sanders.In trying to wade through the flood of fake news, Sanders supporters had some serious trust issues. There was good reason to be skeptical of Clinton and the WikiLeaks dump of DNC emails was real, after all. But a steady diet of stories fabricated out of thin air can also feed into paranoia and flame wars.Bev Cowling, 64, saw a sudden deluge of requests to join the Sanders Facebook groups she administered from her home in Toney, Alabama. All of a sudden, they were getting 80 to 100 requests to join each day. She and the other administrators couldn’t vet everyone, and the posts started getting bizarre. “It came in like a wave, like a tsunami,” she said. “It was like a flood of misinformation.”Cowling, a retired postal worker, said some of her Facebook group members were ready to believe the bogus news links. “People were so anti-Hillary that no matter what you said, they were willing to share it and spread it,” she said. “At first I would just laugh about it. I would say, ‘C’mon, this is beyond ridiculous.’ I created a word called ‘ridiculosity.’ I would say, ‘This reeks of ridiculosity.’”But Cowling got pushback. She was called a “Hillbot” and a Trump supporter. She ended up removing dozens of members who refused to stop pushing conspiracy theories. “I lost quite a few friends,” she said.Matthew Smollon, a 34-year-old copy editor and page designer based in Knoxville, Tennessee, noticed an influx of posts linking to fake news as early as January 2016. So much of it, Smollon noticed, came from the same accounts. Almost all the sites he traced went back to Veles, Macedonia, which Wired magazine has since dubbed the “Fake News Factory to the World.” There wasn’t a single link he found that went to a pro-Clinton fake news story.None of the fake stories stood out to Smollon. He described the Facebook groups as “being in a room filled with blasting televisions.” It was hard to pick out the loudest noises. “The ultimate goal of this wasn’t so much misinformation as distraction from valid info,” he concluded.But Smollon had a hard time convincing other Bernie supporters that they were being played. “No one cared,” Smollon said. “At that point, you were a Hillary shill. It was like an echo chamber of anger.”Even when pointing out that something like NBCPolitics.org was a fake site ― the real site is NBCNews.com/politics ― he drew criticism. He was eventually removed as a moderator from one of the pro-Sanders Facebook groups. “It’s the closest I’ve been to being gaslit in my life,” he said.In June, Smollon posted a piece on Medium with the headline, “Dear Bernie Supporters: Stop sharing posts from dumpster fire websites.” He urged his fellow Sanders fans to wake up:Guys, I sincerely love you. I love your passion. I love your fire. I love all of that. But when 400 people are circle-jerking clickbait links in between wondering how Hillary Clinton is behind the FEMA Earthquake drill that happens on several days with one of them being primary day?Some people “liked” his Medium piece on Facebook and posted it on their walls, he said. Others did not. Smollon later updated his article to say he’d been banned from the group “Bernie Believers” because of it.“This is a pretty solid case for admins/mods being part of the spam,” he wrote. “Not all of them obviously, but it only takes one person running with an ulterior motive to ensure the whole thing goes to shit.”In San Diego, Mattes was intrigued by a Facebook user named “Oliver Mitov” whom he saw constantly posting anti-Clinton propaganda.Mattes first noticed Mitov posting in his Facebook group in September. But when he searched the page’s archives, he found that Mitov had been in the group since late July. He soon realized there wasn’t just one Mitov but four. Three had Sanders as their profile picture. Two had the same single Facebook friend, while a third had no Facebook friends. The fourth appeared to be a middle-aged man with 19 Facebook friends, including that one friend the other Mitovs had in common.All combined, the four Mitovs had joined more than two dozen pro-Sanders groups around the U.S., including Latinos for Bernie Sanders, Oregon for Bernie Sanders 2016 and Pennsylvania Progressives for Bernie Sanders. Together, those groups had hundreds of thousands of members.The Mitov posts would have been explosive if they’d been true. In one Aug. 4 post to Mattes’ page, Mitov wrote, “This is a story you won’t see on Fox/CNN or the other Mainstream media!” He then linked to a post claiming falsely that Clinton had “made a small fortune by arming ISIS.” On Sept. 25, he posted on several pro-Sanders pages a link promising game-changing information: “NEW LEAK: Here is Who Ordered Hillary To Leave The 4 Men In Benghazi!” The link went to a fake news site called usapoliticsnow.com.The aim of Mitov’s activity seemed pretty obvious to Mattes: to depress the number of Sanders supporters who voted for Clinton in November.“He was a ringer,” Mattes said.Mattes tried to friend the various Mitovs and message them. None of them responded, he said. Attempts by HuffPost to reach Mitov were similarly unsuccessful.Keegan Goudiss, who ran digital advertising for Sanders’ presidential bid, had a different perspective on the trolling. He launched paid campaigns on social media and around the internet, so he was very familiar with the way that money can drive a meme.Bots and trolls that spread fake news shouldn’t be ignored, he said, but “it’s like pissing in the ocean. There’s a lot of noise online.” One way to help your message cut through the noise is to spend money with Facebook, Google or an ad targeting platform that spreads links all over the internet, often at the bottom of stories. (Scroll down far enough on this page and you’ll probably see some of them.)Goudiss recalled one telling example of how this worked: A Clinton ad appeared in the middle of a row of links, clearly paid for by a pro-Clinton group targeting potential donors and voters. To its left was a story making bogus claims about an illegitimate Clinton child. To its right was a piece on presidential mistresses. “There seems to have been a concerted effort to tarnish Hillary and people in her campaign’s reputation using paid placement,” he said.He can’t prove who was doing that, Goudiss said, but it’s probably worth trying to figure out.“Was there a Russian entity supporting those websites that popped up?” he said. “That’s important and people deserve to know who influences our democracy.”Some level of foreign participation in spreading disinformation about the left was comically apparent. The names of a few suspect Facebook groups reek of poor translation. One group with more than 80,000 members, claiming to be from Burlington, Vermont, is called “Bernie Sanders Lovers” ― the kind of name a non-English speaker might think makes sense, but that sounds wrong to native ears.Throughout the campaign, the Bernie Sanders Lovers page saw heavy engagement, and nearly every article it shared was from Bients.com, the pieces posted there by one Maximilian Gottlieb. Gottlieb, in turn, pulled articles from other sources, some more and some less reliable.On Oct. 29, for instance, he put up 11 articles. A few praised Trump or gave Trump’s advisers space to attack Clinton. Others attacked Clinton’s campaign directly: adviser Huma Abedin had ties to radical Islam (false), the DNC email leak was authentic (true), campaign manager Robby Mook had deleted his entire Twitter feed (false).Since the election, the Bernie Sanders Lovers page has shifted to urging the senator to run for president again in 2020. It no longer shares Bients.com stories. Instead, they all come from ThePredicted.com. Both sites were registered by a person name Hysen Alimi in Albania. (Feel free to check out the sites yourself, but Chrome will warn you your connection is “not secure,” so don’t enter any information there.)There had been rumblings that the Russians were specifically behind the DNC hack since last June. In early October, the U.S. intelligence community said it was “confident” that President Vladimir Putin’s government had both directed the hack and made sure the emails found their way to WikiLeaks. In January of this year, a more detailed intelligence report concluded that the Russian government had blended covert intelligence operations with overt efforts by, among others, “paid social media users or ‘trolls’” to try to influence the U.S. election.A separate dossier on Russia’s role, assembled by former MI6 agent Christopher Steele and made public by BuzzFeed, claimed that the DNC leak had been an attempt to “swing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hillary Clinton and across to Trump.”“These voters were perceived as activists and anti-status quo and anti-establishment and in that regard sharing many features with the Trump campaign, including a visceral dislike of Clinton,” Steele wrote.The intelligence report also said that the DNC hackers seemed to have financial ties to the Internet Research Agency, a Saint Petersburg, Russia, company that has taken state-sponsored trolling to an industrial level. Its likely financier is “a close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence,” the report stated.“Russia’s information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history,” wrote The New York Times in a 2015 profile of the firm, “and its target is nothing less than the utility of the Internet as a democratic space.”The “Internet as a democratic space” is the very thing that allowed the energy of the Sanders campaign to snowball into a movement for change. It was also the thing that allowed Oliver Mitov and his ilk to thrive.Could the fake news tsunami have swung the election? It’s impossible to say for sure, but a YouGov survey recently asked people who voted for Sanders in the primary how they thought other people they knew who backed Sanders ended up voting in the general election. Thirteen percent said all of those folks voted for Clinton, and 48 percent said most of them did. But 20 percent said only some, 9 percent said just a few and 4 percent said none voted for Clinton.In the survey, only 7 percent said that most or all of the Bernie people they knew wound up helping raise money or otherwise volunteering for Clinton. Fifty-four percent said that applied to just a few or none of the Bernie people they knew. Sanders backers were by far the most energized element of the Democratic coalition during last year’s campaign. Clinton’s inability to motivate them more broadly to back her candidacy undoubtedly hurt.Asked what they themselves did, 12 percent of those who voted for Sanders said they went on to volunteer or raise money for Clinton. Only 16 percent of those who voted for Clinton in the primary said they also volunteered for her.Of course, the propaganda didn’t create the chasm dividing left-wing voters. The belief that the DNC favored Clinton was widely held. Fifty-eight percent of all the survey respondents agreed on that. Among Democrats, the number was 55 percent. In the Midwest, which essentially elected Trump president, 67 percent agreed. Even 62 percent of those who voted for Clinton in the primary said that the DNC favored her.But the legitimate skepticism opened the door to believing the more demented propaganda. And the more the fake news was passed around, the harder the divisions became. Clinton backers would charge Sanders supporters with being obnoxious, sexist “Bernie bros.” Many of those bros may have been trolls, not real Sanders supporters. Tell that to a Clinton backer, however, and you can be accused of dismissing the hostility they faced.Aidan King set up a popular Reddit page for Sanders beginning in 2013 and went to work for the campaign in January 2016 as Sigala’s deputy. He dealt directly with many of the Facebook groups. After the Democratic convention, he said he noticed a strong shift away from the party in the tone of many of those pages.“I’ve gone back and forth on it,” King said. “I wouldn’t feel comfortable saying with any authority it’s a coordinated effort by trolls, but also wouldn’t feel confident saying it was exclusively pissed-off Bernie supporters.” It might not actually matter if Vladimir Putin or a kid in Macedonia masterminded the flood of fake news. What matters is that it happened ― and it is still happening. People are deliberately seeding misinformation into the left-wing conversation. That’s a real fact. (Trying to measure the size and scope of the operation could make for a useful political science dissertation.)For a wide swath of Sanders backers, the primary is still far too raw to even start to think about Russia. Mentioning foreign sabotage sounds like you’re throwing up a smokescreen to obscure the Democratic establishment’s own failure. But Mattes has tried to argue that two things can be true at once: Clinton was a terrible candidate and Russia intervened in the U.S. election.“It’s wildly distressing that we were played,” Mattes said. UPDATE: March 13 ― The Facebook page “Bernie Sanders Lovers” responded to this article on Sunday, saying: “We were never linked up with Russians and we will never be with them.”“How come that we would write of Trump’s advantage and support him when we are democrats,” the page administrator wrote. “Even though we are democrats we do not support Hillary Clinton. We are not linked with the government to support someone that we do not like, to be encouraged to support someone, but we are those who desire and want progress.”After reading this story, we’re curious what your view is on Russia’s role in the election. Take this brief survey, and we’ll post the results here on Sunday night.CORRECTION: Keegan Goudiss ran digital advertising, not all digital efforts, for Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid."

In recent months, however, anti-ISIS militia gains and an increased U.S. presence have appeared to indicate that the operation could finally get underway.U.S. Marines were deployed to the area near Raqqa this week, and ISIS supply routes to the city have been cut off. The group’s leaders are also reportedly fleeing the city in anticipation of the advance, relocating to the relative safety of ISIS-occupied Deir al-Zour province. Thousands of fighters are still estimated to be in the city, however, and the battle is expected to be one of the most challenging yet against the militants.But despite the buildup of anti-ISIS forces and extensive planning, the actual offensive to retake Raqqa may still not be coming soon. Instead, the U.S. is mired in a political standoff as its ostensible allies in the region are at odds with each other over who should assume what role in taking back the city.The divisions highlight that the offensive is important not only to push ISIS out of its de facto capital but also because it threatens to inflame the complex dynamic among the groups vying for power within the Syrian civil war.At the center of the debate is Turkish anger that the U.S. has signaled it plans to arm and back Kurdish YPG forces to take back Raqqa. This is a point of contention for Turkey, which fears that if the YPG gains more power, it could pose a threat or funnel support to Kurdistan Worker’s Party militants who are in a violent conflict with the Turkish government. Turkey opposes the use of YPG (a Kurdish acronym for People’s Protection Units), preferring Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army forces as well as its own military. The problem is that, although the U.S. is allied with both against ISIS, analysts say American officials see the Kurds as the most capable force to take back Raqqa. “We don’t really think we can find a way to liberate Raqqa without the Kurds, short of a huge Turkish intervention ― which is not going to happen ― or a huge American intervention ― which is not going to happen,” said Michael O’Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institute think tank.The U.S. faces a difficult balancing act in trying to assuage Turkish concerns about Kurdish YPG forces while still achieving its goal of booting ISIS from the territory it seized in the early years of the Syrian civil war. These challenges could result in an increased U.S. presence in the conflict, as was demonstrated this week when Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit were sent to the town of Manbij, near Raqqa. The deployment effectively put U.S. forces in the role of peacekeeper, after YPG offensives last month near Manbij blocked Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army advances. The U.S. presence in the town is partly to act as a deterrent to stop any Turkish-led offensive against YPG in the area, which would have further hindered the efforts to target Raqqa.Turkey warned the U.S. on Thursday that relations between the two countries would suffer if Kurdish forces are included in the battle for Raqqa. As a result of this spat, U.S. officials told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the offensive could be delayed until after Turkey’s mid-April referendum. The vote will determine whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will gain greater powers under a U.S.-style executive presidency.The fact that President Donald Trump’s administration is still assessing what its Syria policy will be and is still reviewing its plan on how to fight ISIS adds to this uncertainty surrounding the Raqqa offensive. Despite Trump’s aggressive rhetoric that his administration would take quick action to destroy ISIS, it has not announced any significant changes to current operations. Retaking Raqqa would push the Islamic State out of its greatest stronghold in Syria and back into a relatively small patch of territory in eastern Syria, but it would not be a death blow to the group.The Islamic State and its previous iterations have proved to be a highly adaptable organization despite losses of leadership and territory. Leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi has survived despite frequent reports of his death in airstrikes, and there are still thousands of militants fighting for ISIS.Many of the underlying conditions for the Islamic State’s rise have also not changed, including the multi-faceted Syrian war and the widespread instability it has created. As the heated disputes ahead of the Raqqa offensive demonstrate, these divisions and the conflict will persist even after ISIS is driven out of the city."

Amnesty International, the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Muslim Advocates and the National Bar Association were among the over 150 major organizations to sign an open letter both accusing Trump of fostering an atmosphere of hate and being to slow to condemn crimes motivated by hate.The letter cites a slew of horrific, “hate-based acts of violence or intimidation” in 2017, including the February shooting of two Indian men in Kansas, one of whom died; the burning of four mosques in less than two months; over 100 bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers, synagogues, and Anti-Defamation League offices; the shooting of a Sikh man in Washington; racist graffiti in Connecticut and Oregon; assaults of Latinos in California and New York; and the murders of seven transgender women of color. “While we welcome President Trump’s remarks to the joint session of Congress, where he noted ‘we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,’ it was the first public acknowledgement he had made on specific recent events,” the letter states. “It is clear that the President has been slow to respond to hate incidents, when he has responded at all. We strongly believe the President has a moral obligation to use his bully pulpit to speak out against acts of hatred when they occur.” The letter goes on to say that Trump and his surrogates have “too frequently used rhetoric and proposed and enacted policies that have fostered a hostile environment” toward minorities. “The President cannot condemn hate in one sentence and then in the same speech, promote falsehoods that can lead to bias and hate violence,” it says. Trump has portrayed black Americans as criminals and Mexicans as rapists. He has routinely disparaged Muslims, evaded questions about anti-Semitism, mocked the disabled, bragged about the sexual assault of women, and promised to remove certain protections for LGBTQ people. The Southern Poverty Law Center tracked over 1,000 bias incidents in the month after the Nov. 8 election. In some 37 percent of those incidents, the perpetrators directly referenced either Trump, his campaign slogans or his comments about sexual assault, according to the SPLC.In 2015, hate crimes rose 7 percent, according to the FBI, driven by a 67 percent increase in hate crimes targeting Muslims. The agency has yet to release its numbers for 2016.But while the FBI counted only 5,479 hate crimes in 2015, another government report estimates that number to be significantly higher. A survey by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that there are likely a staggering 260,000 hate crimes annually in America. “We encourage the President, his staff and members of his Cabinet to condemn hate incidents when they happen,” Friday’s letter states. It also urges to the president to “continue the tradition of a White House interagency task force on hate violence, and make available the full resources of the federal government to track and report hate crimes, to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators, and to aid affected communities.”“Our inclusive democracy demands no less,” it said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

Amnesty International, the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Muslim Advocates and the National Bar Association were among the over 150 major organizations to sign an open letter both accusing Trump of fostering an atmosphere of hate and being to slow to condemn crimes motivated by hate.The letter cites a slew of horrific, “hate-based acts of violence or intimidation” in 2017, including the February shooting of two Indian men in Kansas, one of whom died; the burning of four mosques in less than two months; over 100 bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers, synagogues, and Anti-Defamation League offices; the shooting of a Sikh man in Washington; racist graffiti in Connecticut and Oregon; assaults of Latinos in California and New York; and the murders of seven transgender women of color. “While we welcome President Trump’s remarks to the joint session of Congress, where he noted ‘we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms,’ it was the first public acknowledgement he had made on specific recent events,” the letter states. “It is clear that the President has been slow to respond to hate incidents, when he has responded at all. We strongly believe the President has a moral obligation to use his bully pulpit to speak out against acts of hatred when they occur.” The letter goes on to say that Trump and his surrogates have “too frequently used rhetoric and proposed and enacted policies that have fostered a hostile environment” toward minorities. “The President cannot condemn hate in one sentence and then in the same speech, promote falsehoods that can lead to bias and hate violence,” it says. Trump has portrayed black Americans as criminals and Mexicans as rapists. He has routinely disparaged Muslims, evaded questions about anti-Semitism, mocked the disabled, bragged about the sexual assault of women, and promised to remove certain protections for LGBTQ people. The Southern Poverty Law Center tracked over 1,000 bias incidents in the month after the Nov. 8 election. In some 37 percent of those incidents, the perpetrators directly referenced either Trump, his campaign slogans or his comments about sexual assault, according to the SPLC.In 2015, hate crimes rose 7 percent, according to the FBI, driven by a 67 percent increase in hate crimes targeting Muslims. The agency has yet to release its numbers for 2016.But while the FBI counted only 5,479 hate crimes in 2015, another government report estimates that number to be significantly higher. A survey by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that there are likely a staggering 260,000 hate crimes annually in America. “We encourage the President, his staff and members of his Cabinet to condemn hate incidents when they happen,” Friday’s letter states. It also urges to the president to “continue the tradition of a White House interagency task force on hate violence, and make available the full resources of the federal government to track and report hate crimes, to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators, and to aid affected communities.”“Our inclusive democracy demands no less,” it said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "

They dressed up as Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson, the NASA pioneers who were the focus of the film “Hidden Figures,” as well as Amelia Earhart, Mae Jemison, Hillary Clinton, Condoleezza Rice, Celia Cruz, Madam CJ Walker, Lucille Ball, Whoopi Goldberg and Girl Scouts’ founder, Juliette Gordon Low.Rather than just talking to girls about women’s history, the organization wanted to give them a chance to walk in the shoes of the 11 iconic women who broke barriers in their fields, according to Andrea Bastiani Archibald, Chief Girl and Parent Expert at Girl Scouts of the USA.According to Bastiani Archibald, the girls not only had a great time playing and laughing at the shoot, but they were truly inspired by the boundary-shattering women they were portraying. “It wasn’t just a dress up day: each of them learned the stories behind these iconic women, and honored their achievements. They truly became that woman for a while – they walked out of that shoot a little more inspired, confident, and assured of their own strength,” she told The Huffington Post. Bastiani Archibald says that this is the message that the Girl Scouts wish to broadcast to the world with their photo shoot. “We want every girl to know she can be a leader, shatter ceilings, and make a difference in the world. Girl Scouts are making history every single day, and they become the history-makers of tomorrow as well,” she said. Judging by the photos, these girls are off to a great start. "

19,POLITICS,"Energy Star Is Cheap, Popular And Saves Billions Of Dollars. Trump Wants To Gut It.",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-energy-star_us_58c2e96be4b0ed71826c70ef,Privatizing the $57 million program could upend entire industries and kneecap cities' efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.,2017-03-10,"An Energy Star logo is seen on washing machine displayed for sale at a Conn's Inc. HomePlus store in Knoxville, Tennessee.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c2ee911e00003f0077f10d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past 25 years, the federal government’s Energy Star program has become a valuable marker for all kinds of industries. Real estate agents upsell buildings that have been Energy Star-certified as energy efficient. Homeowners seek out its blue logo on electricity-guzzling appliances and devices. But the White House has proposed eliminating funding for Energy Star and instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to “begin developing legislative options and associated groundwork for transferring ownership and implementation of Energy Star to a non-governmental entity,” according to a draft budget the energy news service E&E News obtained this week. The cuts come as part of President Donald Trump administration’s effort to channel federal spending away from a variety of other programs and toward a $54 billion military buildup. But Energy Star helps save even more than the $57 million that the federal government spends on it each year, according to more than a dozen business executives, building consultants and energy advocates The Huffington Post interviewed this week. Energy Star is a voluntary initiative that has a number of different aspects. It includes a certification program for appliances, electronics and lighting; an evaluation system for rating the efficiency of homes and buildings; a program that trains engineers in energy efficiency; and an award series for eco-friendly small businesses. Nine major cities and a handful of states require landlords to report energy and water efficiency per Energy Star standards as part of their building codes.Energy Star has slashed $430 billion off utility bills and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 2.7 billion tons since its inception, according to 2015 estimates.“It’s such a win for our economy and such a huge return on investment of federal dollars,” said Kateri Callahan, president of the nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy. “It’s penny wise and pound foolish to look at reducing funding, let alone defunding the program or stopping it completely.” For builders, Energy Star provides a standard to measure the energy efficiency of their properties. For landlords and building managers, free Portfolio Manager software launched under the initiative helps monitor energy and water use and shave hundreds off utility bills. For engineers, the program offers guidelines on indoor lighting, plumbing, ventilation, heating and cooling, ensuring that their structures waste as little electricity, heating gas and water as possible.“There are three stages of a project: Where are you now? Where do you want to be? And what steps do you have to take to get there?” said Glenn Tanner, principal engineer at a Torrance, California-based green engineering design firm called MEP. “Energy Star’s benchmark is the first way to find out where you are. You can’t make improvements if you haven’t measured where you are.”Having a single national Energy Star standard is also helpful. “You can compare your building in New York to somebody else’s building in Houston to another in Chicago or Detroit and know where you stand,” said Jim Newman, who runs a green building consultancy out his home in the Detroit area.Real estate agents also like Energy Star because they can advertise certified houses ― which are 30 percent more efficient than average homes ― on their eco-friendly and cost-saving merits. And as banks remain wary of lending to homebuyers with poor credit a decade after the real estate bubble burst, energy-efficient homes provide some potential reprieve. People who live in more efficient homes are 32 percent less likely to default on their mortgages, according to a 2013 study, in part because up to 15 percent of household spending can end up paying for utilities.“If you’re talking about affordable housing and vulnerable populations out there, these kinds of things make a huge difference,” said Dan Teague, vice president of business development at the Wegowise, a software company that helps building owners track utility and water data using Energy Star benchmarks. “It can be the difference between paying rent and paying utilities.” Energy Star has become a well-known brand since it was first created in 1992. A 2015 survey by the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, a utility-backed group, found that 83 percent of American households recognized the brand without visual aid. The ubiquity of Energy Star has made it easier for people to identify energy-efficient appliances.EPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine declined to comment “at this early stage in the process.”That isn’t to say the program doesn’t have faults. The certification process is susceptible to fraud, according to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report. GAO’s investigators were able to obtain certifications for 15 bogus products ― including a “geothermal heat pump” and a “gas-powered alarm clock” described as being “the size of a small generator.” Soon after, Energy Star began requiring third-party certification of energy savings on appliances, a rule that rankled manufacturers who said it placed an undue burden on them. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers criticized the EPA last year for issuing stricter qualifications for Energy Star refrigerators and freezers than the Department of Energy, which provides $7 million of the program’s budget. The EPA pays for the other $50 million. The program has endured years of attacks by ring-wing commentators and conspiracy peddlers who depict Energy Star as yet another weapon in the arsenal of environmental culture war bogeymen. Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh waged what became known as the “light bulb wars” after Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, aimed at increasing energy efficiency and reducing use of fossil fuels. Conservative pundits falsely accused lawmakers of seeking to ban incandescent bulbs to bolster LED lighting, which uses 75 percent less energy and lasts up to 25 times longer. Beck’s rancor on the issue reached such a pitch that his website The Blaze at one point addressed rumors that the media mogul threatened to fire employees who bought energy-saving bulbs or biodegradable utensils. Consumer demand ultimately anointed energy-saving lighting as the victor. The global LED industry is forecast to grow to $33.1 billion in 2017 from $29.6 billion the previous year, with 52 percent of the market, according to a report by the research firm TrendForce. Yet conservative pundits continue to pooh-pooh renewable fuels and energy-saving technology by condemning what they call government attempts to “pick winners and losers.” “There is a philosophy that consumers will make the right decision on their own accord; if they’re really going to save money, they’ll buy efficient products,” Callahan said. “But there’s a lack of information out there that acts as a market disturbance.”There are alternatives. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers offers certification in building design, energy assessment and facility management, but charges annual membership fees. Another nonprofit called Architecture 2030 provides green design and engineering training and software as well as public-private partnership programs. But both initiatives lack the breadth or international name recognition of Energy Star. Private alternatives also lack the access to international markets provided by Energy Star’s partnerships with regulators in Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, Taiwan, the European Union and the European Free Trade Association, which includes Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. “There are other things that can take its place, but it’s going to take a while,” Newman said. “And they’re going to be more expensive to do.”Privatizing Energy Star could kneecap cities’ efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. Residential and commercial buildings account for about 39 percent of the U.S. carbon footprint, making it the largest source of planet-warming gases. Metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Minneapolis and New York City require landlords to benchmark their buildings to Energy Star standards as a means of reducing emissions. “Despite a sea of competition among private groups that want to rate your building, people all fall back on the government one because they trust is and, at the moment, it’s free,” said Christopher Cayten, a principal at the New York-based environmental consultancy CodeGreen Solutions. “That means it’s free to comply with these laws to benchmark buildings.” “If a fee is put in place to use this tool, people may have to revisit even having benchmark requirements in cities,” he added. “Cities can’t force you to use a private tool.” That may be a low priority for the White House. Trump pledged to bolster U.S. economic growth by macheteing environmental regulations he blames for strangling fossil fuel industries and hampering manufacturing. Earlier this month, he proposed cutting the EPA budget by 20 percent and pink-slipping 1 in 5 employees, essentially crippling its enforcement division. Despite irrefutable evidence, the president has repeatedly smeared climate science, suggesting that the idea of humans contributing to global warming is “a hoax.” As one of its first acts under the new administration, the EPA halted a request for oil and gas drillers to report emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas 40 times more potent than carbon dioxide. “When you save energy, in addition to saving consumers’ money, you also benefit the environment and create jobs,” said Lowell Ungar, senior policy adviser at the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “In the end, this is a program to help people save money. That’s why it’s so popular. It’s about helping real people.”This article was updated with a comment from the EPA."

Despite irrefutable evidence, the president has repeatedly smeared climate science, suggesting that the idea of humans contributing to global warming is “a hoax.” As one of its first acts under the new administration, the EPA halted a request for oil and gas drillers to report emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas 40 times more potent than carbon dioxide. “When you save energy, in addition to saving consumers’ money, you also benefit the environment and create jobs,” said Lowell Ungar, senior policy adviser at the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. “In the end, this is a program to help people save money. That’s why it’s so popular. It’s about helping real people.”This article was updated with a comment from the EPA."

A new podcast has also included an assertion that he was being held hostage in his own home by a housekeeper. “Missing Richard Simmons,” by Dan Taberski, features an interview with a former assistant who made the accusation about a maid still on Simmons’ staff.But after investigators made a welfare visit to Simmons’ home, LAPD detective Kevin Becker called the allegation “garbage.”“There was something about his housekeeper holding him hostage and not allowing people to see him and preventing him from making phone calls, and it was all garbage, and that’s why we went out to see him,” Becker told People. “None of it is true. The fact of the matter is, we went out and talked to him, he is fine, nobody is holding him hostage. He is doing exactly what he wants to do. If he wants to go out in public or see anybody, he will do that.”The detective continued: “He is perfectly fine and he is very happy. I don’t know what he is going to do, but right now he is doing what he wants to do and it is his business.”Simmons’ longtime representative, Tom Estey, had already insisted that Simmons merely wanted a break from public life.The fitness guru thanked his followers on Facebook and through a spokesperson when his iconic Beverly Hills gym Slimmons, opened in 1974, closed in November. But the “Sweatin’ to the Oldies” video star has not been seen in public since February 2014, according to the “Missing Richard Simmons” podcast.The LAPD’s revelation comes amid a report (watch above) from Entertainment Tonight in which Simmons’ former massage therapist, Mauro Oliveira, who also made the hostage claim, said Simmons had stopped talking to many old friends."

Abigail Klem, who took over as president of the brand after President Donald Trump’s daughter stepped down in January, said the company has seen near-unprecedented success since last month.“Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,” Klem said in a statement. “For several different retailers Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the [brand’s] best performance ever.”While the company does not publicly share sales figures, recent market research reports backed up Klem’s statement. Lyst, a British e-commerce website that sells thousands of different brands, said sales of Ivanka Trump products increased 346 percent between January and February, while sales of the brand are up 557 percent over last year. Ivanka Trump was the site’s 11th most popular brand in February, up from 550th in January. “To see such an extreme spike in one month is completely unheard of and came as a huge surprise to us,” Lyst spokeswoman Sarah Tanner told the BBC earlier this week. Market research firm Slice Intelligence, which tracks purchases from 4.4 million consumers who have allowed the firm to analyze their email receipts, saw a 207 percent increase in purchases of Ivanka Trump products between January and February. (The same firm reported a 26 percent drop in the brand’s sales in January over the same month of the previous year.) Amazon, one of the most high-profile retailers carrying Ivanka Trump products, did not immediately respond to a request for sales figures for the brand. However, Ivanka Trump perfume is currently the website’s best-selling fragrance.And a company spokesperson said sales of the brand were up by 21 percent in 2016 over the previous year’s sales. That spike may be attributable to increased public interest in the Trump family over the last year. The February sales surge coincided with the president’s first month in office, during which Ivanka Trump made multiple high-profile appearances, including at the inauguration and the president’s address to a joint session of Congress. The surge also came after several stores, including Nordstrom, dropped or stopped promoting the clothing line amid calls for boycotts against companies that sell Trump family products.Following Nordstrom’s announcement, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway urged consumers to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” “I’m going to give a free commercial here,” she said Feb. 9 during an appearance on “Fox & Friends.” “Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”Many ethics experts condemned Conway’s remarks, and the Office of Government Ethics called on the White House to discipline her for potentially violating a rule prohibiting officials from using their positions of power to promote products. However, the White House declined to penalize Conway, arguing the comment was made “in a light, off-hand manner.”The president himself attacked Nordstrom for dropping Ivanka Trump products, tweeting that the department store chain treated his daughter “unfairly.”"
25,POLITICS,Democrats Demand That DeVos Explain How She Is Going To Protect Trans Students,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/devos-trans-students_us_58c2cdffe4b054a0ea6a3fe5,"DeVos has said she is committed to protecting all students, but these senators think her actions speak louder than her words.",2017-03-10,Democratic senators are asking Betsy DeVos to step up for the protection of all students.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c2cf3c270000330074944e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Weeks after President Donald Trump’s administration rescinded an Obama administration guidance protecting transgender students, a group of Democratic senators are demanding that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos explain how she plans to defend the rights of these children. Several Democrats on the Senate Committee for Health, Education, Labor and Pensions sent DeVos a letter Friday asking for a briefing with her to better understand how she will enforce civil rights for all students. The letter headed by Senator Patty Murray (D-Wash.) also featured prominent Democratic co-signers like Sens. Al Franken (Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.). Their message expressed outrage at the secretary’s decision to rescind the guidance, and says the move has sent schools around the country into a tailspin of confusion. The letter also asks DeVos to respond to written questions over how she plans to enforce Title IX for all students by the end of March.The letter comes after a whirlwind week for transgender students and their families. On Monday, the Supreme Court decided not to rule on the case of Gavin Grimm, a Virginia teen whose school does not allow him to use the bathroom that is consistent with his gender identity. The Supreme Court cited Trump’s decision to revoke the guidance as a factor in its decision. On Wednesday, a small group of LGBTQ organizations, families and students met with DeVos to inform her of the challenges and discrimination transgender children face in schools. DeVos has not made her opinions on this issue clear. While she has publicly stood by the decision to revoke the Obama guidance, calling it an example of federal overreach, various reports say that she privately opposed the move. The letter from the senators addresses these rumors, saying that “the suggestion that the Department jeopardized the health or well-being of any student because of political pressure is extremely alarming.”DeVos has repeatedly said that she still plans to make sure LGBTQ children are provided with a safe learning environment. In a statement released following the rescission, DeVos said the “this is an issue best solved at the state and local level.” She has also emphasized her commitment to fulfilling a federal mandate and “moral obligation” to protect all children. However, the letter from senators also call these statements misleading and deeply problematic considering the recent repeal. Senators are now pressing DeVos to explain how transgender students have been made safer through the revoking of Obama’s guidance, as well as how the withdrawal of this guidance is compatible with her department’s “federal mandate” and “moral obligation” to defend students. It also asks for her to elucidate how the decision to revoke this guidance was made and whether or not any transgender people were consulted in the process.Further, the senators press her on how the Department’s Office of Civil Rights will make sure transgender students’ rights are protected. “By revoking the transgender guidance, you have put the safety and well-being of transgender students at risk,” the senators wrote in the letter.After meeting with DeVos Wednesday, parents of transgender students told The Huffington Post that DeVos was attentive and respectful of their concerns. The secretary also said in a statement that she was “grateful for the opportunity to speak directly with these families, students and community leaders,” adding that she is “committed to advocating for and fighting on behalf of all students.”"

Penguin is slated to publish the as-yet-untitled book in early 2018. HBO will follow with a mini-series directed by Jay Roach, who also directed the network’s adaptation of Game Change. The Game Change film centered around former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin joining the Republican ticket, while the book also covered former President Barack Obama’s rise, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s fall in the Democratic primary, and the tabloid saga of former Democratic Sen. John Edwards. There was no HBO series based on Double Down, which covered Obama’s comparatively less cinematic re-election contest against Mitt Romney. Halperin and Heilemann, two veteran political journalists, should be able to find plenty of drama in the 2016 election, given President Donald Trump’s unprecedented and chaotic campaign and shocking victory.The struggle for the authors will be to unearth new details from the Trump and Clinton campaigns to distinguish their work from the saturated news coverage and other postmortems. Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, authors of a book on Clinton’s tenure at the State Department, are slated to publish their campaign-focused book, Shattered, in April. NBC News correspondent Katy Tur, who traversed the country covering Trump’s insurgent candidacy, is writing a memoir. Still, the pair managed to reconstruct closed-door scenes and find newsy nuggets from the 2008 campaign for Game Change in early 2010. They have longstanding relationships with major politicians and operatives, evident from 2016 bookings for their late Bloomberg News show, “With All Due Respect,” and Showtime series, “The Circus.” And the authors also have experience getting access to Trump, though they faced criticism during the campaign for not aggressively challenging the candidate during the campaign. In a statement, HBO Films President Len Amato said the project “promises to vividly capture the most unique and impactful event in modern American politics.” Halperin went as far on election night on “The Late Show” to describe Trump’s victory as “the most cataclysmic event the country has ever seen” outside of the Civil War, World War II and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. When returning to the show Wednesday, Halperin joked that he “might have understated it.”"
27,POLITICS,"Democrats' Letters Ask For Answers About Trump's Conflicts, Ethics And Michael Flynn",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-conflicts-of-interest-democrats-letters_us_58c31037e4b0ed71826cb1e7,The lawmakers want answers but have few ways to get them.,2017-03-10,"Trump International Hotel property, formerly the Old Post Office Pavilion, in Washington, D.C., is leased from the General Services Administration.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c3144a1d000037037cdc6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration’s conflicts of interest and ethics missteps have been a boon for the congressional letter-writing industry. The first week of March featured no less than five official letters sent by Democratic lawmakers asking for more information on the multitude of controversies swirling around President Donald Trump and his team.Without the power to hold hearings and issue subpoenas that comes with majority control in Congress, Democratic lawmakers have practically no legal means of obtaining information about subjects they deem important. Writing letters to agencies and the White House asking for information about particular issues is one way they can seek and publicize their pursuit of that information. The boom in letters also highlights the many areas where information is lacking from the Trump administration.The letters show that questions are still unanswered about Trump’s ethics and lobbying executive orders, the lease between Trump’s company and the General Services Administration, the protection of overseas Trump-branded properties, and the failure of White House aide and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner to divest from business holdings that could present conflicts of interest. Some of these letters followed up on previous requests for information while others asked questions that had not yet been directed to the administration.The letter from Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) is a new inquiry. The three senators sent a letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday asking if the three departments are providing or plan to provide extra security for Trump-branded properties in foreign countries.The president’s name is publicly displayed on properties in Turkey, Dubai, the Philippines, India, Canada, South Korea, Ireland and the United Kingdom. These properties are not secured in the same way as overseas U.S. government properties.“An act of terrorism on one of these properties could potentially lead him to take actions in his official capacity that he would not take if the property were not owned by his organization,” the senators warn.They want to know if federal resources are being used to secure these buildings or if there are internal discussions about doing so. The letter also asks whether the three federal agencies are renting or have purchased space in any of the president’s properties.Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) sent a letter Tuesday to the inspector general for the General Services Administration as a follow-up to two unanswered letters. The DeFazio and Johnson letter asks Carol Ochoa, the inspector general, to launch an investigation into the GSA’s management of the lease that Trump holds to operate a hotel out of the GSA-owned Old Post Office Pavilion.“Because President Trump failed to transfer or eliminate his controlling interest in the property prior to his inauguration, he is now able to negotiate new and favorable financial terms with the Administrator he appoints,” the letter reads. “Left unchecked, this arrangement is fraught with the possibility that President Trump and his children will enrich themselves at taxpayers’ expense. This is simply untenable.”Trump’s D.C. hotel is the most clear-cut example of a conflict of interest he created by not divesting or separating himself from his business. He is now in a position where, as president, he is both the landlord and the tenant. His children will participate in annual negotiations with the GSA that will affect how much they pay and their tax bill. Trump will also appoint a new administrator of the GSA to oversee his own lease. The president and his hotel were sued on Thursday by a nearby restaurant for unfair competition.It is not just the president’s conflicts of interest that Democrats want answers about. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent a letter to the White House counsel’s office on Wednesday asking what assets Kushner has divested from. The letter follows a report by ProPublica that Kushner has not fully divested himself of assets that could create conflicts of interest. The report added that Kushner’s ownership stake in buildings that receive public housing money from the Department of Housing and Urban Development has led him to recuse himself from policy discussions related to the department.The other two letters sent this week from Democratic offices concern executive orders related to ethics. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) sent a letter to the White House asking whether the administration plans to continue the Obama administration’s practice of publicly disclosing ethics documents and annual reports that show any waivers provided for ethics rules imposed by executive orders issued by both President Barack Obama and Trump.“The annual reports disclose whether the Ethics Pledge has been waived for any appointees, and if so, the names of those receiving the waivers and whether the waivers were handed out appropriately,” Tester wrote.Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) sent a letter to the White House on Thursday to ask whether Trump’s executive order placing a lifetime ban on administration officials from lobbying for foreign governments will apply to retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser. Flynn was fired by Trump for lying about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. On Wednesday, Flynn retroactively registered as a foreign agent for work he did for a Turkish client prior to the election. Trump’s executive order gives the president the power to waive any of its lobbyist bans for individuals.“I urge you to publicly certify that neither you, nor any member of your administration, have waived or will waive the restrictions imposed on administration officials from engaging in any activity on behalf of any foreign government or foreign political party for former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn,” Pascrell requested.It’s unclear if the administration will answer any of these questions."

Dean Heller (R-Nev.) is an example of a Republican who could be in trouble if the GOP's replacement plan for Obamacare passes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1d3391e00003f0077ee11.jpeg?ops=crop_0_242_3500_1786%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― If President Donald Trump and Republicans make good on their promise to angry rural voters to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, those voters may wind up a lot angrier.And it won’t be good for their health or for the electoral prospects of the GOP.Democrats, at least, certainly think so, and are looking at both fresh polling data and history for evidence that the GOP’s repeal and replace effort will also repeal Republican control of Congress.For Jill Hanauer, who runs the progressive election research and strategy outfit Project New America, the landscape is starting to remind her of Colorado in 2004, when Democrats did especially well, running in part on a health care message.“The way we really won in Republican-leaning districts of the state legislature was talking about the specifics of health care ― particularly breast cancer and prostate cancer and other cancer screenings and other prevention,” Hanauer recently told The Huffington Post. “Thirteen years later, those same issues are, I believe, going to tear this party potentially apart if they don’t smell the coffee.”Two things back up Hanauer’s opinion. One is polling.A survey her group commissioned with Myers Research delved into Nevada, where Republican Sen. Dean Heller faces a battle for re-election in 2018. First, the poll found Trump’s approval ratings are under water, at 42 percent positive versus 50 percent negative. Heller comes out even worse, at just 33 percent favorable and 53 percent unfavorable.Rebecca Lambe, the senior Democratic strategist widely credited with engineering electoral success in Nevada under former Sen. Harry Reid, said the problem for Heller is that while voters still see Trump as someone they sent to Washington to shake up the system, Heller is part of that system.“Nevada voters will not be giving Dean Heller that same benefit of the doubt they are offering to Trump, as they still see him as part of the problem in Washington,” Lambe said. Hanauer pointed to findings from the survey that suggest voters will give Heller even less love if he helps carry out the repeal bid, especially if the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is replaced by the proposal currently moving through the House of Representatives.“Overwhelmingly, Nevada voters are supportive of the specific components of the ACA, with as many as 9-in-10 saying that any replacement should not turn back the clock on coverage and put insurance companies in charge again,” the analysis accompanying the polling data says.The second thing that should worry Republicans, Hanauer and Democrats say, is the emerging reality of the GOP’s health care plan ― and the impact it will have on Trump voters.The centrist group Third Way estimated in a report released Thursday that 2.2 million Trump voters will be worse off under Republican leaders’ proposed American Health Care Act. Many of those voters are rural and white.Independent analysts see similar outcomes.“Low-income people in rural areas would get hit particularly hard under the House GOP health care bill,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.One way rural voters get hit is through the fact that tax credits proposed under the Republican health care plan are not as generous as those under Obamacare. For instance, in the Reno, Nevada, market, a 60-year-old person who earns $40,000 would get almost $2,000 less to buy health insurance in 2020, a Kaiser Foundation analysis found. Nationally, the average cost hike for that person is nearly $3,000, and in some locales, such as Mobile, Alabama, the difference is an eye-popping $6,000. Another way lower-income white voters could be hurt is by Medicaid cuts that harm rural hospitals, many of which are already on shaky ground. The bill aims to give states more flexibility in how hospitals spend Medicaid, but it also caps spending growth at a rate lower than the inflation index for health care.“Flexibility is one thing, but when it comes with fewer dollars, that constrains the ability of states to provide coverage and adequate financial protection for hospitals,” Levitt said. And with fewer people able to afford insurance, such hospitals would likely face greater uncompensated expenses treating people who can’t pay.Democrats predict a grim future for the GOP in which voters will punish them for taking away things they like.“This isn’t just unique to Nevada,” Hanauer said. “This is a Republican Party federal problem. Their voters voted to shake up Washington, not blow up government as we know it, certainly not blow up the key things voters care about.”Heller is certainly aware of the danger in his state, and has not yet embraced the GOP plan, though he still rails against the Affordable Care Act.“Obamacare is failing millions of Americans. Sen. Heller supports delivering more access, better benefits, and lower costs to Nevadans,” said Heller spokesman Neal Patel. “This bill is a little over two days old. It’s still working its way through the House. The senator will be monitoring it closely. ‎He will continue to work with the Governor to advocate for Nevadans who depend on Medicaid, while also tackling the problems caused by Obamacare.”Heller will probably have to do more than monitor closely. He may have to oppose his party, because many of his colleagues ― even ones who represent large rural populations ― are determined to proceed with the GOP’s repeal and replace plan.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told HuffPost that the Medicaid system and the expansion under Obamacare is already a failure, and that states would be able to do more with less ― in the form of block grants ― if they get more flexibility.“If you continue to expand Medicaid, in my opinion, based on the model that we’re using now, you’re just putting paint on rotten wood,” Kennedy said. He derided the attempts of Louisiana’s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, to embrace Obamacare. “He believes in more free stuff. You can’t give him enough free stuff. As long as somebody else is paying for it, he’ll take a dozen of them,” Kennedy said. “I don’t mean any disrespect, but I’ve know John Bel for a long time. I’m not interested in more free stuff. We can’t afford more free stuff.”There are signs Republicans are concerned about the downsides of following through with Obamacare repeal, however.Four senators, including West Virginia Republican Shelley Moore Capito, signed a letter saying they would oppose anything that rolled back expanded Medicaid coverage in their states.“I still have remaining questions, particularly on the Medicaid expansion side, but I feel like it’s gelling and we’re moving in a direction where those 184,000 people that I’ve been talking about are going to be able to stay insured and have a stable transition period,” Moore Capito told HuffPost. But she still allowed that she has concerns. “I’m worried on any negativity that could obviously be more targeted towards a rural or older state because that is where I live and the folks I live with,” Moore Capito said."

32,POLITICS,Dean Heller Raising Money Off Random Guy’s 3-Year-Old Mean Tweet,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dean-heller-fundraising_us_58c3120ce4b054a0ea6aae6d,The GOP senator claims he's the target of a vast left-wing conspiracy. It's more like a handful of Twitter trolls complaining to whoever will listen.,2017-03-10,Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) is raising money off of mean tweets.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c314da1e00003f0077f1d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The campaign for Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) sent out an email Thursday night urging supporters to give him money in the face of a massive and coordinated left-wing attack.But really, Heller is just fundraising off of a handful of mean tweets, including one that’s three years old and by a random guy with a couple of hundred followers.“We’ve seen a remarkable stream of emails of support from friends like you upset about the over-the-top attacks against Dean, and we hear you,” begins the email from Heller’s campaign, flagged by a Nevada reporter. “These outbursts and orchestrated messages are part of a coordinated left wing campaign across the country.” The email highlights this tweet by @jefsauce, aka “Tim, hi.” It’s from April 2014. “Their opposition to common sense ideas like school choice and smaller government have brought on this excessive aggression,” the email continues. “When you’ve been enabled by big government for so long, clearly you will [sic] they say and do anything to protect it.”“That’s why I’m reaching out earlier than we have ever needed to before,” it adds. “Will you contribute $25, $50, or even $100 to fight the attacks?”It’s unclear why @jefsauce tweeted his message three years ago. When The Huffington Post’s Ryan Grim asked him on Twitter, he said he didn’t remember. But @jefsauce noticed that Heller was using his old tweet to raise money, which prompted this response on Friday:”Well it’s certainly silly that a public figure would still be upset about a three-year-old tweet from a nobody like me,” the person behind @jefsauce told HuffPost. “I just hope that if he made any money off my content, I see my fair cut of it. Thanks!”Jeremy Hughes, a consultant to Heller’s campaign, said the screenshot of the fundraising letter didn’t show that the tweet was actually part of a GIF that rotated among three tweets and a photo of people protesting the senator. The 2014 tweet erroneously ended up in the mix, he said, as the two other tweets were from February 2017. Here’s the GIF:Heller campaign spokesman Tommy Ferraro added that he has a document with “30 or so more” mean tweets from February.“There were dozens of vulgar tweets from last month to choose from,” he said.Heller is up for re-election in 2018 and is one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans.This story has been updated to include comments from Heller’s campaign."
33,POLITICS,Trump’s Immigration Crackdown Would Burn Billions Of Dollars DHS Doesn’t Have,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-crackdown-dhs_us_58c3161be4b0ed71826cb762,A giant wall and massive staff increases sound like expensive wishful thinking.,2017-03-10,"The U.S.-Mexico border wall is shown on July 8, 2012, in Nogales, Arizona. Several hundred miles' worth of barriers already separate the United States and Mexico, but it isn't enough for President Donald Trump.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c318c527000038007495a1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has promised a “big, beautiful wall” between the United States and Mexico and a massive crackdown on illegal immigration.Now, Congress will have to decide whether to pay for it. A flurry of executive orders released during Trump’s first few weeks in office ordered the Department of Homeland Security to come up with the plan to erect more border fencing, and to hire 5,000 Border Patrol agents and 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The president wants authorities to scrap the so-called “catch and release” of recent border crossers, instead detaining every single person until they can be deported. Leaked memos obtained by MSNBC appear to indicate DHS is considering a plan to increase immigrant detention bed space by nearly 500 percent. Any one of those policies would send DHS’ budget skyrocketing and saddle the department with decades’ worth of long-term costs. But neither the wall nor the personnel increases would do much to raise the overall level of deportations, many experts say ― which means Trump’s plans sound more like expensive wishful thinking than a blueprint for effective enforcement. “It’s billions and billions and billions of dollars,” John Sandweg, the former acting director of ICE, told The Huffington Post. “It’s 100 percent not feasible under the current funding levels.”The border wall alone, as proposed, would cost more than $20 billion, according to a DHS estimate. That figure already tops the combined annual budgets of ICE and Customs and Border Protection. Congress would have to fund such a large-ticket item outside the department’s normal budget requests. But Trump’s proposed hiring binge could prove even more expensive. The salaries alone for 5,000 more Border Patrol agents and 10,000 ICE agents would add nearly $1 billion to the DHS annual budget. And salaries are just the most obvious cost, according to Sandweg. Agents with both Border Patrol and ICE go through months of training. The agency’s academies would have to be expanded to accommodate thousands of new recruits. Once in the field, they would also need office space, weapons and vehicles ― all on the government’s dime.Federal workers also receive generous benefits, including annual raises and pensions. So the costs of the added personnel would continue to balloon as time goes on. A Politico report from January estimated the additional 10,000 ICE agents would add some $3.9 billion to DHS’ budget annually. An undated CBP estimate puts the hiring costs at more than $2 billion over the next two years, a figure that includes hiring only a small portion of the proposed 5,000 agents. “Every year the cost goes up,” Gil Kerlikowske, the last to head CBP under President Barack Obama, told HuffPost. “Health care. Retirement. Project that 15 years on. It’s a tremendous cost and one that continues well past retirement.”Border Patrol hasn’t even been able to keep the staff it has a budget to pay for. Kerlikowske left office in January with 1,200 open positions needing to be backfilled. Finding qualified applicants who can pass security screenings and speak Spanish, and who are willing to live in remote border towns and accept salaries lower than those paid to ICE agents, is always a challenge. It’s an even more daunting task when unemployment is low and CBP finds its agents getting poached by other law enforcement agencies after a few years on the job, Kerlikowske said.To speed the process along, DHS is considering adopting less stringent guidelines for hiring, Foreign Policy magazine reported last month ― a development that has some experts worried, given the agency’s vulnerability to corruption. An undated memo from CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan describes a plan to fill the open positions and hire the extra 5,000 agents over the next five years. But that optimistic timeline would require a 25 percent increase in the number of annual applicants. Making that happen would require still more money for outreach.  The memo, posted to the Border Patrol union’s website, recommends limiting the use of polygraph tests on some applicants, including some former police officers or members of the military, to get agents through the door faster. ICE doesn’t subject applicants to a polygraph test, the memo notes. But relaxing hiring standards like the polygraph exam, the final step in the hiring process, worries some. A 2013 story by the Center for Investigative Reporting found that several applicants who’d passed every element of the hiring process went on to fail the polygraph exam because they admitted to committing crimes. Several of these applicants confessed to trafficking drugs. One said he once woke up in a kitchen doused in blood, but couldn’t remember whether he’d committed a crime during the three hours he’d blacked out. Another applicant, Joseph Montross, admitted to owning a large cache of child pornography. Instead of joining Border Patrol, Montross, a former U.S. Marine, was prosecuted and sentenced to 30 years in prison.Even the hiring process itself would cause logistical problems for the department. John Roth, the chairman of the DHS Office of Inspector General, told Congress last month that according to a recent audit, the department suffered from a lack of human resources staff and poorly organized systems for tracking and processing job applications. “In fiscal year 2015, it took an average of 282 days (over 9 months) to hire a Border Patrol Agent, measured from the time the job announcement closed to the date the applicant was hired,” the report says.All that spending might seem justified if you’re determined to crack down on unlawful migration. But none of these multibillion-dollar, decades-long commitments are likely to have that effect, at least in the short term.  Both CBP and ICE are already well-staffed and arrest far more people on a daily basis than they can detain. Without sufficient detention capacity, agents would simply have to release many people they detain after serving them with orders to appear in immigration court. The Trump administration has taken note of the bottleneck. The Department of Justice plans to send 50 immigration judges to detention centers across the country to help speed up the deportation process. But it’s unclear what difference that will make. The immigration courts face a backlog of more than 540,000 cases, with only about 300 judges to hear them. While the National Association of Immigration Judges has pressed for years to double the number of judges handling these cases, they’re currently backfilling 73 open positions. Sending more judges to detention centers wouldn’t automatically make those cases move much faster, according to NAIJ President Dana Leigh Marks. Defendants need time to find lawyers. They need to find people to testify on their behalf. They often need to obtain documents from foreign countries, a process that can take months. “There is only so fast you can go and be consistent with the due process needs of the individuals in the courtroom,” Marks told HuffPost. “A judge has to balance the interest of the government with the rights of the individual to adequately prepare.” All told, Trump is asking Congress to spend tens of billions of dollars on symbolic action that would likely have a marginal impact at best. Trump may not be able to deport many more people than Obama, but his promised crackdown already appears to have made the enforcement system more erratic. In the first major investigations operation carried out by ICE, roughly a quarter of the people detained had no criminal records ― a sharp departure from last year, when all but 8 percent of those deported from the interior of the country had either committed crimes that landed them among ICE’s enforcement priorities, or had been deported before."

We do so to honor Dr. David Gunn, the first of four abortion providers killed in a wave of domestic terrorism and violence between 1993 and 2009. The other doctors who were killed were John Britton (1994), Barnett Slepian (1998), and George Tiller (2009).The New York Times described Dr. David Gunn’s life this way:David Gunn never set out to be a symbol. He wanted to deliver babies. But then an abortion clinic asked for help, and because no other doctor would do the job, performing abortions in the rural South became Dr. Gunn’s life. There were wanted posters with his name on them, people following him late at night, hate mail, death threats, protesters yelling “Murderer!” Dr. Gunn kept three guns in his car ― one in the glove compartment, one under the seat and one in the trunk.It didn’t matter. On March 10, 1993, Dr. David Gunn was killed on his way into a clinic in Pensacola, Florida by anti-abortion zealot.Twenty-four years later, for many abortion providers, the danger is still real for the work that they do. Here in Colorado, being an abortion provider means you have to think of things other physicians don’t. And as we saw in November 2015, the domestic terrorism against women’s health care providers is still all too real.So we want to thank abortion providers for the bravery they display in providing healthcare to Colorado women. Abortion providers are a critical part of a woman’s right to privacy and exercising her Constitutional right to choose abortion. And whatever reason a woman has to choose abortion is the correct one for her - every woman is different, and as physicians will tell you, every situation is different.With Roe now settled law for 44 years, people have forgotten how awful it was in the days before safe, legal abortion. According to Our Bodies, Ourselves, “Estimates of the number of illegal abortions in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s range from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. Prior to Roe v. Wade, as many as 5,000 American women died annually as a direct result of unsafe abortions.”Roe didn’t establish women seeking abortions. It just stopped women from dying from it. Legal abortion is one of the safest medical procedures available. Illegal abortion kills women. And too many politicians in 2017 seem to be willing to return to those dark days before 1973.As we remember Dr Gunn and his fellow providers this year, we should all be conscious and grateful to live in a state where physicians can provide the full spectrum of women’s medical care - birth control, pregnancy, and abortion care - without the political interference prevalent in others states. And we should thank the doctors, nurses and medical staff who are willing to go through what they do to ensure women get the care that they need with compassion and understanding."

He can, however, revoke the trust at will and, as its sole beneficiary, remains linked to it financially.The new trademark approvals cover such businesses as branded spas, massage parlors, golf clubs, hotels, insurance, finance and real estate companies, retail shops, restaurants, bars and bodyguard and escort services.The 35 trademarks, which Trump’s lawyers applied for in April last year, are registered to “Donald J. Trump” and listed to the address of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York.The Associated Press earlier reported the approvals of the trademarks, which it said also included three further trademarks not directly registered in the President’s name. These related to Scion, a hotel brand Trump’s sons want to expand in the United States. Reuters could not immediately confirm the three further approvals.Representatives for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s personal ties between politics and business have prompted concern from politicians and rights groups who say the President could face potential conflicts of interest related to the extensive business affairs of his family.Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking member on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for the Departments of State, Commerce and Justice to brief Congress on the Chinese trademark approvals and on “the potential constitutional dangers that they present.”“This is an astonishing development ... It’s clear to me that officials in Beijing have come to appreciate the potential return on investments for China in having a positive, personal business relationship with the President of the United States,” Cardin said in a statement.Cardin has previously introduced a resolution demanding Trump cut his ties with the Trump Organization or risk violating the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless approved by Congress.The preliminary approvals are open to be challenged for around a 90-day period from the date of approval.

The legislation will affect employers with more than 25 employees and will eliminate the gender pay gap, which in Iceland is 14 to 18 percent, by 2022.It will be presented to Iceland’s Parliament this month for signing.Other countries, as well as the state of Minnesota, have equal-salary certificate policies. In Minnesota’s case, their law – titled the Women’s Economic Security Act ― only affects certain state contractors whereas Iceland’s law will affect both private and public employers.“Equal rights are human rights,’’ said Iceland’s Equality and Social Affairs Minister Thorsteinn Viglundsson, according to The AP. “We need to make sure that men and women enjoy equal opportunity in the workplace. It is our responsibility to take every measure to achieve that.’’Icelandic Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson discussed the legislation in New York City on Wednesday. He also assisted actor and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Edgar Ramirez in lighting up the Empire State Building pink to celebrate IWD.Last November, thousands of women gathered in Reykjavik, Iceland’s capital, to protest the gender pay gap. Stunning video overlooking the capital’s streets captured them clapping and chanting together in unison.Viglundsson said that under the new measure each company will be audited to enforce the law.“You need to be within a five percent ‘unexplained’ gap and 95 percent wage distribution explained by the mechanisms in place to get the certification that there is not a gender based pay gap within the company,“ he said, according to iNews.Companies that fail the audits would have to notify the employees and unions, which would then have the right to seek compensation. Iceland has consistently ranked number one in the world for gender equality by the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index.“Across the Index, there are only five countries that have closed 80 percent of the gap or more,” the forum reported following the release of 2016’s data.Those top countries, just behind Iceland, were Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Rwanda.The United States ranked number 45 out of the list of 144 countries surveyed. Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom were all higher."

Trump, now in his seventh week in office, has yet to articulate a clear position on the Gulen extradition or Syria. But unless Trump agrees to Ankara’s demands, Turkey — a key NATO ally and base for U.S. operations against the self-described Islamic State — may not stay quiet much longer. Government officials here are hopeful Trump’s eagerness to reverse the policies of his predecessor will work in their favor.“We have positive opinions of the new U.S. administration,” Yildirim said via a state translator . “We believe it will continue on a more positive note than it used to be over the past couple of years.”In the final years of the Obama administration, disagreement over how best to combat ISIS in Syria threatened the cooperative relationship between the U.S. and Turkey. The U.S. has identified the People’s Protection Unit, or YPG, the military wing of a Syrian Kurdish political movement, as a valuable local military partner in Syria and has provided military assistance to the group to fight ISIS. For Turkey, which views the YPG as an arm of the Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) – a group listed as a terrorist organization by both Turkey and the U.S. — this arrangement is a non-starter.The Pentagon, however, appears to be leaning in favor of including the group in the upcoming military effort to retake Raqqa, the most important ISIS stronghold in Syria.The decision to partner with the YPG in Syria was a “mistake” that the Trump administration should not repeat, Yildirim said Thursday. “The U.S. should be above fighting terrorist organizations by using other terrorist organizations,” he continued. “If they insist, the friendship between the U.S. and Turkey will be significantly damaged and undermined.”Already fragile relations between the two countries worsened after July’s failed coup in Turkey. Ankara blames the attempted putsch on followers loyal to Gulen, the cleric living in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. The U.S. has not obliged Ankara’s requests to extradite Gulen back to Turkey, citing a lack of evidence pointing to his role as the coup ringleader.It was “as if they were mocking us,” Yildirim said of the Obama administration’s response to the extradition request last year. The accumulation of perceived slights has left Turkey feeling abandoned by a key ally. Ankara accuses Washington of failing to appreciate the challenges it faces in fighting simultaneous threats from ISIS, the PKK, and the infiltration of individuals loyal to Gulen throughout its government. The U.S., in turn, has grown frustrated with what it sees as Turkey’s distracting focus on denying Kurdish gains in the fight against ISIS. It sees Turkey’s aggressive post-coup crackdown ― which has included tens of thousands of arrests and the dismissal of more than 100,000 people from government jobs ― as an undemocratic purge.But even as Yildirim seeks a clean slate with the Trump administration, it is not clear that the new U.S. president will pursue dramatically different policies from his predecessor on the Syrian Kurds or Gulen extradition request.The Pentagon, which experiences minimal personnel changeover during presidential transitions, appears to be unswayed by Ankara’s objections to its partnership with the Syrian Kurdish group. “The YPG, along with the Syrian Arab Coalition, are elements of the [Syrian Democratic Forces] that have liberated scores of cities from ISIS. The SDF have proven to be a capable force and tactical support against ISIS will continue,” Air Force Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the military operation against ISIS, wrote in an email. Although Turkey views the YPG as a part of the PKK, the U.S. does not. The YPG is not designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S., Dorrian noted.The new administration has yet to send any concrete signals that it intends to extradite Gulen back to Turkey. The source of Ankara’s hope appears to be an op-ed written by Trump’s former national security advisor, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign last month amid a scandal over his communications with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. On Election Day last year, Flynn published an op-ed arguing that Gulen was a “shady Islamic mullah” who should not be provided a safe haven by the U.S. Two days later, the pro-government Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah ran a story with the headline “Trump expected to turn the heat on FETO, extradite Gulen for better relations with Turkey.”But Flynn no longer works in the White House — and his sympathy for Ankara’s perspective does not seem to be based on deeply held beliefs. When the coup was unfolding in July — four months before his op-ed was published — Flynn publicly cheered the attempt to oust Erdogan, warning that Turkey had began “to move toward Islamism.” He later reversed his view on the attempted coup after his intelligence firm was hired by a Dutch company tied to Erdogan’s government. He recently registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department, citing his work with that company.Turkey’s Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said Thursday, via a state translator, that he has not yet received any assurances from the Trump administration on Gulen. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions took office, his Turkish counterpart sent him a congratulatory letter and a note about the “significance” of the Gulen case to Turkey, Bozdag told reporters. He followed up to request a phone conversation with Sessions, which he said is set to happen in the coming days.The Justice Department declined to comment on whether the Trump administration’s position on extraditing Gulen would differ from his predecessor’s. “We will review any new materials the Turkish government may provide and will make any decisions about extradition on the basis of the facts and relevant U.S. law,” Nicole Navas, a department spokeswoman wrote in an email.The Trump administration’s handling of these two key issues will likely have an effect on how much longer Erdogan’s government is willing to quietly tolerate Trump’s anti-Islam rhetoric and policies. For now, Ankara’s official position on Trump’s travel ban, which targets six Muslim-majority countries, is that it is a U.S. domestic matter. But Turkey has not shied away from accusing its allies of Islamophobic tendencies in the past, and policymakers’ not-so-official line conveys simmering frustration with the president’s policies. “Whether U.S. remains open or not, whether U.S. becomes more inward looking, whether U.S. continues to attract talent and diversity, whether it sees diversity as a source of richness or a threat — that’s something for U.S. administration to decide,” Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said Wednesday. “But if you’re asking my personal view, I think U.S. is shooting itself in the foot.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

40,THE WORLDPOST,Kosovo Looks To ISIS Wives In Order To Fight Extremism,"Nina Teggarty, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kosovo-looks-to-isis-wives-in-order-to-fight-extremism_us_58c1ae33e4b054a0ea6900dd,Most Kosovar men who travel to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS are accompanied by their wives. For our series “Women and,2017-03-09,"For Kosovars used to a moderate form of Islam, the recent rise of a more strict ideology can provoke fear, making it difficult for families to tell whether a loved one is being radicalised or simply embracing the religion.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1afa61d000039007cd868.jpeg?cache=QwP8GTVQ9W&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most Kosovar men who travel to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS are accompanied by their wives. For our series “Women and Jihad,” we talk to counterterrorism experts who believe these women could be the key to challenging violent extremism.“Wherever he goes, I follow. I will always be with my husband.” This is the mind-set of Kosovar women who join their militant husbands in Syria or Iraq, according to Kujtim Bytyqi, one of the government’s senior security policy analysts and head of Kosovo’s strategy to counter violent extremism. The police say that more than 300 Kosovars have traveled to fight for the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) – the highest number per capita in Europe – and the majority of fighters do not go alone: Bytyqi says half of the Kosovar citizens currently in Syria or Iraq are women or children.Very little is known about the wives from Kosovo who travel to ISIS-held territory. But through the work of the government and NGOs, a picture is slowly emerging of a group of women who are isolated and disenfranchised. They play crucial roles in the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, but are often overlooked in discussions on how to tackle the radicalization that drives the fighting.To many Kosovars, the rise of violent Islamic extremism in their country has come as a shock. Kosovo was a communist nation for over 45 years and religion was viewed as a private matter. In the late 1990s, when U.S.-led NATO troops stabilized the region and paved the way for an independent Kosovo, the predominantly Muslim country celebrated its ties with the West. However, since the end of the war in Kosovo in 1999, the threat of violent Islamic extremism has been growing, fueled by poverty, youth unemployment and funding from foreign sources that preach extremist ideologies. Money from religious groups based in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations has gone into building schools and mosques where Wahhabism, an ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam, is being taught, experts say.The shifting allegiances from Kosovo’s traditionally moderate form of Islam to more radical forms are having a profound impact on families – especially newlywed couples where the husband has been exposed to extremist ideology and has “forced his wife to become subject to this ideology as well,” says Florian Qehaja from the Kosovar Centre for Security Studies (KCSS). “Due to the fact that their husbands pressured them, we believe that about 40 women were subject to this ideology and have ended up in Syria and Iraq,” he says.The women who end up in the conflict zone usually play a domestic role, according to a report published by KCSS in January. The report, Women in Violent Extremism, says these wives are “mainly cooking, cleaning and taking care of their children … They are valued solely as mothers who will raise the next generation of ‘lions.’”And counterextremism experts believe that, with their invisible but pivotal roles at the hearts of ISIS families, the wives of fighters could prove key to challenging the extremist ideas held by their husbands and children.Reaching out to those women, however, is a challenge.Besa Ismaili, a professor at the Faculty of Islamic Studies in Kosovo’s capital, Pristina, says the wives of radicalized men never attend lectures at her institution because, in their eyes, women like herself “are not good Muslimahs. We wear colors and mix with males.” Ismaili says it is impossible to “see [the wives], know them, talk to them” – they rarely leave the house, and if they do, they are escorted by their husbands. Physically cut off from the rest of the world, the women are also imprisoned by a lack of knowledge, says Ismaili. Their husbands are their main source of information, putting them in a “situation of complete darkness, brainwashing and lack of alternatives.”The increasing awareness of religiously enclaved communities, and the risk of radicalization, is unsettling to many in Kosovo. Bytyqi says that, when some Kosovars see Muslim men with beards or women wearing the hijab, “They don’t want to talk to them; they are afraid.” According to Bytyqi, the police often receive calls from worried mothers who declare, “’Please can you come, my son has started to pray.’ … In their family tradition, nobody prayed before. So they are afraid.”In an environment where some families fear that “everything Islamic is [equal to] terrorism,” says Bytyqi, several organizations have started working with women to help wives and mothers spot signs of actual radicalization – as opposed to genuine, good-spirited interest in Islam – and to strengthen women’s voices in the home.Albert Berisha created the Institution for Security, Integration and De-Radicalization (INSID) in 2016, after he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for participating in a terrorist organization while in Syria in 2013. He served 23 days and is currently out on appeal, and says he only went to Syria for humanitarian reasons and returned after two weeks. But as one of 115 Kosovars who have returned from Syria or Iraq, Berisha believes handing down harsh sentences to returnee jihadis will only encourage radicalization.His NGO works with foreign fighters and their families, offering legal aid and supporting the de-radicalization process. “Our main activity is to talk with foreign fighters and their families,” he says. “We want to be their voice against discrimination, against violations of human rights, and against stigmatization of their families. We give them legal advice and we try to understand what problems they have.”While Berisha talks to the men, his female colleagues approach their wives. Berisha says that it’s “hard work” – his team are often met with suspicion – but he thinks reaching out to women is crucial. “We need our mothers, wives, daughters and sisters to be independent, strong and educated, to challenge the extremist ideas inside families,” he says.This year, at least two other organizations, the Association of Women in Kosovo Police and the Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, are planning awareness-raising events that will show women how they can help prevent violent extremism. And the government plans to roll out a “referral mechanism” across the country, basically a drop-in service for families who are worried about loved ones being radicalized.The government and police often highlight recent successes in their counterterrorism work, citing the fact that no one from Kosovo has traveled to Iraq or Syria in the last year. Yet there is growing recognition from police, the government and NGOs that in order to tackle violent extremism, women need to be involved.“We need to build a society in which women will never be slaves who agree with everything their men say,” says Berisha. “The best investment against extremism and radicalization is investing in families and women.”This story is part of a special series called “Women and Jihad.” It originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

41,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Has A Plan To Win Back Trump Voters,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-donald-trump-voters_us_58c1ac90e4b054a0ea68fa17,"The Vermont senator says the Democratic Party has shown ""enormous neglect"" resulting in ""an ultimate failure.""",2017-03-09,Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a federal contract workers rally on Feb. 16 to celebrate Andrew Puzder's decision to withdraw from consideration to be secretary of labor. Sanders has also been speaking to crowds outside the Beltway lately.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1adf02700003300749178.jpeg?cache=uprOwRGo66&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At a time when Congress is debating a vast overhaul of the nation’s health care system, a hardened approach to refugees and immigration in general, and links between the current president and interests in Russia, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) finds himself increasingly outside the Beltway, in states and towns won by President Donald Trump.Since January, the Vermont senator has stopped in Mississippi, Kansas and Michigan. Early next week, he’s heading to one of the poorest counties in America, McDowell County, West Virginia, which Trump carried by a ratio of 3-to-1. There, he will tape a show with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes.Sanders views these enclaves as critical for the future of the Democratic Party and, by extension, the country. They are, he argues, the places where Democrats have shown “an enormous amount of neglect.”“The truth is, and I think anyone who objectively assesses the situation has to appreciate, that the model the Democrats have followed for the last 10 to 20 years has been an ultimate failure,” Sanders said in an interview with The Huffington Post from his Senate office in Washington.“That’s just the objective evidence. We are taking on a right-wing extremist party whose agenda is opposed time after time and on issue after issue by the vast majority of the American people. Yet we have lost the White House, the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, almost two-thirds of the governors’ chairs and close to 900 legislative seats across this country. How can anyone not conclude that the Democratic agenda and approach has been a failure?”Sanders, of course, is not a Democrat, despite caucusing with Democrats in the Senate for years and running in the party’s 2016 presidential primary. And often his diagnosis of Democrats’ failures strikes those who are in the party as tinged with condescension. But his appeal to a certain class of voters, including those who abandoned the party in favor of Trump, is undeniable, to the point that leadership moved quickly to mirror his playbook and curry his favor. This past summer, the party adopted its most progressive platform ever, with many policies echoing Sanders’ proposals. Following November’s election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) gave Sanders a spot on his leadership team and endorsed his favored candidate ― Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) ― for Democratic National Committee chairman.But platforms are largely ceremonial. And leadership roles matter little when your party is out of power. So Sanders has adopted what he sees as an “outside strategy” to complement his new status as an inside player.“At the end of the day, being in the minority here in the Senate, the minority in the House, having a right-wing Republican president, the only way we are going to win this ― and I think we can win this ― is when millions of people stand up, especially in states that Trump carried, and say, ‘Excuse me. We did not elect you to be president to throw us off of health care. We did not elect you to cut back on the child care we desperately need,’” he said.As he barnstorms America, much of what Sanders is advocating has a familiar ring. It’s the pitch he’s used for decades and the one that elevated his candidacy during last year’s primary. There is talk of raising the minimum wage, making public universities tuition-free, the need to protect and expand health care access and the encouragement of unionization efforts, including at the Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi. There is a distinctly “What’s the matter with Kansas?” feel to it all, premised on the concept that many people who voted for Trump did so against their own self-interest.And Sanders has a theory as to why. Part of it, he explains, is that Trump has effectively turned one set of voters (working-class whites) against another (immigrants and refugees) to the point the real culprits (bottom-line-driven CEOs) skate by without reprimand or punishment. “That’s what demagogues have always done,” he says of Trump. “You pick on the weak and the powerless and you turn a majority against them and you deflect attention from the real causes of the problems that we face.”But there is also a personal element motivating Sanders’ travel too. The crowds he’s drawing aren’t the stadium-sized ones of his primary campaign. But they are the same sets of voters: individuals who left the Democratic Party, may never have associated with it at all or were never politically active in the first place. If Democrats are to regain power ― and if Sanders is to run for the White House again ― success will be predicated on getting this segment of the population engaged. That can be done from D.C., and it can take the form of resistance to Trump. But the bet the senator is making is that it’s more enduring if you go to where the people are with an impassioned, populist pitch. “I think from a moral perspective as well as good politics that you cannot just be defensive,” he said. “You need a proactive agenda that brings people together to fight for a new America.”Video by JM Rieger and Jessica Carro."

43,POLITICS,Michael Flynn Concealed Foreign Lobbying Work From Justice Department,Christina Wilkie and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-flynn-turkey-lobbyist_us_58c1c515e4b0d1078ca55f09,"Trump didn't know his national security adviser was helping Turkey during the campaign, the White House says.",2017-03-09,"While campaigning for Donald Trump, Michael Flynn was paid to help discredit exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, shown at his home in Pennsylvania.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1dbf52700003800749283.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn was paid more than $500,000 last fall as a foreign lobbyist to help the Turkish government discredit the exiled cleric Fethullah Gülen, according to lobbying disclosure forms that Flynn filed Tuesday with the Department of Justice.The new documents reveal that Flynn was collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to run an information campaign against Gülen while he was campaigning for Donald Trump by attacking his Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton as a corrupt stooge of foreign governments. Following Trump’s surprise victory in November, the president-elect rewarded Flynn’s loyalty by naming the retired lieutenant general as his national security adviser.On Thursday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was unaware of Flynn’s work on behalf of a foreign government when he decided to name Flynn his national security adviser. Spicer declined to say whether the president would have still hired Flynn if he had known. Ultimately it would be Flynn’s ties to Russia, and not Turkey, that cost him his job in the White House after less than a month. Still unknown in February, when Flynn resigned from the White House, was the nature of his work to benefit the government of Turkey’s autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.This is because Flynn’s lobbying firm told the Senate in September that it was working for a Dutch company called Inovo BV on issues related to State Department and Pentagon funding. It also claimed that the only person working on the Inovo BV project was Flynn’s partner Robert Kelley, not Flynn himself.Tuesday’s filings, however, told a different story.According to the new documents, Flynn Intel Group was hired to “perform research” on Gülen and his network of charter schools and to “engage a public relations firm and a filming and production crew to potentially distribute the results of its research.”Turkish authorities blame Gülen and his millions of followers for a failed coup in 2016 and have jailed thousands for alleged connections to the Pennsylvania-based cleric. The Turkish government wants the U.S. to arrest Gülen and extradite him to Turkey.Over the three months of the contract, Flynn and his partners enlisted former FBI agents, psychiatrists, retired spies, cyber warriors and cameramen to help them “research” Gülen. The firm also hired Flynn’s son, Michael G. Flynn, and paid him $4,000 for “administrative support” for the project.From the beginning, it was clear that the real client wasn’t a Dutch company but Kamil Alptekin, a powerful Turkish businessman with close ties to the Erdogan regime.Soon after Flynn’s firm began working for Alptekin, they flew to New York to meet Turkish officials, including the minister of energy, Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan’s son-in-law. At the time, Flynn’s firm believed the meeting was “for the purpose of understanding better the political climate in Turkey at the time, as background for the project.”At this point, there was little doubt that the work would help the Turkish government achieve one of its chief goals: the extradition of Gülen. Still, the only record of this burgeoning anti-Gülen campaign was a form that claimed Kelley, Flynn’s colleague, was helping a Dutch company navigate Defense Department budgets.This disconnect between what Flynn’s firm reported and what was really going on is startling, said Alex Howard, deputy director of the pro-transparency Sunlight Foundation.“If people lobby for foreign countries in the United States, much less if former high-ranking military officers lobby for foreign countries, it’s reasonable to expect them to register [with the Justice Department] at the point they sign a contract,” Howard said in an interview with The Huffington Post.By taking advantage of a lobbying disclosure system that is riddled with loopholes, Flynn and his firm were able to hide the true nature of their work during a critical three-month period in which Flynn became the most visible national security adviser to Republican candidate Trump.When asked whether it was concerning that Flynn had been a foreign agent, Spicer said, “This is what he did for a living.”Even with his busy schedule campaigning for Trump, Flynn still found time to devote to his client.On Election Day, Nov. 8, Flynn, in an op-ed in The Hill newspaper, called Gülen a “radical Islamist” and argued that, “from Turkey’s point of view, Washington is harboring Turkey’s Osama bin Laden.”Flynn’s logic in the piece was circular: He defended his claim that Gülen was an extremist by saying that if Gülen weren’t an extremist, then the Turkish government wouldn’t be so angry with him. Flynn concluded by arguing that the United States “should not provide [Gülen] safe haven.”On Tuesday, Flynn and his firm claimed that Flynn wrote the op-ed entirely on his own and not as a part of his lobbying work on the anti-Gülen campaign. They admitted, however, that Flynn’s op-ed was provided to Inovo BV “for review” in advance and claimed that “no changes, other than technical edits, were made to the op-ed based on feedback from Inovo.”According to a note added to the op-ed Thursday by The Hill, “neither General Flynn nor his representatives disclosed his lobbying contract when the essay was submitted” to the newspaper.Following the new disclosure, Alptekin also distanced himself from the firm. “Gen. Flynn never engaged in lobbying work for me or my firm. And I never lobbied or contracted lobbyist on behalf of the Turkish Government,” he tweeted.Ultimately, it appears that Flynn’s lobbying campaign did not accomplish much, save, perhaps, for lining Flynn’s pockets.According to the disclosures, Flynn Intel Group was paid a total of $530,000 from Inovo BV over three installments, the last of which was dated Nov. 14, a week after Trump was elected. Over that time, Flynn’s firm claims that it created a “Gülen-themed monopoly graphic” and a few video interviews that were never publicly released.To this day, Flynn’s op-ed remains the only tangible evidence of the half-million dollars that Turkish anti-Gülen forces paid to Flynn and his partners.But in the world of foreign lobbying, tangible evidence is merely the tip of an iceberg: The real value lies in future access and backdoor channels.Two days before Trump was inaugurated, on Jan. 18, Flynn held a working breakfast in Washington with Turkey’s foreign minister, who was visiting the U.S. to celebrate Trump’s inauguration.Flynn’s firm, meanwhile, still claims, somewhat incredibly, that it “does not know whether or the extent to which the Republic of Turkey was involved with its retention by Inovo for the three month project.” "
44,POLITICS,Water Utility That Dared Challenge Farm Pollution Says Big Ag Is Trying To Destroy It,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/des-moines-water-works_us_58c06447e4b0d1078ca391e5,"""Don't step in the way of Big Ag, or you'll suffer the consequences,"" says the CEO of Iowa's Des Moines Water Works.",2017-03-09,U.S. and Iowa state flags are seen next to a corn field in Iowa. The state has been the site of a long-standing battle between a water utility and agribusiness over water pollution.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c064a72700003300748deb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Des Moines Water Works CEO Bill Stowe says there’s a word for an Iowa bill that proposes to dissolve the utility he’s overseen for four years: retribution.Two years ago, Des Moines Water Works sued three farm-heavy Iowa counties located upstream from the city for costs of filtering nitrogen the utility claims came from the farms. The state Supreme Court ruled against the utility in January, and a federal trial is set for June.But Stowe said Iowa’s mighty agribusiness interests are seeking justice of a different form by pushing legislation that would eliminate the utility altogether as revenge for the legal action.“It’s clear to me the bill is intended to get at us because of our lawsuit,” Stowe told HuffPost on Wednesday. “It sends its own message: Don’t step in the way of Big Ag, or you’ll suffer the consequences. That has a huge, chilling impact on civil discourse.”The legislation, introduced last month, would dissolve existing independent water utilities in Des Moines, as well as in the neighboring suburbs of West Des Moines and Urbandale, and replace them with city departments under control of city councils.The bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Jarad Klein, has deep connections to the state’s powerful agriculture interests. Klein, a farmer whose district is 100 miles east of Des Moines, is a member of the Iowa Farm Bureau, according to his state legislature biography. The Farm Bureau has opposed the Des Moines utility’s lawsuit and donated nearly $10,000 to Klein’s 2010 campaign. Klein also belongs to groups representing pork producers and corn growers, which have opposed the utility’s litigation.Klein denies his legislation has anything to do with the Des Moines utility’s lawsuit, according to local media, and did not respond to an interview request. The Farm Bureau says it’s not involved, noting that it did not author the bill and has not registered in support of it.Klein has insisted to local media that the bill is a step toward a regional water authority that combines resources of Des Moines and its suburbs, giving suburban concerns more representation.“Having more voices, more opinions, backgrounds, diversity at the table helps us produce a better result,” Klein told a local news station last month.Debate on the legislation has been fierce. A large crowd of opponents on Monday packed the Iowa state capitol for a public hearing. Critics noted that language requiring the formation of a regional water authority has been removed from the bill since it was first introduced.Still, the legislation appears to have momentum.State Rep. Chris Hall, a Sioux City Democrat who sits on the state’s three-member House agriculture committee, was the lone vote against the measure when two GOP committee members advanced it last month. A Senate subcommittee also approved the bill, so it is now bound for the full House.Hall doesn’t buy Klein’s argument for a regional utility, noting that existing state law already allows for such a move.“When you look at the bill itself, the clear takeaway is that it’s politically motivated,” Hall told HuffPost. “There is not rationale in public policy that is sound that will be created by this legislation.”Environmental groups say the bill could harm water quality. Josh Mandelbaum, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Poverty Center, noted that Iowa is already dealing with elevated levels of nitrates in water sources. Nitrogen, from fertilizer and animal waste, can pollute drinking water, harm aquatic life, fuel toxic algae blooms and emit a potent greenhouse gas. Mandelbaum said the bill does nothing to address those concerns.“The water quality problems we have are real, and if we don’t address them and don’t make progress towards real solutions, we’re essentially just taking our chances on something much worse happening,” Mandelbaum said.That “something worse,” Mandelbaum and other critics of the bill fear, could be a crisis rivaling the lead emergency in Flint, Michigan.“What they’re proposing to do is to take the responsibility for providing safe drinking water and place it with people who don’t have any experience or expertise running a water utility,” Mandelbaum said. “That’s exactly the same type of circumstances that were in place in the runup to Flint.”For his part, Stowe is undaunted. Facing the possible dissolution of his water utility and an uncertain future for the legal battle he brought, Stowe said the state’s nitrate pollution cannot be downplayed much longer.“You can kill the messenger, but not the message,” Stowe said. “The waters of our state are getting worse instead of better, and we are articulating that message. And that doesn’t go away until the facts disprove it.”This story has been updated to include information from the Iowa Farm Bureau.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

Outset also called out the show and called the segment a “sick attempt at a joke.” Coddington had his own thoughts on the segment:UPDATE ― March 9: On Thursday night, Coddington released an official statement about the incident on Twitter, saying, “half-apologizing for offending someone is not apologizing for making baseless accusations against people because of the way they look.” However, he did thank the show for donating $1,000 to his GoFundMe page. “I am overwhelmed by the support received in that account, and am grateful to everyone who has contributed,” he wrote.

A glowing orange sun with a yellow top surrounds the monster as though a halo might, casting an ominous figure.The film, another installment of the many “King Kong” films out there, is coming to theaters this weekend, a bit more than a decade after the last major reboot in 2005.“King Kong: Skull Island” has an estimated budget of around $190 million, and is expected to gross around $50 million in the U.S. and Canada alone during this opening weekend. It stands to become a blockbuster.The legendary story of the oversized, mythical gorilla will play out on screen for viewers as the public contends with an ongoing spectacle in the White House. Interestingly, President Donald Trump, has a long history with the story of the famous primate.At the 2002 Academy Awards, Trump appeared in a short video segment created by filmmaker Errol Morris that focused on the favorite movie moments of the featured individuals. Speaking alongside notable faces such as Iggy Pop and Mikhail Gorbachev, Trump had a particularly telling answer for his cherished movie memory.“Seeing King Kong try and conquer New York,” he said, with a small grin.Back when he was better known as a bloviating figure of New York real estate, Trump gained an ownership stake of the Empire State Building, the same one associated with King Kong in the 1990s. He attempted to win control of the entire building, but was ultimately thwarted as his stake was bought out.In 2005, he publicly attended Universal Studios’ premiere of the Peter Jackson–directed reboot with wife Melania.Yet the 2016 presidential campaign led artists and political commentators alike to align Trump and the Empire State–dominating film icon even further.In a segment about Trump’s infamous “locker-room banter” with Billy Bush, “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah compared Trump to Kong. “Trump is like King Kong in that they both broke free of their shackles and like grabbing white women without asking,” he said.Around the time that scandal erupted, Trump himself tweeted a message containing imagery reminiscent of King Kong.As a method of protest to Trump’s misogynistic and xenophobic rhetoric during his campaign and beyond, artists have frequently aligned the man with the city-conquering Kong. In January, Madonna shared a depiction of Trump as King Kong atop the Statue of Liberty.Other visuals aligning Trump with Kong have ended up as covers on editions of The Weekly Standard and The New York Post.Just last week during Mardi Gras, a float imagined Trump as the ape clinging to the Washington Monument.A political cartoon by Michael de Adder depicted Trump as a shackled Kong — the moment in the original film just before Kong violently reacts to the jarring flashes of photographers and breaks free of his restraints.The star of “Skull Island,” Brie Larson, has even suggested that her new film contains a message that directly advocates against Trump’s aggressive tendencies — especially toward the media. “I make movies as a form of activism,” she wrote in an Instagram caption. “I believe we learn from what we see in our leaders. I’m proud to play Mason Weaver in @kongskullislandmovie because she represents the many journalists who risk their lives everyday to share with us the truth. Weaver leads with compassion and believes that unity cannot be obtained through aggression.”Whether you take your entertainment in the form of a gorilla blockbuster or The New York Times, it’s hard not to notice the fascinating timing of it all."

Wednesday marked International Women’s Day as well as the “Day Without A Woman” strike, in which women in the United States and around the world highlighted their contributions to society by expressing their frustrations on social media, wearing red and taking to the streets to demonstrate. Many women did not show up to work, which closed schools around the country.The “Hamilton” production included an insert in the evening performance’s playbill to remind audiences that March is National Women’s History Month. It also described how the show was honoring and celebrating International Women’s Day.At the end of Wednesday’s performance, the cast shouted, “Happy Women’s Day!” and the crew joined them on stage wearing an array of red shirts, many of them T-shirts bearing feminist slogans.The gestures come on the heels of the original cast members for the Schuyler sisters adding the perfect line to “America the Beautiful” at last month’s Super Bowl performance. Renée Elise Goldsberry, Jasmine Cephas Jones and Phillipa Soo sang “and crown thy good with brotherhood” but added “and sisterhood” before moving on to the next line.The cast of “Hamilton” has been outspoken since the presidential election. On Nov. 18, Vice President-elect Mike Pence went to the show. Actor Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr spoke on behalf of the production when he addressed Pence directly and expressed concerns about the hateful rhetoric that dominated President Donald Trump’s run for office. “We, sir, we are the diverse America, who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” Dixon said to Pence. “But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.”"

Roland Ruiz had been sentenced to death for the 1992 murder-for-hire of a woman whose husband and brother-in-law wanted her killed. The two men wanted to collect on a $400,000 life insurance policy; instead, they got life sentences for plotting her murder.Ruiz was executed shortly after midnight. He was 44.According to a prison official, his final words were for Theresa Rodriguez’s surviving relatives: “Words cannot begin to express how sorry I am and the hurt that I have caused you and your family. May this bring you peace and forgiveness.”But before the execution could proceed, Justice Stephen Breyer became the lone voice who would’ve stopped it. “I believe his claim is a strong one, and we should consider it,” Breyer wrote in a lengthy statement accompanying one of the court’s denials.In recent years, Breyer has been wanting to hear a case that may kill the death penalty for good, but Ruiz’s case was not it. The justice took interest in something else: the way the inmate had been sitting on death row without meeting his fate for nearly a quarter-century, the bulk of it in solitary confinement.Some 125 years ago, Breyer wrote, the Supreme Court had recognized that imprisonment in isolation raises “long-standing serious objections.” As a result of this form of punishment, he added, many prisoners descended “into a semi-fatuous condition,” “became violently insane,” “committed suicide” or otherwise “did not recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the community.”Breyer then appeared to turn his darts toward a colleague, Justice Anthony Kennedy, who did not join him in his bid to spare Ruiz but nonetheless in 2015 had raised objections of his own about the “human toll” of solitary confinement.Kennedy was silent this time around, but Breyer quoted him at length ― as if to remind him that he once appeared to agree that being caged all alone was cruel and unusual. And that Kennedy, too, had once called for a case to examine the constitutionality of the practice. Kennedy had even invoked Kalief Browder ― the Bronx teenager who took his life after being imprisoned in Rikers Island for a crime he didn’t commit. Browder, too, had spent long periods in “punitive segregation.”So this may have been a way for Breyer to nudge his colleague, who has built a record on how the Constitution stands as a barrier for certain forms of punishment.“If extended solitary confinement alone raises serious constitutional questions, then 20 years of solitary confinement, all the while under threat of execution, must raise similar questions, and to a rare degree, and with particular intensity,” Breyer concluded.Last year, Breyer already indicated suffering on death row for 40 years may be unconstitutional. Only time will tell if Kennedy and others on the Supreme Court will join him in this lonely crusade."

Dignitaries like Boston’s mayor and Massachusetts’ governor have announced they’ll boycott the historic parade through South Boston on March 19 because the group OUTVETS claimed its application to take part was denied on Tuesday.Organizers first admitted LGBTQ groups to the parade in 2015. In a statement posted on Facebook, OUTVETS said the Allied War Veterans Council, which organizes the parade, had not given a “clear reason” why they were denied entry, after they participated the last two years. “Given the tenor of the Council’s deliberations, one can assume it’s because we are LGBTQ,” the statement said. “This is a sad day for the LGBTQ community and for Veterans of all backgrounds,” it continued. “We served our country with honor and distinction. But even after bringing honor to this parade, this community, and to all those who have served, we fight every day to be treated with the basic dignity that comes with service to country.”The Allied War Veterans Council did not respond to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment. Dan Magoon, the parade marshal, resigned over the vote’s outcome. He told The Boston Globe that he’d voted to allow OUTVETS but that others on the council claimed the group had missed a deadline.The vote sparked a display of support for OUTVETS from politicians who canceled their scheduled appearances and corporations that threatened to pull their sponsorship. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D) and Massachusetts Gov.

Some refused to do any paid or unpaid labor, some rallied in their cities, and some wore red in solidarity. But certain members of the GOP managed to observed the occasion by pushing for legislation that would harm women and women’s health. On Wednesday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan held a press conference in D.C. to address unpopular changes that House Republicans are proposing to the Affordable Care Act ― and in so doing, managed to brag about how great defunding Planned Parenthood would be. “This is what we’ve been dreaming about doing,” Ryan said, about reforming the ACA. He then went on to explain how these changes would affect the women’s health care organization. “It ends funding to Planned Parenthood and sends money to community centers,” he said. Ryan also said that these changes are part of a “conservative wish list,” which feels like a particularly brutal statement considering the proposed legislation would harm predominantly low-income Americans.Meanwhile, in Texas, members of the Texas House State Affairs Committee reportedly held an hours-long hearing for legislation that has already been blocked by federal judges ― House Bill 35, the contentious bill that would require burial services for aborted or miscarried fetuses. It’s also worth noting that this all came to pass as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $650 million initiative to fund sex education and reproductive health services worldwide.Quick trip to Canada, anyone?

57,POLITICS,This D.C. Restaurant Just Sued Trump And His Hotel For Unfair Competition,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-hotel-lawsuit_us_58c19053e4b0ed71826ac039,"The president's ownership of the hotel and its restaurants gives it an unfair advantage over other local businesses, the plaintiffs say.",2017-03-09,"Khalid Pitts, left, and Diane Gross, co-owners of Cork, are suing President Donald Trump over his financial interest in the restaurant at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1913927000038007490bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Cork Wine Bar is suing President Donald Trump and his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., for unfair competition. The lawsuit claims that the president’s ownership and promotion of the hotel gives it an unfair advantage in attracting business for its restaurants and its bar, which are likewise owned by the president.The lawsuit was filed in D.C. court as a common law claim, asking the court to issue an injunction declaring that the hotel is competing unfairly with local businesses. If an injunction is ordered, the plaintiffs are looking for the court to demand that the Trump Organization resolve the issue. That could involve divesting from the property and the lease.The owners of Cork, Diane Gross and Khalid Pitts, who are married, are not seeking monetary damages. The legal team involved in the case includes Mark Zaid, Scott Rome, Steven Schooner and Alan Morrison.Trump’s hotel in D.C. has been at the center of concerns over his refusal to divest from his multibillion-dollar business. On Jan. 11, Trump announced that he would simply hand control of his many businesses to his adult sons Donald Jr. and Eric. But the president still maintains ownership of every one of his businesses and benefits financially from every dollar spent at his hotels, golf courses and commercial and residential buildings.Since Trump’s election and inauguration, the Trump International Hotel has seen a massive boom in business. Foreign governments have moved their annual parties from other venues to the Trump hotel. Management hosted an event to sell foreign diplomats on staying at the hotel to curry favor with the White House. Wealthy Trump administration appointees like Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Small Business Administration head Linda McMahon and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn all live in the hotel. Sean Spicer, one day before assuming the job of White House press secretary, encouraged people to “go there if you haven’t been by.” Trump has even patronized the hotel’s restaurant to eat his customary well-done steak with ketchup.“The lawsuit addresses unfair competition that derives from what is the most dramatic conflict of interest ever involving a President of the United States,” said Schooner, a government procurement expert at George Washington University Law School.At the center of the case is the lease the Trump Organization holds from the General Services Administration to operate the hotel within the government-owned Old Post Office building. The terms of the lease forbid any elected official from benefiting from it. This provision was put in place to avoid the obvious conflicts of interest and potential for unfair business practices that arise from an elected official owning a restaurant and hotel in a city where influence-seekers would patronize that location over other businesses. The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has filed a complaint with the GSA arguing that Trump is in violation of his lease. The plaintiffs argue that the president’s ownership of the hotel and its restaurants gives it an unfair advantage in a city where many big spenders are looking for ways to influence political actors. There is no better way to influence a political actor than to put money in their pocket and ensure their business is a success. This necessarily pulls money away from other businesses in the city that host influential patrons and private parties.“It is clear that those who are looking to influence this administration are going to look to that business,” said Rome, the business lawyer at Veritas Law Firm representing Cork.The president’s hotel was actually underperforming financial expectations in its first two months of operation, prior to the Nov. 8 election. Business has surged since then.Pitts, who has worked for environmental and progressive organizations, said, “We have seen that our business has declined... compared to other periods close to inaugurations ― both in dining as well as in private events that we do.”While Pitts could not put a monetary figure on the decline in activity, he said that as business owners who have operated for 10 years, he and Gross know the normal patterns for business in the city. They saw a marked change around the president’s inauguration, he said, and it’s continued since then.Pitts explained that he and Gross decided to file suit because they believe the Trump hotel situation is unfair to them and to other D.C. restaurants.“On face value this seemed unfair to us,” he said. “We saw the sitting President of the United States using his office for financial gain to the detriment of local business.”“We didn’t enter into this lightly,” Gross said. “We’ve never sued anyone before.”Alan Garten, counsel to the Trump Organization, called the lawsuit “a wild publicity stunt completely lacking in legal merit.”Gross, who says she is a registered Democrat, said there were no political motives behind the lawsuit.“We strictly see this as a civil business lawsuit,” she said. “We’re challenging the actions he’s taken as owner. We’re not challenging his policies as president.”Though he acknowledged that there will likely be a host of political theater around this lawsuit at the national level, Pitts said that it is, at heart, a local issue.“This is about local D.C.” Pitts said. “This is about a local business and local businesses who are trying to make it here in this city and we feel that the President of the United States owning restaurants, promoting those restaurants, it’s unfair and to the detriment of other businesses in this city.”"
58,POLITICS,"While Trump Was Dominating In Deep-Red Oklahoma, This Democrat Won A Landslide",Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-party-future-rural_us_58b7089ee4b019d36d0fecb4,Now Joe Maxwell is urging his party not to give up on rural America.,2017-03-09,Joe Maxwell beat a right-to-farm initiative in a farming state.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bb849e1900003300bd6cae.jpeg?cache=R6u9KNJW7z&ops=crop_19_10_812_557%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As precinct data rolled into his war room at the Aloft Hotel in downtown Oklahoma City last November, Joe Maxwell realized his team had a landslide on its hands.He saw no need to delay the victory speeches, having been up since before daybreak orchestrating a statewide get-out-the-vote operation for what was expected to be a close contest. His team took the elevator to the rooftop bar, where about 50 small farmers gathered anxiously to watch the returns and, they hoped, celebrate.For the previous 14 months, they had battled a so-called “right to farm” ballot initiative, with Maxwell serving as “the general” (to quote his friends) of that campaign. Corporate agricultural interests in Oklahoma hoped the measure would protect factory farming from environmental, food safety and humanitarian regulations. The deep-red state’s Republican governor and every member of its all-GOP congressional delegation backed it.In response, Maxwell, who works for the Humane Society, had helped assemble an opposition force of animal welfare activists, environmental groups, Native American tribes and family farmers. Few political strategists would have picked that coalition to overcome the influence of the state’s dominant industry. But there Maxwell was, quietly enjoying a beer as he listened to former state Attorney General Drew Edmondson (D) deliver the news of their crushing victory to a cheering audience. The “no” vote had carried every congressional district in the state and defeated Big Ag by more than 20 points.Maxwell slapped a few backs, shook a few hands and made small talk about the view of Oklahoma City’s modest skyscrapers. The party broke up early, as people relocated to await the presidential returns. Maxwell and a few of his top deputies retreated to a bar down the street.Not many Democrats enjoyed the evening of Nov. 8, 2016. A bit after 10 p.m., Maxwell called Barry Lynn, director of the Open Markets Program at the New America Foundation in Washington, D.C., to complain that he had no one to celebrate with.Donald Trump’s triumph last November was a victory for rural and small-town voters over metropolitan enclaves, the culmination of a grim trend for Democrats that has been intensifying since the 1990s. In 1996, Bill Clinton won nearly half of America’s 3,142 counties. Sixteen years later, Barack Obama carried fewer than 700 counties and still won the election. Hillary Clinton carried just 487 and lost.Running up the score in population centers isn’t helping much with down-ballot contests either. As culturally liberal people move away from suburban and rural communities and concentrate themselves in cities, they’ve increased the Democratic Party’s margins in already blue areas — but decreased them in swing suburban, exurban and rural districts. At the same time, Republicans have aggressively gerrymandered many previously competitive districts, redrawing them to neutralize Democratic votes. Those two factors make it extremely difficult going forward for Democrats to win the U.S. House of Representatives, where they’ve shed 69 seats since 2008, or state legislatures, where they’ve ceded more than 900 seats over the same stretch, without revitalizing their position in exurban and rural America.After the 2016 disaster, Democrats tasked Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) with performing an independent “autopsy” of the party’s disappointing performance in House races across the country. His team conjured a 350-variable mathematical model, studying hundreds of districts. The massive resulting equation predicts doom for Democrats in districts with few college-educated voters, but sees promise in wealthier, diversifying suburbs. It suggests a strategy that effectively writes off all of rural America.“They’re just wrong,” Maxwell said. “They can’t do that, and they don’t have to.”Maxwell’s brand of politics looks beyond the poll-tested analytics that dominate Washington. Even the best mathematical models — tools like Maloney’s current project — are only useful at a particular snapshot in time. They treat voters as static data points, rather than human beings capable of changing their minds. A model might focus on the number of Democrats registered in a district to predict the party’s performance in an upcoming race. But models can’t explain how to create more Democrats in that district.Maxwell won where Democrats weren’t even playing, in a state where Trump carried every single county. When he convinced the Humane Society to get involved against the right-to-farm measure in 2015, independent polling showed his side trailing 64 percent to 15 percent.His decision to fight and battle plan reveal a possible path for the Democratic Party out of the political wilderness and back to electoral relevance. But taking it would require rejecting the political strategy that Democratic leaders are now honing in Washington.“Democrats don’t have to throw out their values,” Maxwell insists. “Democrats don’t even have to abandon their issues. It’s about how you frame it. It’s about connecting with people and showing them how your ideas fit with their values.”Maxwell, 59, and his brother Steve run a farm in northeastern Missouri, just outside the town of Mexico, with a population of roughly 11,000. They’re fourth-generation hog farmers, and politics wasn’t a focus growing up. After stints in the Army and the U.S. Postal Service, Maxwell returned to the family business in the late 1970s, just in time for Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s crusade against inflation.The Fed’s ruthless interest rate hikes didn’t just bring down prices; they devastated small farmers, sparking a great wave of farm foreclosures across the country. When the farms failed, so did the local community banks that had loaned them money. And when the banks collapsed, so did other local businesses that relied on them for credit. Rural America was ravaged. Farmers rode tractors into Washington to snarl traffic in protest, and Maxwell decided to go into politics.“That’s when I realized that government actions pick winners and losers,” he said. “And they’d decided that my industry was a loser.” Maxwell began volunteering for Rep. Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.), and by 1986 he was working on the presidential campaign of Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.). He helped Gephardt organize his ultimately unsuccessful opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement before striking out on his own. Maxwell won election first to the Missouri legislature and then as the state’s lieutenant governor in 2000 — another year when his win bucked a bad national trend for Democrats.“I’m pretty good at getting up and giving a line to people on the stump,” said Wes Shoemyer, a former Missouri state senator. “Me personally, I’m just a good ol’ boy, not too sophisticated. Joe, he’s a sophisticated good ol’ boy. And that’s something the Democrats lost.”Statewide Democratic campaigns in Missouri typically set up shop in Democratic-friendly cities like St. Louis or Kansas City. Maxwell ran his campaign for lieutenant governor from his hometown, which meant he didn’t have to sit through city traffic every time he set out to stump in rural Missouri. Working adjacent to a farm did have its drawbacks, however.“We were in an at-times flea-infested office,” recalled Tricia Workman, a Missouri-based lobbyist who managed the campaign. “I probably paid to exterminate them myself. But he campaigned on agriculture, which is the state’s biggest industry.”“And he campaigned on health care, the working class, the middle class — everybody gets a quality education,” she said. “And we won on that. ... Democrats used to be a lot more popular in the state.” Maxwell still speaks lovingly of “Jeffersonian democracy” and hails Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. There’s a harmony between his attacks on corporate farm interests and the rhetorical assaults from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) against the 1 percent. But Maxwell and his allies aren’t selling democratic socialism.“We don’t want government subsidies,” said Fred Stokes, a Maxwell collaborator who founded the Organization for Competitive Markets, which advocates for small farms against big producers like Tyson, Perdue and Smithfield. “We just want the game to be fair. Apply the damn antitrust laws and it’ll work. Teddy Roosevelt had this figured out 100 years ago. I don’t know why it’s so damn hard for people to understand.”The work that Maxwell and the Humane Society of the United States are doing in rural America could serve as a foundation for further outreach. The Humane Society’s battles against factory farms, puppy mills, research labs and other places that abuse animals are nonpartisan. Its advocates are Democratic and Republican alike, and its explicit political organ, the Humane Society Legislative Fund, supports candidates from both parties. But many of the alliances it has built look like the nascent stage of a new rural liberalism.In 2010, the group’s president, Wayne Pacelle, was in Jefferson City, Missouri, to lobby in favor of a state ballot proposal to crack down on puppy mills. He ran into Maxwell at the statehouse. “It was a pure case of serendipity,” Pacelle said. Maxwell had backed a bill to ban cockfighting during his time in the state legislature, and he’d gone after Big Ag for animal cruelty before. Pacelle hired him to direct the Humane Society’s rural outreach program. Connecting with farmers as an animal welfare advocate requires overcoming some significant cultural barriers. A lot of farmers see the Humane Society’s efforts against animal cruelty as a Trojan horse — the first step in a project that ends with forced vegetarianism and the elimination of all animal agriculture.“What people may not realize about places like Oklahoma is, yes, there is a huge agricultural industry, mostly wheat and cattle,” said F. Bailey Norwood, an agricultural economist at Oklahoma State University. “But ag is also a very popular hobby. … For a lot of kids growing up, their hobby was showing cattle or showing hogs. They show farm animals the way other people show dogs. So even when people don’t farm for a living, there’s a real connection with farm culture.”“With my students, there’s a lot of us-versus-them mentality,” he said. “Us, the good Oklahomans who raise our animals right, and them, these crazy animal rights activists and environmentalists from California who wanna tell us what to do.”Stokes, the small-farmers advocate, acknowledged that Maxwell’s association with the Humane Society is a significant cultural barrier.“All of us catch a lot of hell for that,” Stokes said. “They’ve been conditioned by Farm Bureau and everyone else over the years to think badly about the Humane Society, when they’ve been very good to us and asked for absolutely nothing in return.” (The American Farm Bureau Federation is a century-old organization that advocates for the agricultural industry, but tends to represent the goals of Big Ag.)But there is a common interest between family farmers — who are routinely undercut by the market power of big meat-packing companies — and animal welfare advocates — who want to end brutal factory farming techniques that small farms, by definition, don’t deploy. And Maxwell is getting results. Back in 2002, when he was still lieutenant governor, the Humane Society helped pass an anti-cockfighting ballot initiative in Oklahoma. But it did so by getting strong turnout in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Initiative supporters carried only 11 of the state’s 77 counties. On the 2016 right-to-farm question, Maxwell’s side won 37.“You have to go meet them,” said Maxwell, referring to voters. “You have to go be where they are. It’s about who they are and showing them that you are like them, that you share their values. If you’re in their coffee shop or barber shop or their synagogue or their church — if you’re there, then they feel comfortable to express themselves. You can’t do that in a poll.”The Humane Society’s success at state-level politics has earned it a lot of enemies. Major food and agriculture companies hired PR guru and super-lobbyist Rick Berman to target the Humane Society with a complex propaganda operation. Berman is behind both the think-tank-sounding Center for Consumer Freedom and the blog HumaneWatch.org, which has visually caricatured Maxwell as a puppet and falsely smeared him as an animal torturer.“HSUS is a vegan organization — they don’t want people to ultimately eat meat,” Will Coggin, research director for the Center for Consumer Freedom, claimed. “If they want to be like PETA, they should be as honest as PETA is about their agenda.”This charge is, of course, impossible to square with Maxwell’s career as a hog farmer. “I represent Monsanto, which Joe hates, but I still have the absolute biggest respect for him that I possibly could, as a human being and as a politician,” said Workman, his former campaign manager who has since returned to lobbying.While Maxwell is notching victories now, any broader Democratic Party strategy for rural America would take time to pay off. But he didn’t win the first one either.In 2014, when Maxwell decided to fight a right-to-farm ballot initiative in Missouri, Big Ag had a 35-point lead. Maxwell’s side ended up losing the vote by a whisper-thin 0.2 percent. Former Oklahoma state Sen. Paul Muegge (D) took note. When a similar plan was introduced in Oklahoma, he called Maxwell and urged him to join the opposition campaign, which was headed by Cynthia Armstrong, the Humane Society’s top operative in the state.Right-to-farm measures come with a sympathetic label, but they benefit big agricultural conglomerates, giving them legal protections that help elbow smaller producers out of the market. The Oklahoma initiative would have amended the state constitution to make it all but impossible for the state government to regulate farming technology, either by statute or agency rules. Unless the government could demonstrate “a compelling state interest” — an extremely high standard of legal scrutiny that also applies, for example, to restrictions on voting rights — new farming rules would be forbidden. Even if the state could show a compelling interest, corporate agriculture could have used the right-to-farm law to tie up new standards in court for years.Maxwell was tasked with everything from writing speeches to pitching farmers face-to-face on the “no” campaign.“The farm community is so much faith-based, I thought the idea of stewardship could really be a powerful message,” Maxwell said. “Stewardship of the animals, stewardship of the land.”He also saw an opening on environmental concerns, which are paramount in many portions of the state. The Illinois River, Lake Tenkiller and other waterways in eastern Oklahoma have been polluted for years, due primarily to chicken waste runoff from big poultry farms. Eastern counties broke hard for Maxwell’s side on election night.“I think Joe’s an amazing person,” said Mike Callicrate, a Kansas cattle rancher who serves on the board of the Organization for Competitive Markets. “And it’s going to be his work and his coalition-building that will save family farming and get people back to the land. That win in Oklahoma might be the turning point.”Victory builds confidence. Maxwell spent this past New Year’s Eve in his hometown with brother Steve and former lawmaker Shoemyer. In deep-red northeastern Missouri, one of the bars on the town square displayed a sign declaring that anyone who had voted for Hillary Clinton would not be served. Maxwell’s crew took the hint and started their evening on the other side of the square. After a few rounds, his drinking buddies looked up to see him walking toward the anti-Clinton sign.Maxwell walked in, slammed his hand down on the bar and said, “I voted for Hillary Clinton and I want a beer!”He got his beer.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

61,POLITICS,Trump's Revised Travel Ban Is Still Mired In Prejudice,"Bill Frelick, ContributorDirector of the Refugee Rights Program at Human Rights Watch",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-revised-travel-ban-still-mired-in-prejudice_us_58c1a47de4b0a797c1d39a39,"Donald Trump says he inherited “a mess” when he became president, but many of those messes are of his own making, as shown",2017-03-09,"<p>A protest at the San Francisco International Airport against <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"">Donald Trump</a>'s January 2017 executive order on immigration, January 28, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1c3161d000015007cd8d9.jpg?ops=crop_0_0_1024_678%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump says he inherited “a mess” when he became president, but many of those messes are of his own making, as shown by his latest effort as president to make good on wild promises he made on the campaign trail.Trump first called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” back in December 2015. The incendiary call was a major turning point in his campaign, galvanizing his base and putting him at the center of media attention.It was patently clear, however, that a complete ban on one religion would be unconstitutional. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said Trump came to him about “the Muslim ban” and asked for help to “show me the right way to do it legally.” Shortly after securing the Republican nomination in July 2016, Trump said, “People were so upset when I used the word Muslim. Oh, you can’t use the word Muslim. Remember this. And I’m okay with that, because I’m talking territory instead of Muslim.”He pivoted to name several countries where Muslims live rather than Muslims per se, and to ban the entry of people from those countries in his first executive order. He temporarily banned entry from nationals of seven predominantly Muslim countries, and suspended the refugee resettlement program, while setting up a new system of extreme vetting for these, and potentially other, groups.But, as pointed out in an amicus brief challenging the order from 10 top national security figures, including former secretaries of State and Homeland Security, and former CIA and NSA directors, “since 2001, not a single terrorist attack in the United States has been perpetrated by aliens from the countries named in the Order.”One of the courts staying the first order noted that the government had “not offered any evidence to identify the national security concerns that allegedly prompted this EO, or even described the process by which the president concluded that the action was necessary.”The revised order does try to cook up evidence to support a national security need—boilerplate descriptions of the six Muslim majority countries (Iraq is dropped from the list) whose nationals would be barred from entry for 90 days, as well as examples of two Iraqi refugees who were convicted for plotting terrorist activities and a Somali refugee who came as a child, became a naturalized citizen, and was convicted of another terrorist plot. The order vaguely alludes to 300 people who entered as refugees who are currently the subjects of FBI counterterrorism investigations.While 300 people under investigation does, indeed, sound ominous, it is 0.01 percent of the 3 million refugees admitted since 1980, and there is no indication yet that any of them have actually been involved in any terrorist activities. There is also no indication of how long they have lived in the United States. If they came as children, like the Somali mentioned in the order, no amount of vetting would have predicted their potential as terror threats many years later.Let’s not lose sight of the politics at work here. As Justice David Souter, writing for the majority, said in a case involving the display of the 10 Commandments in the McCreary County courthouse in Kentucky, “The world is not made brand new every morning.” The Supreme Court was not willing to confine its purview to the display per se, but rather looked at prior statements and actions of local officials who had made clear their intent to favor Judeo-Christian precepts over other religions.The same principle applies to the revised executive order. Though cleansed of overt references to Muslims—while continuing to use code words like “honor killings”—the order is still contaminated by Trump’s campaign rhetoric and promises. As Justice Souter reminds us, that cannot be forgotten or ignored. On March 9, Washington State’s Attorney General, who successfully filed suit against the first order, said that “the core constitutional problems remain the same.”To gain the presidency, Trump employed classic scapegoating tactics to whip up fear of refugees “pouring into our country” through the “Trojan horse” of the U.S. refugee resettlement program and of Muslims, whom he broadly conflated with terrorism. His continuing ham-fisted efforts to tar all members of entire nationalities and to vilify refugees have less to do with protecting the country against actual threats than proving that he meant what he said during the campaign.While great latitude remains for the president to take reasonable steps to screen would be immigrants and to choose which and how many refugees to admit, he has cast doubt on his own authority to do so by introducing noxious prejudice into the equation."
62,POLITICS,"Political Street Theater: How to Organize a Die-In to Protest Attacks on Medicaid, Affordable Care Act and Other Safety Net Programs","Ellen Freudenheim, ContributorFreelance writer, activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/political-street-theater-how-to-organize-a-die-in_us_58c1a678e4b0a797c1d39a3d,"Street protests are back. And they come in various forms: the march, the rally, the prayer service, the vigil. And, that",2017-03-09,"<p>At a fake tombstone-making workshop in Brooklyn, preparing for a citizen “Die In” protest of efforts to “repeal/replace” the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. March 9, 2017</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c1a7252700001b00749140.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Street protests are back. And they come in various forms: the march, the rally, the prayer service, the vigil. And, that simplest form of street theater, the Die-In.The Die-In is striking, unnatural and can be devastating. It can be used as gut-punch way to illustrate the real human impact of life-and-death policies, for instance, pertaining to the availability of health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. A visceral and visual form of protest, Die-Ins have been deployed by different groups for different reasons. Environmental activists, AIDS activists, gun control activists, anti-nuclear activists, cyclist safety activists, Black Lives Matter activists, and health provider activists have all staged them. The Die-In has been used to highlight violence against women in Madrid; by protestors against Egyptian president Sisi in London and by vegan activists in Paris. Sometimes they are held in a public space, like a park. Some are staged close to the belly of whatever beast is being challenged, such as the NRA, a government building, or a complacent Congress. An article in the National Journal dates the American Die-In to the roiling 1970s, but the chances are that this imagery has been staged through the centuries. Why, beyond the truism that nothing’s new under the sun? Because in its silence and universal familiarity, the evocation of mass death is instantly recognizable, and disturbing. Because, it’s simple, and powerful.The Die-In is easy to stage. But if this action captures your imagination, check out other actions described here: Protest Theater in an Age of Entertainment Politics , Bread and Puppet Theater and other social justice puppet groups, and the satirical group, Billionaires for Bush. All can be filed under the same category, as art and theater speaking power to authoritarianism, discrimination, and oppression. NUTS AND BOLTS OF PLANNING A DIE-IN TO SUPPORT OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMSIn the current political environment, where long-held “safety net” programs are under attack by those in power, the Die-In format is one that can be used by activists nationwide. Here’s a template, of sorts: What is a Die-In?: It’s a highly visual form of citizen protest that uses elements of street theater. During a Die-In, volunteers pretend to die, to convey the idea that something or someone—the target of the action—is literally killing people. Those pretending to have died remain play-dead for a few minutes, or longer. Often there’s a meditative silence during the Die-In. Signage and speeches are used to explain the issue. Die-Ins take space, are not spontaneous, and can be held before or after speeches, marches, rallies, and other events. Where Do You Do It? Pick a location where your audience can see the action, and where a photographer can get a good photo from above, perhaps on steps or on a plaza. For the comfort of participants, grass is best. When picking a location, consult a photographer (or think like one).How Many People? If you Google images of “die-ins,” it’s clear that even a few dozen people make a powerful visual.Program: Unlike a rally where everyone is carrying signs, the action of “dying” needs context and explanation. Keep the dramatic dying element for last to ensure that your crowd stays till the end. Testimonials are powerful. Props: Visuals that carry your message are useful, such as homemade cardboard cut-out tombstones, or signs. Sometimes those doing the “dying” to wear the same color clothing, say, black pants and white tops, for visual impact. If you are creating props, plan ahead. You can canvass local stores for free supplies, like cardboard boxes. Messaging: The imagery of mass death is powerful, so the messaging can be simple and explanatory. Complex policy issues can be discussed by speakers, or in hand outs. (See below for specific health care messages from March 2017.)Call to action: Participants and passersby may be engaged by the Die-In action. It’s a good moment to circulate petitions or delineate specific calls to action. Choreography & Body Chalking: Plan out the choreography of the “dying” carefully, both for safety and for the photographic image. The “fallers” can fall in a pattern, a circle, a line, a pile. They can also be chalked with white chalk, so when the participating person stands up, the mark is left. Avoiding Injuries/Distress: People can hurt themselves if they over dramatize, get dizzy or cold, or have mobility limitations. If the event is scheduled outdoors or during winter, advise participants to bring something to lie down on. If it’s scorching hot, sunscreen, sunglasses and hats are helpful. Also, people at risk or who have experienced loss, specifically from the issue being protested (like lack of insurance) might find the die-in distressing. You might remind people that participation in the Die-In is at participants’ own risk. Media Before/After the Event:  A Die-In is a made-for-media event. For that same reason, it can’t be overdone or overused, or what was powerful risks becoming trite. You can list “Photo Ops” in your pre-event press advisory. For instance: “Die-In of 50 health care providers.” Getting Permits: This is a perfectly legal activity. Check with your local police department for rally, march, and sound permits. It’s perfectly possible to obtain them! Just allow sufficient time to fill in and submit the necessary forms. Civil Disobedience: Die in’s have been used for intentional civil disobedience protests, for instance in blocking streets. If that’s what you are doing, know your rights, have necessary ID with you, and be prepared for the possibility of arrest. Music: Consider taps, ringing a bell, reading out causes of death or political demands.The author is a participant in the “Get Organized Brooklyn” community-based effort."

Two months later, he remains in that station. But the hype around him has heightened to a point that a foreboding thought has replaced the anticipation.What if the time doesn’t come for the 35-year-old Harvard and Oxford graduate, Rhodes scholar, Afghanistan veteran, Navy reservist and openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana? What if Buttigieg’s political careeer is imprisoned by the state in which he resides?Such hypotheticals are the parlor games of political junkies. But the question isn’t so far from Buttigieg’s mind, either. He finds it inherently intolerable, because it implies his state has no place for a young progressive Democrat like him, at least not at its higher political levels.“I definitely don’t feel imprisoned,” he told The Huffington Post. “I feel like I’m at home. I live here and I love this community. And the benefit I have is I have a really compelling, great day job. So it’s not like I’m in a hurry to find something else to do.”But Buttigieg is also honest enough to admit that he envisions what the future has in store. And as he surveys next steps, he has gamed out both the opportunities and hurdles; the offices that match his interests and those that don’t.One place that falls into that latter category is Congress. “I don’t think that’s going to be me,” he says of a future there, even though his district is represented by a lawmaker with whom he’s had sharp, public disagreements: Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.). It is the culture of Congress that turns him off; a departure, he notes, from politicians of yesteryear ― like Barack Obama, John F. Kennedy, George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney ― who viewed the legislative branch as a job of stature, if not a critical stepping stone.“Congress has become less attractive for people,” Buttigieg said. “I think a lot of emerging leaders take a look at opportunities to run for Congress and decide it is not for them.”But if the future for Buttigieg is in Indiana, it’s in an Indiana that is fundamentally different than the current version, which hasn’t had a Democratic governor since 2004. Buttigieg doesn’t downplay the task. Instead, he ties it directly to what drew him to the DNC race in the first place: the idea that the party should not just focus on elections themselves, but on all the preceding ingredients that make those contests more winnable.“There is that question: ‘How do people advance, especially when we are producing a lot of great emerging Democrats in red states?’ And I suppose the simple answer ― not to say the easy answer ― is to have those states not be so red any more,” he said. “I don’t think things are as fixed or predictable as a lot of people think they are. But it is a challenge.”Though Buttigieg was one of the youngest candidates for DNC chair, his bid became a magnet for some of the party’s graybeards. He earned the endorsement of the most former chairs, including Howard Dean, whose 50-state strategy for rebuilding the party was the template every single aspirant pledged to mirror.He also had Obama’s attention. The former president followed the race closely and, according to close aides, admired the clarity of Buttigieg’s candidacy and his ability to communicate progressive policies with a calm, approachable demeanor. Obama had earlier labelled Buttigieg one of the four Democrats he envisioned as the future of the party, the other three being U.S. senators. And others in Obama’s universe shared his appreciation for the South Bend mayor’s potential.David Axelrod, Obama’s longtime adviser, told HuffPost he viewed Buttigieg as “an enormously talented guy in a difficult state” who “definitely elevated himself in the DNC race.” His wife was even more impressed, hosting a meet-and-greet for Buttigieg during the race. “She loves him,” Axelrod said in an email.Buttigieg is aware of his appeal to an older generation of Democrats. Some of it he chalks up to standard political decorum. “A lot of folks were telling me I was the future while I was really trying to concentrate on the present,” he explained. “They would say all kinds of nice things and then swear up and down that I was their second vote, which was a nice way of saying, ‘I’m not going to vote for you.’” But he also recognizes that he is, in part, a vessel for that generation’s hopes for a better future for the party; a personification of the younger generation of Democrats they hope to empower but who have become disillusioned or have never really engaged at all. Dean, who endorsed Buttigieg late in the DNC race, spoke of the mayor in precisely these terms to explain what drew him in. “He is the face of the first global generation,” Dean said. “They don’t like institutions or care about them or consider themselves Democrats. And they are incredibly good at organizing, but it’s always on an ad hoc basis. They don’t need institutions to do it, because it is done on the Internet.”“This generation is going to win eventually, because they will outlast the generation that voted for Trump. And I think this is an opportunity to get them into organized politics,” he continued. “I saw Buttigieg as a way to be a face of the first globals who would understand how to organize, and I think that’s true still.” Dean added that Buttigieg’s allure was more than just symbolic, that he had a resume and a record of executive leadership to stand on his own. But there certainly is something to the notion that Democratic officials have yet to fully grasp that they are conduits, not leaders, in the age of Donald Trump. Buttigieg himself acknowledged as much. The moment that surprised him most during his run for DNC chair, he said, was when he found himself in a van on a freeway in Houston, chasing fellow candidate (and eventual winner) Tom Perez to an airport protest over the president’s first iteration of a Muslim ban.“Just imagine this slow-speed car chase up the freeway of Houston, where you have a former Cabinet secretary and a mayor in hot pursuit, racing to catch up to a 20-something on Facebook who a few hours earlier had started this action,” he recalled. “It really symbolized where the party is. The politicians are racing to catch up.” History will show that Buttigieg earned just one vote in his run for DNC chair in 2017. Ohio committeewoman Nan Whaley cast her ballot for the mayor during the first round, after Buttigieg had dropped out of the race. And yet no one, save Perez, did more to advance his own cause during the course of the race. Buttigieg became the rarest of political commodities: a man in a hurry who didn’t suffer the tar of appearing overly ambitious (though all politicians are). What he failed to receive is clarity on what comes next. Dean suggested that a run for governor of Indiana was the most logical move, arguing that Buttigieg already has the experience of running statewide (losing his campaign for state treasurer in 2010), but now has far more clout, appeal and experience. Axelrod also offered that a gubernatorial run in 2020 made sense. And if not, he added, Buttigieg would be wise to do forums around the country and play a major role in a presidential campaign, which would “put him in close proximity to the candidate” and “set him up for an administration role” should that candidate win. Though Buttigieg has what he calls “a blessedly nonpartisan existence” in South Bend, he recognizes that it won’t always be so tidy and quaint. And he seems at peace with that, too. It’s why he ran for DNC chair, he said, knowing full well that a foray into national politics and an audition for a second job may have played poorly back at home. Buttigieg may or may not end up being the “future” of the Democratic Party. But at a time when the party is suffering a crisis of identity and an absence of direction and power, he wants, at a minimum, to play a role. “The question is, how do we resist and respond and oppose without losing our proactive and positive agenda?” he asked. “And I still don’t know fully how to square the circle. But I know it is going to be the central challenge in the next few years.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated Nan Whaley’s gender.Want more updates from Sam Stein?

Obama had earlier labelled Buttigieg one of the four Democrats he envisioned as the future of the party, the other three being U.S. senators. And others in Obama’s universe shared his appreciation for the South Bend mayor’s potential.David Axelrod, Obama’s longtime adviser, told HuffPost he viewed Buttigieg as “an enormously talented guy in a difficult state” who “definitely elevated himself in the DNC race.” His wife was even more impressed, hosting a meet-and-greet for Buttigieg during the race. “She loves him,” Axelrod said in an email.Buttigieg is aware of his appeal to an older generation of Democrats. Some of it he chalks up to standard political decorum. “A lot of folks were telling me I was the future while I was really trying to concentrate on the present,” he explained. “They would say all kinds of nice things and then swear up and down that I was their second vote, which was a nice way of saying, ‘I’m not going to vote for you.’” But he also recognizes that he is, in part, a vessel for that generation’s hopes for a better future for the party; a personification of the younger generation of Democrats they hope to empower but who have become disillusioned or have never really engaged at all. Dean, who endorsed Buttigieg late in the DNC race, spoke of the mayor in precisely these terms to explain what drew him in. “He is the face of the first global generation,” Dean said. “They don’t like institutions or care about them or consider themselves Democrats. And they are incredibly good at organizing, but it’s always on an ad hoc basis. They don’t need institutions to do it, because it is done on the Internet.”“This generation is going to win eventually, because they will outlast the generation that voted for Trump. And I think this is an opportunity to get them into organized politics,” he continued. “I saw Buttigieg as a way to be a face of the first globals who would understand how to organize, and I think that’s true still.” Dean added that Buttigieg’s allure was more than just symbolic, that he had a resume and a record of executive leadership to stand on his own. But there certainly is something to the notion that Democratic officials have yet to fully grasp that they are conduits, not leaders, in the age of Donald Trump. Buttigieg himself acknowledged as much. The moment that surprised him most during his run for DNC chair, he said, was when he found himself in a van on a freeway in Houston, chasing fellow candidate (and eventual winner) Tom Perez to an airport protest over the president’s first iteration of a Muslim ban.“Just imagine this slow-speed car chase up the freeway of Houston, where you have a former Cabinet secretary and a mayor in hot pursuit, racing to catch up to a 20-something on Facebook who a few hours earlier had started this action,” he recalled. “It really symbolized where the party is. The politicians are racing to catch up.” History will show that Buttigieg earned just one vote in his run for DNC chair in 2017. Ohio committeewoman Nan Whaley cast her ballot for the mayor during the first round, after Buttigieg had dropped out of the race. And yet no one, save Perez, did more to advance his own cause during the course of the race. Buttigieg became the rarest of political commodities: a man in a hurry who didn’t suffer the tar of appearing overly ambitious (though all politicians are). What he failed to receive is clarity on what comes next. Dean suggested that a run for governor of Indiana was the most logical move, arguing that Buttigieg already has the experience of running statewide (losing his campaign for state treasurer in 2010), but now has far more clout, appeal and experience. Axelrod also offered that a gubernatorial run in 2020 made sense. And if not, he added, Buttigieg would be wise to do forums around the country and play a major role in a presidential campaign, which would “put him in close proximity to the candidate” and “set him up for an administration role” should that candidate win. Though Buttigieg has what he calls “a blessedly nonpartisan existence” in South Bend, he recognizes that it won’t always be so tidy and quaint. And he seems at peace with that, too. It’s why he ran for DNC chair, he said, knowing full well that a foray into national politics and an audition for a second job may have played poorly back at home. Buttigieg may or may not end up being the “future” of the Democratic Party. But at a time when the party is suffering a crisis of identity and an absence of direction and power, he wants, at a minimum, to play a role. “The question is, how do we resist and respond and oppose without losing our proactive and positive agenda?” he asked. “And I still don’t know fully how to square the circle. But I know it is going to be the central challenge in the next few years.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated Nan Whaley’s gender.Want more updates from Sam Stein?

Riot policemen fired tear gas to remove peasant farmers who set up barricades and burned tires to block a main avenue as they demanded that a decree disallowing Bajo Aguan farmers in northern Honduras from being armed, be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bf65531e00003f0077e66a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of Honduran famers and their families have sued the World Bank, alleging it supported a violent palm-oil company that assassinated peasants opposing the business. The bank’s lending arm, the International Finance Corporation, was “knowingly profiting from the financing of murder” by loaning money to the Dinant Corporation that ruthlessly sought control of agricultural land in northern Honduras, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in a Washington, D.C., federal court. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists first reported about the lawsuit on Wednesday. The organization, through a partnership with The Huffington Post, has previously reported in detail about the IFC’s role in the struggle over the Bajo Aguan region in Honduras in recent years. There, changes to a land ownership law laid the foundation for the conflict between poorer farmers and industrialists buying up property tracts. Locals who have spoken out against Dinant have been silenced. In October, two members of a peasants rights organization were fatally shot by a “paramilitary death squad,” the lawsuit claims. In another alleged atrocity, the suit claims, Dinant guards opened fire on women and children who’d taken shelter at a government site to escape floods. The shooting injured two people, according to the complaint. A preacher who had criticized Dinant from the pulpit disappeared in 2012 and was found dead four days later, having suffered fatal head injuries. An investigator that the ICIJ interviewed in 2015 said there were 133 killings linked to disputes over land use in the area. Others have been evicted or even kidnapped from their homes by Dinant’s forces, according to allegations reported in The Guardian in 2014.Seven of the plaintiffs against the World Bank are relatives of people allegedly killed by Dinant security forces. The IFC and Dinant, which was owned by one of Honduras’ most wealthy and powerful men, have financial ties. Dinant received $15 million directly from the ICF in 2009 and one of its largest financial backers in Honduras received $70 million from the ICF in 2011, according to the ICIJ.The suit contends that the IFC knew or should have known about Dinant’s repressive tactics. The World Bank’s own internal investigation found that the IFC committed several ethical failures vis-a-vis its dealings with Dinant. The World Bank has said it helped reduce violence in Bajo Aguan by lobbying Dinant to disarm its guards on company plantations and creating a mediation process for peasants and the company to settle disagreements. IFC officials declined to comment to the ICIJ about the lawsuit. Dinant has denied wrongdoing and claimed that its vast land holdings were acquired legally. “I am sorry that so little respect is felt for Dinant’s more than 8,000 employees, their families, its shareholders and the communities that work with us, as to imply such blatant falsehoods,” said spokesman Roger Pineda in an email to the ICIJ.The company’s workers at times have been victims of violence as well. A Human Rights Watch report describes a 2011 incident in which four Dinant guards and one farmworker were slain by peasants trying to take over the plantation."

Indi Irvin, a U.K.-based model signed with MSA Models, protested outside the Balenciaga show on Saturday, holding up a sign that read “Les Modèles Noirs Importent,” or as it’s translated, “Black Models Matter.” The signage spoke to the brand’s historical lack of diversity on the runway.The arena was fitting ― Refinery29 reports there were only four models of color of the 47 models who walked in the Balenciaga show (which was actually an improvement over past seasons) ― but her protest speaks to the event as a whole. As New York Fashion Week has made slow but sure strides to be more inclusive, Paris, Milan and London have continued to come up short.Irvin explained on Instagram that she was planning to protest Lanvin or Celine, or any show that “was big enough to grab the attention back to the cause,” and it “just worked out best at Balenciaga.” She also explained why she felt like now was the right time to speak out.“2017 was a big year not only politically but also for my modeling career as it was my first season in the European market,” she wrote. “It is very different here compared to the NYC I’m used too [sic]. February was black history and march is women’s so it just felt right.”A few days prior, Irvin pointed out that Gucci, which showed at Milan Fashion Week on Feb. 22, featured just 17 models of color out of 119 total models. “It’s 2017,” she wrote. The protest caught the attention of many news outlets and street style photographers, including Phil Oh (Mr. Street Peeper) and Melodie Jeng, and with good reason. While Balenciaga did not return a request by The Huffington Post for comment at the time of publication, we applaud Irvin for taking matters into her own hands in the name of inclusivity."
71,POLITICS,Republicans’ Obamacare Replacement Just Got A Powerful Enemy,Daniel Marans and Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-obamacare-replacement-aarp_us_58bf4cf9e4b0ed71826809f0,AARP announces its opposition to the bill.,2017-03-08,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), right, addresses questions about the American Health Care Act with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bf4fdc1d000039007cd0cd.jpeg?cache=qbX8v9rvhR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Provisions in the House Republicans’ Obamacare replacement bill that would raise insurance costs for older Americans are drawing resistance from the influential seniors’ lobby.The American Health Care Act, as Republicans are calling it, would allow insurers to make premiums for older Americans five times what they charge younger workers ― provided that a state’s regulations allow for it. Obamacare had capped this ratio, known as an “age rating,” at 3 to 1.The measure was chief among the reasons AARP, the nation’s largest organization for older Americans, cited in explaining its opposition to the House bill on Tuesday evening.“Older Americans need affordable health care services and prescriptions,” AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond said in a statement. “This plan goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance premiums for older Americans and not doing anything to lower drug costs.”AARP, which has nearly 38 million members ages 50 and older, is also firmly opposed to a pair of major changes to Medicaid that the House bill includes. One is a rollback of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which made the program available to millions of low-income adults, many of them seniors, who had no insurance before. The other is a new Medicaid funding formula that could leave states on the hook for more and more money, a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded Tuesday. That might force states to make cuts that hurt seniors, many of whom rely on Medicaid for nursing home care and other health services.“Medicaid cuts could impact people of all ages and put at risk the health and safety of 17.4 million children and adults with disabilities and seniors by eliminating much needed services that allow individuals to live independently in their homes and communities,” LeaMond said. “This harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable.” AARP used its considerable political power to help pass Obamacare in 2010, despite the opposition of many members ― about 400,000 left the organization in protest. AARP’s objection to key elements of the Republican bill to replace the landmark law could prove just as influential.“[AARP] backed it and paid the price for backing it, so why not support it against repeal?” said Fred Lynch, a professor at Claremont McKenna College and author of “One Nation Under AARP.” “The Congress is genuinely afraid of age power, and they’d just as soon let the sleeping giant go on sleeping.”“The only possible leader right now is AARP, so it’s sort of in their hands,” he said.The mammoth organization has already registered its opposition to the two measures in letters to Congress in late January and early February.AARP premiered a new video advertisement for the campaign on Monday, suggesting it was ramping up its efforts to kill the provision. In the tongue-in-cheek ad that runs for just over a minute, a man chopping wood alongside a squirrel named Charlie expresses his anger at the “age tax.”“You know, Charlie and I were watching the news this morning, and they said that Congress has just introduced a new age-rating bill,” the wood-chopping narrator says. “And I was like, ‘What the heck is age rating?’ Then Charlie explained that it’s Washington politician-speak for overcharging older Americans for their health insurance while lining the insurance companies’ pockets.”The ad is part of an advocacy campaign AARP launched Feb. 15 to specifically combat a rise in the “age rating,” which it is calling an “age tax.” At the time, the organization encouraged its members to call those in Congress who were active in drafting the health care legislation to oppose the rating provision.AARP’s concern about how the Republican bill would affect Americans 50 and older is well-founded, according to two health care experts.“Across the board, what it does is shift costs from younger people to older people,” said Timothy Jost, a leading health reform expert and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.Republicans introduced the proposal with the goal of enticing younger Americans to buy health insurance and rebalance insurance risk pools, according to Jost.The bill would also create a tax credit to buy insurance that increases based on age. But the tax credits are, at most, twice as large for older Americans while the premiums could be five times higher.“It is sending seniors a 2-foot rope to get themselves out of a 10-foot hole,” said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute.Corlette predicted that under the Republican plan, many Americans in their 50s and early 60s would be unable to pay for private insurance and would end up going without coverage. That risks driving up medical debt, which could lead to more bankruptcies.Some might delay retirement to keep employer-sponsored insurance, Corlette suggested.“If there is less coverage as people get older, people ... are less likely to leave a job to care for a family member or pursue their own business,” she added.Many of the older Americans hardest hit by these changes live in rural, Republican-leaning areas, according to an interactive analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Under the House plan, 60-year-olds earning $30,000 a year would see their tax credits drop 75 percent or more in most of Arizona and large swaths of western Nebraska. The least affected states include solidly Democratic Washington, Vermont, New York and Massachusetts.“They didn’t run this by the politicians. They didn’t look at it seriously in terms of its effect on Republican voters and [Donald] Trump voters,” said Jost, who is also a contributing editor at Health Affairs.AARP represents an older demographic that leans Republican and tended to vote for Trump in November. Republican senators spent much of their time Tuesday dodging questions about the specifics of the House Republican bill, saying they needed more time to read it. Asked about the language in the bill that would allow insurers to charge their oldest customers five times what they charge younger ones, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he’s fine with it. “Five-to-one’s been a standard part of the process and what it was several years ago,” he said. “No, five-to-one doesn’t concern me at all.” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said he’s still studying the bill and that there’s “a lot I’m not wild about,” but the increase in premiums for older Americans wasn’t one of them.“The current price controls are clearly not working,” he said. “Getting away from price controls would probably improve the viability of the individual market.”Pressed on the fact that it could mean older workers will have to postpone their retirement if the Republican bill passes, Toomey said, “I will leave it at that.”Unlike her colleagues, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) expressed concern about the change. “Well it depends on how you structure the credit because, in fact, seniors are more expensive, but if you offset that by giving them a greater credit you can make sure that they’re not hurt by the reality that seniors use more health care,” she said.But Collins acknowledged that preliminary analyses of the credits afforded under the bill to older customers suggest they won’t keep pace with the higher premiums.“Well, that’s an issue that I have. I need more information about the credits and also about the fact that it looks like the credits are the same amount whether you make the bottom of pay scale, or income scale, or the top.”"

In the tongue-in-cheek ad that runs for just over a minute, a man chopping wood alongside a squirrel named Charlie expresses his anger at the “age tax.”“You know, Charlie and I were watching the news this morning, and they said that Congress has just introduced a new age-rating bill,” the wood-chopping narrator says. “And I was like, ‘What the heck is age rating?’ Then Charlie explained that it’s Washington politician-speak for overcharging older Americans for their health insurance while lining the insurance companies’ pockets.”The ad is part of an advocacy campaign AARP launched Feb. 15 to specifically combat a rise in the “age rating,” which it is calling an “age tax.” At the time, the organization encouraged its members to call those in Congress who were active in drafting the health care legislation to oppose the rating provision.AARP’s concern about how the Republican bill would affect Americans 50 and older is well-founded, according to two health care experts.“Across the board, what it does is shift costs from younger people to older people,” said Timothy Jost, a leading health reform expert and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.Republicans introduced the proposal with the goal of enticing younger Americans to buy health insurance and rebalance insurance risk pools, according to Jost.The bill would also create a tax credit to buy insurance that increases based on age. But the tax credits are, at most, twice as large for older Americans while the premiums could be five times higher.“It is sending seniors a 2-foot rope to get themselves out of a 10-foot hole,” said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute.Corlette predicted that under the Republican plan, many Americans in their 50s and early 60s would be unable to pay for private insurance and would end up going without coverage. That risks driving up medical debt, which could lead to more bankruptcies.Some might delay retirement to keep employer-sponsored insurance, Corlette suggested.“If there is less coverage as people get older, people ... are less likely to leave a job to care for a family member or pursue their own business,” she added.Many of the older Americans hardest hit by these changes live in rural, Republican-leaning areas, according to an interactive analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Under the House plan, 60-year-olds earning $30,000 a year would see their tax credits drop 75 percent or more in most of Arizona and large swaths of western Nebraska. The least affected states include solidly Democratic Washington, Vermont, New York and Massachusetts.“They didn’t run this by the politicians. They didn’t look at it seriously in terms of its effect on Republican voters and [Donald] Trump voters,” said Jost, who is also a contributing editor at Health Affairs.AARP represents an older demographic that leans Republican and tended to vote for Trump in November. Republican senators spent much of their time Tuesday dodging questions about the specifics of the House Republican bill, saying they needed more time to read it. Asked about the language in the bill that would allow insurers to charge their oldest customers five times what they charge younger ones, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he’s fine with it. “Five-to-one’s been a standard part of the process and what it was several years ago,” he said. “No, five-to-one doesn’t concern me at all.” Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said he’s still studying the bill and that there’s “a lot I’m not wild about,” but the increase in premiums for older Americans wasn’t one of them.“The current price controls are clearly not working,” he said. “Getting away from price controls would probably improve the viability of the individual market.”Pressed on the fact that it could mean older workers will have to postpone their retirement if the Republican bill passes, Toomey said, “I will leave it at that.”Unlike her colleagues, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) expressed concern about the change. “Well it depends on how you structure the credit because, in fact, seniors are more expensive, but if you offset that by giving them a greater credit you can make sure that they’re not hurt by the reality that seniors use more health care,” she said.But Collins acknowledged that preliminary analyses of the credits afforded under the bill to older customers suggest they won’t keep pace with the higher premiums.“Well, that’s an issue that I have. I need more information about the credits and also about the fact that it looks like the credits are the same amount whether you make the bottom of pay scale, or income scale, or the top.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c05d392700003300748dc9.jpeg?cache=zgaxe1EaO5&ops=crop_0_677_2086_1903%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Less than a year after noting she “doesn’t agree” with the LGBTQ “lifestyle,” “American Idol” alum La’Porsha Renae made some startling claims about her own sexuality. Renae, who lost to Trent Harmon on the final season of “Idol,” responded to a Twitter user’s claims that she was homophobic early Wednesday. The 23-year-old singer quickly denied the accusation. But the Mississippi native didn’t stop there. When another Twitter user took issue with Renae deeming that being gay was a “choice,” she responded: Another Twitter user pressed her for clarification, to which she replied:When another user refuted her claims that sexuality was a choice, Renae noted: Renae, who is gearing up for the release of her debut album, “Already All Ready,” had to backpedal last year after making controversial remarks about the LGBTQ community in an interview. In a conference call with reporters after her “American Idol” stint wrapped, Renae was asked about Mississippi’s House Bill 1523, a “religious liberty” law that allows people with faith-based objections to deny wedding services to same-sex couples, Billboard reported. “I am one of the people who don’t really agree with that lifestyle. I wasn’t brought up that way. It wasn’t how I was raised,” Renae said at the time. The singer went on to disclose that she has “a lot of friends and a lot of people that I love dearly who are gay and homosexual and they’re such sweet, nice people.”Renae took to Periscope just days later, where she apologized and attempted to clarify her comments. “I can understand when I read it back why people were offended and for that I deeply apologize because I wasn’t trying to offend anyone by what I said, I was just trying to honestly answer a question that actually caught me off-guard,” she said in the chat. “It was supposed to be an interview about singing, and it became political and I’m not a political person, at all.”UPDATE March 8: Renae elaborated on her remarks in an email to The Huffington Post. “I decided to be heterosexual because I felt like that’s the life God intended me to live. My response to your skepticism is that many people walk many different strokes of life,” she wrote. “Some people believe they chose homosexuality and some believe they didn’t. Who’s to say one is wrong? It’s not fair to generalize anyone’s sexuality or walk of life.” She continued: Let people believe what they want to believe about themselves. Life can be a complex thing. It’s not always black or white. I took a journey and became more grounded in my faith, and decided that I wanted to live a heterosexual life. The main point I want people to take away from my Tweets is that we are all shaped by different experiences, and we should all love and respect one another. We don’t have to have the same truths or personal belief systems to love one another and get along. I have homosexual friends and family. I believe in God and Jesus, my christ and savior, yet i have CLOSE friends who are atheists, friends who are Muslims, friends who are Jewish, friends who are transgender and believe God gave them the wrong body... We ALL LOVE ONE ANOTHER... we don’t try to “convert” each other and we don’t CONDEMN each other for how different our walks of life are.For the latest in LGBTQ culture, don’t miss the Queer Voices newsletter."

But let’s be honest, can you spoil history?By the time Joan Crawford and Bette Davis started work together on 1962’s “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?” they were starving for roles.In the ‘30s and ‘40s, they had been Hollywood stars. But by the early ‘60s, they were in their 50s ― ancient by Hollywood’s standards of women then and still today. “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?” represented the best script they’d been offered in ages. Oscar potential, even. The trouble was, the pair couldn’t stand each other. In FX’s “Feud,” which chronicles the real-life rivalry between Crawford (Jessica Lange) and Davis (Susan Sarandon) surrounding production of the film, the two women are forced to reckon with a conflict fueled for years, in large part, by increasingly limited offers for women their age.“You know how it goes,” laments a beautician working a thick cream into Joan’s neck in the first episode. “Men age, they get ‘character.’ Women age, they get lost.” “Feud,” created by Ryan Murphy of “American Horror Story” fame, is not shy about its message: Hollywood was lousy with ageist, sexist thinking back in the day. As studio boss Jack Warner (Stanley Tucci) observes, scotch may get better as time passes, but “broads, they just get sour,” a line that could just as easily been delivered in 2017. (If behind closed doors.)There are many moments that illustrate the continued sexism of Hollywood, but perhaps none better than one quietly moving scene between Joan’s housekeeper-slash-body-woman Mamasita (Jackie Hoffman) and the director’s assistant Pauline (Alison Wright). At a time when there were few, if any, women directors of “talkie” films, Pauline wants a chance at the helm ― but has faced rejection. Mamasita imparts encouragement with information from U.S. Census reports she’d read in the library, telling her dejected friend how women had recently begun to outnumber men in the U.S. population.“Should someone tell the men they’re going extinct?” Pauline jokes.“Not extinct,” she is corrected, “Minority.” Men “have shorter lives because they are less strong, and many die in war,” she said, explaining their decreasing number and suggesting Hollywood would soon have to reckon with the reality of audience demographics.“Studios will have obligations to make half of stories about women, by women, for women,” Mamasita says. “It only makes economic sense. Keep your head up. Your day is coming.”But 50 years after the events in the show, those predictions have yet to manifest. Pauline ― a studio insider and experienced hand on set ― might have just as hard a time directing her film in 2017. Crawford and Davis might have just as tough a time finding meaty roles. And that’s what makes watching “Feud” feel so familiar. Most films are still made about men, by men and for, well, everyone, through lack of other options. Women made up just 4 percent of those who directed 1,000 popular films from 2007 to 2016. While women can now find more work in short-form and independent films, they’re still not trusted, it seems, with the wide-release fare that costs studios tens of millions of dollars. Pauline’s day may come, but it hasn’t yet. Studies consistently show a wide gap between the number of speaking roles allotted women and men in popular Hollywood films, too. For older actresses, the picture is bleaker still ― particularly in lead roles like the ones Crawford and Davis tackled in “Baby Jane.”Characters past age 60, regardless of gender, are underrepresented, according to a recent study, but that’s especially true for women. And over half a century after “Baby Jane” debuted to critical acclaim, older lead characters are still very rare in lists of Oscar nominees. The same study found that zero female characters over 60 appeared as leads in the 25 films nominated for Oscars in the past three years. Gender aside, there were only two lead characters aged 60-plus during that time. Michael Keaton played them both. Although Crawford and Davis played characters in their mid-to-late 50s, being similarly aged themselves, it’s likely they would’ve been fighting the same fights today.That’s even when women outnumber men by millions, and even when female-led films have been shown to crush box office expectations.“Feud” creator Murphy knows this. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he stressed the feminist motivation behind the new series’ inaugural season, explaining that he “wanted to tell a story about modern issues that are facing women today, and, oddly enough, nothing’s changed.”“You’d think things have progressed. They have not,” he said, diving into a laundry list of problems in Hollywood. “So really it’s a show about sexism and misogyny, and why aren’t women being paid as much as men, and why in our culture we have ‘It’ girls and not ‘It’ boys, and why do women feel there’s only room for there to be one successful woman at a time?”In “Feud,” we watch two legendary actresses scheme to undermine each other’s odds at scoring another Oscar for her shelf, frustrated that the industry they love no longer seems to love them back.It’s a great comedy but, as Murphy said, also a great tragedy.

Muhammad Ali Jr. and Khalilah Camacho-Ali’s religious freedom campaign has drawn support from boxing legends like Evander Holyfield, Larry Holmes and Roberto Duran, and will raise awareness about the fight against Trump’s controversial executive order with the hashtag #AlivsTrump, The Associated Press reported.The campaign comes a month after Ali and his mother were detained at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport upon returning from Jamaica, in what the family’s attorney claims was a residual effect of Trump’s temporary travel ban on visitors from several countries with populations that are predominately Muslim.“There shouldn’t be a travel ban,” Camacho-Ali told the AP. “If I don’t speak up now, they’re going to keep harassing us … I’m paranoid. I’m just waiting for somebody to mess with me. That’s not a good feeling when you have to travel.”On Monday, Trump issued a revised travel ban ― which will take effect on March 16 ― that blocks citizens from six predominantly Muslim countries from obtaining visas for at least 90 days. His previous executive order was struck down by federal judges. To coincide with the launch of “Step Into the Ring,” Ali and Camacho-Ali will detail their experience to lawmakers during a forum on Thursday in Washington. Democrats invited the mother and son to speak at a meeting coordinated by members of the House subcommittee on border security, and the pair will use the forum to push to testify at a formal hearing.“We, as a family, have been fighting this for a very long time,” Camacho-Ali told the AP. “We are going to continue to fight for religious justice.”"
80,POLITICS,GOP Leaders Push Health Care Plan As Conservatives Lash Out,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-leaders-health-care-conservatives-lash-out_us_58c0278de4b0ed718268dce4,"Everything is fine, party leaders insist.",2017-03-08,"House Speaker Paul Ryan has expressed confidence that Republicans will support the health care plan introduced this week, but many conservatives aren't yet onboard. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c041bc1d000039007cd39a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House GOP leaders are forging ahead with their health care legislation, downplaying a potential conservative mutiny on the Republican proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act even as there are real questions whether their plan can pass.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) once again projected confidence Wednesday morning, telling reporters he was confident Republicans would get behind the complementary bills being reviewed by committees this afternoon.“I have no doubt we’ll pass this, because we’re going to keep our promises,” Ryan said.Ryan seems to have been living in a different world on the health care proposal. He said the legislation was the product of a “bottom-up process” that was more than a year long. In reality, committee leaders wrote the bills in private in exactly the way they wrongly accused Democrats of drafting the Affordable Care Act: without hearings or rank-and-file input.Ryan said any member who wanted to participate in drafting the repeal and replace plan could have helped. And while it’s true there were working groups for the legislation that members could have joined a long time ago, leaders actually hid the bills in an undisclosed room and didn’t let Republicans read the legislation until Monday.Regardless of the process, the speaker and other GOP leaders spent a good part of their closed-door conference meeting Wednesday morning trying to convince Republicans that this legislation is their only hope for repealing Obamacare.“They do play up the ‘take it or leave it,’” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) told The Huffington Post, adding that he was unconvinced by the sales pitch.Conservatives insist they will not vote for the current GOP legislation, which they’ve panned as “Obamacare 2.0” and “Obamacare-lite.” But leaders are betting that Republicans will eventually feel the pressure once President Donald Trump makes more of a push for their plan.“For a lot of them, they maybe haven’t felt the inertia that comes from Air Force One landing in their district,” Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) said of conservatives Wednesday, as he headed to mark up the bill that’s in his committee.Walden said he believes that, as whip efforts from the White House “ramp up,” conservatives will get onboard. “The dynamic changes,” he said.For now, House GOP leaders are trying to fill in the gaps left by mixed messages from the White House.“This was a rallying cry today to get our team on the same page,” Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) said of the conference meeting on Wednesday.Collins, who was the first member of Congress to endorse Trump, seemed to have accepted the leadership line that Republicans have only one option when it comes to the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.“The path forward is, if the Republican conference doesn’t pass this, our whole agenda goes down the tubes,” Collins said.“If we don’t get this done, woe be the Republican conference in 2018 midterm elections ― and we know this,” he added.Conservatives agreed that was the message on Wednesday. “They definitely have a rallying cry,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said, adding with a wink that “time will tell” if it’s an effective one. But conservatives don’t seem to buy the “this is our only shot” approach.Amash was emphatic Tuesday night after the House Freedom Caucus met that this health care plan isn’t the only path to getting rid of Obamacare. “It’s never true that you have to take whatever bill is given to you,” he said. Amash added that if Republicans don’t pass this version of health care legislation, they could pass something else, and he suggested the current plan is an impossible lift anyway. “It’s false that there are 218 votes,” Amash said, noting he had caught Ryan’s comments earlier in the day guaranteeing the votes for passage.Amash reiterated his belief that Republicans need to start the process over and begin with the conservative health care proposal written by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.), and he wholeheartedly rejected the idea that the current legislation backed by leadership is their only shot.“It’s false,” Amash said. “It’s like saying, ‘If we don’t eat dinner in Paris tonight, our families will starve.’”"
81,POLITICS,Conservatives Pick Up 'Mixed Messages' From White House On Health Care,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservatives-mixed-messages-white-house_us_58bf7a5fe4b0d1078ca224a0,And they don't think the GOP House bill will pass.,2017-03-08,"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C), the Freedom Caucus chairman, insists that the message had been consistent all day Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bf8d181e00002a0077e6ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Conservatives are questioning where the White House stands on the GOP health care bill, with House Freedom Caucus members saying late Tuesday that the Trump administration isn’t wedded to the the legislation ― which they say can’t pass anyway.Exiting a meeting with former Freedom Caucus member Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director, conservatives suggested the White House isn’t completely sold on the Republican House bill advancing through committees on Wednesday.“If you look at all the comments from the White House, you will find there is a mixed message,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said Tuesday night.Brooks made it clear there’s no mixed message coming from him. He’s strongly opposed to the so-called American Health Care Act ― “the largest welfare program sponsored in the history of the Republican Party,” in Brooks’ words. Yet he poured on the praise for President Donald Trump’s OMB director and the message he delivered Tuesday night. “Mr. Mulvaney was persuasive,” Brooks said.“He informed us of the White House’s position,” he added, getting cagey about what was actually said.Other members were less enigmatic about the meeting. They said Mulvaney’s message was just that the White House was open to seeing what Republicans could produce, that the administration wouldn’t try to shut down the process, and that Trump didn’t care whose repeal and replace measure ultimately passes ― just that one does.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C), the Freedom Caucus chairman, said Mulvaney let them know that they’re still open to negotiations.“We heard that directly from him,” Meadows added. “This is not something that is in stone.”Meadows insisted that the message had been consistent all day Tuesday. “The White House is willing to negotiate,” he said.Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), who sits on the Ways and Means Committee marking up a portion of the legislation on Wednesday, suggested Mulvaney’s message was for Republicans to just repeal and replace Obamacare.“It wasn’t that prescriptive,” Schweikert said. “It was very clear we need to do the elimination of the current model and move to something else, but the something else? It wasn’t prescriptive.”Of course, that was not the lesson GOP leadership had taken from their meetings with Trump and other administration officials on Tuesday. Chief deputy whip Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) told The Washington Post that the president was paying attention to where Republicans stood on the GOP health care bill.“The president said very clearly . . . this is the bill he wants on his desk, and he wants to get this done quickly,” McHenry reportedly said.No matter what hidden messages conservatives are seeing in the tweets and in their private meetings, Trump could swiftly end the speculation by offering his full-throated support. But that was not what conservatives were hearing Tuesday.“What I have heard from the president, from the vice president, from the director tonight, is that they’re open to negotiation,” Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said. “So I find it a little bit intriguing when I hear our leadership say that they have a bill, a set bill, and the president is fully supportive of the bill. I think he is fully supportive of the process.”Labrador was certain the current Republican bill did not have the requisite 218 votes for a majority in the House ― or slightly less, given vacancies and potential absences ― and he didn’t think Republicans could get over the majority threshold with just small changes to the existing bill.“I don’t think there’s any tinkering that will get us to 218,” Labrador said. “But I think some major reforms to the health care problems that we have right now, an actual repeal and replace of the problems that we have right now, I think we can get there.”Conservatives want leadership to put forward the repeal bill that the House passed in 2015. In fact, the Freedom Caucus has taken an official position ― supposedly binding for their roughly 40 members ― that they will oppose any repeal bill less aggressive than the previous reconciliation language. There are signs that HFC leaders are now willing to negotiate on that position, but they now appear willing to sink the House health care plan if leaders don’t significantly open up the measure for discussion.“You have to be open to negotiating and not just cramming it down our throats,” Labrador said.But between GOP moderates who are concerned a repeal would significantly affect poor people ― the elimination of the Medicaid expansion has become a fault line in the Republican Party ― and conservatives who insist the entire “Obamacare framework” needs to be removed, in the words of Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), there might not exist a coalition of 218 Republicans in the House and 50 Republicans in the Senate.And while Labrador acknowledged that everything had to be on the table in a negotiation between conservatives and GOP leadership, he also expressed his opposition to the Medicaid expansion and the advance refundable tax credits which have become the linchpin to the replacement.Asked what a happy middle ground may be between the conservative healthcare bill and leadership’s, Labrador inadvertently summed up the conservative position on negotiating. “I think our plan,” he answered."
82,POLITICS,Democrats Ask DHS To Drop 'Unconscionable' Idea Of Splitting Up Families At Border,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dhs-separating-families-border_us_58c07fbae4b054a0ea67993c,Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly confirms he is considering the policy change to deter unauthorized immigration.,2017-03-08,Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said he was considering a policy to separate families apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c080972700003300748e7e.jpeg?cache=CVCcNKy6Ux&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democratic lawmakers urged the Trump administration on Wednesday not to take the “appalling,” “unconscionable” step of separating children from their mothers at the U.S.-Mexico border in an attempt to deter them from coming to the country without authorization. In letters to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and during questioning of the nominee to be his deputy, lawmakers asked DHS officials to consider what it would mean both morally and practically to split apart families that come to the border, particularly those seeking asylum. Kelly confirmed on Monday that he is considering such a policy change “in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network” through Central America and Mexico. He framed it as a way to help them: “I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America to getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States,” he said on CNN’s “The Situation Room.” The Congressional Hispanic Caucus objected to that reasoning and the proposed “punitive approach” to children in a letter sent to Kelly.“It is appalling that DHS would try to use family separation as a deterrent aimed at families fleeing violence,” the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to Kelly, adding that the policy would “tarnish” the U.S.’ history of welcoming asylum-seekers and refugees. Three Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee wrote a separate letter asking Kelly to drop the idea.“Trying to ‘discourage’ people fleeing violence and extreme poverty from seeking safety in the U.S. by threatening to take their children away from them is unconscionable. ... We strongly urge you to reject this cruel and misguided policy,” wrote the committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), and Reps. Filemon Vela (D-Texas) and Donald M. Payne Jr. (D-N.J.). “To do otherwise would be a black mark in the history of not just DHS, but of America.”In the Senate, Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) pressed the nominee for DHS deputy secretary, Elaine Duke, to think hard before splitting up families. Harris asked what DHS would do with a baby who was nursing, a toddler who was being potty-trained or a child who “is sick and needs comfort to be able to sleep through the night from his mother.” She asked officials to consider those details and ensure agents in the field were trained to know the answer. Heitkamp asked Duke whether DHS officials thought that poor conditions in Central America were “not our problem and the solution is to take babies away from mothers ― that’s the best solution we have in the United States of America to deal with this crisis?” “I can tell you that for every mother who would be seeing someone seeking asylum in this country, fleeing from rape, murder and potential destruction of her family, it’s not a very humanitarian way to deal with this crisis,” Heitkamp said. “I think that the threat of taking mothers away from children may in fact provide a deterrence, I get that, but it doesn’t solve the problem with our hemisphere.” Large numbers of families and unaccompanied children, many of them seeking asylum, have come to the U.S. from Central America for the past several years. Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 54,100 families from October to the end of January, compared with about 24,600 during the previous fiscal year. Experts have said that splitting children from their parents, particularly after what Kelly noted is often a traumatic journey, is damaging to their wellbeing. The American Academy of Pediatrics put out a statement opposing family separation after reports last week that DHS was considering the policy change. “Proposals to separate children from their families as a tool of law enforcement to deter immigration are harsh and counterproductive,” the academy said. “We urge policymakers to always be mindful that these are vulnerable, scared children.” There’s also the matter of whether it would be legal for DHS to use treatment of families as a means of discouraging others from trying to enter the country. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus’ letter to Kelly notes a federal court ruled that the government could not detain immigrant families solely for purposes of deterrence. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letters. At her confirmation hearing, Duke acknowledged that it would be “a bad visual” to see a Border Patrol agent taking a baby from a mother and stressed that no decisions had been made. But she presented a second reason, beyond just deterrence, why DHS was considering the idea. Duke said separating the families is under consideration “because of threats we’ve heard against children,” although she did not elaborate on those threats. She also said the government must address how dangerous it is to come to the U.S. without authorization."

Don Mahaney, the owner of Scratch Food & Beverage, gave all of his female employees paid time off Wednesday in honor of International Women’s Day and the concurrent “A Day Without A Woman” strike.The business will also use the day to hold an evening fundraiser benefiting Planned Parenthood that will feature a brief bartending appearance by Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto, his office confirmed to The Huffington Post.Mahaney told HuffPost that it was the least he could do to give back to the women who, in his words, “get the short end of the stick from the day they’re born.”“It’s just one day of the year,” he said. “We owe it to them to recognize the basic fact that they get 80 cents to the dollar.” Women are also more likely to be the victims of sex trafficking, he added. “It’s a really unfair world.”He credited his female bar manager, Mandi Crosby, with inspiring him to take charge after she requested the day off so she could attend outside events.“I thought there’s probably a lot of women out there who’d like to take the day off who can’t do so,” he said. “I thought my staff should not have to deal with any of that so if they want the day off they can have it.”Crosby, who Mahaney said is one of seven women among the restaurant’s 11-person staff, applauded his decision.“I think everyone I’ve talked to about it so far thinks it’s a really awesome idea, and super generous of the owner Don to really step forward and say this is how it always should be,” she told local station, WTAE.In the ladies’ absence, Mahaney said that local wellness program, Farm to Table Pittsburgh, will provide male bartenders to cover the women’s shifts, as the fundraiser will take place in the restaurant’s bar area.Those looking to get a drink from Pittsburgh’s mayor will get a chance between 8:15 p.m. and 8:45 p.m., a spokesperson told HuffPost.Mahaney, speaking to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said choosing Planned Parenthood as their event’s beneficiary “just made sense to me.”“They’re a great organization that does a lot to offer general health and reproductive health services and they’re more or less under constant attack,” he told the paper.While Mahaney says most of the public response has been positive, he acknowledged that there have been some critics on social media who accuse them of “reverse sexism” and have asked, “when’s men’s day off?” (International Men’s Day, for the record, is November 19.)“People are entitled to their opinions,” he responded."
