0,POLITICS,The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program Is What's Best About America,"Molly Dillon, ContributorFormer policy advisor, White House Domestic Policy Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/public-service-loan-forgiveness-program_us_592dd76fe4b055a197cde0ed,"Cutting the program signals to our young people, and the world, how we view public service.",2017-05-30,"White House staffers stand on the steps of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on November 10, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592dda9c2100002a006fe7fd.jpeg?ops=crop_0_57_2710_1448%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"For the past four years, on the 28th day of each month, the U.S. Department of Education’s FedLoan Servicing automatically withdraws approximately 10 percent of my monthly income from my bank account. Living in a major city, I’d certainly rather have that extra cash on hand to help pay for rent or groceries or train rides to visit my grandmother a few states away. But when I see that payment deducted, I’m not annoyed or angry. Rather, I’m grateful — grateful that I live in a country that allowed me to take out loans to go to graduate school, pursue my dream of working in civil rights policy, and pay back those loans at a rate that doesn’t devastate my monthly budget. I’m able to do that because I’m paying off my loans under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.That’s why last week, I was extremely disheartened to learn that President Trump’s budget proposal calls for the end of the program that I, and so many hard working Americans, financially depend on in order to stay in public service — starting with loans taken out after July 1, 2018.I’m not a public servant who can afford to forgo my salary, or who never had to take out loans, so it may be hard for President Trump, his children/advisors, and Cabinet to understand my situation. But as a president, and staff to the president, it is their job to understand. I would know — I used to work at the White House.After taking out loans to put myself through graduate school at Georgetown’s School of Public Policy, I was lucky enough to land my dream job working in President Obama’s White House on the Domestic Policy Council. For nearly the entire second term, I helped push for policies that aimed to bend the arc of the moral universe a little more toward justice—from women’s equality to foster care to LGBTQ rights to criminal justice reform. We had the honor to work for the American people, and while we almost never spoke about it, we all knew we worked for far less pay than our peers in the private sector. Public service requires self-sacrifice; it always has. But the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program made it possible for me use my education for a career in public service without the fear of a lifetime of debt.But this loan forgiveness program isn’t just about me and my situation. The program was created to encourage and enable students of all backgrounds to enter public service — whether it is as a policy advisor at the White House or an elementary school teacher or a public defender. For years, borrowers make payments on their loans, and at the end of 120 qualifying payments (working in government or non-profits), their remaining loans are forgiven. At a minimum, it takes 10 years.It should go without saying: the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is far from a liberal government hand-out. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007. To be eligible for debt forgiveness requires years of hard work and sacrifice. Work that is regularly unrecognized and unrewarded and often underpaid. But it is work that ultimately helps people and this program demonstrates the idea that service is not only valued, but necessary for a functioning democracy.The program, like other public goods we as a society pay for, is part of what’s best about America. It represents a commitment to the idea that America recognizes your sacrifice and wants to reward and incentivize it by making it a little less risky to go into debt for your education. It enables talented individuals, who might otherwise only be able to afford to go into the private sector, to dedicate their skills to service. Eliminating it will signal to the rest of the world that America is no longer serious about our meritocratic and egalitarian principles. Even worse, the cancellation of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program will signal a generation of aspiring public servants that a public service path is either not valued or is only available to those born to privilege.Given his track record with education, I shouldn’t be surprised by President Trump’s actions. But that doesn’t mean I still can’t be bitterly disappointed. The budget is now in Congress’s hands. Once again, our fate rests with congressional Republicans. I can only hope they will remember that they are public servants too."

Sweden’s parliament, prompted in part by the 2015 Paris climate agreement, has proposed a fossil-free Sweden initiative under which the nation would become fossil-fuel free by 2045.The city has an even more ambitious goal: eliminate all net carbon emissions by 2040. The biggest challenge that remains for the city on its way to the 2040 net-zero emissions goal is to greatly reduce or eliminate carbon emissions from transportation. To do so, the city will have to depend virtually entirely on renewable fuels and electricity for transport by 2040.Hard-to-Eliminate EmissionsReducing transportation emissions is particularly challenging because the city’s population is growing rapidly and some of the city’s traffic emissions is caused by regional development. In addition, the city cannot control air travel or shipping to Stockholm without new national and international agreements.Nonetheless, the city is currently investigating the possibility of issuing a complete ban on fossil fuel sales in 2040 with interim restrictions put in place by 2030. The city is also looking into the possibility of requiring fossil-fuel-free navigation in the port.Maritime transport accounts for 4 percent of Stockholm’s total emissions and 10 percent of its transport emissions. Ships calling at the Stockholm Royal Seaport currently operate mainly on bunker oil or diesel fuel. The port is working to increase the proportion of ships using dockside electrical connections instead of on-board fossil-fuel-fired generators. In the future, port fees could be structured to provide shipping companies with incentives to use renewable fuels—such as biofuel or bio-oil—or LNG, a fossil fuel with lower emissions than oil or diesel, as well as the port’s electrical connections.In addition to emissions from shipping, Stockholm’s emissions accounting also includes fossil fuels consumed by trains within its borders, as well as aviation kerosene consumed from ground level up to 915 meters above Stockholm Bromma Airport.Plastics made from fossil fuels and mixed with the municipal waste that the city burns in its district heating plants are also hard-to-eliminate. Between now and 2050, the city will strive to increase the share of its plastics made from bio-based (non-fossil-fuel) materials.It will also try to sort more plastic from its waste stream for recycling, but there are limits. Plastic fibers cannot be indefinitely recycled without breaking down. The city therefore assumes that some plastic will still be incinerated in 2050.Necessary ExclusionsIn its emissions accounting, the city does not count the carbon generated in producing food and goods for Stockholmers outside the city’s boundaries, nor the carbon produced by Stockholmers traveling beyond the city limits. CFCs used in refrigerants, as well as short-lived climate pollutants, apart from methane and nitrous oxide, are also ignored.Thus the city recognizes that, even with its best efforts, it may still have some fossil-fuel emissions in 2050—on the order of 0.4 tonnes per person. The city knows that it will therefore have to offset these persistent emissions if it is ever to achieve climate neutrality (net-zero fossil-fuel emissions). Zero fossil-fuel emissions in absolute terms likely will remain elusive and impractical even beyond 2050.In addition, they city relies heavily on biofuels whose combustion emits a significant amount of CO2. The city projects that it will produce 350,000 tonnes of biomass-based emissions in 2050. Biofuel Emissions and OffsetsWhile in theory biofuel emissions can be exactly counterbalanced by the removal of an equal amount of CO2 by photosynthesis during plant growth (if an equal quantity of biofuels has been sustainably replanted), in practice this system rarely, if ever, works perfectly. Biomass is usually grown, harvested, processed, and transported with energy generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. The biofuels’ eventual combustion also produces some additional methane and nitrous oxide, both powerful greenhouse gases.In addition, not enough biomass might be replanted—or a replanted biomass crop might succumb to fire, disease, or drought and thus not sequester enough carbon to offset the emissions it was intended to neutralize. Moreover, should global demand for biofuels exceed demand by 2040, engines reliant on biogas or bioliquids—and residential and commercial users of biogas—might need to revert again to more plentiful natural gas, gasoline, or diesel. (To minimize this risk, however, Stockholm is working to increase the future availability of biofuels.)Because of the many concerns about biofuels, in a world in which global emissions must begin falling by 2020 to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2° C, reliance on biofuels remains problematic.Nonetheless, the net emissions of biofuels used in Stockholm are significantly lower than they would be if an equivalent amount of fossil fuel had been used.One carbon-offset method under study in Stockholm to deal with the city’s residual emission in 2050 is to produce biochar from organic materials and incorporate it into the soil (as an amendment), where it would be stored. The city is currently experimenting with a biochar pilot plant and other carbon-sequestration approaches.Take No PrisonersWhen it comes to eliminating carbon emissions, the city’s approach all along has been a genteel version of “take no prisoners.” Its transit efforts, for example, span the gamut from eco-efficient transport, smart traffic solutions, promotion of cycling and walking, and expansion of rail traffic and trunk bus network. As already mentioned, the city is even considering a citywide ban on fossil-fuel sales after 2050. Conventional cars and trucks will be further discouraged by the establishment of environmental zones in which no fossil-fueled vehicles will be allowed.Stockholm’s efforts, of course, reach far beyond its transit sector to include energy efficiency in buildings as well as in heating and cooling and an effort to maximize the use of renewable energy. That includes wind and solar power, as well as biomass and geothermal energy, along with biogas production. These initiatives will be described in forthcoming articles. To better understand Stockholm’s emission-reduction efforts, I went to see Gustaf Landahl, head of Stockholm’s Environment and Health Administration. Landahl has been responsible for much of Stockholm’s climate work since it began in 1996. The third article of this series, informed by that interview, describes the origins of Stockholm’s climate strategy and its fervent commitment to climate protection.

Addiction desperately needs bold philanthropists who want to leverage the people power of the grassroots.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592debbd2300001b00347de9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Addiction and drug overdoses claim one life every four minutes in America. In the time it takes to order a latte, someone dies—from an illness that is highly treatable. The addiction crisis is the result of social prejudice; criminal justice policies that incarcerate people with addiction instead of giving them treatment; health care policies that make it difficult or impossible to get medical help for substance use disorders; ignorance; and “abstinence-only” drug policies that are ineffective and backwards.The fact is, people who struggle with substance use disorder are treated like second-class citizens. Admitting there’s a problem can mean losing your job, home, and custody of your children. That makes addiction a civil rights issue. And, thanks to the work of advocates across the nation, it’s finally being recognized as a moral issue, as well.Thought leaders like Tom Steyer are helping to drive this message home. I first met Tom during the Democratic National Convention. I had just shared my experience with addiction and recovery when Tom approached me. I was taken aback by the story he shared. He, too, lost someone very dear to him due to addiction: his best friend, who struggled with addiction for decades. His friend contracted HIV and Hepatitis C through drug use, and died of medical complications due to his illnesses.A few months later, Tom joined me at the Facing Addiction in America summit in Los Angeles, where we invited him to share his story on stage with the U.S. Surgeon General. As Tom talked, tears filled my eyes. He said, “We must embrace our shared humanity and recognize that addiction is a deadly, chronic illness, not a personal failing.” I'd lost friends, too. I was at risk, too. It was time to bridge the gap between policies and public awareness.People like Tom Steyer and other pioneering philanthropists, who give tens of millions to progressive causes such as medical research, environmental causes, and water quality, must also step up to end the addiction crisis in America. Our fight is America’s fight. The sooner they do, the quicker we can heal this nation from our generation’s most urgent public health crisis.Working alongside lobbyists, nonprofit groups, social organizers, and peer recovery groups, they can help fill the gaps left by policies and laws that omit or punish people with substance use disorder. As the current administration takes steps toward a health care bill that will leave people suffering from addiction without medical care, these philanthropic giants are in a unique position to help. Why? Because their involvement would not be tied to political party or personal gain. Rather, they would focus on the solution, plain and simple.Addiction should be one of the issues on the list of social problems we urgently address, next to finding a cure for cancer and ending childhood hunger. Addiction permeates the social fabric of America. Nobody is exempt. As many people suffer from addiction as diabetes; more people use pain medications than tobacco products. For every person who’s developed full blown substance use disorder, another dozen are on the road to addiction. Substance use disorder affects every corner of society, including our collective health, family unity, the economy, workplace productivity, and our reliance on social programs. It also keeps jails full of people who may struggle to find jobs to support their families once they’re released, and will never be able to vote again.The recovery advocacy movement has been built slowly, through the efforts of individuals and highly fragmented groups. We have an incredible grassroots movement that addresses an issue that directly impacts one in every three families in America, and indirectly touches all of us. But fundraising for recovery advocacy has been largely through family and friend donations—which, although heartfelt, aren’t sufficient to fund serious research, create desperately needed social infrastructure, or provide education about the true nature of addiction. While organizations dedicated to battling cancer, heart disease, and diabetes raise hundreds of millions of dollars annually, the “addiction field,” such as it is, raises perhaps $25 million from private sources. This is unconscionable.Gates, Geffen, Buffett, Steyer, and other philanthropic giants have the potential to be visionaries in this space. They could quickly stem the addiction epidemic without waiting for policy makers to hammer out yet another law that places people’s recovery at risk. They could find the solution that keeps families intact. With their help, nobody will lose another friend to this disease or the health problems that come with it. Bob and Suzanne Wright demonstrated the power and possibility of this kind of giving when they funded Autism Speaks. Their philanthropy helped move autism front and center: why not do the same for addiction?What will our society, our culture, be like when we finally take addiction out of the equation? For many people, and their families, the answer is coming much too slowly.It’s time to apply our knowledge, build a coalition, and offer the solutions our country so desperately needs. It’s time to change the framework of this crisis and confront our deepest values. Instead of punishment, we need to help the people who are sick—dying from this illness. It’s time to work together and end America’s addiction crisis for good.What we need now is for America’s philanthropic visionaries to step up to help us dramatically accelerate the pace of progress in this urgent effort. Addiction doesn’t need someone to put their name on a building, or name a research institute. Addiction desperately needs bold philanthropists who want to leverage the people power of the grassroots.Ryan Hampton is an outreach lead and recovery advocate at Facing Addiction, a leading nonprofit dedicated to ending the addiction crisis in the United States."
4,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: More Fish With More Pasta – Rigatoni With Monkfish,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-more-fish-with-more-pasta-rigatoni_us_592be203e4b0a7b7b469cbf5,"When Jackie and I see a particularly beautiful piece of fish in the market, it’s hard to resist pointing to it and saying",2017-05-30,<p>Aromatics cooking in oil - and flavoring it</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592be2262000001b0016f58b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Jackie and I see a particularly beautiful piece of fish in the market, it’s hard to resist pointing to it and saying, “Give us that one” – even when it’s too big for two. That’s what the freezer is for, and not long before we left for a trip (we’re now in London, eating well and enjoying excellent theater, music and art) it yielded up a nearly 7-ounce (200 g) fillet of monkfish. The thicker part of it we’d eaten a week or two earlier, and this remnant was from the narrow tail end.Since our recent good experiences with rigatoni and salt cod, I’d been looking forward to another fish pasta dish, and the monkfish was ideal for that purpose. Why so? Because its compact flesh, even when cut into cubes, keeps its shape when cooked. (So does swordfish, which would be another option for this dish.)Also in cold storage (this time in the fridge, not the freezer) was a container of simple tomato sauce (how I make it is described in another posting), and since I was thinking in southern Italian terms I opted for a dish that would use red-sauce flavors, but judiciously.Think of pasta alla puttanesca, but then think of how its ultra-aggressive flavors could overwhelm just about any fish. What I wanted was a milder, slightly simpler variant in which the fish could be simmered without getting swamped. First, I jettisoned the olives (one ingredient too many), then cut down on the dosage of other classic puttanesca ingredients, but not so much that their contribution was lost.A while in advance, using a pan big enough to eventually hold the pasta, I cooked a whole peeled clove of garlic and a good sprinkle of chili flakes (the Calabrian ones are great here, but Aleppo or other chilies would be no less delicious) in about 2 Tablespoons of olive oil. Over medium-low heat, I let it go until the garlic and chili aromas were wafting around the kitchen; it would be fine to let the garlic turn pale gold, but don’t brown it or burn the chili flakes. At this point a teaspoonful of rinsed, towel-dried, roughly chopped capers went in and cooked for half a minute. Now I added one oil-packed anchovy – yes, just one – and broke it up with my spoon; it soon liquefied in the hot oil.To this I added 1/3 cup (80 ml) white wine and boiled it down for a couple of minutes before adding 2/3 cup (160 ml) tomato sauce and simmering gently for, say, five minutes; if it gets too thick, don’t worry: pasta-cooking water will adjust the consistency before dinner’s on the table. Check for seasoning; if it needs salt, it’ll need only a little, and I’d be disinclined to use pepper in this dish, though you might feel that’s a trifle puritanical of me. Fish out the garlic clove and discard it (or spread it on a crust of bread for a snack).This sauce stay as it is, off the heat, until the pasta is boiling. I used rigatoni; other short tubular pasta shapes would work too. Long pasta (bucatini or thick spaghetti) would not be incongruous but would be harder to eat with the chunks of fish that will soon make their appearance. Don’t overdo the pasta portion: there’s plenty of fish and sauce.Yes, the fish: Cut it into chunks approximating half-inch (generous centimeter) cubes and salt it lightly. A couple of minutes after the pasta goes into the boiling water stir the fish into the sauce, which you will have reheated. It will need four or five minutes of simmering, depending on the size of your chunks (taste a piece after four minutes). At this point you may need to dip into the pasta pot and thin the sauce with water.As usual, when the pasta is very nearly done, drain it not too thoroughly, fold it into the sauce, and stir gently (so as not to damage the fish) over low heat until the pasta is as you like it. Adjust the consistency with pasta-boiling water and finish with chopped parsley and a drizzle of your best olive oil.I figured that this would be delicious, and it was. But it was also more elegant than it reads; it would work well in half (or even quarter) portions for a dinner party first course, and the fact that the sauce base can be made in advance makes this practicable. On the other hand, it does not cloy when served as a one-dish dinner – which is how Jackie and I ate it."

Elimination was defined as less than one case per ten thousand population in one country. However, in 1999, over ten countries had not yet reached this goal. Even with the free distribution of multidrug therapy (MDT), it did not seem possible to achieve it by the year 2000. It was then that the Global Alliance for the Elimination of Leprosy was formed to cooperate in achieving this target, bringing together WHO, International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP), and governments of endemic countries. In 2001, the first meeting of the Global Alliance for Elimination of Leprosy (GAEL) was held in Delhi, India. It became apparent, however, there were different views among stakeholders regarding what needed to be accomplished. As a way of breaking through this stalemate, the Regional Office for the Americas of the WHO proposed that I serve as WHO Special Ambassador to the Global Alliance for Elimination of Leprosy, and this was officially approved. In my role as special ambassador, I worked to secure a firm commitment from the political leaders of endemic countries and bring together various stakeholders. As I saw it, these were major responsibilities that entailed both leadership and mediation.The Global Alliance met for the last time in 2003, and after that, WHO appointed me as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. As WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, I have focused on three main tasks that I find make a difference. First, I meet and talk directly with the political leaders of endemic countries. I am sometimes surprised to meet leaders and even public health officials who are not aware that leprosy exists in their country or know very little about it. Or if they are aware of it, they have never visited patients and witnessed the situation with their own eyes. For example, during a visit to an endemic country in Africa, the president there told me that although he had seen many people affected by leprosy when he was young, the disease no longer existed in his country.

Elimination was defined as less than one case per ten thousand population in one country. However, in 1999, over ten countries had not yet reached this goal. Even with the free distribution of multidrug therapy (MDT), it did not seem possible to achieve it by the year 2000. It was then that the Global Alliance for the Elimination of Leprosy was formed to cooperate in achieving this target, bringing together WHO, International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations (ILEP), and governments of endemic countries. In 2001, the first meeting of the Global Alliance for Elimination of Leprosy (GAEL) was held in Delhi, India. It became apparent, however, there were different views among stakeholders regarding what needed to be accomplished. As a way of breaking through this stalemate, the Regional Office for the Americas of the WHO proposed that I serve as WHO Special Ambassador to the Global Alliance for Elimination of Leprosy, and this was officially approved. In my role as special ambassador, I worked to secure a firm commitment from the political leaders of endemic countries and bring together various stakeholders. As I saw it, these were major responsibilities that entailed both leadership and mediation.The Global Alliance met for the last time in 2003, and after that, WHO appointed me as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. As WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination, I have focused on three main tasks that I find make a difference. First, I meet and talk directly with the political leaders of endemic countries. I am sometimes surprised to meet leaders and even public health officials who are not aware that leprosy exists in their country or know very little about it. Or if they are aware of it, they have never visited patients and witnessed the situation with their own eyes. For example, during a visit to an endemic country in Africa, the president there told me that although he had seen many people affected by leprosy when he was young, the disease no longer existed in his country. In fact, a leprosarium was located only 45 minutes from his official residence by car. In such cases, I sometimes invite local leaders to visit a leprosarium or colony with me, update them on the real conditions, and encourage them to take a more active role in the campaign against leprosy in their country. Second, I focus on promoting correct knowledge and understanding of leprosy through the media, including the press, radio, and television.

Re-employment in Accumulation Societies.The photographs by Pascal Garret, sociologist and freelance photographer, who collaborates with social scientists on the theme of waste recovery and recycling.Casablanca, Morocco, summer 2016. With constant heat often above 30°C, garbage can quickly suffocate the four millions inhabitants of this city. But as visitors navigate through the second-largest city of the Maghrebian region, small hands are making sure that large quantities of waste do not pile up on landfills by offering them new life.These men and women belong to populations that anthropologist Delphine Corteel and sociologist Stéphane Le Lay (ERES, 2011) have called “waste workers”.Despite their tremendous and tiring work, they remain excluded from the Moroccan society because of the uncleanliness of their work, and the nature of their living spaces.They live on the margins of legal urban areas, in slums and makeshift houses, which are regularly demolished or threatened by real estate and urban projects. While working in the streets, they are often victims of violence either committed by the authorities or other inhabitants.We conducted interviews with many members of this community from 2011. Our objective was to show that these waste collectors, sorters, semi-wholesalers, recyclers and transporters often consider their work as a real profession and believe that their role is essential, especially given that environmental issues have never been higher on the agenda.According to our multi-site surveys, more than a third of Casablanca’s household waste would escape rejection from landfills.Far from presenting an image of misery and exclusion, we wish to portray this population free from the stigma that usually accompanies activities linked to waste.Overview of one part of a waste recycling area in Casablanca, Lahraouine. In the background, you can see the social housing district of Attacharouk. (Photo Pascal Garret/MuCEM, January 2015)Situated on the outskirts of Casablanca and in a topographic depression, the Lahraouine district remains virtually invisible from the outside. Most workers live in neighbouring douars (slums) where running water is absent and electricity is supplied by generators or illegal connections.Several real estate projects have put pressure on the city to revamp the district and get rid of its slums. As the waste collectors do not owner their lands and there’s no rehousing project, they live in fear of eviction.A bouar returning from his tour in the outskirts of Casablanca. (Photo Pascal Garret, May 2016)This bouar (the word is derived from the French word éboueur for garbage man) returns from the city with a cart filled with his daily collection. But the increasing number of containers buried in the affluent neighbourhoods of Casablanca reduces access to this waste resource.More often than not, the bouara (plural for bouar) have to limit their work to open bins in working-class neighbourhoods. They are also more tolerated in these areas than in the city’s central districts or middle-upper class areas. In the latter, police can harass them, even arrest them and confiscate their donkeys and carts.Inside view of a gelssa of Lahraouine. (Photo Pascal Garret, April 2017)The gelssas (a term derived from the verb gels, which means sit down in darija, the language of the Maghreb region) are enclosures of various sizes surrounded by palisades (metal sheets, tarps, boards or dried waste that form a kind of wall) where the bouara centralise their harvest after each city tour.Their collection is sold by weight and consists mainly of cardboard, plastics, metals, glass, fabrics and vegetable waste. Valuable objects, after changing hands several times, will eventually end up in one of the city’s flea markets (joutiya). Nothing that can be used is left behind.A worker sorting waste in a gelssa specialised on plastic materials. (Photo Pascal Garret, May 2016)The bouara of Casablanca can make about €20 daily, but many must rent their equipment (cart and animal) from their bosses for €2.Some gelssas are versatile sorting and recycling sites (plastics, wood, metal, rags), where materials are sorted by type. Others specialise in a particular material, as is the case below for plastic.There is no electricity in the gelssas and this machine is powered by a generator. (Photo Pascal Garret, April 2017)After collection and sorting, some materials have to be compacted and crushed to take up less space, which adds value. The materials will then be sold to informal sector wholesalers or to the formal sector through pick-ups or trucks sent to carry the waste.Women sorting plastic waste. (Photo Pascal Garret, May 2016)In Lahraouine, we have not seen many women in the gelssas. Among the 3,000 active waste-recyclers we roughly counted, the majority are young men and we estimated that there were only 500 to 600 women. They are only assigned to sorting tasks.The economic crisis in Morocco has led to an increase of waste workers in Casablanca.The sheds of waste collectors are themselves made with waste. (Photo Pascal Garret, January 2015)Waste collectors come, for the most part, from the countryside to escape poverty. Some of them originate from very remote villages in the eastern regions of Casablanca.Many, especially youngsters, come and go according to agricultural cycles. Nearly 19% of Morocco’s agriculturally dependent rural population still lives in poverty or in danger of becoming impoverished. These seasonal workers are hosted by relatives in the douars of Lahraouine or live in sheds inside gelssas.The boss of a gelssa posing with his horse. (Photo Pascal Garret, January 2015)This boss of a gelssa employs several waste collectors. He owns a few carts pulled by a donkey or a horse, and is a “middle-income earner”.There is a very strong hierarchy in the world of recycling. At the lower level are the simple bouara and women who sort and earn low incomes. At the end of the higher range are the bosses of large gelssas who own one or more trucks and plastic crushers.Gelssas bosses are very familiar with the cost and value of materials on the market and keep themselves updated through the internet or their mobile phones. They know exactly where, to whom and when to sell to get the maximum benefit from their wares.A waste collector at work in the Mediouna dump. (Photo Pascal Garret/MuCEM, January 2015)Situated about 20 kilometres south of Greater Casablanca, the Mediouna’s landfill receives nearly 3,500 tons of household waste each day, brought in by the trucks of waste-recycling companies.At this site, which should normally mark the end of life for Casablanca’s waste, some 600 illegal waste collectors extract about 1000 tons of materials daily that will be re-injected into the informal and formal recycling circuit.The business of recycling factories and export wholesalers depends heavily on the activities of street collectors or the Mediouna landfill from whom they buy recovered materials at a lower cost. Secondary raw materials produced by the formal sector of the economy are largely derived from the work of these hidden workers.Blurring the borders, this small world of informal workers is thus – directly or indirectly – well inserted in the economic chain on every level: local, regional, national and even international. The PET brought in by waste collectors, for example, is exported to China.Many of them have also fully understood and integrated environmental arguments. One, called Mustapha, told us in an interview in 2013:We contribute to the economy of Morocco. It is thanks to us that this waste is recycled instead of being simply buried or burned. This is our livelihood, it’s our survival and it makes our community liveThis wholesaler even tried to create an association for the waste collectors of the Lahraouine district in order to get them officially acknowledged and organised. But so far he has faced indifference or opposition from the authorities.His failure highlights the perpetual stigma attached to the profession of waste collecting. It also shows their isolation and relegation to the spatial and social margins of the economic capital of Morocco.Yet, elsewhere in the world, innovative experiments, mobilisation of reclaiming communities and associations are signs that integration, access to social rights and, more broadly, recognition or informal waste collectors are possible.Bénédicte Florin and Pascal Garret also collaborated for the Vies d’ordures, waste economics exhibition at the Museum of Civilisation of Europe and the Mediterranean (MuCEM, Marseille), March 22 to August 14 2017.Bénédicte Florin, Maître de conférences, Université François-Rabelais de Tours and Mustapha Azaitraoui, Enseignant-chercheur en géographie humaine, Université Hassan IerThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

He is my boss and he is my elder,” Conway, 50, said of the 70-year-old president. “That has actually allowed me, in my view, to respectfully but forcefully express my opinion on certain matters.”Conway presents an unusual figure in the White House. She can appear to be coquettish and sometimes wears eye-popping colors strikingly different from the typically more conservative fashion found among D.C. political operatives. She was called out earlier this year on Twitter when she curled her legs beneath her on a couch in the Oval Office after snapping photos of heads of historically black colleges and universities who were visiting the president.She considers herself “post-feminist, anti-feminist and non-feminist,” she said in the interview, because she believes feminists are “anti-male.”She’s not big on the concept of sexism, except when the media calls her out, which she considers sexist. She recently blasted Anderson Cooper as sexist for an eye roll while he was interviewing her. It occurred as a testy Conway confusingly attempted to explain Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey.Sexism has not been a problem for Hillary Clinton, however, Conway insists. “Let me tell you,” she said in a Fox interview, “Hillary Clinton is in search of sexism as a lame excuse for why her disastrous candidacy and campaign lost six months ago.”There are only a smattering of women in a White House overwhelmingly dominated by white men. Only four of 24 Cabinet and Cabinet-level posts are filled by women, while more than 50 percent of the U.S. population is female.“Attaching a hard and fast number to it is not as relevant as the contributions that are made by the woman who are at the table,” Conway insisted to Business Insider.“We’re heard and we’re seen and we’re listened to and we are sought out and sought after for our opinions and our judgment and our ideas and our insight.”Trump told The New York Times in an interview last year that his then-campaign press secretary Hope Hicks gave him advice “in a very low-key manner so it doesn’t necessarily come in the form of advice. It’s delivered very nicely.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post said Conway snapped photos while historically black governors visited with the president. The visitors were heads of historically black colleges and universities."

The yellow-eyed penguin is in great peril on the peninsula ― and on the New Zealand mainland as a whole, researchers found. Climate change and other effects of human activity could drive the species extinct locally in just 40 years.The population of yellow-eyed penguins on the Otago Peninsula has been falling precipitously over the past two decades. “We used to have about 600 to 800 breeding pairs in the mid-1990s, but we’re now down to 200 to 250 breeding pairs,” Mattern said. “That’s a loss of 75 percent.”Rising ocean temperatures have been a major cause of this decline, according to the new paper, published in the journal Peer J earlier this month. Warming has reduced the amount of food available to the penguins, which feed off the ocean floor. But climate change hasn’t been the only culprit. By studying penguin population records dating back several decades, and using prediction models developed to estimate the effects of global warming and other threats to the species, Mattern and his colleagues found that while one-third of the population change was due to rising temperatures, the remaining two-thirds was linked to other human activities. Data on these other threats is currently limited, but researchers believe the fishing industry may play a significant role. Gill nets used by fishermen are known to ensnare yellow-eyed penguins, which get entangled in the near-invisible nets and drown. A 2000 study that looked at autopsy data of 185 yellow-eyed penguins that died around South Island found that more than 70 deaths were linked to gill net entanglement. The pollution of waterways from urban centers and also from farms in the area may also be a significant driver of penguin deaths. “There’s some really bad stuff being flushed out of the sewer system into our rivers and seas,” Mattern said. Considered an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the yellow-eyed penguin is one of the rarest penguins on the planet. Endemic to New Zealand, the bird is found in three distinct clusters. About 40 percent live on the New Zealand mainland ― mostly on the Otago Peninsula and also further south on Stewart Island and Codfish Island. (New Zealand is a country made up of about 600 islands. The “mainland” is usually defined as the archipelago made up of the North Island and South Island, and the smaller islands located nearby). The rest of the yellow-penguin population lives on the remote subantarctic Campbell Island Group and Auckland Islands, which have no permanent human inhabitants. Of the three clusters, the yellow-eyed penguins on the mainland are under the greatest threat of extinction, Mattern said. “If you look at the penguin species around the world, the ones really under threat are the ones that live and breed close to human settlements. The closer they are to humans, the greater they are in peril.”The new study focuses specifically on the penguins on the Otago Peninsula, but Mattern said the populations on Stewart Island and Codfish Island are in as much or more danger“They’re probably even worse off,” he said. The risk of climate change is the same and by-catch is as much of a problem, but the area is also home to a multimillion-dollar oyster fishery, which Mattern said has destroyed most of the penguins’ habitat.“Penguin numbers on Stewart Island have declined since the mid-1990s. On nearby Codfish Island, penguin numbers have been in freefall for a few years now,” he said. “We are looking at a likely extinction of the [entire] mainland cluster by 2060.”Mattern said people may point to the two subantarctic clusters as a reason to not worry about the yellow-eyed penguin on the mainland. “If the penguins disappear here, they can just say, well, we still have them on the subantarctic islands.” But Mattern stressed that the loss would still be deeply felt. The three clusters are entirely distinct from each other, he said, and “if we give them long enough, they would evolve into three different species.” If one of the clusters is lost, it will be “gone for good,” Mattern said. “There can’t be any hope that it will be recolonized.”The disappearance of yellow-eyed penguins from the mainland could be a significant blow to the New Zealand economy. “I hate to talk of wild animals in terms of monetary value,” said Mattern, but losses could rack up to hundreds of millions of dollars.More critically though, the vanishing penguins would be a harbinger of deeply troubling ecological changes. “Penguins are canaries in the coal mine when it comes to ocean health,” Mattern said. “They are at the top of the food chain so they are usually the last one to leave the room and switch off the light. If they’re gone, then we know that the entire marine ecosystem is off-kilter. We should see them as a warning sign of a dying ocean.”Fortunately, Mattern said, there is still hope for the yellow-eyed penguin and the habitat to which it belongs. “All is not yet lost,” he said. “We haven’t reached the critical threshold.”He said he hopes the new research will spur prompt action to save the species on the mainland. The penguin populations can still recover if swift and effective conservation measures are implemented. Gill net bans or other methods to mitigate by-catch could be introduced. Marine reserves could be established to protect seafloor habitat, and actions could be taken to reduce pollution from agricultural practices and runoff from urban areas. “We need to get organized,” Mattern said. The yellow-eyed penguins are depending on it. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592c34131600002200ddd4e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Olympic freeskier Gus Kenworthy and singer-actress Hayley Kiyoko are just two of the celebrities who are “celebrating themselves” by stripping down for an inclusive Pride month effort.Online underwear retailer MeUndies unveiled their new rainbow polka dot designs May 23 with a colorful spread featuring Kenworthy and Kiyoko for its “Celebrate Yourself” campaign. But the photo series ― which also features musician Big Freedia and YouTube personalities B. Scott, Stevie Boebi and Ally Hills ― isn’t just an excuse to spot the stars in their skivvies. For every pair of underwear sold, MeUndies will donate $1 to the Los Angeles LGBT Center to help expand its youth center. Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Chief Marketing Officer Jim Key told HuffPost that underwear was “a very appropriate choice” for their new campaign, which was launched to coincide with Pride month in June. “We lift, support and comfort people of all types and ages,” he quipped, noting that much like MeUndies’ polka dot designs, “we’re bold and courageous.”Given the current political climate, Key said, funding for homeless LGBTQ youth services is more at risk than ever, which is one of the many reasons he’s grateful for the MeUndies campaign. It’s a particularly pertinent issue in Los Angeles, where about 40 percent of the homeless youth population in the city identify as LGBTQ, he said. Kiyoko, who made waves in 2015 with her “queer girl love” anthem, “Girls Like Girls,” said the campaign really spoke to her as an artist who has never shied away from exploring sexuality in her work. “In the artist community, we do have a responsibility to use our platform to spread messages of hope and acceptance,” she said. “Whether or not someone decides to do that is their choice, but I’ve always used my art as a way to bring people together ― if you could call that political.”Kenworthy echoed those sentiments. For him, the campaign wasn’t so much of a political gesture as it was one more way for him to express “that I am proud of who I am.” “It’s about trying to just embrace the things that make me different and the things that make me unique, and not allow myself to be dictated by other people’s expectations,” the Olympian, who came out as gay in a 2015 ESPN Magazine cover story, told HuffPost. The best ways to “celebrate yourself,” he explained, weren’t necessarily grand gestures. “I think on the most stripped back, grassroots level, the way that I celebrate myself is just being proud of who I am walking down the street holding my boyfriend’s hand, living my life unapologetically.”Check out more photos from the MeUndies “Celebrate Yourself” campaign for the Los Angeles LGBT Center below.

He probably just learned how much he is being paid.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592c002d1600002500ddd4a5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The average hourly pay for food service workers and cashiers in the United States at McDonald’s is $8.50. At Starbucks, employees earn an average of $9.43 an hour, but shift supervisors can make over $12 an hour. Full-time associates at Walmart are paid $13.38 an hour. Customer service associates earn $13.54 an hour at Costco and as much as $13.78 an hour at Home Depot. However, in many school district in the United States, substitute teachers, in charge of helping to educate our children, are paid less than $13 an hour and have barely any qualifications. This is part of the trend to outsource and privatize what goes on in our schools, something being promoted by the Trump/DeVos education regime, and something that in no way counts as “education.”A major player in the fast-food teacher industry is Kelly Educational Staffing. In Florida, it is active in Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa-Saint Petersburg. It also provides substitute teachers in Massachusetts,According to the Kelly website, requirements to be a Kelly substitute are minimal: an associate’s degree or 60 college credits, the ability to read and write in English, “passing” criminal background checks and a drug test, “completion of an informational session on substitute teaching to be conducted on the day of your interview,” “successful completion of a behavioral interview and a mandatory orientation conducted by Kelly Educational Staffing,” and the willingness to work for next to nothing without any benefits. The online training program takes two hours and includes a quiz.People with these “qualifications” are then expected to provide “instruction,” encourage “student progress,” and manage the “learning environment.” That means the “implementation” of “existing lesson plans in a manner that ensures the integrity of academic time, and motivates students to learn and participate” and instructing “students regarding a variety of classroom topics/courses of instruction, as determined by the School District’s lesson plan and in accordance with Kelly Services policy.”In some school districts, including Washington D.C., there is a high mid-year turnover of teachers in poorly performing inner-city minority schools. At one DC high school 25 percent of the teaching staff now consists of unprepared low paid substitute teachers. An 11th grade Algebra student explained the impact to the Washington Post. Since his regular teacher left in January, “No one is teaching. It’s been like that for months now. We don’t do anything, so I leave and go to my biology class or English class and go do other work.”If the Trump/DeVos education budget or some semblance of it passes Congress, the future for public education in the United States and the teaching profession look dim. The proposed budget calls for a $9.2 billion, or 13.5 percent, spending cut to education. Title I funding to high-poverty schools would not be adjusted to take into account rising costs. Money for teacher training, class-size reduction (which promotes literacy), and for after-school programs would be reduced or eliminated. Medicaid funds that help school districts assist students with special needs would be cut. Other federal funds will be diverted from public schools to charters, private, and religious schools. The federal government would stop subsidizing interest on student loans and phase out public service loan forgiveness so fewer people could afford to become teachers. You can sign a petition opposing this cuts at this link.If the Trump/DeVos education budget is approved look for a lot more fast-food teachers in the future.Question: Would Trump accept teachers with these “qualifications” at the fancy private schools attended by his son and grandchild?Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8"

She lives with her husband, daughter, and son on an acre of land in rural Ohio, where they keep bees, garden, and brew beer.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592c17af200000190016f5c8.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jami IngledueThe first time I encountered Ben, he came up to me and my 4th grade daughter as we were walking out of the school. “Did you know (insert some random math fact that made no sense to me at all.)”I looked at him blankly. Who was this kid? Why was he spouting math at me?My daughter has always been way ahead of me in this area. “Hi Ben,” she said with her usual kindness. “How are you?” Ben said hi back and skipped off.“That was odd,” I said to my daughter.“That’s just Ben,” she said.Now, I would be able to spot it: Ben was clearly on the autism spectrum. But I was ignorant at the time. And I’m ashamed to admit that my first instinct was to recoil.But then that same kind and cheerful daughter became a teenager with debilitating depression and anxiety. She was also struggling with hitherto undiagnosed ADHD and executive function impairment. And I entered a whole new world, one that I had not been aware of or sensitive to before. Only now do I understand how unkind and intolerant I had in fact been.Now, I am not an unkind or intolerant person. So why did I react that way?First of all, I was ignorant. There is no way around that fact. I didn’t understand autism and I didn’t realize how common it is. And I’m also a sometimes-socially-awkward introvert who needs a little time to process things. So the natural human inclination in that situation is, I think, to avoid being uncomfortable, to avoid being in situations where we have no idea what to say. So I said nothing.And I think due to my ignorance on the issue I also had this vague sense, which was never conscious or articulated, that kids like this would behave differently if only their parents handled them differently. If only they were more disciplined and didn’t let them have their way, then they wouldn’t throw those fits. We saw this same attitude recently when a Fox News contributor mocked a 10-year-old autistic boy by calling him a “snowflake” who needed a “safe space.” When used in this way, Snowflake (the insult de jour), means a hypersensitive, easily offended person, someone who has been convinced they are unique by over-indulgent parents, but who melts under the pressures of everyday life.Repeat after me: AUTISTIC KIDS ARE NOT “SNOWFLAKES.” Neither are kids with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Or Depression, or ADHD, or OCD.If you could see how much these kids work and struggle every single day, EVERY DAY, just to navigate their way through this world—and how hard their parents work to make this happen—they would be your heroes, as they are now mine.Let me say that I absolutely understand the frustration people feel with the way we tend to coddle our kids today, to pander to their whims, to be helicopter parents. I am the opposite of a helicopter parent, and I think kids need independence and the ability to fall down, to fail at things, in order to learn and grow.But here’s the thing—if you allow YOUR child to ostracize autistic kids, to reject them because they’re different, to make fun of them—then maybe YOU are the one pandering to your kids. If our child rejects a kid or a teacher because of their skin color, most parents (at least those who are kind and tolerant) would not allow that. They would teach their child that this was wrong, that we are all the same on the inside, that we should make an effort to be inclusive.But when it comes to rejecting autistic kids? Anxious kids? ADHD kids? According to Michelle, parent of two autistic kids: “If I gave examples of rejection, the parent might think, ‘Oh, I’d never do that.’ But they effing do. 99 percent of the time. And if their own kids recoil from mine, they NEVER step in and model appropriate behavior. They support their kid in rejecting mine.” This happens regularly every day at school, but autistic kids also get left out of birthday parties, playdates, etc.Honestly, this could have been me. Not because I actually consciously supported my kid in their rejection. But because I just wouldn’t know what to say or do. And because I was ignorant and unknowingly prejudiced.Yes, parents, we ARE prejudiced against autistic kids. We aren’t necessarily conscious of it, but that’s how prejudice works. It influences our reactions before we even realize it. And the only way to overcome this is to drag it into the light of day, to examine it for what it is. In other words (in many cases), to mess up, and then see that we were wrong.And now, after years of seeing my daughter work SO hard to overcome her depression, her anxiety, her ADHD, all of these debilitating conditions that she was unfairly saddled with in life—boy, I see how wrong I was. Do I ever. When just getting out of bed, when making it through a school day, is an epic battle—that is courage. That is resilience. That is the opposite of “snowflake.”But my daughter has taught me in another way as well. As I said, she’s always been way ahead of me in this area. Perhaps because of her own struggles, she has always been extremely empathetic and kind, especially to kids who are obviously different or ostracized. She was way ahead of me all the way back in fourth grade when she was kind to Ben and I unconsciously recoiled. And she continued to be this way even while in the depths of her own struggles.In the middle of her worst year of high school, she took it upon herself to take an autistic kid under her wing. He rode the same bus that she did, the bus where she was the undisputed Queen, because that’s just how she rolls. He was a difficult kid to get along with and would sometimes lash out and say inappropriate things. Nevertheless, she sat with him when no one else would. She yelled at kids who made fun of him and threatened to beat the crap out of them if they messed with him. She saved up her own money to buy him a birthday present. I have never been more proud of her.So now I’m trying to catch up. Parents, we need to catch up. According to the Autism Society, 1 in 45 kids is diagnosed with autism. Its prevalence has increased 119 percent since 2000. Other behavioral health conditions such as ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, and OCD are all on the rise. These children belong to all of us, and we need to act like it, even when it’s uncomfortable and we don’t know what to say. Strike up a conversation with the mom. Invite the kid to birthday parties and events, even when it means making a few accommodations. It will mean the world to that kid and his parents. Set the example for your kids of being inclusive and kind and generous.So now, when my first thought is “man, that kid is acting rude,” or weird, or spoiled, or emotional, or fill-in-the-blank—I have a second thought that quickly follows. Could this kid be on the spectrum? Could they be anxious? Could they have some emotional or developmental need that is not being met? And most importantly, how can I help?Because we are the moms. That’s what we do: we help, we nurture, we support all kids. So if you still find yourself thinking these kids are “snowflakes”—first of all, please educate yourself on autism, but more importantly, listen to your mom heart. Access the parent in you, and treat them as if they were your child. This is how change happens, one act of kindness at a time. Remember, your kids are watching.Previously published as ‘Autistic Kids Are the Opposite of “Snowflakes”’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comThis is Part 3 of a three-part series.

16,QUEER VOICES,The Ex-Gay Movement Provided A “Safe Space” For Hating Myself,"Peterson Toscano, ContributorA Quirky Queer Quaker playfully exploring the serious worlds o...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-ex-gay-movement-provided-a-safe-space-for-hating_us_592c2debe4b0a7b7b469cc24,I lived in that stew of hate and fear for nearly 20 years.,2017-05-29,"<p>Bearing witness outside Love Won Out Conference, Memphis, TN 2008</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592c39b91600002500ddd4f7.jpg?ops=crop_2_2_358_358%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"A few years ago the Southern Poverty Law Center asked me if I would consider the Ex-Gay group Exodus International, a Hate Group. This conversion therapy umbrella organization dismantled itself four years ago, but during its heyday in the late Ninties and early Noughties, it not only proclaimed that change was possible for people gays or lesbians, it spoke out against hate crime legislation and equal rights for LGBTQ people. They did hateful things, but were they a hate group like the KKK and other white supremacist groups? During the 17 years I received and endured conversion therapies, heterosexuality was preached as God’s ideal for all creation. Anything other than heterosexual partnerships, (within the context of marriage of course,) were considered inferior, immoral, and potentially dangerous, not only for the individual but to society at large. Most of the places where I received conversion therapy, the leaders used God and the Bible to uphold their 1950’s white suburban middle class family values. They expected everyone to adhere to strict gender guidelines. Therefore, much of the teachings we received were designed to transform us into “real” men and women. Technically most conversion therapists and ex-gay ministers do not believe there are any other people in the world beside gender normative heterosexuals. Transgender, bisexual, lesbian, gay, and gender non-conforming people are simply “normal” straight folks who are misbehaving and need to repent.At large Love Won Out gatherings organized by Focus on the Family and Exodus International, success stories were trotted out on stage, replete with family photos displayed on big screens. For parents with an LGBTQ child, the message was crystal clear—Fear not, like these fine folks, your child can be saved from homosexuality! Of course many of the successful ex-gays on those stages have since come to their senses and are now out of the closet pursuing new lives as LGBTQ people. Some have even gone so far as to renounce their part in the Ex-Gay Movement. They have issued public apologies, and denounced the treatments they provided and promoted as dangerous.Heterosexuality was prized and preached in the programs I attended. Many of these conversion therapy providers are not only anti-LGBTQ, they are also Straight Supremacists. They hold up heterosexuality as the ultimate goal and God’s best for our lives. Most of the people who have run these programs have been ex-gay themselves. Straight people also have played a part. At the Love in Action residency program I attended in Memphis, TN, a handful of heterosexuals served on staff along side the former gays and lesbians. These heterosexual men and women who never “struggled with same-sex attraction” were referred to as Ever Straights. They were the models we were told to follow.No doubt I experienced harm at the hands of conversion therapists. They have and still do stir up trouble in people’s lives and families. They cause harm in churches, counseling sessions, and in society. Still it is not so simple to call them Hate Groups. Since so many of the people who run them are ex-gay themselves and live under the burden of gender norms and the aspiration to heterosexuality, they need to also be defined by the self-harm they perpetuate.After spending time with the question, I replied to Southern Poverty Law Center. These ex-gay groups are not exactly like most hate groups, they operate as Self-Hate Groups. The revulsion and intolerance they have turned in on themselves spills over into the world. They then direct it towards all LGBTQ people.I lived in that stew of hate and fear for nearly 20 years. The self-hatred ate at me like a cancer. I grew confused, anger, and suicidal. I was not stuck in the closet; I was trapped in a tomb. Coming out was not enough. I had to undo the destruction to my psyche. I needed therapy to address the damage caused by the unethical treatments I received, treatments that have been denounced by every major medical association in the world and are now illegal in some US states.Besides traditional therapy, I needed to heal though new relationships with openly LGBTQ people, and I needed to learn about our history, and read our literature.I also decided to return to the Bible to take matters into my own hands. Finding heroic gender non-conforming Bible characters is part of my way to counter the hate and lies I faced. These queer Bible characters along with LGBTQ heroes in history help me see that I come from a people—queer folk who have always been and always will be in the world despite hate and ignorance.The violence continues against LGBTQ people in the USA and beyond. Therefore, we remain vigilant, resist, and look after each other. We have a lot of fight in us. As Russian poet Olga Fyodorovna Bergholz wrote after surviving the Siege of Leningrad, “Those who brought us so much death miscalculated. They underestimated our voracious hunger for life.”"

It makes me yearn for the heady days of cat videos and ads for that blanket with sleeves. The relentless Trump Russia updates, the Jared Kushner investigation, the persistent frat boy beer farts: “treason,” “traitor”, unqualified, undignified, unintelligent, un-American, under investigation, unconscionable and unmitigated disaster.And I gotta do something! Life on earth is in peril… unless… I sign this petition and share it with 10 friends.Better yet… Do I wear a pink hat? Turn on CNN? Or, wait till Rachel Maddow breaks it all down at six? Donate to the ACLU? I’m supposed to Occupy some venue? Demonstrate against someone? March to somewhere?Or, like Peter Finch in Network, because I’m so angry the system has failed – in a fit of madness and desperation do I just go to the window and shout “I’m mad as hell and not going to take it anymore…”You’ve heard of the five stages of grief when someone dies, right?Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.Well, I’ve got the 5 stages of The Trump Russia Scandal… Plus, how you can avoid the last stage: the stage where you feel dead inside.The constitutional crises in Trump’s White House is the most serious threat to America. Ever. Even worse than the time George W. Bush tried to sell back to the Indians the Louisiana Purchase for a six-pack of Meister Brau and a fist full of lottery scratchers.Every time I refresh my Facebook newsfeed, I’m punched in the face by bombshell headlines and breaking news. And, it’s a metric shit ton of information for the brain to absorb and process.And look, it can all feel overwhelming. Since you started reading, there were 42 new leaks and epic takedowns.The stages of grief after a loved one’s death can last anywhere from 6 months to 4 years… but less if the person who died is an ex-wife or a mother in law.HOWEVER ― With Trump, it’s only been what? Like 135 days… So, here now the five stages of grief of the Trump presidency:Disgust…Euphoria… Terror… Hopelessness… and Dead inside.I’ll explain.1. Disgust. I’m disgusted by the evidence and increasing number of allegations about Russian influence in our election and Trump’s collusion.2. Next is Euphoria. Trump is a bad person. With deceptive motives and no moral compass, So, I’m euphoric that allegations of criminal behavior will result in him leaving office BEFORE the end of his first term.3. Next, Terror. That’s the realization that “holy shit” there are A LOT of allegations – Just this week: The FBI is talking to Jared Kushner, Mike Flynn might be cooperating with the FBI, Jim Comey’s memos leak, Trump and Melania don’t hold hands, Trump shoves the president of Montenegro, Trump calls terrorists “losers.”4. Then, there’s Hopelessness. That’s where you go “Holy shit, Trump Russia is the only thing I watch on TV” “It’s the only think I talk about” I dream about Trump… and not the pretty one! So, you’re overwhelmed… but NOTHING IS HAPPENING. HE’S STILL PRESIDENT. So, you feel hopeless.5. And quickly, hopelessness metastasizes into feeling dead inside. You ask yourself “What can I do to help that the FBI, The House, The Senate, The Special Prosecutor, two federal courts, and the media aren’t doing?” Oh, I know! I’ll put on a pink hat?Being awoken to the pointlessness, you shut down… nothing matters. You’re broken and beaten. Dead inside. And so, you do…Nothing!BUT WAIT! – I have good news! You’re not alone. Those feelings, we’re all experiencing them. And science saw the whole thing coming up Broadway with an Underdog balloon.A few years ago, scientists did an experiment inside a supermarket. They put out a display with 20 varieties of Jelly… And there’s little bits of bread and customers are encouraged to sample… And hopefully buy something. They kept track of how much jelly they sold.Next...They put out a different display. This time, just three kinds of jelly. And again, there’s bread and customers are encouraged to sample.Now, which display resulted in more jars of jelly being sold? The one with 20 or the one with three kinds of Jelly?The answer is: The second one! The one with fewer choices.Why? Because when we’re presented with so many options, so much information, the brain doesn’t know what to prioritize and what to ignore. It focuses on the recent, not necessarily the important.So, the brain shuts down… and instead of just picking something, anything… many people make no choice at all.Now, the brain has an enormous capacity to take in information… When you’re driving, you see the road, how much gas is in the tank, cars all around, the weather, your speed, music, kids…HOWEVER – this thing with Trump is different! It’s relentless. Think about how often and how fast you scroll through your Facebook timeline. The volume of headlines you read… the number of stories you click on…The brain needs time to absorb information… but it can’t make a good decision if it’s constantly in the mode of taking in information.So – what can you do to beat back that “dead inside” feeling? To be less stupid?Turn off your phone. NO! Not forever. That candy is not going to crush itself. Instead of checking Facebook 100 times a day. Do it 20 times. And set a time at home where you put it down for the night… say 9pm.Follow fewer of the political pages and groups and more about pizza and Twin Peaks. Do the same with your computer.Recognize the feeling that comes over you when you start to get overwhelmed… so as soon as you feel it come on, go have a smoke, or get some ice cream, or better yet, get some exercise.Oh, and I almost forgot…There’s a sixth stage of Trump Russia Grief… HOPE! Remember that the FBI, the New York Times, Washington Post, Congress, two federal grand juries, CNN/MSNBC and a bunch of internet sleuths are doing what they do… If there’s dirt, these fuckers will find it – and the traitors, and colluders and justice obstructors will be kicked out of office… and many of them will end up in jail.Jon Hotchkiss is a 14 time Emmy nominee for his work on Politically Incorrect and Penn & Teller: Bullsh*t.

At 38, he would also become the youngest person to hold the office.Supporters are comparing the trained doctor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and new French President Emmanuel Macron, hoping a straight-talker from the generation hit hardest by an economic meltdown a decade ago can transform the political landscape.“I honestly don’t think in 1981 when I first got elected that I could foresee a time when an openly gay man might become Taoiseach (prime minister),” former Fine Gael deputy leader Nora Owen, who served as justice minister in the 1990s, told Reuters.“We have come a long way and the fact that someone like Leo Varadkar, who is an openly gay man, living with his partner, can actually put himself forward for Taoiseach and nobody is batting an eyelid is wonderful and I think it’s a great day for Ireland that we can do that.”The fact that such a milestone is barely mentioned in local media or raised in the leadership race demonstrates just how far the country of 4.6 million people that was long seen as one of the most socially conservative in Western Europe has come.Having only decriminalized homosexuality in 1993 and introduced divorce two years later, Ireland became the first country to adopt gay marriage via a popular vote in 2015, drawing overwhelming support from every corner of the country.The vote marked a further ebbing of the church’s dominance in Irish society, which has been shattered over the past two decades by the uncovering of scandals of sex abuse by priests and cruelty at Catholic-run institutions.His election would also show another face of modern-day Ireland.Varadkar’s father Ashok, who is also a doctor, was born in Mumbai in India. He met Varadkar’s mother Miriam, a nurse and farmer’s daughter from the southern Irish county of Waterford, while working in England in the 1970s. They married there but decided to move to Ireland and raise their family in Dublin, where Varadkar was born.Varadkar himself has played down the significance of his background and personal life.“It’s not something that defines me. I’m not a half-Indian politician, or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter. It’s just part of who I am, it doesn’t define me, it is part of my character I suppose,” he told state broadcaster RTE in a 2015 interview when he said publicly for the first time that he was gay.“POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE”He has secured the publicly declared support of 46 of Fine Gael’s 73 lawmakers in the June 2 race to succeed Kenny. With lawmakers accounting for 65 percent of the selection vote, his opponent Simon Coveney needs a significant number to change their minds, which analysts say is highly unlikely.Whoever takes over from Kenny’s 15 years at the helm, they will be the only leader in the Irish parliament born in the 1970s. When Kenny was first elected to the lower house in 1975, Coveney was 3-years-old and Varadkar was not even born.Opinion polls show both are popular among Fine Gael members but that Varadkar has the potential to win a significant percentage of votes from other parties.That appeal is down to the current social protection minister representing what political commentator Noel Whelan called “the most interesting story around the kitchen tables, water coolers and bar stools of Ireland” in a long time.“I think Leo Varadkar becoming Taoiseach is potentially transformative for the electoral fortunes of Fine Gael and perhaps for the political system generally,” Whelan said.“He is blunt, brash, direct but for those reasons, also more authentic. In an era of anti-politics he is one of the closest things to an anti-politician we have serving in politics. He excites parts of the electorate Fine Gael doesn’t usually reach.”Whelan said Varadkar’s style will be tested by the office, not least through Ireland’s vulnerability to Brexit and its still constrained public finances that will limit his plans to provide the growing economy with better infrastructure.But Fine Gael lawmakers, desperate to restore their lead over rivals Fianna Fail in opinion polls before a possible election next year, look set to take a calculated risk on a leader who they say voters like, regardless of their background.“The people I have met who might be from more conservative rural backgrounds and who I thought wouldn’t really subscribe to Leo really like him,” said Brendan Griffin, a backbencher from the sourhern county Kerry.“I was with a group of friends at the weekend and the first comment was imagine a Taoiseach in his 30s. The second was ‘and a son of an immigrant’ and it was only then that someone said ‘and gay as well’ People are amazed at how quickly the country has moved on.”(Editing by Angus MacSwan)"

His wife confirmed the news to the paper. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on Dec. 16, 1938, Deford attended Princeton University before landing a job at Sports Illustrated in 1962, when the magazine was still in its infancy.Over the next 27 years, Deford would become one of the most celebrated sports writers in U.S. history, once even being described in GQ as “the world’s greatest sportswriter.” He was known in particular for his sweeping and lyrical magazine profiles, many of which were seen as iconic, such as “The Boxer and the Blonde,” which he considered his best piece ever. “I think I would die if I couldn’t get to the typewriter every day. I really need that. I think it’s a sexual experience,” Deford once said. He eventually branched out from magazines and into radio and television as well. Starting in 1980 and up until this month, he delivered memorable sports commentaries on NPR’s “Morning Edition” ― 1,656 times to be exact. And for two decades, he served as a senior correspondent for HBO’s “Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel.”Over his career, his fellow sports writers voted him U.S. Sportswriter of the Year six times. In 1998, he was elected to to the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Sportscasters and Sportswriters. In 2013, President Barack Obama awarded him with the National Humanities Medal.“A dedicated writer and storyteller, Mr. Deford has offered a consistent, compelling voice in print and on radio, reaching beyond scores and statistics to reveal the humanity woven into the games we love,” Obama said at the time.But Deford’s interests were not limited to sports, either. He wrote more than a dozen books, many about sports and celebrity, but some of which dealt with topics such as pre-Pearl Harbor Japan and the polio epidemic. He is survived by his wife, Carol, and two children, Christian and Scarlet.After news of his death circulated Monday, many in the sports journalism industry and beyond wrote of their fond memories of Deford. This article has been updated with more details on Deford and reaction to his death."
21,IMPACT,Why You Should Stop Feeding Your Baby From Trendy Little Food Pouches,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baby-food-pouches-plastic_us_59120da5e4b050bdca600cb0,They're an environmental nightmare.,2017-05-29,"As demand for packaged baby food grows, environmentalists are concerned because most of these packs can't be recycled.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59120efc17000020005a5a36.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story is part of a series on ocean plastics.For the over-stretched parent who doesn’t have time to puree plums or soak grains overnight, portable plastic packs jammed with organic and healthful ingredients are a godsend.On-the-go moms can just twist off the cap and hand a pouch of blueberry flax and oat to a hungry baby to suck on by himself. No spoon or spoon skills required.While these packs are pricey ― a 4-ounce pouch can cost north of $2 ― families are willing to fork over the funds for the convenience factor. But this convenience comes with another price: Most of these plastic pouches can’t be recycled and are destined for landfills ― or worse, the oceans. The demand is growing even though reasonably priced alternatives are available that can be used over and over again. The problem with the disposable pouches is that they’re made from multiple layers of materials and the recyclable components can’t be separated out, said Brent Bell, vice president of recycling at Waste Management, the largest residential recycler in North America. Empty food packs and other types of trash end up in the ocean due to a mix of mismanaged trash disposal and littering. When a person litters, for example, that item can easily blow into a storm drain, travel through sewer pipes and eventually land in waterways. Stuffing loads of unusual and healthful foods into plastic casings isn’t sitting well with environmentalists.“There’s definitely a push for clean eating both for kids and grown-ups,” Lindsay Gallimore, a mother of two who blogs about green issues, told HuffPost. “But all the buzz words that are associated with a ‘greener’ lifestyle are packaged into a packaging that’s not green at all.”If the baby food industry doesn’t come up with a solution soon, the amount of plastic piling up from these products is only going to grow at an explosive rate.In 2015, sales from baby food pouches reached $45 million. That was up from $8 million in 2010, according to a report from the Freedonia Group, a market research firm. The demand for this niche product is increasing as oceans are being overloaded with plastic. By 2050, experts estimate oceans will have more plastic than fish (by weight). Plastics are believed to threaten at least 600 different wildlife species, according to the Ocean Conservancy. When plastic reaches the landfill, it can take up to 1,000 years to decompose and can leak pollutants into the soil and water.While plenty of plastic products are harming the environment, activists take specific issue with baby food packs because a number of convenient and eco-friendly alternatives exist, even for time-strapped parents.“I can’t get everyone to use washable menstrual pads. I certainly can’t get everyone to use cloth diapers,” Gallimore said. “Feeding your baby healthy purees could happen in so many other ways that don’t require the little squishy packs.”Gallimore likened the advent of plastic baby food packs to the K-Cup phenomenon. While some of these one-time-use coffee pods are technically recyclable, the process is so painstaking that consumers are more likely to throw them in the trash after using them for a few seconds. In fact, John Sylvan, the inventor of the Keurig machine, said he regrets the innovation. “It was along the same lines as K-Cups for coffee,” Gallimore said of the similarities between the coffee pods and plastic baby food packs. “We were doing fine without them before.”Before the plastic squeezy packs hit the market, baby food was mostly packaged in glass jars, which are recyclable, reusable and cheaper. Responding to the surge of plastic packs, a number of companies have developed receptacles that work similarly, but can be washed and used more than once. Rhoost, for example, manufactures 4.5-ounce plastic pouches that can be filled with pureed food repeatedly and washed by hand or in the dishwasher. They run $12.99 for a four-pack. Though most of the disposable plastic packs can’t be recycled, some experts say there is some merit to them.They usually require fewer raw materials to produce than recyclable materials, which results in net energy and greenhouse gas emissions savings, Bell, of Waste Management, said. The packages are also designed in such a way to reduce food waste, which is where the “greatest environmental savings are realized,” he said.Hain Celestial ― the company behind Earth’s Best and Ella’s Kitchen baby food ― is reducing its plastic footprint by partnering with recycling company TerraCycle. After consumers finish with their packs, they can download free shipping labels and send the waste to TerraCycle.Since the products can’t be separated, they’re shredded and melted into a plastic and pelletized. That material is then sold to manufacturers who can use recycled plastic in their products, Lauren Taylor, TerraCycle’s global director for communications, said.While this process is a start, it’s not capturing many plastic packages. Celestial sells about 20 million pouches annually in the U.S. alone, said Jared Simon, vice president of marketing for Better-for-You-Baby at Hain Celestial United States. TerraCycle has collected about 3.3 million pouches in the U.S. and the U.K. since it started doing so in 2013.Even if those numbers increased, environmentalists likely still wouldn’t be satisfied. “Recycling is awesome ― it’s great. But recycling is not the be all and end all of environmentalism. It’s expensive and it’s not a perfect solution.” Gallimore said. “Instead, how can we replace what we’re using and throwing away with something that we don’t throw away?”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592afb512000003a0016f4d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sri Lanka is bracing for more rain, three days after enormous mudslides triggered by heavy precipitation killed more than 150 people and left more than a hundred missing, The Associated Press reported.The heavy rains ― the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003 ― wreaked havoc across the country in previous days, causing both widespread flooding and devastating landslides. Mudslides in three southwestern district buried hundreds of people under mud and debris. The death toll had climbed to 151 on Sunday and 111 people were still missing, authorities said, according to the AP. Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe, who leads the search and rescue mission, said rescue workers didn’t expect to find more survivors. Ranasinghe added that while floodwaters were receding, some areas were still inundated.The disaster has left nearly 2,000 homes destroyed and more than half a million people displaced, according to Al-Jazeera.The rains have affected 14 districts in the country, the International Foundation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies noted in a brief on Saturday. Landslides were reported in four different southwestern districts - Galle, Matara, Kalutara and Ratnapura. The country’s southwest is often referred to as the “wet belt,” IFRC said, because ample rainfall is common in the region. Rescue workers on Sunday made use of a brief respite in the rains to clear debris and improve access to some of the affected areas. Army trucks transported relief supplies and evacuated residents in affected areas, the AP reported.

Mudslides in three southwestern district buried hundreds of people under mud and debris. The death toll had climbed to 151 on Sunday and 111 people were still missing, authorities said, according to the AP. Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe, who leads the search and rescue mission, said rescue workers didn’t expect to find more survivors. Ranasinghe added that while floodwaters were receding, some areas were still inundated.The disaster has left nearly 2,000 homes destroyed and more than half a million people displaced, according to Al-Jazeera.The rains have affected 14 districts in the country, the International Foundation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies noted in a brief on Saturday.

It had been been launched from near the coastal city of Wonsan and flew about 280 miles east. Japan said the missile had landed in its exclusive economic zone in the Sea of Japan but caused no damage to planes or ships. “This ballistic missile launch by North Korea is highly problematic from the perspective of the safety of shipping and air traffic and is a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said, according to Reuters.“Japan absolutely cannot tolerate North Korea’s repeated provocative actions. We have strongly protested to North Korea and condemn its actions in the strongest terms,” Suga added.U.S. President Donald Trump had been briefed on the launch. “The United States government is aware. The president has been briefed,” an unidentified National Security Council official said, according to White House pool reports.North Korea has spent years attempting to build an intercontinental ballistic missile that has the power to reach United States, but has so far failed to successfully test a weapon with that capability. The United States and its allies have been carefully watching North Korea’s tests, as well as its military parades, to monitor the progress of country’s secretive missile program. Experts project that Pyongyang is still several years away from possessing a functional ICBM, but the looming threat is a persistent policy problem for the U.S. with no consensus how to address.Pyongyang dramatically increased the number of missile tests in recent years and even conducted two nuclear tests, as Kim accelerated the country’s missile program in tandem with pursuing advancements in its nuclear capabilities. The U.S. responded under former President Barack Obama by ramping up a clandestine cyber war aimed at disrupting the missile program.Although the American cyber operations are thought to be a major reason that so many of North Korea’s recent tests have result in failure, Washington has been unable to fully stop advancements in the missile program.Pyongyang stepped up the pace of its tests even further in recent months. Sunday’s launch is the country’s ninth missile test just this year, Yonhap reported, and comes just a week after Pyongyang tested a mid-range missile.Just hours before Sunday’s launch, North Korean state media KCNA reported that the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, had supervised the test of a new anti-aircraft weapon system, ordering its mass production. However, KCNA did not provide details about the type of weapon, nor when the test took place, Reuters notes.President Trump has used stern and hostile terms when speaking about North Korea’s military moves. Previously leaked transcripts of a call from last month between the U.S. president and Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte showed Trump describe Kim as a “madman with nuclear weapons.” Yet Trump has also publicly praised Kim as a “pretty smart cookie,” and said he would be “honored” to meet him and conduct direct negotiations under the right circumstances.Despite Trump’s tough rhetoric, the U.S. and other international powers have no easy options to prevent Pyongyang from becoming a nuclear armed state with the range to target a large portion of the world.Military intervention would likely spur a devastating reprisal attack that could hit South Korea, Japan and other allies and states in the region. Different attempts at negotiation have failed to compel Pyongyang to denuclearize, however, as have extensive sanctions targeting the Kim dynasty. Trump has said he believes China, North Korea’s most powerful ally, could be a crucial ally in pressuring Kim to abandon his pursuit of intercontinental nuclear missiles."

Attached to one of the bodies was a sign that said “Munafik” (traitor).The discovery confirms days of speculation that Maute rebels had killed civilians during a takeover of Marawi, that the military believes is aimed at winning the Maute recognition from the Islamic State as a Southeast Asian affiliate.The fierce resistance of the Maute gunmen and the apparent executions of civilians will add to growing fears that subscribers to Islamic State’s radical ideology are determined to establish a presence in the southern Philippines, with the support of extremists from Indonesia and Malaysia.The army deployed more ground troops over the weekend and dispatched army and air force helicopters to carry out rocket strikes on Maute positions as fighters held buildings and a bridge deep inside a predominantly Muslim city where few civilians remained.Some of those trapped in Marawi had called and text-messaged a hotline pleading with the military to stop the air strikes, according to Zia Alonto Adiong, a local politician coordinating complex efforts to evacuate civilians, dead and alive.“Some have no food at all. Some fear for their lives,” he told Reuters.“This is a conflict that has gone beyond proportion. The magnitude of the degree of the damage and the people that are affected ... it’s really massive.”At least 61 militants were killed and 15 security forces as of Saturday, according to the army, which said it could confirm nine civilians killed by militants.At the ravine where the bodies were found, Marawi police officer Jamail C Mangadang said the victims were carpenters who were part of an evacuation convoy stopped by rebels late on Saturday.Recalling information provided by their manager, Mangadang said the victims were pulled off a truck because they were unable to cite verses of the Koran, the Islamic holy text.BRAZEN SIEGEThe military said it was possible there were others victims.“This development validates a series of reports of atrocities committed by the militants earlier,” said military spokesman, Restituto Padilla.“We are still validating other reports of atrocities.”Islamic State’s Amaq news agency last week claimed responsibility for the Maute’s brazen siege. Unverified statements claiming to be from the extremists have appeared online, declaring the city of 200,000 people the “Islamic City of Marawi.”President Rodrigo Duterte on Sunday canceled a trip to Japan to address the unrest in Mindanao, an island of 22 million people where martial law has been declared. Police on Sunday outlawed guns there and suspended all weapons permits.Fierce battles took place on Sunday as ground troops engaged Maute fighters with heavy gunfire and artillery. Plumes of smoke were seen on the horizon and helicopters unloaded rockets on rebel positions.A surveillance drone circled the sky above Marawi. Some civilians tied white cloths to poles to distinguish themselves from militants as soldiers on foot huddled behind armored vehicles that crawled along deserted streets.Tens of thousands of people have fled Marawi since Tuesday, when militants went on the rampage seizing a school, a hospital, and a cathedral, where Christians were taken hostage, according to church leaders. Scores of prisoners, among them militants, were freed when rebels took over two detention facilities.The violence erupted in response to a failed attempt by security forces to capture Isnilon Hapilon, who the government believes is Islamic State’s point-man in the Philippines.The military is certain the Maute are protecting Hapilon and had narrowed down his location. Hapilon leads a radical faction of another Mindanao-based group, the Abu Sayyaf.The little-known Maute group has staged several days-long sieges on Mindanao island but none on the scale of Marawi, where witnesses said flags resembling those of Islamic State had been flown and some gunmen wore black headbands.The Maute group was blamed for last year’s bombing in the president’s home city, Davao, which killed 14 people, and its battlefield capability has been a serious challenge to a military that has far larger numbers and firepower.Another concern for the government was the discovery of Indonesian and Malaysian fighters with the Maute, which it said showed a domestic rebellion had expanded to become a far greater threat, driven by radical ideology.(Reporting by Tom Allard; Additional reporting by Erik De Castro in MARAWI and Manuel Mogato in MANILA; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Michael Perry)"

I was strong and fast. The people I coached told me that I inspired them. Even so, I never felt like I ‘belonged’ in the fitness industry.I was just a normal girl who ate normal food who had a normal-looking body who lived a normal life.And I felt like a fraud because of the work I did.But as the years have gone by, I’ve become more able—with effort and mindfulness—to gradually own who I am and make my way through life with greater confidence. This is how I’ve come to learn the following lessons about finding peace and confidence in my own skin:Spend more time with confident people. It helps...a lot.The notion that you become who you spend the most time with isn’t a new one, and is relevant no matter what you’re trying to achieve in life.Spend most of your time with people who drink a lot, and you’ll probably find yourself heading to the bar more often.Spend most of your time with people who are successful, confident (not to be confused with being cocky) and purposeful, the less time you’ll spend wallowing in your insecurities and the more inspired you’ll be to ask: “What are the things that she does everyday that helps her live this way?”So if you want to help yourself become confident and certain in your own skin, do it by spending more time with people who know how to get and stay there.Do hard things that make you uncomfortable to build your resilience.Developing a fit body requires that you sweat, experience discomfort, and push yourself beyond your perceived limits. It involves placing increasing amounts of measured stress on your body with the goal of making it stronger, faster, more flexible, and more capable of enduring the physical rigours of life.But that alone isn’t enough to make you resilient inside and out, or able to rebound from adversity.Rising from difficult circumstances, be it heartbreak, betrayal, abuse or disappointment and getting better at withstanding more of them requires that you go through the accompanying mental and emotional discomfort.Just like the way the torn muscle fibers in your body get stronger as they recover and rebuild after a challenging workout, so does your ability to get up and keep moving forward after being knocked down.Break down your self-limiting beliefs by doing more and thinking less.“You can’t”.For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this tiny voice in my head whose only job seemed to be to plant the seeds of doubt when hope, new ideas or opportunities presented themselves, causing me to stop in my tracks and give up on even trying.At some point, I needed to get real with myself to find out why this voice was there—and I did, with great discomfort. After awhile, I realised that it was just a self-protection mechanism that I was using to keep me safe from failure and disappointment.Despite being aware of it, I haven’t been able to get rid of it completely. But what I am able to do is silence it with action. The more I focus on the ‘doing’ despite my inner resistance and the more success I achieve, the quieter the voice in my head gets.Quiet down your thinking with ‘doing’, and the better you’ll get at breaking past your invisible limits.Master your body by mastering your meals.A big part of feeling good in your own skin comes from knowing how to nourish your body.There’s a huge misconception about eating well, especially if you’re one of the estimated 50% of Americans who want to lose weight, and it’s that you need to starve, deprive and punish your way skinny.I’d struggled with my weight and emotional overeating for about 20 years of my life, and it was only when I began to master the food in my life so they no longer controlled me that I started to truly feel comfortable and confident in my body.How did I get here? By realizing at rock bottom when I was on the verge of giving up, that I wanted so much more out of life, and deciding to eat in a way that allowed me to feel good about being alive instead of abusing food (and my body) because I didn’t know how else to deal with the stresses of life.This meant prioritising awareness, mindfulness and habit development over external tactics like counting calories and restriction, which almost always led to more food cravings and bingeing. It also meant making sure that my primary focus was on eating foods that helped me feel energetic, nourished and satisfied, rather than forcing myself to 'eat clean' day in and day out.I didn't realise it then, but this path of mindful, joyful eating allowed me to heal my dysfunctional relationship with food, and finally, lose all the extra weight I'd been carrying around for years without starving and depriving myself of the food I loved.Tired of overeating and feeling uneasy in your body?

I was strong and fast. The people I coached told me that I inspired them. Even so, I never felt like I ‘belonged’ in the fitness industry.I was just a normal girl who ate normal food who had a normal-looking body who lived a normal life.And I felt like a fraud because of the work I did.But as the years have gone by, I’ve become more able—with effort and mindfulness—to gradually own who I am and make my way through life with greater confidence. This is how I’ve come to learn the following lessons about finding peace and confidence in my own skin:Spend more time with confident people. It helps...a lot.The notion that you become who you spend the most time with isn’t a new one, and is relevant no matter what you’re trying to achieve in life.Spend most of your time with people who drink a lot, and you’ll probably find yourself heading to the bar more often.Spend most of your time with people who are successful, confident (not to be confused with being cocky) and purposeful, the less time you’ll spend wallowing in your insecurities and the more inspired you’ll be to ask: “What are the things that she does everyday that helps her live this way?”So if you want to help yourself become confident and certain in your own skin, do it by spending more time with people who know how to get and stay there.Do hard things that make you uncomfortable to build your resilience.Developing a fit body requires that you sweat, experience discomfort, and push yourself beyond your perceived limits. It involves placing increasing amounts of measured stress on your body with the goal of making it stronger, faster, more flexible, and more capable of enduring the physical rigours of life.But that alone isn’t enough to make you resilient inside and out, or able to rebound from adversity.Rising from difficult circumstances, be it heartbreak, betrayal, abuse or disappointment and getting better at withstanding more of them requires that you go through the accompanying mental and emotional discomfort.Just like the way the torn muscle fibers in your body get stronger as they recover and rebuild after a challenging workout, so does your ability to get up and keep moving forward after being knocked down.Break down your self-limiting beliefs by doing more and thinking less.“You can’t”.For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this tiny voice in my head whose only job seemed to be to plant the seeds of doubt when hope, new ideas or opportunities presented themselves, causing me to stop in my tracks and give up on even trying.At some point, I needed to get real with myself to find out why this voice was there—and I did, with great discomfort. After awhile, I realised that it was just a self-protection mechanism that I was using to keep me safe from failure and disappointment.Despite being aware of it, I haven’t been able to get rid of it completely. But what I am able to do is silence it with action.

35,WORLD NEWS,91 Seconds Spell Disaster For Bahrain,"Brian Dooley, ContributorSenior Advisor, Human Rights First",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/91-seconds-spell-disaster-for-bahrain_us_592ae42ce4b07d848fdc049b,"The clip is only a minute and a half, but the White House video of President Trump meeting the king of Bahrain last week",2017-05-28,<p>Last week’s meeting between President Trump and the king of Bahrain was followed by a sharp rise in attacks on dissent in the kingdom.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592afec6150000260015bc63.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The clip is only a minute and a half, but the White House video of President Trump meeting the king of Bahrain last week caps years of misguided American policy on the kingdom. It’s also been followed by a sharp, violent attack on internal dissent against the monarchy.In the film the pair sit awkwardly and exchange stiff, stilted conversation, but Trump’s message is clear. “Our countries have a wonderful relationship together, but there has been a little strain, but there won't be strain with this administration,"" he said, suggesting Bahrain is about to enjoy a new era free from White House criticism of human rights abuses. ""We're going to have a very, very long-term relationship. I look forward to it very much - many of the same things in common,"" said Trump.Two days after the meeting Bahrain’s security forces attacked an 11-month protest near the house of senior Shia cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim. Demonstrators had gathered to protect the cleric after his citizenship had been stripped last June. Five people were killed in the attack, and hundreds arrested.Reports from multiple credible sources say detainees have this week been electrocuted and threatened that their family members will be raped. Torture is not new in Bahrain, but this week has seen a sudden and dramatic surge in the targeting of activists. The new assaults on dissent have, say some, been enabled by Trump’s message to the king.Local activists tell me they are ""terrified"" by the new context, and report that human rights defender Ebstisam AlSaegh had to be hospitalized on Friday after severe pressure was exerted on her during an eight-hour interrogation. ""I know that the situation has changed a lot from the previous times, according to the testimonies from many human rights activists in this period,"" one told me. Internal critics of the monarchy (and external ones, including myself and other international human rights observers) are conveniently and simplistically dismissed as agents of Iran.A lack of meaningful censure from foreign governments has enabled Washington’s military ally to crush its political opposition and attack its leading dissidents for years. Prominent human rights leaders including Abdulhadi Al Khawaja, Nabeel Rajab and Naji Fateel are in prison. Other leading activists have been forced into exile. No-one arrested this week can expect to get a fair trial.The Obama administration’s response to Bahrain’s human rights abuses was often weak, and two years ago next month it lifted holds on arms sales to Bahrain’s military, bafflingly citing “meaningful progress on human rights reforms.” Within weeks of the move peaceful opposition leader Ibrahim Sharif has been rearrested. Last year Sheikh Ali Salman, leader of the main opposition group Al Wefaq, was jailed and the group dissolved. But while the Obama administration offered only sporadic criticism of Bahrain, there were times when it did speak out. Since Trump’s election win things have become undeniably worse. January saw the first executions in the country since 2010, and last month the king approved a constitutional amendment allowing civilians to be tried in military courts. This week’s attack has left much of the country more scared than at any time since the large-scale violent repression of 2011, and several activists have told me in the last few days they are braced for a large-scale roundup of critics.This week’s attack has left much of the country more frightened than at any time since the large-scale violent repression of 2011, and several activists have told me in the last few days they are braced for a large-scale roundup of critics. Parliamentary elections are due to take place next year, but it’s impossible to see them being anything more than an oppositionless charade. Bahrain’s ruling family appears to have no more sophisticated policy than to stamp out all dissent. President Trump looks unlikely to try to stop them."

Godbolt, who appeared to have an injured arm, suggested that the late-night violence followed a dispute between him and his estranged wife over custody of his children.“I was having a conversation with her stepdaddy and her mama, and her ― my wife ― about me taking my children home and somebody called the officers, people that didn’t even live at the house. But that’s what people do. They intervene,” Godbolt said before saying he was “sorry.”Asked what’s next for him, he appeared to say “death.”“Suicide by cop was my intention,” the Clarion-Ledger reported him as saying. “I ain’t fit to live. Not after what I’ve done.Authorities plan to charge Godbolt with capital murder for the deputy’s death and seven counts of first-degree murder for the slaying’s of the other victims, Warren Strain, a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety, told HuffPost. Aside from the deputy, Godbolt was related to or acquainted with the seven people he killed, Strain said.The slain deputy has been identified as 36-year-old William Durr, a two-year veteran of the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and a four-year veteran of the Brookhaven Police Department, The Daily Leader reported, citing Strain. Durr was married and had an 11-year-old son, CBS News reported.Strain, speaking to Reuters, said Durr was responding to a call about a domestic dispute at the house of Godbolt’s in-laws in Bogue Chitto, about 69 miles south of Jackson, when he was fatally shot.Vincent Mitchell, Godbolt’s stepfather-in-law, told the Associated Press that Godbolt’s wife had left him several weeks ago because of domestic violence and had been staying with them since. Mitchell said that Godbolt opened fire after the deputy arrived, killing the officer, Mitchell’s wife, Barbara Mitchell, 55, one of her daughters, Tocarra May, 35, and the wife’s sister, Brenda May, 53, according to multiple reports. Mitchell and Godbolt’s wife escaped.Law enforcement officials said they believe as many as 10-12 people were in the house that night, Strain said. He declined to identify the victims or how they were related.After the initial shootings, Godbolt went to a second home in the nearby city of Brookhaven where he fatally shot Jordan Blackwell, 18, and Austin Edwards, 11. Blackwell died protecting his 15-year-old cousin, according to the Clarion-Ledger. The newspaper didn’t say whether the cousin was injured.He then went to a third property where he killed his wife’s sister, Shelia Burage, 46, and her husband, Ferral Burage, 45, according to TV-station WAPT.Authorities apprehended Godbolt outside of the third home. He’s been hospitalized with a gunshot wound, and Strain said it was possible he exchanged gunfire with a civilian. Godbolt had also reportedly taken a 16-year-old boy as a hostage. The boy has been safely released, according to the Lincoln County sheriff. The other victims have yet to be publicly identified.Strain said that it would be “premature” to discuss a motive.Sunday morning, Gov. Phil Bryant (R) issued a statement asking all Mississippians to join him and his wife “in praying for those lost in Lincoln County. Every day, the men and women who wear the badge make some measure of sacrifice to protect and serve their communities. Too often, we lose one of our finest. I thank the law enforcement agencies involved for their hard work. May the peace of the Almighty wash over those hurting after this senseless tragedy.”This article has been updated with more information about the victims."

During the set’s first song, “Long Road,” Vedder amended the words to say, “Without you, something is missing.”Vedder also performed a cover of Neil Young’s “The Needle and the Damage Done,” a song about heroin addiction.Later during the gig, when a fan shouted “I love you,” Vedder reportedly responded, “Thank you. I need it ― we all need it. I’m thinking of a lot of people tonight, and some in particular and their families. And I just know that healing takes time, if it ever happens. It takes time, and that means you have to start somewhere. So let it be music. Let it be love and togetherness. And let it be Amsterdam.”Vedder and Cornell worked together when Cornell was the lead singer of the rock band Temple of the Dog, which united the founding members of Pearl Jam. Guns N’ Roses also paid tribute to Cornell on Saturday, during a show in Ireland. The band performed “Black Hole Sun,” Soundgarden’s defining hit. Duff McKagan, Guns N’ Roses’ bass guitarist, collaborated with Cornell when they performed with the supergroup Mad Season, which featured members of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Queens of the Stone Age and The Walkabouts. At a 2015 reunion show, Cornel filled in as the band’s lead singer, and McKagan played bass. Guns N’ Roses are among many acts that have covered “Black Hole Sun” in recent days, including Ryan Adams, Ann Wilson and Norah Jones."

The caption initially named all the spouses of NATO leaders who were posing in the photo ― except for one: Gauthier Destenay, the first gentleman of Luxembourg and husband to Prime Minister Xavier Bettel.Twitter users were quick to point out the missing name and accused the White House of doing it on purpose. Scott Bixby of The Daily Beast called the caption “homophobic.”A White House spokeswoman told Chris Johnson, a reporter for the LGBTQ political news site Washington Blade, that the omission was likely an “oversight.”“Thousands of photos were taken over the course of a very big, very busy international trip,” deputy press secretary Stephanie Grisham told Johnson in an email that was shared on Twitter.Ten hours after the photo was posted, and less than one hour after Johnson tweeted Grisham’s response, the White House edited the caption to include Destenay and his official title.By then, The Daily Beast, Newsweek, and the watchdogs of Twitter had already called the White House out.Bettel and Destenay were in a civil partnership when Bettel became Prime Minister in 2013. They officially married two years later, when Luxembourg legalized marriage equality in 2015. Bettle is the only openly gay prime minister in the world.People celebrated Destenay after photos of him with other world leaders’ spouses were published Friday. Some called his presence in the photo a symbol of equality for the LGBTQ community.Though officials edited the original Facebook caption to include Destenay, some of the photo’s most-liked comments, including one from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, are a clear reminder of the mistake the White House made."

It was his hope to help revive the farm and his hometown.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5928969d150000470015ba85.jpeg?ops=crop_0_29_960_580%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When Marshall Bartlett describes Como — the northern Mississippi town of 1,200 where he lives and operates a farm that’s been in his family for 150 years — he says the statistics speak for themselves.Among the Panola County town’s residents, 35 percent report income below the poverty line, far exceeding the statewide poverty rate — which itself has been cited as the highest in the nation. And the county’s unemployment rate of 6 percent outpaces state and national numbers.“It’s all pretty grim,” Bartlett admitted.Bartlett says his father had encouraged him and his siblings to not pursue careers in agriculture, and he initially heeded that advice — earning a bachelor’s degree in environmental studies at Dartmouth College and working with AmeriCorps to rebuild the homes of Hurricane Katrina victims in neighboring Louisiana, among other pursuits.But about four years ago, the now-28-year-old returned to the farm with a lofty aim: to not only keep the farm in the family but also bring economic opportunities back to the place where he grew up.The result was Home Place Pastures. Bartlett and his team grow and process pasture-raised pork, beef and lamb with a keen eye on humane handling and environmentally friendly practices. The farm now processes about 25 hogs, five steers and 20 lambs and goats a week, bringing in about $30,000 in revenue. And Bartlett has 12 farm employees, about half of whom live right in Como.“We’ve gotten here in a little over three years, which is pretty crazy,” Bartlett told HuffPost. “I’m really proud to have built this here.”Though a lot of hard work contributed to that success, Bartlett also credits two U.S. Department of Agriculture rural development grants that helped make the farm’s steady growth possible.In 2014, Bartlett applied for and received a USDA value-added producer grant (VAPG) of about $50,000 to help finance the farm’s expansion of its pork business, allowing it to supply products to area restaurants, retailers and consumers by helping to finance refrigerated delivery equipment. A year later, the farm received a second $50,000 grant to help establish its free-range lamb operation.Bartlett doubts the farm would be in the position it is today without the federal help.“We were able to handle these upfront expenses without borrowing a ton of money,” he said. “Without that injection of those grants, we wouldn’t have been able to do all this.”The VAPG program was created under the Clinton administration in 2000 to reward farmers, particularly beginners, who were working to diversify farm income streams by creating products and marketing opportunities that added resilience against volatile commodity prices. The program awarded $45 million in grants to 325 producers last year.This kind of support, advocates say, is especially important when many U.S. farmers are struggling with falling income and rising debt, as well as the extreme weather challenges associated with climate change.And yet the program is on the chopping block.As part of a proposed 21 percent reduction in the USDA’s overall spending, President Donald Trump’s budget plan calls for eliminating the funding for VAPG and other rural development programs under the department’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service.The programs were deemed “duplicative and underperforming” in the president’s skinny budget. Neither USDA nor Office of Management and Budget officials responded to a request for further explanation of the proposal.Wes King, policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, said the elimination of these programs could be devastating for many smaller farmers.“If this were to go away, I think you would have a number of farms that would probably end up closing up shop,” King told HuffPost.Anna Johnson, a policy program associate at the nonpartisan Center for Rural Affairs, described the RBCS cuts as particularly alarming when combined with massive cuts proposed for other initiatives aimed at rural communities, like zeroed-out funding for the Rural Economic Development Program as well as the USDA’s water and wastewater loan program, which helps fund rural infrastructure projects.“Economic opportunity in these rural areas is a really big issue, and these areas face higher levels of poverty,” Johnson said. “These are really important programs. For the administration to propose eliminating these supports is troubling for rural communities.”Criticism of the proposed USDA cuts has come from all sides of the agriculture sector ― including the conservative-leaning Farm Bureau Federation, which said the plan “fails agriculture and rural America” ― as well as members of Congress from both parties. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue appeared to be distancing himself from the president’s spending plan this week. Perdue attempted to assure lawmakers that he is elevating rural development concerns at the USDA, but his reorganization has eliminated the undersecretary for rural development. Some farmers appear willing to give Perdue a chance to make good on that pledge.In 2015, William Powers, who owns and operates Darby Springs Farm in Ceresco, Nebraska, alongside his wife, Crystal, was another recipient of a $50,000 VAPG grant. The federal money helped finance the farm’s construction of a creamery that will allow them to make and sell ice cream using milk from their pasture-grazed dairy cows.“The program is crucial for young entrepreneurs with a cash-flow situation,” Powers explained. “We’re not independently wealthy, so that grant helps us make up some of those upfront payments.”While Powers believes the proposed cuts to the VAPG and other USDA rural development programs would be detrimental to farms like his, he thinks it’s unlikely Congress will move forward with them.“But who knows?” he added. “I’m an optimist.”"

Some farmers appear willing to give Perdue a chance to make good on that pledge.In 2015, William Powers, who owns and operates Darby Springs Farm in Ceresco, Nebraska, alongside his wife, Crystal, was another recipient of a $50,000 VAPG grant. The federal money helped finance the farm’s construction of a creamery that will allow them to make and sell ice cream using milk from their pasture-grazed dairy cows.“The program is crucial for young entrepreneurs with a cash-flow situation,” Powers explained. “We’re not independently wealthy, so that grant helps us make up some of those upfront payments.”While Powers believes the proposed cuts to the VAPG and other USDA rural development programs would be detrimental to farms like his, he thinks it’s unlikely Congress will move forward with them.“But who knows?” he added. “I’m an optimist.”"

Grinnell invited him back this week to deliver the commencement address to the graduating class of 2017. During the ceremony, the school awarded Nanjiani an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters.The star of HBO’s “Silicon Valley” opened up to the graduates about his experience moving from Pakistan to Iowa for college and how it shaped the way he moved through the world. “When I came to Grinnell I was a devout Muslim who had never romantically touched a girl and I was going to get a degree that guaranteed me a job,” Nanjiani said. “By the time I graduated I was basically a Rastafarian with a white American girlfriend and a philosophy degree. College changes you, is my point.”He also offered advice on how to take on bigotry, even if it is uncomfortable.“We cannot expect others to understand our point of view if we don’t understand theirs,” he said. “It’s uncomfortable and awkward and infuriating and it hurts your brain, but with that pain can come growth and real change.”“Being a fish out of water is tough, but that’s how you evolve,” he added. “I think that’s scientifically accurate — I don’t know, I had a liberal arts education.”Nanjiani advised the graduates to live with intention and not fear failure ― unless, he joked, you’re the person who created the exploding Samsung Galaxy phones.“I never thought big picture,” Nanjiani said. “That would have been overwhelming. So what I’m saying is, you can go slow. Allow your dreams and goals to change, but live an intentional life.”He continued: “Here’s the big secret I’ve learned in the last few years: Nobody knows what they’re doing ... Everybody’s winging it out there. Some people are just better at pretending to be confident because nobody’s done ― nobody’s cooked.”Watch Nanjiani’s full commencement speech below."
42,POLITICS,Donald Trump Delays Final Decision On Paris Agreement Until Next Week,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-paris-g7_us_59297a30e4b0065b20b6d756,The White House could make the U.S. one of only three countries to reject the historic climate deal.,2017-05-27,World leaders have pressed President Donald Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate pact.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59297d531600002200ddd283.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House will decide next week on whether to remain in the Paris Agreement, the historic climate 2015 pact President Donald Trump vowed to withdraw from during his campaign last year.In an announcement harkening to a characteristically reality TV cliffhanger, the president teased his decision in a tweet on Saturday morning during a summit with the Group of 7 industrialized nations in Italy, where the U.S. clashed with European allies over climate and trade. Trump initially delayed the decision until after the G7 meeting, which ended on Saturday.European, Canadian and Chinese leaders have urged Trump to keep the U.S. in the accord. All but two countries ― Syria and Nicaragua ― signed the agreement committing to begin slashing planet-warming emissions. The accord is not legally binding. And even if every country reached its promised goals, the targets set out in the agreement would not prevent the Earth from warming beyond the 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, after which scientists predict the most catastrophic effects of climate change would become irreversible. But the United Nations-brokered deal marked the first time the world, including the U.S. and China, the biggest polluters by far, agreed to slash emissions with the intent of halting global warming.Still, Trump pledged to “cancel” the agreement during his openly nationalist presidential run last year, insisting multilateral deals like it were harmful to U.S. economic interests. In March, he ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to review the Clean Power Plan ― the only U.S. policy for cutting emissions from the electricity sector. Without this sweeping regulation, which puts limits on coal-fired power plants and encourages the proliferation of renewable energy, the U.S. won’t even come close to meeting its emissions goals.“It seems President Trump is seeking to build the kind of suspense that is usually reserved for reality shows,” Heather Coleman, climate and energy director at the charity giant Oxfam America, told HuffPost by email on Saturday morning. “Climate change is not a TV show, it is and will continue to have devastating consequences for all of us on this planet, especially the poorest and most vulnerable among us.”The White House has split over the future of the Paris Agreement. Like climate science itself, which Trump has dismissed as a “hoax”, the pact has overwhelming support. Sixty-one percent of Americans said the country should remain in the deal, while just 17 percent support withdrawing and 21 percent weren’t sure, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted last week. Already, more than 400 U.S. cities, 37 states, 800 universities and nearly half of all Fortune 500 companies have set clean energy and emissions targets. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and familial advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump back the deal. Big corporations, including coal, oil and gas companies, also support remaining in the agreement. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon want to pull out of the pact. Aside from the usual cadre of once-fringe climate science deniers, they are joined by a handful of House Republicans and at least three GOP senators.  Sources told HuffPost this month that Trump was leaning toward withdrawing. But since then, world and corporate leaders have increased pressure for the U.S. to remain in the deal. During his first visit to the Vatican this week, Pope Francis gave Trump a 184-page letter on climate change. In the president’s best-known business book The Art of the Deal, he outlines a strategy for negotiating based on making aggressive opening salvos. Vowing to withdraw could be an initial step toward reworking the Paris Agreement to get what his administration considers more favorable terms.  Pulling out of the agreement could have major economic consequences. The U.S. could lose jobs in a clean energy industry estimated to be worth $6 trillion by 2030. Countries could put a tariff on American-made imports. And investors could sour on the U.S. amid what they see as instability sown by sclerotic regulation of carbon emissions. The diplomatic ramifications could be worse. Quitting the deal could brand the nation as a “rogue country” and a “climate pariah” as it loses its seat at the negotiating table on global climate policy. Moreover, the U.S. risks ceding global influence to rival superpower China, which has already promised to support poorer countries’ efforts to adapt to climate change.“Trump has heard now very clearly from world leaders, CEOs, and even the Pope,” David Waskow, director of international climate policy for the World Resources Institute, told HuffPost by email. “It’s time for him to make the right decision.”"
43,POLITICS,New York’s Renegade Democrats Face Growing Calls To Rejoin Party Fold,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-renegade-democrats-idc-face-calls-to-rejoin-fold_us_5929ccbee4b0df57cbfbfc03,"Despite a Democratic majority in the state senate, Republicans control the upper chamber.",2017-05-27,"New York state Sen. Jeffrey Klein, leader of the Independent Democratic Conference, speaks at the Annual Endometriosis Foundation of America's Medical Conference on April 11, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5929cd0a200000290016f41b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"National Democratic leaders called on a group of breakaway Democrats in the New York state senate to split from Republicans after a special election upheld the party’s majority in the chamber.Democrats have 32 seats in the state senate, but eight senators in the Independent Democratic Conference have chosen to form a majority coalition with the Republicans. An additional senator who does not belong to the IDC, Simcha Felder, has chosen to caucus outright with Republicans. The defections have handed the GOP control of the chamber.Mainline senate Democrats have long prioritized the return of the IDC to the party fold because they say it would help win back Felder and allow Democrats to claim their rightful majority.What was unusual this week was just how many nationally prominent Democrats joined in these calls. The catalyzing event was Democrat Brian Benjamin’s victory Tuesday in a special election for a Harlem senate seat. The win restored Democrats’ numerical majority after a brief vacancy in the seat for a few months.Benjamin’s election gives New York “the opportunity to become the seventh state in the nation with a completely Democratic state government,” said Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in a statement. “To accomplish that, the Democratic Party, which stands for working families, must unite in New York and everywhere.”For years after an internal party dispute prompted the formation of the IDC in 2011, the breakaway faction lingered in relative obscurity. But since the November elections in which Democrats regained their numerical majority in the chamber, scrutiny on the IDC has grown. Perhaps more importantly, President Donald Trump’s victory energized the state’s progressive activists who were shocked to learn that Republicans control a legislative body in deep-blue New York due to an anomalous divide. Grassroots liberals have organized protests against the IDC’s eight members since January, which have at times drawn upwards of 100 people.New York state assemblyman Michael Blake, a DNC vice chair, emphasized the importance of Democratic state governments in blocking Trump’s agenda in a statement calling on the IDC and Felder to rejoin the mainstream party.“For New Yorkers to have policies that create jobs with better wages and promote equity in all that we do; for the good of the country that needs us united as a party, it is time for Sen. Simcha Felder and members of the Independent Democratic Conference to end their alliance with the GOP and rejoin the mainline State Senate Democratic Coalition,” Blake said.Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), another DNC vice chair, joined him in a separate statement. Meng also co-signed a letter from all 18 of New York’s Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives calling on all of the breakaway Democrats to “return to the Democratic Conference.”And the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democratic state legislators, called on the IDC specifically to rejoin the rest of the party following Benjamin’s election on Tuesday.On Monday, the IDC launched its own appeal for unity with a “Call the Roll” letter asking all 32 Senate Democrats to commit themselves to fight for seven “key progressive issues,” including single-payer health care, expanding abortion rights, and adopting public campaign financing.IDC spokeswoman Candice Giove referred HuffPost to “Call the Roll” in response to questions about the national pressure on the IDC.“Thirty two is not a magic number unless there are 32 Democrats who are ready to stand up and unite on policies that combat Donald Trump,” Giove said. “Until we achieve unity and stand up for women, immigrants, and the most vulnerable New Yorkers, all talk about a majority is nothing more than meaningless rhetoric on the part of failed leadership.”But for state Sen. Mike Gianaris, deputy leader of the 23-member mainline Democratic conference, the individual views of senators are besides the point.“They are giving power to the Republicans to decide whether those issues get brought up at all,” he said. “Things that do get done, get done much later than they should or get watered down.”Gianaris considers recent legislation raising New York’s age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 an example of the latter.Until the reform passed in April, New York had been one of just two states to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. But as the result of compromises with the Republicans who control the senate, the new legislation would still require those charged with nonviolent felonies to begin their case in criminal court. After 30 days, they would automatically be sent to family court unless the district attorney demonstrates that there are “extraordinary circumstances” that require them to stay in criminal court.And New Yorkers at those ages accused of violent felonies would have to meet three criteria assessing the severity of the crime before they could proceed.The limitations of the “Raise the Age” legislation rankle many progressive Senate Democrats, including Gianaris, who maintains that a simpler increase would have been possible without Republican Senate control.Giove pointed to civil rights advocates’ praise for the role of the IDC and its leader, Sen. Jeffrey Klein, in helping broker the deal that ensured the legislation’s passage.“Senator Klein and the IDC deserve enormous credit for their exceptional leadership in this effort,” said Judge Jonathan Lippman, former Chief Judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, in a statement at the time.Mainline Democrats accuse the IDC of allying with Republicans because of the power it gives them as a crucial lynchpin in giving the Republicans a governing majority. Some of the perks are quite literal. Senate Republicans have distributed generous financial stipends normally reserved for committee chairs to IDC members who serve on these committees as well, often as the second-highest ranking member. New York’s attorney general and the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn have opened investigations into the legality of the practice since The New York Times first reported it this month.The IDC members are quick to note that even if they rejoined the mainline Democratic Party, it would still not have a majority unless Simcha Felder caucused with the party as well.In a Wednesday letter to IDC leader Klein, Felder lashed out at the IDC’s “Call the Roll” initiative.“Although I am no longer a practicing CPA, it would make more sense for your 25 percent [of Democrats] to rejoin the rest of the Democrats, rather than everyone else join you and support issues you deem a priority,” he wrote. “Who are you to decide what the legislative priorities are for loyal Democrats across New York State?”Felder went on to ask the IDC to “publicly unite” with Democrats, if they “truly seek unity.” He stopped short of promising to join them if they did so, claiming only that he would “welcome unity if it effectuates my priority to have the greatest positive impact on my constituents and all New Yorkers.”“It’s telling that Simcha Felder didn’t sign the pledge,” Giove said, referring to the “Call the Roll” letter. “We now see where he stands on these seven crucial issues.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that the IDC caucuses with Republicans, whereas it merely provides the Republican Party with the votes needed to form a majority. Legislators who caucus together participate in the same conference meetings, and IDC members and Senate Republicans do not."

Knowing the president’s receptivity to flattery, the Saudis pulled out all the stops and gave Trump a red-carpet welcome, a horse-borne escort on his trip to the royal palace and a lavish party that included a traditional sword dance.For his part, Trump announced the completion of a massive deal to sell Saudi Arabia U.S. weapons, and in his remarks made it plain that he wasn’t interested so much in human rights in the region so long as leaders joined the U.S.-led fight against Islamist terrorism. It was a message the region’s autocratic leaders were pleased to hear following eight years of criticism on the issue from Obama.His next stop, in Jerusalem, was still friendly territory for him. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had a chilly relationship with Obama, welcomed Trump as a true friend to Israel.Things started going downhill for Trump, though, in Rome. For the first time, there were protests against him, albeit not very large, thanks to the mayor whose party leader, Beppe Grillo, admires Trump. And although the White House got the Vatican audience it wanted, Pope Francis’ dour facial expressions likely were not the images it had hoped for.Those first three stops, though, was largely ceremonial – added relatively late as a way to emphasize Trump’s respect for the three Abrahamic religions. It was the long-scheduled meetings in Brussels, Belgium, and Taormina, Italy, where both Trump’s message and delivery left raw feelings.At the unveiling of a memorial at NATO headquarters to the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, Trump used the occasion to scorch America’s military allies for failing to spend as much on defense in recent years as Trump would have wanted. In his view, their failure to do so unfairly burdened U.S. taxpayers – an opinion other NATO members do not share, a sentiment made clear by their facial expressions as he spoke.(Trump then generated unflattering headlines for himself by shoving aside the leader of Montenegro, NATO’s newest member, so he could take his assigned spot for a group photo, and, later, by reportedly calling Germany “bad” for selling so many cars in the United States.)Finally, at the G-7 meeting of the world’s largest democratically run economies, Trump would not commit to honor the United States’ participation in the 2015 agreement to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to slow climate change, which the other six nations badly wanted the world’s largest economy to remain part of. Even as Trump deferred a decision on that point, he continued complaints that the United States is running trade deficits with European nations.“The president does not like having large trade deficits,” top economic adviser Gary Cohn said at a news conference at the close of the summit.Trump personally did not participate in any news conferences at all during the trip, and only took the occasional shouted question from reporters. The decision may have been based on the continued stream of news reports from Washington during his overseas jaunt about the ongoing FBI investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russia.Both Cohn and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster refused to take questions about the latest Russia-related news report alleging Trump son-in-law and top aide Jared Kushner had discussed setting up a secret back channel with Russia during the transition period."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5929b1231600002100ddd2d6.jpeg?cache=XR1UnNy0gi&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Adrian Smith (R-Neb.) refused to say whether “every American is entitled to eat” and the food stamps program is the best way to ensure that they have the food they need.NPR’s Scott Simon interviewed Smith on Saturday about the farm bill and President Donald Trump’s proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. In the president’s budget, the White House is seeking $193 billion in cuts to SNAP over 10 years, an amount equal to more than one-quarter of the program’s cost over that period.There is room for “very minor shifts” in SNAP that “make sure we do not harm the most vulnerable among us,” according to Smith.“Especially for people in need we do not want to leave our most vulnerable without nutrition,” he said. “Looking at that, we always want to keep that in mind.”But Simon pressed Smith on his views about the program’s underlying philosophy.“Let me ask you this bluntly: Is every American entitled to eat?” he asked.“Well, nutrition obviously we know is very important and I would hope that we can look to ―” Smith began.“Well, not just important, it’s essential for life,” Simon interjected.Smith conceded that nutrition is essential to life.“So is every American entitled to eat and is food stamps something that ought to be that ultimate guarantor?” Simon persisted.“I think we know that given the necessity of nutrition, there could be a number of ways that we could address that,” Smith answered.As Smith later observed, a president’s budget is merely a set of suggestions that reflect the president’s fiscal priorities. It is up to Congress to allot the funds for federal programs. The president can then sign or veto budget legislation they craft.Smith refused to rule out reductions in SNAP spending as part of that process, however.“I want to look at our entire budget, look at all of the details,” he said.Roughly 43 million low-income Americans receive SNAP benefits, which are vouchers to buy food. Enrollment has dropped significantly since 2014 due to improvement in the economy.Mick Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has claimed there are people receiving benefits who do not need them given how long ago the recession was.The administration has not been clear about its intentions for the means-tested aid program, though. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, whose department oversees SNAP, has defended SNAP’s performance and claimed that it will be up to Congress to decide how much it wants to reduce the program’s spending."

Landrieu’s speech went viral.As the country grows ever more cynical, divided and partisan, we’re not used to honesty and courage from our leaders. Seeing a politician stand up for what he or she believes is the right thing is increasingly rare.Political discourse and civic life has so devolved in 2017 that a man charged with physical assault, Republican Greg Gianforte, was elected to Congress Thursday in Montana with the backing and full support of his party. Just the day before, Gianforte, a self-made tech millionaire, wrapped his hands around the neck of a reporter, threw him to the ground, and repeatedly punched him for asking a question. Comparing a longtime politician in Louisiana (Landrieu comes from a political family and is a former lieutenant governor) to an upstart businessman-cum-politician may seem like a stretch. But these two men make a neat case study on the state of ethics and integrity in 2017.These days the public no longer expects leaders to do what’s right. We’ve grown accustomed to name-calling and carefully crafted milquetoast middle-of-the-road statements. We’re used to lying, and we expect leaders to put party and their own careers before all else.“Norms have shifted,” said Gautam Mukunda, the author of Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter and a professor at Harvard Business School. “We expect leaders to be bad, and people live up to what you expect of them. We’ve created a self-fulfilling prophecy of bad behavior and it is profound.” To many Americans, politics is either a massive conspiracy, a “House of Cards” dystopia, or a playground for craven buffoons, a la “Veep.” We are no longer surprised as we witness leaders live up to these expectations, lying about meeting with foreign agents, changing their stories, and blaming everyone but themselves when things go wrong. You could see footprints of our lower standards all over the Gianforte incident. Instead of apologizing for his naked act of aggression, Gianforte initially released a statement blaming the reporter, Ben Jacobs of The Guardian. “It’s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,” the statement read.Worse, the statement was false. It claimed Jacobs shoved the microphone in Gianforte’s face and refused to lower it after being asked, but audio and witness accounts from a Fox News crew refuted the claims.Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan gamely admitted what Gianforte did was wrong, and called on him to apologize, but he also said would support his election if that’s what the people of Montana wanted. Of course, we can’t actually know what the people in Montana thought of the assault. A majority of voters cast their ballots before the body-slam.It’s easy to imagine a different politician simply stepping out of the race in the face of such an incident. Remember when Howard Dean appeared to scream in one speech and it doomed his entire bid for the presidential nomination?Some conservative pundits tried to spin the assault this week as a good thing: “Gianforte, the manly and studly candidate, threw the 125-pound wet dishrag reporter from The Guardian to the ground,” Rush Limbaugh said of the incident, according to an online transcript of his show posted on his website. Laura Ingraham, while gamely allowing that politicians should stay cool in such situations, also tried to cast Jacobs as wimpy for not fighting back. What “would most Montana men do if ‘body slammed’ for no reason by another man?” she asked in a tweet.As is too often the case in 2017, partisanship blinded us from even distinguishing right from wrong. The increasing divide between right and left and the intensely personal way each side attacks the other means that even ethics are now partisan. Republicans and Democrats call each other “bad” or “evil,” and there is often no higher playing field where everyone agrees to nonpartisan standards and values (don’t hit people, don’t lie, etc.). “I don’t think Obama was perfect, but it’s hard to imagine more of a straight-arrow person. Not a hint of scandal,” Mukunda said. Yet somehow half of America just didn’t it see it that way. People who disagree with his politics won’t typically acknowledge that he acted with respect for the office. “You don’t hear a lot of that,” Mukunda said.Yet at the same time, people are hungry for heroes ― men and women with humility who will stand up for what’s right. When former acting Attorney General Sally Yates refused to enforce President Donald Trump’s travel ban because she believed it was unconstitutional, many people found it thrilling. When Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) criticizes the Trump administration for its failings, he’s lauded.Indeed, we need people like this to set examples, Mukunda says. “The extent that we have culturally deprived people of that is troubling.”It’s also highly dysfunctional. Integrity is the bedrock of a properly functioning organization, Joseph Badaracco told HuffPost recently. Badaracco has been teaching an introductory course in ethics, leadership and accountability to Harvard Business School students for the past decade. He defines integrity as a consistency between what you believe, say and do. “It all hangs together,” he said. “There’s a way in which integrity shouldn’t be newsworthy ― we assume it, rely on it and count on it,” Badaracco said. “It’s not exactly like obeying the laws of gravity, but we ought to be able to assume it’s there.”The ability to know what’s right and follow through on it with conviction isn’t something Badaracco believes can really be taught to people by the time they reach Harvard Business School. “We don’t teach people how to have integrity. Or even teach the importance of it,” he says. “If someone doesn’t understand that, they have a deficiency in their education or development and we can’t remedy that.” Badaracco says his focus is on making hard decisions. The grey areas. “Not right versus wrong where a person with integrity will know what’s right,” he explains. “But right versus right where it’s not really clear.” But civil discourse has devolved from this graduate-school-level thinking. Americans elected Trump, a man whose most original thinking seems to come through in his creative penchant for name-calling. Many mistook Trump’s plainspoken manner for authenticity, and perhaps conflated this with honesty and integrity.These are not the same things. "

We’re used to lying, and we expect leaders to put party and their own careers before all else.“Norms have shifted,” said Gautam Mukunda, the author of Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter and a professor at Harvard Business School. “We expect leaders to be bad, and people live up to what you expect of them. We’ve created a self-fulfilling prophecy of bad behavior and it is profound.” To many Americans, politics is either a massive conspiracy, a “House of Cards” dystopia, or a playground for craven buffoons, a la “Veep.” We are no longer surprised as we witness leaders live up to these expectations, lying about meeting with foreign agents, changing their stories, and blaming everyone but themselves when things go wrong. You could see footprints of our lower standards all over the Gianforte incident. Instead of apologizing for his naked act of aggression, Gianforte initially released a statement blaming the reporter, Ben Jacobs of The Guardian. “It’s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,” the statement read.Worse, the statement was false. It claimed Jacobs shoved the microphone in Gianforte’s face and refused to lower it after being asked, but audio and witness accounts from a Fox News crew refuted the claims.Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan gamely admitted what Gianforte did was wrong, and called on him to apologize, but he also said would support his election if that’s what the people of Montana wanted. Of course, we can’t actually know what the people in Montana thought of the assault. A majority of voters cast their ballots before the body-slam.It’s easy to imagine a different politician simply stepping out of the race in the face of such an incident. Remember when Howard Dean appeared to scream in one speech and it doomed his entire bid for the presidential nomination?Some conservative pundits tried to spin the assault this week as a good thing: “Gianforte, the manly and studly candidate, threw the 125-pound wet dishrag reporter from The Guardian to the ground,” Rush Limbaugh said of the incident, according to an online transcript of his show posted on his website. Laura Ingraham, while gamely allowing that politicians should stay cool in such situations, also tried to cast Jacobs as wimpy for not fighting back. What “would most Montana men do if ‘body slammed’ for no reason by another man?” she asked in a tweet.As is too often the case in 2017, partisanship blinded us from even distinguishing right from wrong. The increasing divide between right and left and the intensely personal way each side attacks the other means that even ethics are now partisan. Republicans and Democrats call each other “bad” or “evil,” and there is often no higher playing field where everyone agrees to nonpartisan standards and values (don’t hit people, don’t lie, etc.). “I don’t think Obama was perfect, but it’s hard to imagine more of a straight-arrow person. Not a hint of scandal,” Mukunda said. Yet somehow half of America just didn’t it see it that way. People who disagree with his politics won’t typically acknowledge that he acted with respect for the office. “You don’t hear a lot of that,” Mukunda said.Yet at the same time, people are hungry for heroes ― men and women with humility who will stand up for what’s right. When former acting Attorney General Sally Yates refused to enforce President Donald Trump’s travel ban because she believed it was unconstitutional, many people found it thrilling. When Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) criticizes the Trump administration for its failings, he’s lauded.Indeed, we need people like this to set examples, Mukunda says. “The extent that we have culturally deprived people of that is troubling.”It’s also highly dysfunctional. Integrity is the bedrock of a properly functioning organization, Joseph Badaracco told HuffPost recently. Badaracco has been teaching an introductory course in ethics, leadership and accountability to Harvard Business School students for the past decade. He defines integrity as a consistency between what you believe, say and do. “It all hangs together,” he said. “There’s a way in which integrity shouldn’t be newsworthy ― we assume it, rely on it and count on it,” Badaracco said. “It’s not exactly like obeying the laws of gravity, but we ought to be able to assume it’s there.”The ability to know what’s right and follow through on it with conviction isn’t something Badaracco believes can really be taught to people by the time they reach Harvard Business School. “We don’t teach people how to have integrity. Or even teach the importance of it,” he says. “If someone doesn’t understand that, they have a deficiency in their education or development and we can’t remedy that.” Badaracco says his focus is on making hard decisions. The grey areas. “Not right versus wrong where a person with integrity will know what’s right,” he explains. “But right versus right where it’s not really clear.” But civil discourse has devolved from this graduate-school-level thinking. Americans elected Trump, a man whose most original thinking seems to come through in his creative penchant for name-calling. Many mistook Trump’s plainspoken manner for authenticity, and perhaps conflated this with honesty and integrity.These are not the same things. "

He was 69.He “passed away peacefully at his home in Savannah, Georgia,” according to a statement on Allman’s official website. “Gregg struggled with many health issues over the past several years. During that time, Gregg considered being on the road playing music with his brothers and solo band for his beloved fans, essential medicine for his soul. Playing music lifted him up and kept him going during the toughest of times.”Allman was born on Dec. 8, 1947, in Nashville. He, along with his brother Duane, helped to create one of the most successful classic rock bands of all time. With that came not just music, but drugs, women and ― at times ― tragedy, including the early death of Duane.In his later years, Allman developed hepatitis C, and suffered from an irregular heartbeat and a respiratory infection and had to have a liver transplant. In 2017, he canceled a planned summer tour, sparking worries about his health. Allman was born to Willis Allman, a WWII veteran who stormed Normandy Beach, came back to his bride after the war, and had two sons. His father’s life was cut short when Gregg was just 2 years old. After Willis Allman offered a stranger a ride home from a bar one night, the man fatally shot him in the back.Neither Gregg nor Duane showed any interest in emulating their father’s military career. The boys hated the military school their mother sent them to, but found their footing in music while there, according to Rolling Stone.“I learned to play mostly from black people,” Allman told The Guardian in 2015. “We used to listen to a station that called itself ‘The black spot on your dial.’ It played Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, and it hit Duane and me like spaghetti hitting a wall.”By the time the Allman Brothers Band was formed in 1969, Gregg and Duane were legitimate country hippies ― long-haired, drug-smoking free-loving spirits. Duane played guitar, with Gregg on vocals. Other founding members of the band included drummers “Butch” Trucks and Jai “Jaimoe” Johnny Johnson, along with “Dickey” Betts on guitar and Berry Oakley on bass.The Allman Brothers Band blended country, jazz, blues and Southern rock in such seamless riffs, pounding drums and twangy vocals that it earned them a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and a Lifetime Achievement award at the Grammys in 2012. The movie “Almost Famous” was also, in part, inspired by the band.The Allman Brothers Band produced their biggest hits in the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, including “Ramblin’ Man,” “Midnight Rider” and “Whipping Post.” During this time, the band experimented heavily with drugs and attracted many groupies on tour.“Gregg was just a pretty boy,” drummer Butch Trucks told Rolling Stone in 1999. “He had blond hair, and the girls were hanging all over him.”In his book My Cross To Bear, Gregg bragged about his sexual exploits.“I would have women in four or five different rooms,” Allman wrote about staying in hotels while on tour. “Mind you, I wouldn’t lie to anybody; I’d just say, ‘I’ll be right back.’”During those earlier years, he and his bandmates were also experimenting with drugs, including (but not limited to) PCP, cocaine and speed. The band loved psychedelic mushrooms so much, they made them their unofficial logo and tattooed a mushroom on each of their calves, according to Rolling Stone.In 1971, just as the band found itself being propelled into stardom, Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident. He was 24.“Duane was the king of laughter, always making jokes,” Gregg Allman told The Guardian in 2015. “You’ve got to keep laughing. It was what Duane would have done, and wanted us to do.”At Duane’s funeral, Gregg played songs on his older brother’s antique guitar.“This is a very old guitar, a very beautiful piece,” he said to a crowd of 300. “It was made in 1920 and I’m very proud to have it. And I’m very proud that you all came.”In 1975, Allman married singer Cher in Las Vegas. The marriage lasted nine days, ending after Allman allegedly pulled a knife on her while trying to score heroin. They reconciled after learning Cher was pregnant with their son, Elijah Blue.In 1977, Cher divorced Allman for good. The final straw was reportedly at an awards show, when Allman passed out face-first in a plate of spaghetti.“Every now and then,” Allman wrote in his 2012 memoir, “I’ll think of all the hell I caused other people over the years.” Allman eventually embraced sobriety. “I’m doing great,” Allman told the Savannah Morning News in 2013. “I’ve been clean and sober for 19 years.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story gave the wrong year of Allman’s birth. Language has also been changed regarding Allman’s role in “Ramblin’ Man.”"

He’s been in prison, he’s always been spouting anti-establishment stuff but he’s a nice person I just can’t imagine.” Officers detained Christian soon after he got off the train, police said. They were unable to interview the women, however, as they’d already left the area.Police booked Christian into the Multnomah County Jail early Saturday. Along with the aggravated murder charges, he faces two counts of intimidation in the second degree, one of attempted murder and one count of being a felon in possession of a restricted weapon.Christian has previously been convicted for felony robbery, kidnapping and possession of weapons. He will be arraigned in Multnomah County Court on Tuesday, where he may face additional charges, authorities say.Police said Saturday they were familiar with Christian from previous encounters but did not consider him a threat to public safety at the time. The investigation is looking into Christian’s “extremist ideology,” but a spokesman also noted that Christian had not been flagged as a member of a criminal gang. His ties to white supremacy include attending local rallies, according to authorities. On April 29, police confiscated a baseball bat from him at a “March for Free Speech” rally, after which he screamed racial epithets and gave the Nazi salute throughout the day, the Portland Mercury reports.The Willamette Week identified him as being the man in the American flag in the below video:Police have determined he has no history of mental health issues. Christian’s mother told HuffPost that she doesn’t believe he is mentally ill.The Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement in response to the attack Friday calling on President Donald Trump to speak out against anti-Muslim incidents, which it said had increased more than 50 percent in the U.S. from 2015 to 2016.“President Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities,” said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. “Only a strong statement from the nation’s leader will send a message to bigots that such acts of violence targeting racial, ethnic or religious minorities are unacceptable.”Trump’s administration may be moving in the opposite direction on white nationalism, however. Muslim advocacy groups and a program that works to rehabilitate neo-Nazis may lose funding if Trump narrows the focus of the Countering Violent Extremism grant program to Islamic extremism. As it stood under the Obama administration, groups dedicated to help combat Islamophobia and other hate group at home shared millions in funding, alongside groups that deterred recruitment by Islamic terrorist groups.Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler paid tribute to the train victims for “doing the right thing, standing up for people they didn’t know against hatred.” “Their actions were brave and selfless, and should serve as an example and inspiration to us all,” he said in a Facebook post. “They are heroes.”TriMet, the transit provider in the Portland region, confirmed there would be delays following the incident and issued messages of condolences over the deaths:Police said the Oregon State Medical Examiner would conduct autopsies on the two men on Saturday morning. They will release the names of the three victims soon after, they added.This article has been updated throughout."

It is widely believed that the deformed feet, which were placed in small embroidered shoes, would attract a better husband. A new study suggests feet were bound for another reason.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59285025200000290016f1de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chinese foot-binding is perceived today as unusual, gruesome, an antiquated fetish, an erotic tradition. For decades in China, young girls’ bones were broken and their feet tightly bound in a painful process that would eventually make them appear more desirable to men, according to historians. Their deformed feet, known as lotus feet, were tucked into embroidered shoes and viewed as delicate and dainty. It was a way to show off their social status. It was, at the time, chic.One study, however, suggests that there was another reason girls were subjected to the practice ― and it wasn’t all about beauty or sex.Research published in the book Bound Feet, Young Hands suggests that some women’s feet had been bound at a very young age so they could be trained to sit still for hours and help create textiles and clothing for the family.“What’s groundbreaking about our work is that [foot-binding was] not confined to the elite,” Laurel Bossen, the book’s co-author, told HuffPost. The study, Bossen added, dispels the view that the goal was only to try to please men.To uncover this little-known history of foot-binding, Bossen and the book’s co-author, researcher Hill Gates, interviewed over 1,800 elderly women in remote villages across China and found that foot-binding was widespread among peasant populations, shattering the belief that foot-binding was a status symbol of the elite.All the women surveyed were born when foot-binding was still an accepted tradition. It’s unclear when the practice began exactly, but Bossen believes foot-binding in China goes back as far as 1,000 years.“As the last generation of these foot-bound women disappears, we fortunately managed to interview many of them,” Bossen told HuffPost. “There is no other body of data based on interviews with foot-bound women that is as comprehensive as this. It was really a last chance to do it.”The type of foot-binding practiced in rural communities was a form of discipline, the book argues. Mothers bound young girls’ feet so they would stay still and work with their hands, creating yarn and spinning thread, among other things, which families could use or sell.“Women who bound their daughters’ feet had their own interests in controlling the labor of young girls and young women,” she said. “We reject the view that women were exempted from work, treasuring their precious bound feet and not economically important. They developed hand skills and worked with their hands throughout their lives.”These new findings, Bossen believes, prove that women in rural areas who had bound feet didn’t get the recognition they deserved.“Chinese women were contributing more to society than they received credit for,” she said of the rural women with bound feet. “They were making very important contributions in the form of textiles [that have] been undervalued and mostly just forgotten.”And while this new research suggests that this painful practice wasn’t solely for men’s desire, it doesn’t make the practice any less oppressive.Bossen explained, “It robbed young girls and then women throughout their lives of their ability to do other things, to move around and play, to have more choices. Of course it’s oppressive.”The practice of foot-binding began to be banned in the early 20th century, though some women, like those interviewed by Bossen, kept their feet bound their entire lives. Bossen believes the stories of the women she interviewed might have gotten lost in history as their generation passed away. Still, Bossen and Gates’ book doesn’t deny that “lotus feet” were created to make a woman appear more desirable. Accounts written by feet-bound women in 19th century China, published by the University of Virginia, show that women often believed the tighter the foot-binding, the better the husband they’d attract. The research does, however, show that these women were more than just sexualized objects. They worked hard to contribute to their families and to the larger society.“We often underestimate how important handwork was in China’s pre-industrial economy,” she told HuffPost. “The intense pressure on women to work with their hands, to spin, weave, sew, and stitch cloth, bedding and textile products for their families and for sale has gone unrecognized.”Their research, Bossen added, aims to look at the whole woman and not just her bound feet.“Somehow, people have been so fascinated by the feet that they ignored the rest of the woman and what she did,” she said.“It’s very rare to find people who notice the role of handwork in the lives of foot-bound women or who ask these elderly women what work they did when they were young girls.”"

58,POLITICS,New Republican Bill Makes Suing Cops For Civil Rights Violations Really Tough,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-republican-bill-makes-suing-cops-for-civil-rights-violations-really-tough_us_59287e16e4b053f2d2ac6dcd,The Back the Blue Act would also make it a federal crime to assault or kill a police officer.,2017-05-26,Sen. John Cornyn speaks during a news conference in Captiol Hill. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59287e59150000470015ba4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A pair of bills introduced in the House and the Senate would make assaulting law enforcement officers a federal offense and suing cops for civil rights violations more difficult. Under the Back the Blue Act, introduced on May 16 by Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) in the Senate and Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) in the House, suing cops in federal court for violating the constitutional rights of civilians will be limited.The bill introduced in the Senate states that individuals who were “engaged in felonies or crimes of violence” would be blocked from receiving damages for any violations that occurred during “any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in the judicial capacity of that officer.” So, even if the individual can prove their rights were violated by an officer, police departments would be able to claim an individual’s injuries were a result of that person’s conduct which, to quote the bill, “more likely than not, constituted a felony or a crime of violence.”It would also treat assault on a police officer leading to bodily harm as a federal crime carrying a mandatory minimum of two to 10 years in prison, depending on if the harm was minor, “substantial” or “serious.” If a weapon was used during the assault, the charge would carry a 20 year mandatory minimum regardless of the harm inflicted on the officer. Both caveats would have brash consequences for civilians ― particularly black and Latinx people who tend to have more unnecessary contact with law enforcement. For instance, an officer could justify their use of excessive force by charging someone with felony assault ― an issue explained by HuffPost in January regarding Louisiana’s law that made attacks on police a “hate crime.”It could also have an impact on political demonstrations. For example if a police officer attempts to restrain a protester and that person makes a movement the officer interprets as threatening, a minor trespassing or disturbing the peace charge could be upgraded to assault.But in light of the new bill, a civilian, regardless of whether or not they were “engaged in felonies,” could be hit with a federal charge and possible federal prison time without the option to seek damages for a civil rights violation. The proposed law would also make it a federal offense to murder, attempt to murder or conspiring to murder a federal judge, a first responder or a state or local law enforcement official who works for any agency that receives federal funding. And almost all law enforcement agencies ― including local police departments ― receive federal funding.Defendants, if found guilty, would face the federal death penalty and a mandatory minimum of 30 years in federal prison.The bill also mandates that no more than $20 million be granted to local law enforcement agencies so that they can “promote trust and ensure legitimacy” with the communities they serve. If passed, the bill could be legally redundant. All 50 states have statutes, or “aggravating factors,” that automatically increase the penalties for violent attacks on law enforcement officers, according to the Anti-Defamation League. And Louisiana and Kentucky have made violent attacks on police a hate crime in the past year. Cornyn and Poe both introduced the same bill last year. Cornyn has said the bill was a way of showing “unparalleled support” to law enforcement.“Law enforcement officers selflessly put their lives on the line everyday to protect our communities, and in return they deserve our unparalleled support for the irreplaceable role they serve,” Cornyn told The Dallas Morning News last year. “The Back the Blue Act sends a clear message that our criminal justice system simply will not tolerate those who viciously and deliberately target our law enforcement.”Poe has made similar comments.Cornyn and Poe’s offices did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.The 2016 bills didn’t pass, but the political climate was different. Former President Barack Obama’s administration focused on sentencing reforms and prosecutors placing crimes into context when deciding on prison time. Obama was also vocal about the need to reform police departments and better their relationship with the communities they serve. President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has vowed to be harder on crime and end what he calls the “anti-police atmosphere” in the U.S. Trump has said protests against widely-publicized police violence has provoked the murder of police officers and that calls for reform are “anti-law enforcement.” He also believes that calls for police accountability have caused a “war on cops.” A May 10 memo from current Attorney General Jeff Sessions reversed Obama’s policy, mandating that federal prosecutors “charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense” possible against defendants charged with a federal crime. The memo also requires federal prosecutors to get approval from the U.S. Attorney or an assistant Attorney General if they wish to pursue a lesser charge. The Back the Blue Act, if passed, would take prosecutorial aggressiveness a step further. Currently, any attacks on law enforcement are handled by state and local jurisdictions. This would continue under the law unless the U.S. attorney doesn’t like the way a case is being handled, which could pose an issue since many jurisdictions have elected district attorneys looking to reform criminal sentencing laws and police departments. As criminal justice reporter Radley Balko explained in The Washington Post: In a few places, such as Philadelphia, Chicago and Houston, the new DAs were elected specifically after campaigning on policing issues, or in response to a past incumbent’s inattention to police abuse. If this bill passes, a U.S. attorney more sympathetic to law enforcement could thwart those efforts by, for example, charging a high-profile victim of police abuse with the new federal crime of assaulting a police officer. It wouldn’t be difficult. We’ve seen plenty of video now where a clear victim of police brutality was initially arrested and charged with battering one of the officers who beat him. If the new bill were to go into effect, federal prosecutors would have full discretion to overrule a state or local court if “the verdict or sentence obtained pursuant to State charges left demonstratively unvindicated the Federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence” or if “a prosecution by the United States is in the public interest and necessary to secure substantial justice.”"

Gianforte capitalized on the president's popularity in Montana.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5927a81d200000290016f029.jpeg?cache=yUexAOpkjL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Greg Gianforte’s triumph in Montana’s special House election on Thursday spoiled the plans of Democrats hoping for a major symbolic victory against President Donald Trump. But Montana, where the president remains broadly popular, was always a dubious place to harness the energy of the anti-Trump backlash.In fact, having Trump in the White House was almost certainly an advantage for Gianforte, who staved off a challenge from Democrat Rob Quist, a folk musician, by some 7 percentage points despite allegedly manhandling a reporter on the eve of the election.Trump won Montana by more than 20 percentage points in November. And Ryan Zinke was reelected to the House seat by 16 points. (Trump tapped him as interior secretary, triggering the special election.)In that same election, Gianforte ran for governor against incumbent Democrat Steve Bullock. He lost to Bullock by 4 points, notwithstanding Trump and Zinke’s big wins.This time around, Gianforte played the Trump card whenever he could, calculating that if the election were a referendum on the president, he would actually stand to gain more than if it were not.Speaking to voters at a campaign event in April, Gianforte framed his candidacy explicitly as an opportunity to support the president’s agenda.“Does the Trump train pick up speed or do we put on the brakes?” he said. And Gianforte welcomed the support of the White House and associated figures. His most prominent campaign surrogates were the president’s eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., who visited the state twice to campaign for Gianforte; Vice President Mike Pence, who also came out to stump for the candidate; and the commander-in-chief himself, who recorded a last-minute robocall for the campaign. “The lesson here, and I think frankly even around the country, is that it’s too soon for there to be a backlash,” said Jacquie Helt, a vice chair of the Montana Democratic Party and the state director of the Service Employees International Union. “It takes a while. People want to dance with who brung them,” Helt added, referring to her fellow Montana voters. “They also, I think, are reluctant to admit that they made a mistake.”Given that reality, Quist rarely focused on Trump as an individual, or the mounting scandals surrounding the alleged ties of his campaign associates to Russia.He instead mounted a populist bid to paint Gianforte as an out-of-touch “New Jersey billionaire,” whose 2009 lawsuit against the state seeking to restrict public access to a river adjacent to his property made him a less reliable guardian of Montana’s public lands. (Gianforte made his first fortune as a tech entrepreneur in New Jersey, before moving to Montana in the 1990s.)In the campaign’s final weeks, Quist took full advantage of Gianforte’s murky stance on the unpopular Obamacare repeal bill that the House passed. The Democrat repeatedly slammed Gianforte for telling lobbyists in private that he was “thankful” for the bill’s passage, even as he declined to stake out a position on it in public. He even devoted his closing ads to the threat Gianforte would pose to Montanans with preexisting conditions.Jorge Quintana, a Montana Democratic National Committee member and veteran of Democratic politics in the state, credited Quist’s campaign for keeping the loss margin so close.“We’re only five months into his administration. Trump won the state by 20 points,” he said. “Tonight, Quist, a brand-new candidate who has no experience in this, came up seven points short.” Another factor working against Quist was that Gianforte’s most damaging moment ― the now-infamous “body-slamming” of Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs ― occurred on the eve of the election, when more than two-thirds of the votes had already been cast through absentee ballots.Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault over the incident.In an audio recording of the altercation, Jacobs asks Gianforte about his position on the health care bill in a polite tone. The tape then cuts to the sound of a loud scuffle in which Gianforte can be heard berating the journalist as a frazzled Jacobs says that the Republican “body-slammed” him and broke his glasses.The account of a Fox News reporter who saw the incident corroborates Jacobs’ version of events, adding in graphic detail how Gianforte had taken the reporter down with his hands on his neck and proceeded to punch him. Gianforte initially denied wrongdoing, but during his victory speech on Thursday night, apologized for his behavior.Earlier on Thursday, rumors coursed throughout the state that many Montanans who had already voted for Gianforte were having buyer’s remorse.Derek Oestreicher, the director of Montana’s elections and voter services and a political appointee of the Republican secretary of state Corey Stapleton, estimated that his office had received roughly a dozen inquiries from voters interested in changing their votes on Thursday morning. He got more questions from reporters interested in knowing whether voters had sought to change their ballots than actual voter requests, however.A fiery debate has predictably erupted over whether Quist could have overcome even these disadvantages with earlier help from the party.Although Quist raised sizable funds on his own, he got crushed in outside spending. Republican political action committees spent $5.6 million on behalf of Gianforte and against Quist, compared with just $700,000 spent by outside groups trying to elect the Democrat, according to an analysis by Roll Call. In March and early April in particular, Republican groups were able to tie Quist to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and attack his financial peccadilloes with a limited response from the Democratic side.The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect House Democrats, virtually ignored the race until the middle of April. It eventually injected a total of $600,000 in the race, a fraction of the sum it has spent on a special election in Georgia’s 6th congressional district, where the party believes that filmmaker Jon Ossoff has a clearer path to victory.“Seats like this are winnable ― but only if we get in early, organize and fight to win,” said Charles Chamberlain, executive director of the progressive organization Democracy for America, in a statement reacting to the election results.Other critics were less subtle.As for the Democratic National Committee, chairman Tom Perez took over the party body less than two weeks before Quist secured the Democratic nomination. Under his leadership, the DNC ultimately mobilized its email list to raise funds for Quist and ended up sending a staffer to assist with digital efforts. Quintana, a voting member of the DNC who backed Perez’s candidacy for chair, defended the body’s role in the race.“The DNC did everything the campaign asked it to do,” he said. “It would have been nice if the DCCC had gotten in earlier and harder. We’re used to being outspent here.”In a public memo on “key takeaways” from the Montana race, DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly wrote that “within weeks of the nominating convention, the DCCC took a chance on underdog Rob Quist ― who was doing all the right things in his campaign ― and invested to help him achieve parity on television.”“Unfortunately, after weeks of parity, the head-to-head numbers simply did not move, according to multiple data sets before and after the investments,” Kelly said.This article has been updated with comment from Meredith Kelly."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greg-gianforte-gop-wins-montana_us_5925fda5e4b061d8f81efde9,Democrats had hoped Montanans would send a signal of discontent with President Trump,2017-05-26,Montana Democrat Rob Quist speaks to supporters earlier this week in Great Falls. His hard-fought House campaign fell short of victory on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5925fe9a2000004700cb2832.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Greg Gianforte overcame an election eve assault charge filed against him that sparked national attention, defeating Democrat Rob Quist in the race for Montana’s open U.S. House seat Thursday.Gianforte received 50.2 percent to Quist’s 44.1 percent. Libertarian Mark Wicks picked up 5.7 percent of the vote.The result is a major disappointment for progressive activists who poured money into the campaign to help Quist, a banjo-playing songwriter and political newcomer, in a bid to notch a symbolically important win against President Donald Trump.“Your voices were definitely heard in this election,” Quist told supporters after the results were final. “I know we came up short, but the energy in the state and the grassroots movement in the state goes on.”The defeat is especially demoralizing for Democrats in light of the misdemeanor assault charge against Gianforte, a multimillionaire tech entrepreneur and social conservative, for allegedly “body slamming” Ben Jacobs of The Guardian on Wednesday while the reporter was asking about the GOP health care bill. Gianforte’s campaign blamed Jacobs, casting him as a “liberal reporter” who acted “aggressively” toward the Republican as he was about to be interviewed by a TV crew. But Alicia Acuna, the Fox News reporter who was slated to interview Gianforte, corroborated Jacobs’ version of events, and the incident spurred widespread condemnation of the Republican.“Last night I made a mistake,” Gianforte said in his victory speech Thursday night. “I should not have responded in the way that I did, and for that I’m sorry.”The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the liberal group MoveOn.org had blasted Gianforte with a last-minute ad campaign highlighting the incident as evidence he was “unfit to serve” and had “no business being in Congress.”House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) urged Gianforte to apologize earlier Thursday and called his behavior “wrong.” And three Montana newspapers withdrew their endorsement of him.The Missoulian newspaper said “there is no doubt that Gianforte committed an act of terrible judgment that, if it doesn’t land him in jail, also shouldn’t land him in the U.S. House of Representatives.”A factor likely benefiting Gianforte was that before news broke of Wednesday’s altercation, more than two-thirds of those who voted in the election had already cast early ballots, according to state election officials. Still, Quist’s loss will inevitably fuel criticism that the national Democratic Party got involved in the race too late.Even before Thursday’s results were known, Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive political strategist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research’s Revolving Door Project, had told HuffPost that “the national Democrats who provided financial assistance after mail-in voting had already begun will have to question anew their initial reluctance to engage in the race in March and early April.”“Early funding might have ensured more consistent tracking on Gianforte,” Hauser added, referring to the attack on the reporter. “It almost seems like you never know when Gianforte might commit a crime under a modicum of scrutiny.”Under almost any circumstances, a Democratic win would have been an upset. Even as Quist’s standing improved in the campaign’s final weeks, none of the polls released in advance of the race showed him ahead of Gianforte.Montana’s at-large U.S. House seat opened up in December when Trump tapped Ryan Zinke as his interior secretary. Republican Zinke had cruised to re-election in November by nearly 16 percentage points. Trump carried the state over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 20 points.Democratic presidential candidates have triumphed in the state just twice since 1952, most recently when Bill Clinton won it in 1992.Still, in a state with a sizable segment of independents, Democrats at times have held their own in down-ballot races. One of them is current Gov. Steve Bullock, who won re-election in 2016 when he defeated Gianforte by 4 percentage points.Quist, 69, a native-born rancher’s son from the Flathead Valley and founder of the popular Mission Mountain Wood Band, had the profile to repeat Bullock’s success. But Montana’s GOP leanings proved insurmountable in a traditionally low-turnout special election.“When this race started, I thought Quist had a 1-in-5 chance,” Jorge Quintana, a Democratic National Committee member from Montana, told HuffPost. “I don’t think any Democrat has been disappointed with the way Quist has behaved in this campaign. He has raised a ton of money. And he has hit the state hard ― Montanans expect that.”With grassroots opposition to Trump prompting a wellspring of national protests and small-dollar fundraising for progressive causes, Democratic leaders looked for a victory in Montana to signal waning public support for the president in historically Republican territory ― and spook GOP leaders. But Quist’s loss comes on the heels of similar disappointments for the party. Earlier this month in Omaha, Democrat Heath Mello failed to unseat Republican Mayor Jean Stothert. In April, progressive Democrat James Thompson lost an unexpectedly close race for an open House seat in deep-red Kansas.In 2017’s highest-profile race, Democrat Jon Ossoff fell less than two percentage points short in April of an outright win in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, a seat Republican Tom Price gave up to become Health and Human Services Department secretary and that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich once held. Ossoff faces Republican Karen Handel in a June 20 runoff election.Democrats were able to flip two state legislative seats on Tuesday ― one in New York, the other in New Hampshire. Quist, known throughout sprawling Montana for his music and poetry, barnstormed across the Treasure State in what at first seemed a quixotic campaign. He encouraged supporters to organize new Democratic committees in counties long neglected by the party. Until late last month, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee virtually ignored the race.Quist was buoyed by support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who Quist backed in the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign. Sanders, who won Montana’s primary over Clinton, headlined four separate campaign events for Quist this past weekend that drew thousands of supporters.Gianforte sought to capitalize on Trump’s popularity in the state. Donald Trump Jr. and Vice President Mike Pence campaigned on his behalf. Both the president and Pence recorded a last-minute robocalls for him.Still, Quist’s campaign gained ground as House Republicans passed the deeply unpopular healthcare bill and the White House became engulfed in a series of self-inflicted scandals. Party leaders tripled their initial investment in the race to $600,000 as polls showed it tightening earlier this month.Quist raised more than $5 million, with his average individual donation amounting to $25 ― $2 below the figure that Sanders’ constantly touted during his presidential run. Quist received more than $550,000 after Gianforte waffled on his support for the American Health Care Act that would repeal and replace Obamacare.The 56-year-old Republican praised the bill, which threatens the health insurance coverage for at least 70,000 Montanans, in a private call to conservative lobbyists. Days later, Gianforte walked back his comments amid voter outrage after The New York Times earlier this month published audio of the call.Quist, whose medical expenses nearly bankrupted him in the 1990s after a botched surgery left him unqualified for affordable health insurance, hammered his opponent with slogans like “hands off our health care.”Quist also depicted Gianforte, who sold a software company in 2011 to tech giant Oracle for $1.5 billion, as an out-of-touch millionaire guy from outside the state. The cowboy hat-clad son of Montana ranchers repeatedly skewered Gianforte as a “New Jersey billionaire.” The Republican, born in San Diego, spent years in the Garden State before moving to Montana in 1995. His reported net worth is estimated at between $65 million and $315 million.Gianforte raised more than $3.4 million, including a $1 million loan he made to his campaign.Republicans attacked Quist for failing to pay commercial taxes on a barn he converted in the 1990s into a concert space and rental property. Quist defended the property in an interview with the Billings Gazette, insisting his son lived there, “so that’s not a rental property. It’s just something that’s kind of family-owned.”A lengthy report in the conservative Washington Free Beacon cast doubt over the botched gallbladder surgery Quist frequently cited as the pre-existing condition that prevented him from getting health insurance.Quist’s loss may heighten Democratic concerns about the re-election prospects next year for Sen. Jon Tester, a party moderate.Quintana, though, said he believes Tester is in good shape for a third term.“He looks out for Montana. He’s setting himself up quite nicely for 2018,” Quintana said."

Parsley. Parsley was new for me … tomato, potato, eggs, milk, zucchini, onion, peanuts, pistachio …”Al-Zoubi and al-Shareef are both originally from Daraa, in southwestern Syria, and lived as refugees in Jordan after their families fled their home country in 2012 because of the ongoing war. But they met in Canada, where they both arrived in early 2016. Al-Zoubi came with her husband and four children, while al-Shareef was resettled alongside her husband and seven children.Working in the kitchen gives their families a much-needed financial boost. And al-Zoubi and al-Shareef both stressed how important it was for them to quickly stand on their own two feet.“We don’t depend on what the government gives us or anyone else. We spend money on ourselves and our children from what we earn from our products,” al-Zoubi said.More than 40,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled in Canada since November 2015, following an election campaign promise by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party. The federal government sponsored more than half of these Syrian newcomers. Refugees with government or private sponsors receive monthly financial assistance during their first year in the country.But for many of them struggling to adapt to life in their new home, anxiety about the so-called “13th month” – when the government or private groups’ financial support dries up – is palpable.Projects such as Karam Kitchen give Syrian refugees an income and more financial independence. They also serve as a bridge between the newcomers and the communities where they have been resettled. The Hamilton kitchen is not the only business of its kind in Canada: in nearby Toronto, Syrian women at The Newcomer Kitchen cook up weekly meals, while in Vancouver the women of Tayybeh: A Celebration of Syrian Cuisine create pop-up dinners. (Tayybeh is Arabic for “delicious.”)“I would not have guessed a year ago that this would be happening,” said Brittani Farrington, Karam Kitchen’s administrative director, who cofounded the catering business with the Syrian chefs.The idea first blossomed when members of Farrington’s church decided to host a welcome dinner for 10 Syrian newcomer families who resettled in Hamilton last April.“That’s when I asked Dalal, and she said yes, but we will cook Syrian food for the party,” Farrington said. They were joined by al-Shareef and a third founding chef, Rawa’a, who is currently taking time off after having a baby.The success of that first dinner prompted the women to ask how they could sell their food in Canada. And after an online fundraising campaign that raised more than $17,000 from nearly 250 backers, they catered their first event last August.At Karam Kitchen, a buffet-style meal costs just under C$16 per person (about $12), for groups of 20 people or more. It comprises several courses, including a choice of mutabbal (smoked eggplant dip) or hummus to start, yalanje (grape leaves stuffed with ground beef and rice), kibbeh (fried bulgur and ground meat) or falafel.The main dishes include shish burak (meat dumplings in a yogurt sauce), kousa mahshi (zucchini stuffed with meat, rice and spices and cooked in tomato sauce) and kabsa (fried chicken pieces and rice).The women are now averaging three to four days in the kitchen per week, and they have received orders to cater for City of Hamilton meetings, events at local organizations and private parties for 20 people or more.“It’s been so exciting,” Farrington said about seeing the women grow more and more comfortable in the kitchen. “I think they’re getting comfortable to the point where they’re making suggestions and innovations.”Karam Kitchen are currently fundraising to buy a delivery van, which Farrington said would help them take on more contracts and potentially hire other women to join the project. They have also taken on two new chefs, also Syrian refugees.“I hope we keep growing. I hope we’re able to hire more women and train these women as much as they want.

65,POLITICS,San Francisco Begins Providing Attorneys For Immigrants Who Can't Afford Them,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-attorneys-immigrants_us_59270f83e4b061d8f8201ead,Supporters say it's a vital service as Trump ramps up deportation efforts.,2017-05-26,ICE detainees make phone calls at the Adelanto immigration detention center.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59286025150000210015b9d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO — City officials this week began providing public defenders to immigrants unable to afford an attorney to help fight deportation attempts in court. The new program is the third immigration unit in the U.S. run by a public defender’s office. Supporters say it’s an indispensable service for San Francisco, where immigrants make up one-third of the population, as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls out its aggressive border enforcement and deportation agenda. Immigrants without attorneys are more likely to lose deportation cases than people defended by a lawyer, according to studies. Yet, in nearly 40 percent of cases, people take their chances without representation, according to Department of Justice figures. Without legal guidance, immigrants are pressured into making decisions that affect their ability to stay in the country before understanding all of their options, according to critics.“Miguel,” a man in his 20s from Central America, stood in front of a camera and video screen at a California detention center early last year. He’s a legal resident, and had lived in the Bay Area for almost nine years. But for months, he’d been held in a detention center, targeted for deportation because of a criminal conviction. The video in front of him connected to a courtroom in San Francisco, showing a federal judge and a prosecutor who argued for Miguel’s removal.Miguel, a Spanish speaker, could not afford a lawyer. He struggled with the judge’s repeated questions about his asylum application, according to transcripts of his case. “Okay. Sir, I asked you if you have that application filled out today. Did I not?” the judge said. Miguel, speaking through an interpreter, appeared overwhelmed by the proceedings. ‘Yes, but I wasn’t able to get any help. I tried to get an attorney, but there was no answer, and I couldn’t fill it out because I didn’t have any help. And that’s why I didn’t do it,” Miguel said. It had been a month since Miguel’s previous appearance before the judge, who had given him additional time to fill out the forms to fight his removal from the U.S. At that earlier hearing, Miguel told the judge he found no attorney who would take his case from the list of free and reduced-fee immigration lawyers provided by the court, according to a transcript. Frustration crept into the judge’s comments.“Sir, you and I had a conversation. You were supposed to fill out that application today. So I can find today that you’ve given up your application and find you removed,” the judge said. “Sir, you can be removed right now from the United States. Because I don’t appreciate people not following the court’s orders. And you made a promise that that application was going to be filled out and sent today. And now you come with nothing.”“What can I do? I don’t know how to read. I don’t know how to write. I couldn’t fill it out,” Miguel said. The scene is Kafkaesque. A legal resident is threatened with immediate deportation by a judge impatient with his inability to fill out documents thrust in front of him. The judge ultimately relented and allowed the man additional time to complete the forms.Details about Miguel’s identity have been withheld by his current attorney, who worried that criticizing immigration procedures could negatively affect his chances of remaining in the U.S. on appeal.The case shows typical challenges non-citizens face in immigration courts, where there is no right to a court-appointed lawyer. Immigration cases are classified as civil matters. People who can’t afford to hire a lawyer are only entitled to a public defender in criminal court. “To a person undergoing them, they feel like a criminal process. The government brings up everything it can,” said Raha Jorjani, an Alameda County public defender in nearby Oakland who now represents Miguel. “It’s an absolutely bewildering process. We’re talking about some of the most complicated laws in the nation.” Only New York City and Alameda County public defenders’ offices established immigration units before San Francisco. Other localities are devoting resources to hire lawyers for immigrants. Los Angeles announced a $10-million fund for local immigrants facing deportation in December. Chicago put together $1.3 million for a defense fund around the same time. Austin, Texas, put up emergency funds in February. Nonprofits and some law firms have offered pro bono legal aid for years. Access to an attorney could have immense benefits for detainees. Studies have shown that in immigration court, having a lawyer makes a defendant six times more likely to prevail than counterparts defending themselves, according to the San Francisco Public Defender’s office. Yet, more than 73,000 immigrants — almost 40 percent of all cases — ventured into immigration court without a lawyer in 2016, according to Department of Justice figures. “Having a lawyer evens the playing field,” said UCLA professor Hiroshi Motomura, an expert in immigration law. “Procedurally, it becomes a much more fair fight.”It’s a critical time for immigrants. Arrests by immigration officials have risen 38 percent this year under Trump’s administration, and the White House budget proposal seeks $2.7 billion in additional funding for border security and immigration enforcement. Trump also has threatened to slash funds to so-called sanctuary cities that don’t cooperate with federal immigration policy. The Trump administration’s hostile attitude toward immigrants, ironically, made it easier for San Francisco city officials to reach agreement on spending $200,000 on three lawyers and a paralegal for the rest of the year, according to Francisco Ugarte, head of the public defender’s immigration unit. “Our goal is to create some semblance of due process in the immigration court,” Ugarte said. “There’s one thing that we can bank on. He [Trump] wants to deport more people and be aggressive. He’s put a ton of fear into immigrant communities.”Ugarte’s team of three lawyers each will balance about 50 cases at a time. That’s not enough to provide every detainee with a lawyer, as about 1,500 detained immigrants have court dates in San Francisco each year, but it’s a start, the public defender’s office said. Critics say the program is a waste of government resources. “I don’t believe there is an appetite among the citizens in California to use their taxpayer dollars to defend undocumented immigrants who may have committed crimes,” Sue Caro, a state Republican Party official, told The Mercury News.Even with attorneys on hand, immigrants lack many of the other familiar protections against unfairness in criminal courts. There is no right to a speedy trial or statute of limitations, for instance. “Having representation is significant, huge and would go a long way,” said Jorjani. “But unfortunately, I don’t think the system is that fair.”"

The new program is the third immigration unit in the U.S. run by a public defender’s office. Supporters say it’s an indispensable service for San Francisco, where immigrants make up one-third of the population, as President Donald Trump’s administration rolls out its aggressive border enforcement and deportation agenda. Immigrants without attorneys are more likely to lose deportation cases than people defended by a lawyer, according to studies. Yet, in nearly 40 percent of cases, people take their chances without representation, according to Department of Justice figures. Without legal guidance, immigrants are pressured into making decisions that affect their ability to stay in the country before understanding all of their options, according to critics.“Miguel,” a man in his 20s from Central America, stood in front of a camera and video screen at a California detention center early last year. He’s a legal resident, and had lived in the Bay Area for almost nine years. But for months, he’d been held in a detention center, targeted for deportation because of a criminal conviction. The video in front of him connected to a courtroom in San Francisco, showing a federal judge and a prosecutor who argued for Miguel’s removal.Miguel, a Spanish speaker, could not afford a lawyer. He struggled with the judge’s repeated questions about his asylum application, according to transcripts of his case. “Okay. Sir, I asked you if you have that application filled out today. Did I not?” the judge said. Miguel, speaking through an interpreter, appeared overwhelmed by the proceedings. ‘Yes, but I wasn’t able to get any help. I tried to get an attorney, but there was no answer, and I couldn’t fill it out because I didn’t have any help. And that’s why I didn’t do it,” Miguel said.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) introduced a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force against the Islamic State, al Qaeda and the Taliban. It would give Congress new oversight over military action against those groups and over the countries in which U.S. bombings can take place. It would also repeal old AUMFs still in effect. The senators paired up on a similar bill in 2015, and it went nowhere. There’s no clear indication that this latest incarnation will have success, either.Yet, the two senators insisted that times are different.Flake enthusiastically said the Senate Foreign Relations Committee could take up their bill soon after the Memorial Day break. Kaine said he expects, now that they’ve filed a bill, that Trump administration officials may start working with them on the specifics of a new AUMF. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Their problem isn’t that they lack ambition, or are making a weak case. After all, many lawmakers don’t like that the White House currently can use a sweeping 2001 AUMF to justify military action against al Qaeda or ISIS anywhere, anytime, without congressional oversight.Their problem is, outside of a motley crew of rank-and-file lawmakers, nobody particularly cares.Flake and Kaine unveiled their bill to a room of a dozen or so reporters, and as many empty seats. Their 2015 AUMF bill never got a Senate committee hearing, never mind a floor debate or vote. Similar AUMF proposals in the House haven’t gone anywhere, either. The two senators said they told their respective party leaders about their latest plan to push the AUMF issue again, and said neither had much of a reaction.“He’s not opposed to it or in favor it,” Flake said of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).“He knows it’s an obsession of mine,” Kaine said of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “His attitude is … we’ll see what comes out of committee.”McConnell spokesman Don Stewart didn’t say how McConnell feels generally about the need for an AUMF debate. But he noted the administration is in the middle of reviewing its strategy for fighting ISIS, and once that’s done, President Donald Trump may need additional authorities to carry out his mission.“One could envision, in that scenario, that they’d ask for an AUMF that supported the strategy,” said Stewart. “But as that hasn’t happened yet, I don’t have any guidance on what the review will yield.”A Schumer aide did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Constitution says that it’s the role of Congress to declare wars, and that the president has to get lawmakers’ approval for any sustained military action. But Congress ceded some of its power in 2001, when it hastily passed the broad AUMF allowing President George W. Bush to attack anyone connected to al Qaeda, anywhere, at any time. That AUMF never expired, and President Barack Obama stretched its limits to argue he could unilaterally take military action against the Islamic State, too, since the terror group is an offshoot of al Qaeda.Today, that means Trump can use a 16-year-old war authorization to bomb people anywhere, at any time, without Congress signing off, so long as he can make the case that Islamic State or al Qaeda targets are there.That makes some lawmakers uneasy. But for all their discomfort with how the 2001 AUMF is being used, most are simply afraid to take a war vote ― one that would shape the duration, scope or troop levels in forthcoming military actions ― that could come back to haunt them.Kaine and Flake are holding out hope that responsibility will prevail over cowardice in Congress. They won’t concede that this is a fruitless task.“Why do I have hope ...” began Kaine, relaying a story about his multiple failed attempts as a Richmond City Council member to move city elections from May to November.“It took me seven years, and now we have November elections,” he said. “I don’t give up easy.”Flake rattled off his own reasons for optimism. More than half the members of Congress are new since their previous AUMF, he explained, which means fresh votes to recruit. There’s a new administration in the White House. And the new defense secretary has signaled support for a new AUMF. (Then again, so did the last one).“I believe they will want it because it strengthens their hand as they enter negotiations, or just diplomacy,” Flake said of the Trump administration. “We think that this bipartisan language does a good job.”But didn’t his last AUMF bill have good language, too?“This is better,” Flake said."

Alongside the massive proposed cuts to safety net programs that many women rely on, the policy was quickly labeled a “cruel joke.” Still, no other White House has gone this far.That the measure is broader than what Donald Trump suggested on the campaign trail ― it also covers fathers and adoptive parents ― is notable. That it was proposed despite clear opposition to any kind of paid leave mandate from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and the GOP shows a willingness to buck party desires. That it originated from a right-wing, male-dominated administration demonstrated that Ivanka indeed has some influence inside White House walls.And yet, the inclusion of a paid leave policy in the budget hasn’t won Ivanka much, if any, goodwill across the aisle. If anything, the proposal seems to have made her more of a target for progressives, who continue to blame her for her father’s worst impulses and initiatives.“As far as I’m concerned, this is a budget that she now is responsible for,” said Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. “She’s responsible for all women’s issues. And this is the most outrageous attack on women, women’s rights, women’s access to health care, that we’ve seen from any president.”“Ivanka is not simply tolerant of her father’s blathering radicalism, let alone nobly embattled by it; she is an active proponent and beneficiary of the outrageous robbery her family is perpetrating against those they purportedly serve,” charged feminist writer Lindy West in a Guardian column this week. “Come on. She loves it.”“Reminder: Ivanka is not your champion, or your moderating influence on her despicable father,” tweeted actor Wil Wheaton. “She is complicit, and as evil as any of them.”Ivanka-blaming is a passion among the president’s critics. It started during his campaign, when she was presented (by herself and her father) as a moderating influence. At the time, those skeptical about Donald Trump desperately hoped that Ivanka’s cosmopolitan, socially liberal sensibilities would move him in genuinely progressive directions on environmental policy, women’s issues and LGBTQ rights. Those hopes were fueled, at first, by his often-bizarre infatuation with his daughter, and then heightened when he made her a senior adviser. But that fantasy hasn’t panned out, which has engendered both disappointment among the wishful thinkers and a flood of I-told-you-so rejoinders from those who thought the expectation was ridiculous in the first place.Ivanka-blaming has also become an overly simplistic way to express fury over White House policies in general. It’s possible that Ivanka is fully complicit in shaping the president’s agenda and just pretending to be a moderate voice to protect her own brand. It’s also possible that she has limited powers as an adviser, little to no policy knowledge in the areas she covers, and zero political experience in a White House stacked with right-wing men who’ve spent careers in Washington.Donald Trump is, and remains, Donald Trump ― a man who called women dogs and pigs, bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” and said that when he comes home from work and dinner isn’t ready, he “goes through the roof.” That he gave his daughter a post in the White House in no way guaranteed that he was going to take direction from her. It also didn’t negate the fact that he is a wild card with his own opinions, thoughts and instincts.In truth, we know very little about what Ivanka has and hasn’t tried to do in the White House. What we do know is fairly broad. She and her husband, Jared Kushner, have “frequently tried to blunt Trump’s riskier impulses,” according to The Washington Post. They have notably failed to intervene at certain crucial moments ― like the firing of FBI Director James Comey ― but Ivanka claims she is picking her battles and regularly challenges her father, even if it doesn’t always work. “I’ll go to the mat on certain issues and I may still lose those,” she recently told The New York Times. “But maybe along the way I’ve modified a position just slightly. And that’s just great.”Those who despaired over Trump’s election needed a vehicle for hope and turned to her. Advocates imagined that she’d swoop in, whisper something about Planned Parenthood into her father’s ear, and convince him to go against the multiple anti-abortion advocates he had already placed in his administration. They imagined that she’d sit down with dad over dinner, explain the harms of rising carbon levels, and persuade him to remain in the Paris climate pact. They concocted scenarios of her tip-toeing into the Oval Office after Vice President Mike Pence had left and explaining to her father that, in fact, religious freedom laws endanger social progress on gay rights and thus win out over the veep. As an adviser to the president with the benefit of a close personal connection, Ivanka has certainly disappointed. She is a self-proclaimed feminist, but her speeches and writings on “women’s empowerment” have been narrow and low on substance. She has been notably absent from Washington during intense legislative battles, like when she went skiing during the health care debate. Her Instagram feed, filled with trips to museums and high-profile events, suggests that she isn’t exactly putting in the insane office hours that senior advisers traditionally do. And aside from her (inadequate) paid leave plan, she has won no apparent victories for women or the environment so far. (The decision whether to stay in the Paris accord remains TBD.)But to blame Ivanka for the entirety of the dumpster fire that has been her father’s presidency is misdirected anger. When Trump proposes defunding Planned Parenthood, it’s far more likely that he has been influenced by his vice president and dozens of anti-abortion advisers. Or that he’s basically forfeited domestic policy to Pence entirely, since that was reportedly what he’d always planned to do.Many have argued that Ivanka could stand up for her own values and become “a national hero” by publicly denouncing some of her father’s moves. But where, exactly, would that leave her? She’d have publicly admonished her dad while giving up any potential sway she had over him and his future policies. No such expectations were put on past presidential advisers. Nobody demanded that Valerie Jarrett ditch Barack Obama when she disagreed with something he did. Ivanka herself has said that she intends to be private in her advice. In April, she urged people “not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence.”Her critics haven’t done that. They have perhaps fairly blamed her for giving some of her father’s policies the type of moderate, sensible veneer they don’t deserve ― it’s why “Saturday Night Live” mocks her as “complicit.” We don’t know enough, however, to blame Ivanka for all her dad’s decisions. It’s unclear what she’s tried to do behind the scenes. What we do know is that, as senior adviser to the president, she isn’t up for the job and shouldn’t have been hired in the first place.But maybe, just maybe, Trump’s policies are his own fault. "

It’s also possible that she has limited powers as an adviser, little to no policy knowledge in the areas she covers, and zero political experience in a White House stacked with right-wing men who’ve spent careers in Washington.Donald Trump is, and remains, Donald Trump ― a man who called women dogs and pigs, bragged about grabbing women “by the pussy,” and said that when he comes home from work and dinner isn’t ready, he “goes through the roof.” That he gave his daughter a post in the White House in no way guaranteed that he was going to take direction from her. It also didn’t negate the fact that he is a wild card with his own opinions, thoughts and instincts.In truth, we know very little about what Ivanka has and hasn’t tried to do in the White House. What we do know is fairly broad. She and her husband, Jared Kushner, have “frequently tried to blunt Trump’s riskier impulses,” according to The Washington Post. They have notably failed to intervene at certain crucial moments ― like the firing of FBI Director James Comey ― but Ivanka claims she is picking her battles and regularly challenges her father, even if it doesn’t always work. “I’ll go to the mat on certain issues and I may still lose those,” she recently told The New York Times. “But maybe along the way I’ve modified a position just slightly. And that’s just great.”Those who despaired over Trump’s election needed a vehicle for hope and turned to her. Advocates imagined that she’d swoop in, whisper something about Planned Parenthood into her father’s ear, and convince him to go against the multiple anti-abortion advocates he had already placed in his administration. They imagined that she’d sit down with dad over dinner, explain the harms of rising carbon levels, and persuade him to remain in the Paris climate pact. They concocted scenarios of her tip-toeing into the Oval Office after Vice President Mike Pence had left and explaining to her father that, in fact, religious freedom laws endanger social progress on gay rights and thus win out over the veep. As an adviser to the president with the benefit of a close personal connection, Ivanka has certainly disappointed. She is a self-proclaimed feminist, but her speeches and writings on “women’s empowerment” have been narrow and low on substance. She has been notably absent from Washington during intense legislative battles, like when she went skiing during the health care debate. Her Instagram feed, filled with trips to museums and high-profile events, suggests that she isn’t exactly putting in the insane office hours that senior advisers traditionally do. And aside from her (inadequate) paid leave plan, she has won no apparent victories for women or the environment so far. (The decision whether to stay in the Paris accord remains TBD.)But to blame Ivanka for the entirety of the dumpster fire that has been her father’s presidency is misdirected anger. When Trump proposes defunding Planned Parenthood, it’s far more likely that he has been influenced by his vice president and dozens of anti-abortion advisers. Or that he’s basically forfeited domestic policy to Pence entirely, since that was reportedly what he’d always planned to do.Many have argued that Ivanka could stand up for her own values and become “a national hero” by publicly denouncing some of her father’s moves. But where, exactly, would that leave her? She’d have publicly admonished her dad while giving up any potential sway she had over him and his future policies. No such expectations were put on past presidential advisers. Nobody demanded that Valerie Jarrett ditch Barack Obama when she disagreed with something he did. Ivanka herself has said that she intends to be private in her advice. In April, she urged people “not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence.”Her critics haven’t done that. They have perhaps fairly blamed her for giving some of her father’s policies the type of moderate, sensible veneer they don’t deserve ― it’s why “Saturday Night Live” mocks her as “complicit.” We don’t know enough, however, to blame Ivanka for all her dad’s decisions. It’s unclear what she’s tried to do behind the scenes. What we do know is that, as senior adviser to the president, she isn’t up for the job and shouldn’t have been hired in the first place.But maybe, just maybe, Trump’s policies are his own fault. "

For her latest shoot, the toddler emulated a special hero in her life: her grandmother, who is a breast cancer survivor.Scout’s mom, Ashley, told HuffPost that her mother was the initial inspiration behind the famous icons shoot. She wanted to teach Scout about strong, courageous women as her grandmother battled cancer. “From the beginning, I was planning on making Scout and my mom (”Nonnie”) each a photo book of all the recreated photos we shot,” Ashley told HuffPost. “I felt like it would only make sense to do photos of my mom as well since she’s the inspiration behind the entire project.”The grandmother was a bit camera shy at first. “My mom is very selfless,” Ashley explained. “Being the center of attention is definitely not her favorite thing.”Scout, however, loves posing for pictures and helped bring her out of her shell. The toddler particularly loved the matching shirts, which Ashley and her mom made for the grandma-granddaughter photo shoot. “She had such a blast getting to shoot with her Nonnie,” Ashley said. “She was seriously thrilled to get to match with her.”Today, Ashley’s mother is doing well. “She’s cancer free and back to doing whatever she feels like doing! Her hair is growing back in beautifully and her strength is coming back,” she said, adding that her mom has one surgery coming up, but they’re ready to face this last step together as a family.“She’s the toughest lady I know,” Ashley added. “My sister and I are lucky to be a part of her. My babies and my nieces have the best Nonnie in the world.”Ultimately, Scout’s mom wants people who look at these photos to see that women are fierce and strong. “My mom, although she was sick, was my rock throughout the entire diagnosis and treatment. Fighting breast cancer, I know she was in pain and she was exhausted, but she never once showed that side to the little people who call her ‘Nonnie,’” Ashley said, adding that the grandmother continued to laugh and play with her grandchildren and took part in a normal Christmas celebration just a few weeks after having a double mastectomy. “Being a hero doesn’t always mean you’re saving the world,” Ashley said. “Sometimes, just showing up for life and meeting the problems head on is enough.”"

Author Rebecca Traister described how Clinton’s “brow furrows” upon mention of climate change skeptics Bret Stephens and George Will recently joining The New York Times and MSNBC, respectively. “Why … would … you … do … that? Sixty-six million people voted for me, plus, you know, the crazy third-party people,” said Clinton, who won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. “So there’s a lot of people who would actually appreciate stronger arguments on behalf of the most existential challenges facing our country and the world, climate change being one of them! It’s clearly a commercial decision. But I don’t think it will work. I mean, they’re laughing on the right at these puny efforts to try to appease people on the right.”Clinton also jabbed at The New York Times for recently launching a feature encouraging people to “Say Something Nice” about President Donald Trump: “I never saw them do that for me.”Looking back on the 2016 race, Clinton said she “underestimated” the impact of WikiLeaks publishing unflattering emails from members of the Democratic Party. The U.S. intelligence community has since concluded that Russian hackers stole the messages.Emails dripped out daily in October in a fashion that was “innocuous, boring, inconsequential,” Clinton said ― yet people “played like it was some breathless flash.” She said conservative media outlets amplified the contents of the emails, but added that the mainstream press played its own role in giving the documents outsize attention. “Look, we have an advocacy press on the right that has done a really good job for the last 25 years,” Clinton said. “They have a mission. They use the rights given to them under the First Amendment to advocate a set of policies that are in their interests, their commercial, corporate, religious interests. Because the advocacy media occupies the right, and the center needs to be focused on providing as accurate information as possible. Not both-sides-ism and not false equivalency.”Read Traister’s full piece here."

During this month of Ramadan, let us be resolved to spare no measure so that we may ensure that future generations will be free of this scourge and able to worship and commune in peace.”Trump's statement diverged from Ramadan greetings released in previous years by President Barack Obama, who spoke about celebrating and honoring the contributions of Muslims to American society.""As Muslim Americans celebrate the holy month, I am reminded that we are one American family,"" Obama wrote in his 2016 statement for Ramadan. ""I stand firmly with Muslim American communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights.""Obama also acknowledged the millions of refugees, many of them Muslim, who have been displaced by war and crises around the globe.In his message, Trump acknowledged some of the key themes of the holiday, including fasting, acts of charity and community engagement. He also referenced recent attacks in the United Kingdom and Egypt to point out that such “acts of depravity... are directly contrary to the spirit of Ramadan.”The president, who just over a year ago said “I think Islam hates us,” has distanced himself from earlier negative comments about the faith. In a speech to leaders of 55 Muslim-majority countries Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump insisted he had nothing against Islam, itself.“This is not a battle between different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations,” he told the leaders gathered for an Arab-Islamic-American summit. “This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it. This is a battle between good and evil.”Read Trump’s full statement for Ramadan below:Statement from President Donald J. Trump on Ramadan"

What would Michael Pollan do?!Sheepishly, I scanned the banana barcode using HowGood, a free app intended to help shoppers make more ethical food purchases. I’d been using the app all week to try to make all the “right” choices at the grocery store.The app revealed, unsurprisingly, that the bananas did not meet HowGood’s sustainability standards, but there were no other banana options in the store. There were also no other options that met the app’s standards, it turned out, in two other stores where I looked for a better alternative.Eventually, I bit my lip and bought some verboten bananas.The app that led to my banana boondoggle was created by brothers Arthur and Alexander Gillett in 2007 with the aim of creating an unbiased, one-stop source of information about food companies’ ethical practices and histories, cutting through the confusing web of product labels, academic studies and Internet hot takes to separate the greenwashers from the genuine foodie heroes.The app relies on a research team — which includes input from hundreds of scientists, academics, farmers and grocers — that has rated over 200,000 products across 70 different indicators that fit into three broader categories. They include how the products are grown, how they are produced or processed, and how the company operates.Those ratings are boiled down to one of just four ratings — “good,” “great,” “best” or, if a product is determined not to meet standards in all three categories, no rating whatsoever.Easy, right? HowGood co-founder and CEO Alexander Gillett admitted to HuffPost that simplicity was the goal.“For each of the different included inputs, the idea is to take all the complexity of the food system and simplify it so you don’t have to have a Ph.D. in each of these fields or understand the difference in every single input to be able to vote with your dollars,” Gillett said.The ratings can be accessed using the company’s smartphone app, which debuted three years ago and has been slowly attracting an audience and investors ever since, bringing in a new round of funding in the range of $4 million this year.Using the app, shoppers like me can scan any product with a barcode or search the HowGood database to quickly view product ratings.Some grocery stores — about 257 across 26 states — are even working with the startup to display the ratings next to products’ price tags, with more to come, according to Gillett. “The shelf labeling is going about as fast as we can do it,” Gillett added, noting that licensing the app’s ratings for the in-store labeling is the startup’s primary source of revenue.For now, it appears the HowGood rollout hasn’t made much of a dent in the Midwest, where I’m based. The nearest store already sporting HowGood shelf labels was more than an hour’s drive away.Without shelf labels to rely on, I was left scanning each product that piqued my curiosity, a process that felt time-consuming and grew increasingly frustrating when the app began to time out. Then, in large sections of the first store I visited, my phone lost signal altogether, which rendered the app useless.At two other stores where my signal was stronger, however, I was able to easily compare ratings on products like different brands of coconut oil (all of them were “great”) and feel-good frozen entrees from the likes of Amy’s and Evol (some of them, surprisingly, better than others).When my phone had a strong signal, the process was certainly quicker than scrolling through pages of Google search results and looking for insights into company practices.But what about situations — such as my own personal bananagate — in which shoppers have no highly rated options to choose from? And how reliable are these ratings in the first place? Experts in food ethics admire the effort behind the app but aren’t so sure.Dan Crossley is the executive director of the U.K.-based Food Ethics Council, a nonprofit group.Crossley said he feels that tools like HowGood hold a lot of potential to help shoppers make more informed decisions in the grocery aisle, but noted that past attempts at developing these sorts of ratings have come up short because the science behind the ratings often isn’t robust enough to capture the nuances inherent in our food system.He said he wasn’t sure if HowGood has succeeded where many others have failed. The result could even do more harm than good.“Well-intentioned simplification can end up resulting in greater confusion,” Crossley added.Lauren Ornelas, the founder and executive director of the food justice-oriented Food Empowerment Project, was also concerned that the work could be oversimplifying the issue at hand.In response to concerns about the ways in which most commercial chocolate is sourced, Ornelas’ organization launched its own “chocolate list” and an accompanying app about six years ago that identifies which chocolate brands their group has reviewed and recommends.Researching that project, Ornelas added, was a huge undertaking for their small organization. And it was a process that revealed many products are neither “good” nor “bad” — most fall in a gray area in between. That gray area, she said, is less evident in the HowGood approach.“This makes something that’s very complicated seem very simplistic,” Ornelas told HuffPost.One particular rating in the app also caught Ornelas’ eye: Driscoll’s raspberries were rated “good,” owing to the brand’s high company conduct score — but the company has been the subject of widespread allegations of farmworker abuses and calls for a global boycott of its products.The surprising rating made Ornelas question who might be weighing in on the app’s product ratings.“Who is setting this criteria and deciding what’s the best one out there?” Ornelas added. “If you’re claiming to be any type of entity that’s forcing companies to be more transparent, you have the responsibility to be more transparent yourself.”In response to a question about the Driscoll’s rating, Gillett said that seemingly controversial companies can sometimes rate better than anticipated using their system because the companies are being compared to the rest of the industry — in other words, everyone is being graded on a curve.“Oftentimes it’s the case where a company has problems in one area and needs improvement but it’s just a well-publicized version of that and the rest of the industry is performing worse,” Gillett explained.In addition, Gillett said the company welcomes input from users concerning product ratings and considers that input when it is reviewing ratings, a process that automatically begins anytime a product’s ingredients or sourcing change and is also carried out manually on a regular basis.There’s still plenty of reason to be skeptical of all of this.Paul Thompson, a philosophy professor at Michigan State University who has been studying food ethics issues for 35 years, admitted that the HowGood app was “doing a pretty fair job of covering the bases” on a wide range of food ethics issues. If it becomes more widely used, he said, it could encourage more food companies to embrace better practices.But still, Thompson said, a more just food system probably won’t be achieved through an app — or through more “woke” shopping habits in the first place.“Anyone who seriously thinks that an app is going to make their food decisions for them is not really engaged in food ethics,” Thompson added. “Food justice usually is about building relationships on a local community level. Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I still think that a relation mediated by an app is not really a relationship.”Personally, I share Thompson’s skepticism. The app wasn’t particularly easy to use and I’m unsure how many shoppers would take the time to go to three different stores in search of an ethical banana. I’m even less sure that the number of people making such an effort would hit a critical mass capable of shifting the entire food system.But would it hurt if some people do? Probably not.Gillett, for his part, remains optimistic.“You can really make a difference in peoples’ lives by switching from one product to another and supporting the companies with the best practices,” Gillett added. “We’re empowering people to engage and help move the needle.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

I’d been using the app all week to try to make all the “right” choices at the grocery store.The app revealed, unsurprisingly, that the bananas did not meet HowGood’s sustainability standards, but there were no other banana options in the store. There were also no other options that met the app’s standards, it turned out, in two other stores where I looked for a better alternative.Eventually, I bit my lip and bought some verboten bananas.The app that led to my banana boondoggle was created by brothers Arthur and Alexander Gillett in 2007 with the aim of creating an unbiased, one-stop source of information about food companies’ ethical practices and histories, cutting through the confusing web of product labels, academic studies and Internet hot takes to separate the greenwashers from the genuine foodie heroes.The app relies on a research team — which includes input from hundreds of scientists, academics, farmers and grocers — that has rated over 200,000 products across 70 different indicators that fit into three broader categories. They include how the products are grown, how they are produced or processed, and how the company operates.Those ratings are boiled down to one of just four ratings — “good,” “great,” “best” or, if a product is determined not to meet standards in all three categories, no rating whatsoever.Easy, right? HowGood co-founder and CEO Alexander Gillett admitted to HuffPost that simplicity was the goal.“For each of the different included inputs, the idea is to take all the complexity of the food system and simplify it so you don’t have to have a Ph.D. in each of these fields or understand the difference in every single input to be able to vote with your dollars,” Gillett said.The ratings can be accessed using the company’s smartphone app, which debuted three years ago and has been slowly attracting an audience and investors ever since, bringing in a new round of funding in the range of $4 million this year.Using the app, shoppers like me can scan any product with a barcode or search the HowGood database to quickly view product ratings.Some grocery stores — about 257 across 26 states — are even working with the startup to display the ratings next to products’ price tags, with more to come, according to Gillett. “The shelf labeling is going about as fast as we can do it,” Gillett added, noting that licensing the app’s ratings for the in-store labeling is the startup’s primary source of revenue.For now, it appears the HowGood rollout hasn’t made much of a dent in the Midwest, where I’m based. The nearest store already sporting HowGood shelf labels was more than an hour’s drive away.Without shelf labels to rely on, I was left scanning each product that piqued my curiosity, a process that felt time-consuming and grew increasingly frustrating when the app began to time out. Then, in large sections of the first store I visited, my phone lost signal altogether, which rendered the app useless.At two other stores where my signal was stronger, however, I was able to easily compare ratings on products like different brands of coconut oil (all of them were “great”) and feel-good frozen entrees from the likes of Amy’s and Evol (some of them, surprisingly, better than others).When my phone had a strong signal, the process was certainly quicker than scrolling through pages of Google search results and looking for insights into company practices.But what about situations — such as my own personal bananagate — in which shoppers have no highly rated options to choose from? And how reliable are these ratings in the first place? Experts in food ethics admire the effort behind the app but aren’t so sure.Dan Crossley is the executive director of the U.K.-based Food Ethics Council, a nonprofit group.Crossley said he feels that tools like HowGood hold a lot of potential to help shoppers make more informed decisions in the grocery aisle, but noted that past attempts at developing these sorts of ratings have come up short because the science behind the ratings often isn’t robust enough to capture the nuances inherent in our food system.He said he wasn’t sure if HowGood has succeeded where many others have failed. The result could even do more harm than good.“Well-intentioned simplification can end up resulting in greater confusion,” Crossley added.Lauren Ornelas, the founder and executive director of the food justice-oriented Food Empowerment Project, was also concerned that the work could be oversimplifying the issue at hand.In response to concerns about the ways in which most commercial chocolate is sourced, Ornelas’ organization launched its own “chocolate list” and an accompanying app about six years ago that identifies which chocolate brands their group has reviewed and recommends.Researching that project, Ornelas added, was a huge undertaking for their small organization. And it was a process that revealed many products are neither “good” nor “bad” — most fall in a gray area in between. That gray area, she said, is less evident in the HowGood approach.“This makes something that’s very complicated seem very simplistic,” Ornelas told HuffPost.One particular rating in the app also caught Ornelas’ eye: Driscoll’s raspberries were rated “good,” owing to the brand’s high company conduct score — but the company has been the subject of widespread allegations of farmworker abuses and calls for a global boycott of its products.The surprising rating made Ornelas question who might be weighing in on the app’s product ratings.“Who is setting this criteria and deciding what’s the best one out there?” Ornelas added. “If you’re claiming to be any type of entity that’s forcing companies to be more transparent, you have the responsibility to be more transparent yourself.”In response to a question about the Driscoll’s rating, Gillett said that seemingly controversial companies can sometimes rate better than anticipated using their system because the companies are being compared to the rest of the industry — in other words, everyone is being graded on a curve.“Oftentimes it’s the case where a company has problems in one area and needs improvement but it’s just a well-publicized version of that and the rest of the industry is performing worse,” Gillett explained.In addition, Gillett said the company welcomes input from users concerning product ratings and considers that input when it is reviewing ratings, a process that automatically begins anytime a product’s ingredients or sourcing change and is also carried out manually on a regular basis.There’s still plenty of reason to be skeptical of all of this.Paul Thompson, a philosophy professor at Michigan State University who has been studying food ethics issues for 35 years, admitted that the HowGood app was “doing a pretty fair job of covering the bases” on a wide range of food ethics issues. If it becomes more widely used, he said, it could encourage more food companies to embrace better practices.But still, Thompson said, a more just food system probably won’t be achieved through an app — or through more “woke” shopping habits in the first place.“Anyone who seriously thinks that an app is going to make their food decisions for them is not really engaged in food ethics,” Thompson added. “Food justice usually is about building relationships on a local community level. Maybe I’m old-fashioned, but I still think that a relation mediated by an app is not really a relationship.”Personally, I share Thompson’s skepticism. The app wasn’t particularly easy to use and I’m unsure how many shoppers would take the time to go to three different stores in search of an ethical banana. I’m even less sure that the number of people making such an effort would hit a critical mass capable of shifting the entire food system.But would it hurt if some people do? Probably not.Gillett, for his part, remains optimistic.“You can really make a difference in peoples’ lives by switching from one product to another and supporting the companies with the best practices,” Gillett added. “We’re empowering people to engage and help move the needle.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

78,QUEER VOICES,Indonesia Launches New Police Force To Investigate LGBTQ Community,"By Tom Allard and Stefanno Reinard, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesia-lgbtq-police-force_us_5927589ce4b0df34c35ad9bb,The move comes at a time of uncertainty for queer Indonesians.,2017-05-26,Police are seen outside the club where 141 men were detained for what was described as a gay prostitution ring in Jakarta. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5927597b2000003a0016efae.jpeg?cache=MVa70V5Rf8&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Police in Indonesia’s most populous province plan to deploy a taskforce to investigate lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activity, a move likely to fuel concerns of a widening crackdown on the community in the Muslim-majority country.West Java police chief Anton Charliyan disclosed the plan on Tuesday as two gay men in the province of Aceh were publicly flogged, and days after police raided a gay club in Jakarta and distributed photos of suspects to the media.With the exception of Aceh, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. Activists say, however, that police targeting of consensual gay sex has shone a light on discrimination and harassment in the world’s third-largest democracy.Indonesia’s reputation for tolerance is already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian, was sentenced this month to two years in prison for blasphemy.Responding to Sunday’s Jakarta raid, Charliyan told reporters in Bandung, the capital of West Java, a province with a population of about 47 million, that LGBT people suffered a “disease of the body and soul”.He called on the public to report their activities.“I hope there are no followers in West Java, no gay or LGBT lifestyle or tradition, Charliyan said. “If there’s anyone following it, they will face the law and heavy social sanctions. They will not be accepted in society.”‘MORALS POLICE’A leading LGBT activist slammed his remarks, which were confirmed in a recording provided to Reuters by journalists present when Charliyan spoke on Tuesday.“Police have a mandate to follow the law. They are not the morals police,” said Yuli Rustinawati, chairperson of Arus Pelangi, an Indonesian LGBT activist organization.In remarks on Wednesday, Charliyan said the police “taskforce” would include intelligence specialists and was particularly concerned with disrupting “secret parties”, the Detik news portal reported.A national spokesman for the police, Setyo Wasisto, said the approach in West Java did not reflect a national strategy.“It is enough for us to handle it as we do regularly,” he said.Charliyan’s comments follow a spate of high-profile police actions against gay clubs and parties just as the country’s Constitutional Court is due to rule on a petition to outlaw homosexuality and adultery.On Sunday, police detained 141 men and released photos of some of them in varying states of undress to the media, revealing many of their identities. Only 10 of the men have been declared suspects, five remain under investigation and 126 were released.The police said the photos were released due to “procedural errors”, the Jakarta Post reported.Rustinawati at Arus Pelangi said, however, the release of the images was part of a police pattern of publicly shaming of gay people.NAMED AND SHAMEDThe two Acehnese men, caned 82 times each on Tuesday, were punished in front of a crowd of more than 1,000. Semi-autonomous Aceh province is governed by sharia Islamic law.Earlier, a video of the men, naked and distressed as they were apprehended by sharia police, was released and viewed widely on social media.In Indonesia’s second-largest city of Surabaya in East Java, 14 gay men were arrested, tested for HIV and the results made public, Indonesian media reported.“The police also release data - names and addresses,” said Rustinawati. “It’s humiliating and it puts LGBT people in danger.”On Tuesday, North Jakarta police chief Dwiyono, who like many Indonesians has only one name, took journalists through the gay club raided on Sunday. As they climbed three floors, he pointed out a gym, a communal jacuzzi used for “striptease” and a cluster of cubicles for sex.“This door can only be opened if you pay 185,000 rupiah ($14) to the receptionist,” he said. “In here, there’s no change room, you just tear off your clothes and use a towel.”PUBLIC DISAPPROVALIndonesian President Joko Widodo last year gave qualified support for the gay community, telling the BBC that “there should be no discrimination against anyone”, before noting that homosexuality is not popular in his country.However, his defense minister, Ryamizard Ryacudu, suggested that homosexuality was a national security threat and part of a “proxy war” waged against Indonesia by foreign states.A Pew Research Center poll in 2013 found 93 percent of respondents in Indonesia disagreed that “society should accept homosexuality.”Indonesia’s Islamist groups have long called for the criminalization of gay sex. The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), the vigilante group that led huge rallies against the now-convicted Jakarta governor, has cooperated with police in curbing alleged vice for more than a decade.(Additional reporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa, Gayatri Suroyo and Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by John Chalmers and Bill Tarrant)"

Most of them seek asylum or other forms of humanitarian exemption from deportation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/592714a21600002100ddcd66.jpeg?cache=hMRv9hUcO6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― A woman locked at a family immigrant detention center tried to take her own life this month in what legal advocates described as a desperate effort to free her two kids.  Samira Hakimi, an Afghan national, has spent the last six months detained with her two young children despite a federal ruling that dictates they should have been released within three weeks. The case reinforces the longstanding concerns of immigrant rights groups that say asylum-seeking families should not be forced into prolonged detention.“They told us you will only be a couple of days in there,” Hakimi told HuffPost. “I never thought that I would be detained here for such a long time. That I’m detained here because I’m from Afghanistan and that’s all. But I’m human.”In Afghanistan, the Hakimi family had established a high school and multi-branch private university that used Western curricula, taught in both English and Dari and offered more than half its scholarships to women, according to lawyers representing Hakimi and her husband. Since 2013, the Taliban repeatedly threatened the family for its work. To avoid the danger of commuting, the family moved onto the university campus and contracted private security guards that year. It wasn’t enough for them to feel safe. “We could not go outside,” Hakimi said. “My children could not go to school. We thought they might be kidnapped. This was always in our minds.... They have their lives to live. They should live happy and free from every small thing, going to school and enjoying their lives.”Last year, they fled Afghanistan with Hakimi’s brother-in-law and his pregnant wife, who were facing similar threats.In December, the two families crossed into the United States from Mexico through a legal port of entry, where they all asked for asylum. The men were separated and sent to all-male immigrant detention centers, where they remain. Hakimi and her kids, as well as her sister-in-law and her newborn baby, were sent to the South Texas Family Detention Center in the town of Dilley and later transferred to the Karnes County Residential Center outside San Antonio. Hakimi passed her “credible fear” interview ― the first step toward applying for asylum. It’s common practice for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to free people who pass these interviews so they can pursue their cases in immigration court, but ICE declined to release her and her children. The agency did not respond to a request for comment explaining why it refuses to release them. Hakimi’s sister-in-law is also still at Karnes with her 10-month-old baby.Hakimi told HuffPost she had suffered from bouts of clinical depression before being detained. Advocates with RAICES, a nonprofit that provides legal services to detained families, say she had attempted suicide in the past and told medical workers at Karnes that her condition had worsened as her case appeared to stall. Neither medicine nor therapy would alleviate the problem, she argued. Her depression stemmed from remaining locked up in the detention center with her children.As the months dragged on, she lost hope. “Here, no one talks to us,” Hakimi said. “They don’t give us the reason why I’m detained in here. I never thought that I would be detained here for such a long time.” Her son came to her one day asking her why other families were allowed to leave but not them. “That was really triggering her,” Amy Fisher, RAICES’s policy director, told HuffPost. “She was crying and really depressed. And she went into this thought process, when she was really low, thinking, ‘Well, if I’m no longer here, maybe my children can be free.’” Kids cannot be held without their parents or guardians in family detention. After she made an effort to take her own life, she woke up in the medical unit of the detention center and was taken to a nearby hospital, where two members of the detention center staff sat with her continuously.  “I told them, ‘I’m just crying for my children, please,’” she said in a recording with one of her legal providers. “I’m not sick. But they gave me medicine. And they told me take this every four hours, but I didn’t take it anymore.” Hakimi told her lawyer she did not know what the medicine was. RAICES is requesting her medical records.  The suicide attempt at Karnes occurred the same month as an immigrant detainee’s suicide at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Jean Jiménez-Joseph, 27, killed himself after spending nearly three weeks in solitary confinement. Human rights groups have long criticized mental health services at immigrant detention centers. But Fisher said even adequate therapy wouldn’t resolve the problem Hakimi faces.“There’s no surprise or coincidence that she attempted suicide within days of a young man committing suicide in another detention center,” Fisher said. “There’s no mental health care that can effectively treat someone who is traumatized in a detained setting.” The Obama administration had all but abandoned the family detention policy by 2009, but hastily resurrected it in 2014 to dissuade a sudden influx of Central American mothers and children from crossing into the United States. Most of them were seeking refuge from violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ruled in 2015 that the policy violates a longstanding federal settlement called the Flores Agreement, which requires children to be held in the least restrictive setting possible and to generally be released from detention. To comply with the ruling, most families are released from detention within three weeks. But Hakimi and her children still have no idea when they’ll be freed. The uncertainty of her case likely played a key role in her deteriorating mental health, according to Luis Zayas, the dean of social work for the University of Texas at Austin. Zayas has interviewed dozens of detainees at Karnes and says clinical depression and high levels of anxiety are common there. “We see it constantly,” Zayas said. “It’s not necessarily an intrinsic form of depression, based on brain chemicals or a longstanding depression ― it’s what we call ‘reactive.’ It’s related to the environment the person is in, especially over a long period of time.”Zayas had not interviewed the Afghan woman, but evaluated another woman who attempted suicide at Karnes in 2015. He said he saw parallels in their cases. Both of them had histories of depression and suicidal thoughts prior to entering detention. Suffering through a period of prolonged confinement can push people back to their worst states of mind, particularly if they have a history of mental illness, according to Zayas. The problem is particularly acute with people in family detention, where the vast majority file claims for asylum or other humanitarian exemptions from deportation. “These families aren’t prepared to be there because they’re not criminals,” Zayas said. “This is what happens when people get desperate,” Zayas added. “This woman is suffering a mental health crisis. But we know where it’s coming from. We know what we can do to stop it.” If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
