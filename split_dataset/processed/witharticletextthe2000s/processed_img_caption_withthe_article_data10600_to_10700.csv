The buzz is tremendous.Forbes magazine offers some reasons why you should add “13 Reasons Why” to your binge queue (followed by a few more reasons why it’s still not a perfect show).They say, “It’s compelling, the characters are great, the way the show handles time is clever, the music is wonderful, it’s more than just a high school drama, there acting is top-notch, there’s nothing else like it on Netflix, and Hannah is an unreliable narrator. Having an unreliable narrator not only makes the mystery more interesting, it adds to the humanity of the characters.”Here is how Forbes categorizes what isn’t right in the film: “There’s not enough humor, 13 episodes is a stretch, sometimes the show feels too outlandish, they worry about the subject matter, mental illness is glossed over. For all its flaws, ‘13 Reasons Why’ is a lovingly produced, well-written and beautifully acted teen drama for all ages.”I’ll accept Forbes’ two reasons which is the show is compelling and the acting is great. But parents need to talk to their teens and explain why “13 Reasons Why” shouldn’t be their binge!Based on the book “13 Reasons Why” by Jay Asher, the fictional show opens with a teen suicide and the 13 tapes she (Hannah) left for her friends with listening instructions. It’s a flashback of Hannah while she was still alive and is on the lines of a murder mystery, with bullying, two rape scenes, grief, violence, mental illness and teen drinking.The show is harmful to any teen who could be considering suicide.“13 Reasons Why” does not offer solutions to teen problems. It does glamorize suicide, and we already have enough teens who have taken their lives. The show communicates to teens that if you are lost and not heard, your story will be heard after you’ve left this world.According to the CDC, suicide is the third leading cause of death among persons aged 10-14 and the second among persons aged 15-34 years old. And Child Trends reports that the proportion of high school students who report they have thought seriously about attempting suicide continued to rise in 2015 (to 18 percent), after having fallen substantially since the early 1990s (from 29 percent in 1991 to 14 percent in 2009).Teens identify with people they see on TV and in movies. It’s also important to note that Hannah blames everyone else for her suicide. Suicide is not someone else’s fault. Most teen suicides are contagion behaviors. Connecting suicide to bullying can be detrimental. I won’t say that all teen suicides aren’t due to bullying, but many result in mental health and other issues. By placing the blame solely on bullying, it takes away crucial risk factors of suicidal behavior that must be focused on.“National and international research clearly indicates the very real impact and risk to harmful suicide exposure leading to increased risk and possible suicide contagion,” said Headspace national manager Kristen Douglas this week.Ask any of us in this arena, and we all feel very strongly about how dangerous this show is.Today, the Hollywood Reporter revealed that Netflix is close to renewing “13 Reasons Why.”Allegedly, the series will end with a special 30-minute PSA called “Beyond the Reasons,” which features producers including Selena Gomez as well as the cast, doctors, advocates and psychologists offering insight on how to get help or assist someone in need.This series is a great place to start conversations, but this show is not sending a positive message or solution to our impressionable and vulnerable teens.For any teen who feels suicidal here are resources to help you:National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)www.stompoutbullying.org HelpChat LineTrevor Lifeline at 866-488-7386The GLBT National Youth Talkline at 1-800-246-PRIDE (1-800-246-7743)Or you can call 911 or go to your nearest hospital emergency room.Never give up!

7,POLITICS,Bill de Blasio Thinks He's Proved His Haters Wrong When It Comes To Pre-K,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/de-blasio-prek_us_58ff9edde4b0073d3e79fec0,The New York mayor plans to roll out free preschool for 3-year-olds.,2017-04-26,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio reads to children in a pre-kindergarten class at P.S. 130 on February 25, 2014 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ffd6351c00003a00e81b48.jpeg?cache=E1UV3S4Sde&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Bill de Blasio ran for New York City mayor in 2013, his plan to enact a universal preschool program for 4-year-olds was treated more like a lofty ideal than a workable promise. American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten suggested the goal was unrealistic, and called the proposal’s early iteration “non-serious.” Experts were skeptical that he could adequately overcome the obstacles to providing pre-K for so many children. Four years later, de Blasio has successfully implemented a Pre-K for All program that serves about 70,000 kids. But as he gears up to run for his second term, he has ambitious plans to expand the early education services offered to city families. On Monday, de Blasio announced plans for 3-K for All, a program that could roll out free pre-K for all the city’s 3-year-olds by 2021.It’s a plan that is undoubtedly ambitious for the largest city in the country, and its scope stands out even among other progressive states and municipalities with preschool programs. Yet, unlike when de Blasio first proposed universal pre-K on the campaign trail, this proposal is getting taken seriously, he says. “When I first introduced pre-K, I can’t tell you how many people told me it was a pipe dream,” de Blasio told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “The press was openly dismissive,” questioning where the money to pay for the plan would come from, and whether it could serve so many children so quickly, he said. This time around, neither “political insiders” nor “everyday people” seem flippant about the plan, “even if it’s going to take a lot of work and time.”3-K for All will face obvious obstacles ― and it is rolling out at a slow, incremental pace compared to its Pre-K for All predecessor, which took two years. The city already struggled to find space for centers for 4-year-olds, and de Blasio predicts that it will have to “build early childhood centers from scratch” over the next few years. The state budget helped fund the first pre-K program, and the city will need significant funding commitments from the state and federal government to fully enact the new plan as well. The mayor is optimistic that the city’s efforts on this front will inspire people in both red and blue areas to continue to fight for young children on the local level. There are few indications that Donald Trump’s administration will prioritize early childhood education, and even when Barack Obama was president and pushed the issue, Congress didn’t pass funding for a nationwide pre-K program. Democratic and Republican voters both express support for the issue, though. “This is something happening to the grassroots and bubbling up all over the country,” said de Blasio. “What we do know is what happens locally, that’s the tangible reality. Local dynamics around the country add up to something.”Pre-K for all has generally received successful marks, although it has not been without criticism. Preschool classrooms tend to be heavily segregated by race, similar to the city’s K-12 system. But overall it has succeeded in its goals of giving parents greater early childhood education options. This is a luxury that de Blasio did not have when his kids were growing up, and he worried about whether his kids would get a spot at the competitive preschool center near them. He says the experienced helped spur him to champion this issue. “I think there’s a real argument here that we got to create a less stressful environment for parents,” said de Blasio. “This is the march of history, and it’s about showing it can happen and work in places all over the country.” "

Or do we want to embrace the light-touch approach” in place since 1996 until revised in 2015, he asked.The rules approved by the FCC in 2015 prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a “fast lane,” to certain internet services over others.The 2015 FCC rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities, a decision that could open the door to eventual rate regulation. A federal appeals court upheld the rules last year.Pai said his proposal will face an initial vote on May 18 but he would not seek to finalize a reversal of the Obama rules until the FCC takes public comment, which could take several months.The Obama administration rules require broadband providers to treat all data equally, rather than give or sell access to a Web “fast lane.”Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly said on Wednesday, “The previous FCC took internet policy down into a dark and horrible abyss.” He said the FCC will “expunge net neutrality regulations from the Internet.”Internet providers such as AT&T Inc , Verizon Communications Inc  and Comcast Corp  have argued that net neutrality rules make it harder for internet service providers to manage traffic and has made investment in additional capacity less likely.Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said reclassification of internet services as a utility should be reversed. He said Pai’s proposal “creates an environment where we can have a fresh constructive dialogue.”Democratic Senator Edward Markey predicted Pai would face a “tsunami of resistance” to overturning the rules.The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc  and others, said the current FCC net neutrality rules are working and should not be changed. Reversing the rules “will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online,” they said.(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Tom Brown and Diane Craft)"
9,POLITICS,Donald Trump's First Lower Court Nominee Is Fine With The President Trashing Judges,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-federal-judges_us_5900e689e4b081a5c0fa198d,"""It doesn't matter to us,"" Judge Amul Thapar tells senators.",2017-04-26,President Donald Trump personally attacks federal judges who rule against him. That's ... one way to interpret democracy?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5900e7521c00002600e81dd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s first lower court appointment, Amul Thapar, got his Senate hearing on Wednesday and was asked what he thinks about Trump routinely condemning federal judges who rule against him.He’s cool with it.“What I will say about me and my colleagues is, we don’t pay ― it doesn’t matter to us,” Thapar told the Senate Judiciary Committee.Perhaps it shouldn’t be surprising that Thapar, Trump’s pick for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, would be so dismissive of the president’s attacks on courts. He is counting on Trump, after all, to help him get confirmed. But considering he is currently a U.S. district judge in Kentucky, his decision not to defend the integrity of his livelihood was, at best, awkward.Pressed by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on whether it matters to him that federal courts have credibility in the eyes of the public, and told it weakens people’s faith in democracy when the president degrades an entire branch of government, Thapar pivoted.“When the founders gave us lifetime tenure, senator, they did so to protect us from those types of attacks,” he said. “What we have is neither the purse nor the sword, but our reasoning. Our reasoning protects us, in a way.”Thapar’s hearing comes a day after the White House assailed a federal judge who blocked part of Trump’s January executive order aimed at stripping federal funds from local jurisdictions to bully them into compliance with immigration requests.“This case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single, unelected district judge,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a Tuesday statement.It’s part of a disturbing pattern of Trump personally attacking judges who don’t rule in his favor. In February, he lashed out at U.S. District Judge James Robart for halting his executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim countries. Trump referred to Robart as “this so-called judge” and said to blame him if terrorists flooded into the country.That came after Trump drew widespread condemnation in June 2016 for criticizing U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, claiming this judge couldn’t fairly rule on lawsuits against Trump University because of Curiel’s “Mexican heritage.” (Curiel is from Indiana; his parents are Mexican immigrants.)Some others in his administration have started doing it, too. Last week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions managed to insult the entire state of Hawaii by denouncing a federal judge there who blocked Trump’s revised travel ban in March. “I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,” he said.Asked later why he didn’t just refer to Hawaii as a state, Sessions said, “Nobody has a sense of humor anymore.”Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on federal judicial nominations, told HuffPost it matters to plenty of judges that the president would try to discredit the federal court system.“The larger issue is undermining public confidence in an independent judiciary and separation of powers,” Tobias said."

Sponsored by the National Network of Abortion Funds, the National Abortion Access Bowl-a-Thon is a month-long fundraising initiative that encourages women and men to raise money for their local abortion funds. The bowl-a-thon has, at the time of publication, raised $1.4 million ― an amount way higher than their goal of $1 million.After the election, thousands of dollars poured into Planned Parenthood ― much of which was donated in honor of Vice President Mike Pence. Many also donated to independent abortion providers that function outside of Planned Parenthood.Many of these donations go to legislative or organizational support ― for exmaple, donations to Planned Parenthood Action Fund exist to “ensure that elected officials support policies and programs that help women and their families make responsible choices about family planning and reproductive health.” But what’s so special about NNAF’s model is that funds go directly to abortion clinics so that they can subsidize the cost of abortion procedures for women who can’t afford them, thus directly helping low-income women. And as legislators attempt to make access to abortion more and more difficult, fundraising goals went up. New York Abortion Access Fund (NYAAF) board member Brittany Caballero explained to HuffPost that “the goal is larger this year than before because the stakes are higher.” And Caballero said that people across the country are galvanizing in ways she hasn’t seen before. She told HuffPost that, last year, NYAAF’s bowl-a-thon raised less than $200,000. This year, they’ve raised well over $240,000.Abortion funds all over the country from the Bay Area to New Orleans to Buffalo are fundraising with bowl-a-thon events, and on April 23 in New York City, over beers and wings and black-light bowling, many were anxious to share why they were supporting their local funds and NNAF overall. One family, pictured below, wanted to support the cause because women’s bodily autonomy is “just common sense.”Josh and Julia, and their daughter Lucy, were part of the team “Sextina Awkwafina Goes to Planned Parenthood,” a playful take on the abortion-themed episode of Netflix’s “Bojack Horseman.” By the time the bowl-a-thon happened last Sunday, they’d raised close to $3000 for NYAAF.They told HuffPost that, after Donald Trump won the presidential election, they felt “an urge to become more involved.” They credited the Affordable Care Act for allowing them to plan for their 6-month-old baby daughter, Lucy, and want all women to have access to family planning like Julia did.Other teams, with names like “The Notorious RBGers” and “Women to the Front” also raised around $3000 for the cause, and did so in support of women being in control of their own futures and health. Barbara Kass, part of team “Knock Down the Pinheads” and highest ranked on the bowl-a-thon roster for fundraising, told NNAF that,” [t]his year I felt a bit daunted because of the enormity of the fight ahead of us but I’ve been motivated to aggressively raise money for NYAAF because without access, abortion rights are not a reality for large numbers of people.”Her team has raised over $13,000, but she raised $11,000 on her own. And while the New York-based fund is skyrocketing past its fundraising goals, Caballero told HuffPost that part of what’s so wonderful about NNAF’s model is that it allows for donations to go to the neediest funds. NYAAF has thus far raised over $240,000, but NNAF may disburse much of those funds to others in less abortion-friendly cities and states. That way, the women with the most need will be given the most support. “People working in abortion funds are on the front lines of [reproductive justice],” executive director of the New Orleans Abortion Fund Amy Irvin said. “We are talking to those most impacted, and living in the communities hurt most by unfair and unjust health care policy.”And there’s no question about it: women need support now, more than ever, as legislators continue to push “unfair and unjust” policy.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5900db3b1400001f00a9bfb5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Evin Cosby has written a strong defense of her father, Bill, ahead of his June 5 trial. In a piece for Black Press USA, Cosby wrote about the toll that the accusations against her father have taken on her family, and denied that her father has ever been sexually violent with women. More than 50 women have accused Bill Cosby of sexual abuse or rape, and in an upcoming trial, he’s facing charges for drugging and molesting former Temple University women’s basketball coach Andrea Constand in Pennsylvania in 2004.She placed much blame on “the cruelty of the media” for targeting her father.“The public persecution of my dad, my kids’ grandfather, and the cruelty of the media and those who speak out branding my father a ‘rapist’ without ever knowing the truth and who shame our family and our friends for defending my dad, makes all of this so much worse for my family and my children,” she wrote. Cosby also said that the media was “only interested in the stories of women.”She wrote nostalgically about her childhood with her famous father, and credited her parents for keeping her and her siblings down to earth in the midst of their father’s success.“I felt loved and remembered loving the moments that my parents shared with us by exposing us to all types of people from all walks of life,” she wrote. “We grew up appreciating my father’s success because we knew the prejudice and racism he endured getting to where he got and how hard he worked for our family.”Cosby also paints a very, very different picture of her father than the one that has been painted by the many women who spoke up about his alleged abuse. She writes: My dad broke barriers and raised the conscious of America on important topics, especially for the advancement of women. On “The Cosby Show” he only depicted women as smart and accomplished. On “The Cosby Show” and on “A Different World,” he took on then taboo subjects like menstrual cycles and rape, and even did a show on AIDS before anyone else would bring it up. I am his fourth daughter. He raised me to go to college, start my own business, and be my own woman. He is helping me raise my children and teach them family values. I know that my father loves me, loves my sisters and my mother. He loves and respects women. He is not abusive, violent or a rapist. Billy Cosby will go to trial on June 5 to defend himself over Constand’s accusations. Of his 50+ accusations, this is the only one for which he is being criminally charged.

He confirmed that Trump would propose cutting corporate taxes from the current rate of 35 percent to 15 percent and said the administration wanted to cut taxes for individuals, as well. Mnuchin did not present any plans to raise additional federal revenues. The Treasury secretary said economic growth of 3 percent would make up for any shortfall in tax revenue created by whatever the ultimate tax cuts may be.Mnuchin said the growth in federal debt under former President Barack Obama was “highly concerning” and told attendees that infrastructure spending will not be part of the tax talks between the administration and Congress.The Treasury secretary said the 15 percent business tax rate would apply to small firms and so-called “pass-through” companies, but insisted that the ultimate policy would not serve as a “loophole” for rich people to lower their tax rate. During the presidential campaign, Trump was dogged by questions surrounding his 15 percent business tax rate, which conflicted with his pledge to raise taxes on hedge funds and private equity firms. Many hedge funds are organized as pass-through corporations, as are many law firms. Many sources of income for the wealthy, such as book royalties, are often paid to pass-through corporations.“The president is determined that we will have tax reform,” Mnuchin said. “We like hard challenges. That’s why the president’s here … this is the center and the core of his economic plan.”Mnuchin said the Trump administration remains unenthusiastic about a Ryan-Brady plan to overhaul the tax code by replacing many current taxes with a so-called “border adjustment tax” on goods imported into the country.“We don’t think it works in its current form,” Mnuchin said, adding that the administration would “continue to have discussions” with House leaders on border tax “revisions that we will consider.”Mnuchin said the ultimate tax package will depend on further negotiations with Republicans in Congress. He declined to specify a legislative timeline for the deal.Jared Bernstein, former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden and a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank, threw cold water on Mnuchin’s comments during a panel following the Treasury secretary’s appearance. “This isn’t tax reform we’re talking about,” Bernstein said. “This is just tax cuts.”Maya MacGuineas, an austerity-minded fiscal hawk who runs the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget think tank, said Mnuchin was presenting “magical” numbers that would balloon the federal debt."

But the chief didn’t crack a smile.“I was not arrested,” he added. The justices were considering a criminal statute that penalizes anyone who “procures” U.S. citizenship in a way that is “contrary to law.” The government pressed the argument that any lie on an official form, no matter how small, is a violation that could trigger the loss of citizenship.But Roberts and some of the other justices seemed troubled by the implications for a vast swath of Americans. Roberts pointed out that some questions on naturalization forms are written broadly, so as to catch any little misrepresentation or omission that an overzealous prosecutor may later deem “material false statements” that could mean you should no longer be an American.One question on the naturalization form, for example, asks citizenship applicants to disclose any and all crimes, offenses or attempts to break the law for which they haven’t been arrested — ever.Zeroing in on the word “offense,” which a legal dictionary says includes even “minor” violations of the law, Roberts suggested that the government could potentially go after those who fail to disclose minor slip-ups years earlier. “Now, you say that if I answer that question ‘No,’ 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you can knock on my door and say, ‘Guess what, you’re not an American citizen after all,’” Roberts said. “Is that right?”When Robert Parker, the Trump administration lawyer who argued for the government, answered that authorities expect applicants for naturalization to disclose even trivial violations, Roberts wasn’t having it.“Oh, come on,” Roberts retorted. “You’re saying that on this form, you expect everyone to list every time in which they drove over the speed limit, except when they were arrested?”Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court’s more liberal members, seemed just as bothered.“It’s, to me, rather surprising that the government of the United States thinks that Congress is interpreting this statute and wanted it interpreted in a way that would throw into doubt the citizenship of vast percentages of all naturalized citizens,” Breyer said.Justice Elena Kagan added a lighthearted twist to Parker’s argument.“I am a little bit horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight, it has those kinds of consequences,” she said.The dispute arose when Divna Maslenjak, an ethnic Serb who was admitted as a refugee into the U.S. alongside her husband and kids, was later indicted for lying on her naturalization form. It turns out her husband had served in the Bosnian Serb military during the Bosnian civil war and was implicated in war crimes, but during her asylum interview, she had told immigration officials a different story: that the couple feared persecution because the husband wouldn’t serve in the military.When Maslenjak applied for citizenship years later, she denied in her application that she answered no when asked if she had ever lied about this and other information for purposes of obtaining an immigration benefit. This, in turn, prompted her prosecution for lying to the government, as well as court proceedings to strip her of her citizenship.“Why isn’t this obviously material?” asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of Christopher Landau, Maslenjak’s lawyer. “She lied about her husband’s ... she said he was trying to avoid military conscription when, in fact, he was in the service and in the unit that was committing atrocities.”Lower courts across the country are split on the gravity of the lies that may lead to denaturalization, and the Supreme Court must now determine what the threshold is. But by and large, a clear majority of the justices wasn’t comfortable with where the federal government wants it to be.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has written landmark opinions about how the law bestows dignity on all people, said the administration’s argument “is demeaning the priceless value of citizenship.”“That’s not what our cases say. That’s not what citizenship means,” Kennedy told Parker. In the last decade, more than 6.6 million people have become naturalized Americans, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.“You’re arguing for the government of the United States — talking about what citizenship is and ought to mean,” Kennedy added. (Both the Obama and Trump administrations have held the same position in the case, which has been ongoing for several years.)In the end, it was Roberts, the court’s leader, who saw the severity of the government’s position for what it is: as an opening for prosecutorial overreach.“If you take the position that ... not answering about the speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject that person to denaturalization,” Roberts said, “the government will have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want, because everybody is going to have a situation where they didn’t put in something like that ― or at least most people. And then the government can decide, ‘We are going to denaturalize you for other reasons than what might appear on your naturalization form, or we’re not.’“And that to me ... is troublesome to give that extraordinary power, which, essentially, is unlimited power, at least in most cases, to the government,” Roberts added.The Supreme Court may well decide that only egregious, “material” lies count for the purposes of stripping someone’s citizenship — a requirement that could stand as a roadblock for tougher immigration measures in the Trump era.The case, Maslenjak v. United States, is the last case the Supreme Court heard before the end of the current term. Between now and the end of June, the justices are expected to issue decisions on cases they’ve already considered."

The justices were considering a criminal statute that penalizes anyone who “procures” U.S. citizenship in a way that is “contrary to law.” The government pressed the argument that any lie on an official form, no matter how small, is a violation that could trigger the loss of citizenship.But Roberts and some of the other justices seemed troubled by the implications for a vast swath of Americans. Roberts pointed out that some questions on naturalization forms are written broadly, so as to catch any little misrepresentation or omission that an overzealous prosecutor may later deem “material false statements” that could mean you should no longer be an American.One question on the naturalization form, for example, asks citizenship applicants to disclose any and all crimes, offenses or attempts to break the law for which they haven’t been arrested — ever.Zeroing in on the word “offense,” which a legal dictionary says includes even “minor” violations of the law, Roberts suggested that the government could potentially go after those who fail to disclose minor slip-ups years earlier. “Now, you say that if I answer that question ‘No,’ 20 years after I was naturalized as a citizen, you can knock on my door and say, ‘Guess what, you’re not an American citizen after all,’” Roberts said. “Is that right?”When Robert Parker, the Trump administration lawyer who argued for the government, answered that authorities expect applicants for naturalization to disclose even trivial violations, Roberts wasn’t having it.“Oh, come on,” Roberts retorted. “You’re saying that on this form, you expect everyone to list every time in which they drove over the speed limit, except when they were arrested?”Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court’s more liberal members, seemed just as bothered.“It’s, to me, rather surprising that the government of the United States thinks that Congress is interpreting this statute and wanted it interpreted in a way that would throw into doubt the citizenship of vast percentages of all naturalized citizens,” Breyer said.Justice Elena Kagan added a lighthearted twist to Parker’s argument.“I am a little bit horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight, it has those kinds of consequences,” she said.The dispute arose when Divna Maslenjak, an ethnic Serb who was admitted as a refugee into the U.S. alongside her husband and kids, was later indicted for lying on her naturalization form. It turns out her husband had served in the Bosnian Serb military during the Bosnian civil war and was implicated in war crimes, but during her asylum interview, she had told immigration officials a different story: that the couple feared persecution because the husband wouldn’t serve in the military.When Maslenjak applied for citizenship years later, she denied in her application that she answered no when asked if she had ever lied about this and other information for purposes of obtaining an immigration benefit. This, in turn, prompted her prosecution for lying to the government, as well as court proceedings to strip her of her citizenship.“Why isn’t this obviously material?” asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of Christopher Landau, Maslenjak’s lawyer. “She lied about her husband’s ... she said he was trying to avoid military conscription when, in fact, he was in the service and in the unit that was committing atrocities.”Lower courts across the country are split on the gravity of the lies that may lead to denaturalization, and the Supreme Court must now determine what the threshold is. But by and large, a clear majority of the justices wasn’t comfortable with where the federal government wants it to be.Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has written landmark opinions about how the law bestows dignity on all people, said the administration’s argument “is demeaning the priceless value of citizenship.”“That’s not what our cases say. That’s not what citizenship means,” Kennedy told Parker. In the last decade, more than 6.6 million people have become naturalized Americans, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.“You’re arguing for the government of the United States — talking about what citizenship is and ought to mean,” Kennedy added. (Both the Obama and Trump administrations have held the same position in the case, which has been ongoing for several years.)In the end, it was Roberts, the court’s leader, who saw the severity of the government’s position for what it is: as an opening for prosecutorial overreach.“If you take the position that ... not answering about the speeding ticket or the nickname is enough to subject that person to denaturalization,” Roberts said, “the government will have the opportunity to denaturalize anyone they want, because everybody is going to have a situation where they didn’t put in something like that ― or at least most people. And then the government can decide, ‘We are going to denaturalize you for other reasons than what might appear on your naturalization form, or we’re not.’“And that to me ... is troublesome to give that extraordinary power, which, essentially, is unlimited power, at least in most cases, to the government,” Roberts added.The Supreme Court may well decide that only egregious, “material” lies count for the purposes of stripping someone’s citizenship — a requirement that could stand as a roadblock for tougher immigration measures in the Trump era.The case, Maslenjak v. United States, is the last case the Supreme Court heard before the end of the current term. Between now and the end of June, the justices are expected to issue decisions on cases they’ve already considered."

21,POLITICS,Trump Aims To Limit The Education Department's Influence In New Order,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-education-department-executive-order_us_5900e506e4b0af6d718aecfa,"But so far, it's more talk than action.",2017-04-26,President Trump wants Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to wield less power than her immediate predecessors.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59010a8a1c00002600e81e67.jpeg?cache=3ojXibZsrp&ops=crop_7_180_3473_1913%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that seeks to reduce federal intervention in education. It builds on vows he made during the campaign to dismantle the Common Core State Standards and hand greater control of schools back to states and localities.But initially, at least, the order doesn’t do much.The order directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to identify examples of federal overreach in her bailiwick, senior Education Department official Rob Goad said on a call with reporters. For the next 300 days, DeVos and a team of department staffers will analyze regulations and guidance to determine whether they legally overstep the department’s authority. “For too long the federal government has imposed its will on state and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less. My administration has been working to reverse this federal power grab,” Trump said on Wednesday. It’s not clear what policies Education Department officials will actually finger, and a federal law passed in late 2015 already returns a degree of education power to the states. But some of Trump’s supporters are hoping the administration acts quickly to roll back the federal government’s support of Common Core, as well as Obama-era guidance related to students’ civil rights. The Common Core standards are a set of education benchmarks that the Obama administration incentivized states to adopt. They were designed to make sure that kids received similar schooling across state lines. Conservatives, however, have rallied against them as an example of federal interference in local schools. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would work to erase them.Jane Robbins, a senior fellow with the conservative American Principles Project, has long advocated an end to Common Core. Although she has recently been critical of Trump’s seeming abandonment of the issue, she is optimistic about the new executive order. “I think it’s a very good first step. It indicates to me that all of the encouragement the grassroots have given to President Trump not to abandon his campaign promises on education have had some effect,” Robbins said. Because Common Core was adopted at the state level, the federal government can’t simply dismantle the system. Many states have been teaching kids under these learning benchmarks for several years now. As for students’ civil rights, some conservative- and libertarian-leaning lawyers have been pushing DeVos to rescind Obama-era guidance on the matter. The Trump administration has already rescinded guidance that provided protections for transgender students.Roger Clegg, president and general counsel at the Center for Equal Opportunity, has been pressuring the Trump administration to re-examine guidance related to student punishments. In 2014, the Education Department warned that it would initiate investigations into school districts with severe racial disparities in student discipline. Those disparities need not be the result of direct discrimination to warrant examination, the guidance states. Studies have shown that black students are suspended more frequently than white students, even for the same offenses. In late March, Clegg wrote to the administration calling for withdrawal of that directive. “It is bad policy because it means that perfectly legitimate school discipline polices can be struck down or abandoned because they have politically incorrect statistical results,” said Clegg on Tuesday, before the new executive order had been announced. Clegg said he has “reason to believe” the administration is taking his concerns seriously.“I think in the long term, a reason we have these disparities is because of the fact that unfortunately there are a higher percentage of discipline problems in some racial and ethnic groups than other racial and ethnic groups. It’s not anything genetic; it’s cultural,” said Clegg, pointing to the disparities in out-of-wedlock birth rates between black and white families. However, Catherine Brown of the progressive Center for American Progress thinks the executive order may not result in any significant changes. “I think it’s kind of silly. I feel like it’s purely symbolic,” said Brown. “I think he’s just trying to get as many executive orders before the first 100 days so he could claim it as credit.”"

The coach, widely considered to be the best in the NBA, has been known to leave generous tips when he dines at restaurants.

On Tuesday, the actress and show-runner joined co-producer, Jenni Konner, and moderator, America Ferrera, for an in-depth discussion on the legacy of the show at the Tribeca Film Festival. Ferrera, recalling her own experience starring on the ABC show “Ugly Betty,” asked Konner and Dunham how they felt about the reactions to Dunham’s “non-traditional” body. “Men, generally, were very angry that she felt comfortable showing her body,” Konner commented.“In the third season, a reporter from The Wrap raised his hand at [a press conference] and asked ‘Why do you show your body so much?’ And I had a rage spiral.”For Dunham, the vitriolic reaction to her body confidence seemed to stem from the fact that she didn’t feel she was being “so brave” by doing nude scenes. “I’ve always been like Rihanna to myself. Like, I just have a great time with my own body,” the actress explained.“I think people were so ready to believe that I was, like, jumping past some massive hurdle in order to get naked on television. That’s not where my fear lies. If that’s what scared me, I wouldn’t do it every week.”Dunham added that she got more criticism from men and women who “also didn’t have perfect bodies” than anyone else. “Some of the most love and compliments I’ve gotten have been from women who are considered to have perfect and beautiful bodies, who I think feel the constant pressure to maintain those bodies,” Dunham added.“They seemed to have felt freed in some way by seeing me just say ‘fuck it.’”Now that “Girls” is over, Dunham has plans to focus on her online feminist newsletter, Lenny Letter. She and Konner announced plans to expand the newsletter into a traveling variety show this May. "

People were most outraged over one of the $973 sneakers’ sayings, which read, “I’m Thin & Gorgeous.” HuffPost has reached out to Dolce & Gabbana for comment. “You don’t think it’s a little [irresponsible] to push a message of “Thin and gorgeous?” one commenter wrote on Gabbana’s Instagram account before adding, “I hope this will be followed by a message of inclusion of all bodies?” Other users wrote, “You don’t have to be thin to be Gorgeous!” and “thin?! 😵 I’m disappointed!” As he’s done in the past, Gabbana fired back at the people on Instagram who disagreed with the shoes’ message. “Darling you prefer to be fat and full of cholesterol ??? I think u have a problem,” the designer wrote to someone who disagreed with him, before calling other commenters “idiot” and “stupid.” Gabbana praised the people like his shoes (and who made up the majority of the Instagram comments). Over the past few months, Gabbana has landed himself in hot water for defending his decision to dress Melania Trump and for body-shaming Lady Gaga, who has revealed she has suffered from an eating disorder in the past.

I was just supposed to give the speech.”Coulter, one of the best-known conservative commentators in the United States, had been scheduled to give a speech critical of pro-immigration policies on Thursday. She said she may nonetheless still visit the campus that day.Last week, Berkeley officials said there was no safe venue at the campus on that date. They cited violent demonstrations by left-wing demonstrators in February hours before another right-wing media figure, Milo Yiannopoulos, was scheduled to speak.Berkeley proposed that Coulter speak on May 2. Coulter said she could not make that date and accused the school of an effort to limit her audience, noting that it fell in a study week ahead of final exams.On Tuesday, the Young America’s Foundation and the Berkeley College Republicans, which had organized the speech, sued university officials, accusing the public university of suppressing conservative speakers’ rights to free speech.Later that day, Young America’s Foundation said in a statement it could no longer sponsor the speech, blaming Berkeley officials. It said they had not offered assurances that campus police would protect attendees from any violent protests, a charge the school denied.“Berkeley should be ashamed for creating this hostile atmosphere,” the foundation’s statement said.Dan Mogulof, a Berkeley spokesman, wrote in an email that the university had “heard nothing” from Coulter or the sponsors. He declined to comment further, writing that he had “no interest in communicating with her through the media.”Mogulof also shared a letter sent to students on Wednesday by Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks in which he wrote that campus police had learned of threats of violence should the speech happen.“This University has two non-negotiable commitments, one to Free Speech, the other to the safety of our campus community members, their guests, and the public,” he wrote.(Reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington and Jonathan Allen in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

(Hint: It’s not actually weight loss!).We’re not actually looking to weigh less. We’re looking to feel better, and that’s the illusion that these companies are so masterful at creating. They create an aspirational future state where we feel free, look great, and are generally happy and not preoccupied by food and body issues, through the images, language, and storytelling of their marketing campaigns. These campaigns are effectively masking the truth about living a healthy lifestyle by making it appear as though weight loss is a clean, linear one-time journey, and then, poof! We’re healthy.The truth about weight loss is that it is not some clean, linear, one-time “magical” journey of transformation. Living a healthy lifestyle is a lifelong pursuit. Especially if you’re trying to lose more than 10 lbs, or have been above your “ideal” weight for longer than 10 years. And regardless of how much you weigh or how long you’ve been overweight, less that 5% of dieters manage to keep the weight they lose off for longer than five years.It bears repeating: living a healthy lifestyle is a lifelong pursuit. As long as you draw breath, you have to keep making your health a priority and take the most amazing possible care of your body if you want to be around as long as possible.This might sound discouraging, but it shouldn’t! Because here’s the kicker: you can feel the way you want to feel now, whether or not you lose the weight.This doesn’t mean stop trying to fuel your body with delicious, nourishing, and vibrant foods. And it doesn’t mean stop trying to find ways to show your body love through movement each day. It certainly doesn’t mean stop checking in with your doctor about your health and your weight as it pertains to your health.It means give yourself permission to be, do, have, or feel whatever it is you think you’ll be, do, have, or feel at the “end” of your “weight loss journey.”Because the journey never ends. And you’re worthy, right now, regardless of how much you weigh!Want more tips on how to break up with dieting and love your body harder than ever before?

The only family member who supported her decision at the time was her brother, who followed in her footsteps and became a police officer later. Today, Colonel Sharqawi liaises with UN Women and other international agencies on security sector reform and gender-responsive police services. Gender equality is becoming a priority within the Palestinian police force, and public perceptions about women in police are shifting.‘Have you lost your mind?’ was the typical reaction from friends and family when I decided to quit my job as a teacher in UNRWA school at my refugee camp to join the Palestinian Civil Police in 1997.We were living in the Al Amari refugee camp near Ramallah city. Not only was it unusual for a woman to join an all-male police force, but the public did not trust the security forces.But, it was my dream to wear the uniform!I refused to take administrative roles. While serving in challenging positions, such as the head of the Correction and Rehabilitation Center of Ramallah, I strived to set an example for other women.Almost 20 years later, public perceptions about the police and women in the force are shifting. Today, women make up 3.5 per cent of the Palestinian police force, and 18 women are serving in high ranking positions. There is an active gender unit, the first gender strategy and a professional family protection unit. Gender equality is becoming a priority, within the police.Palestinian women’s involvement in policing has enhanced the overall credibility of the force and improved our communication with the citizens. I want to see more women joining the police so that the force truly reflects and serves all citizens.My message for young Palestinian women who are interested in policing as a career is simple—It’s a journey worth exploring.”Lt. Col. Wafa Sharqawi, 48 years old was among the first women to join the Palestinian Civil Police in 1997. Today, she works in the Office of the Chief of Police’s Assistant for Development and Planning, where she liaises with international agencies on security sector reform. She works with UN Women on promoting gender-responsive police services and increasing the number of women in the police. Her story shows the importance of women’s leadership and participation in the security sector, and relates to Sustainable Development Goal 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.Read more stories in the “From where I stand...” editorial series."

Presented as a hand-held snack on thin-crusted but crunchy bread or on canapés of grilled or fried polenta, or as a sit-down first course with soft polenta, it has a soft, somewhat fibrous, almost airy consistency and a light flavor of fish, softened with oil and (sometimes) milk and often spiked with garlic and parsley.A friend of ours with fond family memories of baccalà saw that reference and wondered whether it was feasible to cook such things here in the New World. It is, and since he was joining us for dinner this week I thought I’d prepare not just a version of baccalà mantecato, but also a dish of rigatoni with baccalà based on a fine one we had at Al Covo restaurant in Venice during the same trip. I’ll write about the pasta soon but today will make a start with my batch of whipped codfish. A note on terminology: Generally speaking, baccalà and similar words refer to cod that has been salted for preservation but which, while dense, remains comparatively supple to the touch – hardly soft, but yielding, like a dry-cured raw ham such as prosciutto. In and around Venice, however, “baccalà” means what everybody else calls stockfish, which is air-dried and stiff as a board when you buy it. For both dishes on our menu, I opted for salt cod, purchased in nice boneless fillets (some salt fish packaged as baccalà or bacalao turns out to be pollack when you read the fine print: not a terrible thing to eat, but you shouldn't have too much trouble finding true cod, which is what you ought to buy).I soaked the cod – the package weighed one pound (450 g) – for 36 hours in a large container in the refrigerator, changing the water four or five times over that day and a half. Setting aside one piece for the next day’s pasta dish, I placed 12 oz (350 g) of the soaked fish into a saucepan with two peeled cloves of garlic, a few whole black peppercorns, a bundle of parsley stems, a sprig of fresh thyme and half a bay leaf, then added 1-1/2 cups (360 ml) each of cold water and whole milk, which in my pan was enough to just cover the fish – use as much as it takes to make sure the cod is pretty well submerged. I brought it up to the boil, then lowered the heat to a gentle simmer and cooked the fish for 25 minutes partly covered until easily flaked. I let it grow tepid in the cooking liquid, then transferred the fish to the work bowl of a food processor. You can also use a stand mixer fitted with a flat paddle, but I don’t see the advantage of this apart from its better mimicking the action of the traditional wooden spoon. I added a couple of tablespoonsful of the strained cooking liquid, the two garlic cloves (now soft and mild) and some salt (after its soaking, the fish is anything but salty), and ran the food processor until the cod was reduced to a fibrous mash. Now came the oil: with the machine running, I slowly added about a quarter cup (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil and not quite that much neutral oil. You can use all olive oil, but I find it too assertive. Now it is a question of tinkering. Salt and pepper needed to be adjusted and more oil beaten in, along with a handful of parsley (you can add whole leaves and let the food processor chop it as it is mixed in), half a raw garlic clove finely grated and the grated zest of half a lemon (a Microplane is the perfect tool for both the garlic and the lemon). At this point I refrigerated it (in the food processor work bowl) and when it was cool I made last-minute flavoring touchups. You may find the mixture a trifle wet; it will come together in the fridge, but one way to bind the cod is to beat in a couple of tablespoonsful of bread crumbs and give them a few minutes to soak up the moisture. That’s cheating, as is the addition of mashed potato, which isn’t to say that either practice is unknown in Italy or in my house. Now, I transferred it into a bowl, tightly covered it with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator, all ready for the next night’s aperitifs.To serve, I removed the mixture from the fridge half an hour before serving, then crisped small squares of cooked polenta in a lightly oiled skillet and topped each with a little mound of baccalà drizzled with a few drops of excellent olive oil and garnished with a few strands of grated lemon zest.Was it what we ate on the Adriatic coast? No: salt cod yields a different dish than stockfish. But in its own right it made a lovely accompaniment to a negroni or a geographically appropriate glass of prosecco. Recreating dishes eaten on vacation, even imperfectly, is one of the best souvenirs you can bring home."

No: salt cod yields a different dish than stockfish. But in its own right it made a lovely accompaniment to a negroni or a geographically appropriate glass of prosecco. Recreating dishes eaten on vacation, even imperfectly, is one of the best souvenirs you can bring home."

But Grand Canyon National Park made use of the unmanned areal surveillance tools in a search last week for Lou Ann Merrell, wife of the founder of the Merrell hiking boot company, and her step grandson, The Associated Press reports.Merrell and 14-year-old Jackson Standefer were hiking with family members April 19 when they lost their footing crossing a tributary of the Colorado River and were swept into the current.Searchers found a backpack and camera with photos of the two, but have not found the hikers.As part of the search effort, rangers made use of the park’s park’s five drones and four certified operators. The teen’s family also flew in specialists with a “Sky Ranger military-grade drone equipped with extra capabilities” to help with the search, according to a statement.The search has been scaled back, and the families said in a statement they support the decision but are still “praying for a miracle.”Despite the disheartening results of the drone search, rangers have found that the drones are important extra resources in tracking injured and lost people in the 2,000-square-mile territory, administrators told the AP. Last year, the park had 6 million visitors, 293 search-and-rescue missions, 1,200 medical emergencies — and 17 deaths, according to the news agency.National parks have also used drones for fire surveillance. In 2015, authorities successfully used a drone over the Paradise fire in Olympic National Park in Washington state to gather infrared information through a thick canopy of trees. This helped firefighters map blaze perimeters and areas that contained the most intense heat.But members of the public have also used drones to snap photos and videos of fires, which has, at times, forced firefighting aircraft to be grounded for safety. Besides being a far cheaper alternative to a helicopter and covering vast spaces quickly, the drones have the major added advantage of sparing rescue workers from the danger of flying over over fires, through dangerous canyon updrafts and close to cliffs. And they were a useful tool during the recovery process after the 2015 Nepal earthquake and, to a lesser extent, following Haiti’s 2010 quake and the 2013 typhoon in the Philippines.Drones can prove “pivitol” because of their ability to “provide information in real time to responders,” Meetu Vijay, Global Medic’s drone operator on the ground in Kathmandu and a member of Global Medic’s water and sanitation teams, told HuffPost in 2015.As rescue teams continue to search for Merrell and her step grandson, WTVC reported that a celebration of life will be held for the teen this week."

Note: strong language ahead.According to Courthouse News, the case goes back to 2011 when Hernan Perez of Pier Sixty and his fellow workers were told by a boss to “turn your head that way and stop chitchatting.” At the time, the workers were trying to unionize and the New York City event venue had a “no talk” rule in force to stop them from discussing it. Perez, a server who had been with Pier Sixty for 13 years, wasn’t happy about the incident and used his phone to vent on Facebook during a break. The Second Circuit quoted the entire post in its ruling: “Bob is such a NASTY MOTHER FUCKER don’t know how to talk to people!!!!!! Fuck his mother and his entire fucking family!!!! What a LOSER!!!! Vote YES for the UNION!!!!!!!”The workers voted to unionize two days later, and Perez removed the post when he realized it wasn’t private. He was fired when the company claimed the Facebook post violated its anti-harassment policy. The National Labor Relations Board ruled 2-1 that the firing violated labor laws. The three-judge panel of the Second Circuit upheld the decision last week, saying the Facebook post was “vulgar and inappropriate,” but “not so egregious as to exceed the NLRA’s protection.”The key? The subject matter was a “workplace concern,” in this case “management’s allegedly disrespectful treatment of employees, and the upcoming union election,” the judges wrote. The outburst “was not an idiosyncratic reaction to a manager’s request but part of a tense debate over managerial mistreatment in the period before the representation election.” Anyone thinking about using this ruling to justify their own social media outburst should beware of three other factors.First, the judges noted that one consideration was the fact that the use of profanity had been pretty much accepted at this particular workplace. The company “had not previously disciplined employees for widespread profanity in the workplace, including the words ‘fuck’ and ‘motherfucker,’ among other expletives and racial slurs.” Only five written warnings over profanity had been issued over six years, and no one had ever been terminated for it. “The [Administrative Law Judge] specifically credited employee testimony that Chef [Philip]DeMaiolo and [Robert] McSweeney cursed at employees on a daily basis including screaming phrases such as ‘What the fuck are you doing?,’ ‘Motherfucker’ and ‘Are you guys fucking stupid?’Second, the profanity was on Facebook and not “not in the immediate presence of customers nor did it disrupt the catering event.”And third, the protection for cursing out your boss has other limits, and this case might be right at the very edge of them. “Perez’s conduct sits at the outer‐bounds of protected, union‐related comments,” the judges wrote. Maybe it’s best not to post that message after all. "

In a 27-page petition submitted to the U.N. Working Group On Arbitrary Detention, Jared Genser argued that the Iranian government is arbitrarily depriving Siamak Namazi, 45, and his father Baquer, 80, of their liberty. Their treatment in Evin Prison amounts to torture, and risks causing “irreversible damage to their physical and mental health, or even death,” wrote Genser, the founder of Freedom Now, a nonprofit that works to free prisoners of conscience.The U.N. working group, established in 1991, can issue opinions on individual cases and urge countries to free prisoners who are being detained unlawfully. It has little ability to compel countries to abide by its recommendations, but a statement on the Namazis from the group could help apply pressure on Tehran. The decision by the Namazi family to make a public appeal to the U.N. group is part of a broader strategy meant to increase public awareness of Siamak and Baquer’s plight and to urge the Trump administration to strike a deal with Tehran to secure their release. Genser released his submission to the U.N. just before a delegation from the U.S. was scheduled to meet in Vienna with counterparts from Iran and the five other countries that helped negotiate a 2015 agreement over Iran’s nuclear program. He and Babak Namazi, Siamak’s brother and Baquer’s son, plan to hold a press conference in Vienna just before the world powers meet to discuss the Iran nuclear deal. “This will be the first face-to-face discussions between the U.S. and Iran since the inauguration of President Trump,” Genser wrote in an email. “We have been informed that the U.S. delegation will raise the Namazi cases directly to the Iranian delegation.”The State Department declined to comment on the Namazis specifically but a spokesman said the agency “continue[s] to use all the means at our disposal to advocate for U.S. citizens who need our assistance overseas.”Until recently, the Namazi family took a very different approach to getting Siamak and Baquer out of prison. When Siamak was arrested in October 2015, his family stayed quiet, hoping to give the previous administration room to negotiate. But when the Obama administration finalized a prisoner swap with Iran last year, Siamak was left behind. The month after the prisoner swap, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Forces arrested Baquer too. In their final days in office, Obama administration officials made a last-ditch effort to negotiate the Namazis’ release, but they were unsuccessful.After quiet patience proved ineffective, the Namazis decided to speak out. Last month, Babak Namazi briefed a group of reporters and human rights activists in Washington on Siamak and Baquer’s condition. He gave a detailed narrative of the family’s saga since Siamak was arrested in 2015 and said he hoped President Donald Trump would be able to accomplish what his predecessor could not.According to the petition filed by Genser, Siamak’s physical and mental state has deteriorated dramatically since he was first imprisoned. He is often kept in solitary confinement in a cell without a bed, forcing him to sleep on the concrete floor. He has been tortured by guards, beaten, hit with stun guns, and forced to watch government propaganda with images of him and his father in prison, Genser wrote. He has lost 26 pounds in prison as a result of a hunger strike. Baquer’s physical health conditions are even more serious. He has a heart condition that caused him to undergo triple bypass surgery before he was imprisoned. He has been hospitalized at least twice since his arrest but has not been allowed to see his heart specialist while in prison.Tehran’s denial of “medically appropriate detention conditions for the Namazis constitutes cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment,” Genser wrote in the petition. Despite being held in the same prison, Siamak and Baquer first saw each other in February, more than a year since Baquer entered Evin, Genser alleged in the petition. Siamak and Baquer have both been convicted of cooperating with a “foreign state” against Iran ― a reference to the U.S. ― and have been sentenced to 10 years in prison. They were only allowed to meet with the attorneys in Iran for a half-hour several days before the hearing, which was closed to the public and the media. According to Genser, they were not allowed to present evidence, call witnesses, or meaningfully challenge charges or evidence against them. The case against the Namazis appears to rely heavily on their past affiliation with Western organizations. Siamak held fellowships with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and the National Endowment for Democracy ― both of which receive funding from Congress. Baquer worked with the humanitarian relief organization UNICEF for over 10 years. At the time of their arrests, Siamak was working at an oil and gas company in Dubai and Baquer was retired and living Iran. Genser’s petition to the U.N. group is just as much an appeal to the U.S. government to focus on getting Siamak and Baquer released. He is conveying a message to the Trump administration that because of their deteriorating health and Baquer’s age, they don’t have much time to negotiate a deal. During the presidential campaign last year, Trump tweeted that he wouldn’t let Iran imprison Americans and demand money for their release if he became president. Earlier this month, the Treasury Department sanctioned the Tehran Prisons Organization and senior prison official Sohrab Soleimani for human rights abuses. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer mentioned Siamak and Baquer by name when he discussed the sanctions. Last week, an American imprisoned for three years in Egypt returned home after the Trump administration negotiated her release. Her release was possible, in part, because of the Trump administration’s willingness to drop pressure on Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to improve the country’s human rights record. But it’s not clear what leverage the Trump administration will have with Tehran. Unlike in Egypt, where he was eager to patch up relations, Trump has vowed to take a tougher stance in Iran. And he repeatedly criticized the Obama administration for giving up too much in last year’s prisoner swap, which means it would be hard for him to accept significant American concessions to bring Siamak and Baquer home.

We are in a race against time.”",2017-04-25,"Seven-month-old Zainab Nawaf, who suffers from malnutrition, is pictured at UNICEF-supported Al-Jumhouri Hospital in Saada, Yemen, on Nov. 13, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ffa2491c00003a00e81a73.jpeg?cache=E3mpouptfJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Members of the international community pledged to meet just over half of the United Nations’ $2.1 billion appeal to support crisis-afflicted Yemenis at a summit in Geneva on Tuesday, which U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres declared a “remarkable success.”He thanked donors for “generosity and solidarity” to help those affected by the two-year conflict in Yemen, where extreme violence between Saudi-led coalition forces and Houthi rebels has triggered mass displacement and one of the world’s most dire food crises.But humanitarian workers issued swift reminders that while $1.1 billion in promised funds will “mean the difference between life and death for millions of people,” millions more will remain without desperately needed aid.“Donors are leaving Geneva without having committed enough funding to meet the needs of just the 12 million most vulnerable” Yemenis, said Mutasim Hamdan, Yemen country director of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “I fail to grasp how the international community can see this crisis unfold without doing its outmost to limit the suffering that Yemenis are facing.” Of Yemen’s approximate 27 million citizens, a staggering 19 million are in need of humanitarian assistance ― including 17 million who don’t have enough food to eat. Desperate circumstances have forced families to resort to extreme survival measures, sometimes sending girls into early marriages and boys into combat.More than 2 million children in the war-torn country are malnourished, and some 500,000 could starve to death without imminent treatment. As Guterres noted at the summit, a Yemeni child under the age of 5 dies from preventable causes every 10 minutes.“With the [funding pledges] realized today, at least the U.N. and UNICEF would be able to respond to the most urgent needs,” Bismarck Swangin, UNICEF Yemen communication specialist, told HuffPost. However, he added, “We are asking the world to fiscally provide the needed resources for us to save lives. Until we’re able to get that full amount, any amount is definitely less than our expectations from the international community.”Geert Cappelaere, UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, issued a grim statement Tuesday, describing the severity of the crisis in stark terms: “Without further action from parties to the conflict and the international community, Yemen is at a serious risk of plunging into famine,” he said. “We are in a race against time.”Swangin further stressed that the country’s rapid deterioration highlights the urgency for an immediate escalated response.“The summit today will make a difference and will save children’s lives if we’re able to get the funds that have been raised as soon as possible,” he said. “Pledges are good, but money is better.”Swangin echoed Guterres’ warning that “funding alone will not reverse the fortunes of millions of people in Yemen,” asserting that humanitarian access and a cessation of violence are also essential.“The parties to the conflict on the ground must allow for unimpeded access to all parts of the country,” Swangin said. Additionally, “we need hostilities to cease so that displaced families scattered across the country are able to come out to points where they can receive medication and food.”Anxiety is growing over increased tensions and reports of a looming military offensive by the Saudi-led coalition in the city of Hodeidah. Located along the western border with the Red Sea, Hodeidah is a crucial port for humanitarian supplies transported from Djibouti, and nearly 80 percent of food imports.“The Hodeidah port is a critical lifeline,” David Beasley, executive director of the U.N.’s World Food Programme, said at the summit in Geneva. “Any disruption to the port would gravely hamper efforts to prevent famine.” When asked about the complicity of major donors that have supplied arms to warring parties in Yemen, Guterres reportedly responded: “The day in which there are no weapons sold to any warring parties anywhere in the world, it would be very difficult for war to take place.”"
45,THE WORLDPOST,France's Election Is About So Much More Than Just Populism,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-le-pen-populism_us_58fe5590e4b018a9ce5dbe65,The established political landscape is under threat across Europe.,2017-04-25,"Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate for France's 2017 presidential election. Although polls predict her losing the second round, Le Pen is claiming she will defy them with a surprise victory.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff87bd1c00002600e81a08.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The French made history in the first round of their presidential elections on Sunday, as neither of the two winners came from the country’s large, traditional establishment parties for the first time in modern France.Pro-European Union politicians and voters hope that independent candidate Emmanuel Macron will defeat far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the second round on May 7, giving a much-needed boost to an embattled EU. Polls predict that Macron will win with around 60 percent of the vote.Some hold up Macron’s first-round victory as proof that the forces of populism are no match for the current liberal order. But in fact, the French election can be seen as an extreme example of a trend across Europe, in which establishment parties and traditional left-right divides are being supplanted by new political movements, anxiety over national identity and radical parties railing against the effects of globalization.Even if Le Pen loses, millions in France will vote for her and she is set to remain a prominent political figure for years to come. France’s traditional left will still be in shambles and the country’s electorate divided.“That we’re talking about whether Le Pen will achieve between 30 and 40 percent of the vote is massively significant. It would have been unthinkable,” said Duncan McDonnell, an expert on populism and professor at Griffith University. The only other time the National Front reached the second round was in 2002, when Marine’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen was crushed in a landslide, 82 to 12 percent.Unlike her father, however, Marine Le Pen has managed to find support among a wide range of voters ― from youth who are facing a near 25 percent unemployment rate to voters who feel left out of the benefits of trade and globalization. “If you look at an electoral map of France in this past election there are basically two Frances, between who voted for Marine Le Pen and who voted for Macron. It’s in that sort of France that has been forgotten in many ways ― rural France, rust belt France ― that Marine Le Pen is doing really well,” said Mabel Berezin, a professor at Cornell University who writes on European politics. The stark divide is not solely the result of populist success, analysts say, but also of the failure of the ruling Socialist Party to address growing discontent among its working-class voter base.“The rise of the populist right both in France and in Europe more generally should be seen less of a cause than a consequence,” argued Sheri Berman, a professor of politics at Barnard College.“The center-left parties, the social democratic parties or labor parties, have really had a huge amount of difficulty adjusting to the economic and social challenges of the last several decades,” said Berman. “What that has done has fragmented its traditional constituency.”It’s not just the far right that has benefitted from the break-up of the traditional left, either, but some radical left parties as well. Communist-backed candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon gained nearly 20 percent of the vote in France’s first round, and was the favorite among youth voters. He campaigned on a platform opposing what he described as France’s “oligarchy,” and likened himself to U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)The French distaste for the entrenched political system was so strong that in the first round, over 40 percent of voters cast their ballot for candidates on the extremes of the political spectrum. Even Macron, a pro-EU former banker, claims he is anti-establishment and neither left nor right.What happened in France’s election isn’t unique. “Clearly in a whole range of European countries the allegiances of people are changing, party affiliation and loyalty are changing. People are now prepared to abandon their former ideological homes either on the center-left or center-right and vote for parties like the National Front,” said McDonnell.The fracturing of established party systems is prevalent across Europe. Last month, the Netherlands’ elections saw the labor-oriented PvdA go from the second most powerful party to the seventh in a catastrophic defeat. France’s ruling Socialists were effectively wiped off the electoral map in the first round of voting and gained only 6.4 percent of the vote. In Britain, the once-powerful Labour Party appears headed for a humiliating loss in snap elections this June.Italy’s center-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned last December following a referendum defeat, and now the most popular party is the ideologically amorphous Five Star Movement ― whose leader Beppe Grillo is a former comedian who applauded President Donald Trump’s election as a rebuke to the political establishment.While all these nations have domestic idiosyncrasies that make their political systems different, the threat to establishment parties is a cross-country trend.As with Le Pen in France, far-right populist parties have capitalized on and fostered this political fragmentation. Amid persistent antipathy toward the EU ― as well as a debate over how to address immigration and the refugee crisis ― far-right populists have gained support by arguing they will take power from a corrupt elite and return it to the people.These parties often possess a narrow and discriminatory definition of who “the people” really are, however, and it tends to exclude immigrants, Muslims and other minorities.In addition to railing against elite politicians and officials in Brussels, far-right populists have played on ethno-nationalist sentiment and accused establishment parties of favoring immigrant and refugee interests over those of native-born citizens. They have vowed to close borders, enact anti-Islam legislation and turn away from international institutions. Although there is an increased spotlight on the rise of populism following the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote and the U.S. election, Europe’s far-right has been a growing presence for decades. But now, in several European nations, some of these parties have reached unprecedented levels of support.In the countries where establishment politicians have held onto power, such as Germany, the U.K. and the Netherlands, they have often made capitulations to the far right. Dutch PM Mark Rutte hardened his stance on immigrants, German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed a ban on face veils and former British PM David Cameron notoriously gambled that the Brexit referendum would be a way of easing pressure from the anti-EU right. But these measures to undercut populist challenges may be a Band-Aid solution. If establishment parties fail to address the social and economic issues that are increasingly driving voters to the extremes, analysts believe populist parties may continue to thrive and grow in the opposition, where their policies don’t have to be tested.Though Macron is predicted to win the vote in May, he will face huge challenges as an inexperienced politician from a newly formed party tasked with fixing France’s myriad ills. Le Pen, meanwhile, will be able to point to any of his failings as proof her populist platform is the only real alternative to politics as usual. When France’s 2022 presidential election comes around, that appeal may be stronger than ever. "

The oil fields are still emitting toxic fumes that are sickening the camp’s residents.QAYYARAH, IRAQ – On the 1.2-mile (2km) stretch of hastily erected plastic tarp tents that makes up the Qayyarah Airstrip displacement camp, almost everyone is coughing, sick or complaining about smoke.“I’ve been coughing endlessly for almost a month,” says Abdullah, a 30-year-old from Tel Abta, pointing to a needle stuck in his hand – a treatment given to him at one of the nearby hospitals in Qayyarah, a district south of Mosul.“Everyone is sick,” he continues. “Children with small bodies that are still growing are breathing the smoke – so are pregnant women.”Not far away is the culprit: an unnaturally gray cloud pluming over the horizon. In July last year, militants of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) planted improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Qayyarah’s oil wells and shot at them with sniper rifles, causing extraordinary explosions and 25 oil fires whose smoke concealed the sky for months.Though the fires were originally intended to deter coalition airstrikes, they later became a ground tactic to thwart the U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces as they advanced on the town in the beginning of the push to recapture Mosul from the insurgent group last October.Since then more than 300,000 people have been displaced, and the battle has moved into densely populated areas in the west of the city.In March, eight months into the offensive, two of the original 25 fires were still ablaze. Firefighters from Iraq’s North Oil Company continue to pummel the persistent flames with water, in what has been nicknamed Iraq’s “second front” in the war against ISIS.Overhead, black smoke blocks the sunlight, making it difficult to work. Some fires are impossible to reach until the approximately 200 IEDs planted by ISIS militants around the flames before their retreat are dismantled.The unusual mix of toxins in the oil fires means that the workers, 15,000 residents of Qayyarah and nearly 50,000 people sheltering in the nearby U.N.-run displacement camp have become accustomed to the ubiquitous black tar. Every day, they breathe in toxic gases that hang heavy in the air long after the fires are extinguished.In early March, an attempt to extinguish one of these gas leaks inadvertently caused an explosion, sending a fresh plume of black smoke into the air, injuring dozens – and killing one of the firefighters who had been fighting the flames for months.“After the most recent explosion, we saw many cases of shortness of breath, and even suffocation,” Dr. Wael, one of the doctors in a recently resurrected hospital in Qayyarah district, told Refugees Deeply.“Over the past eight months, I’ve seen patients who claim that they have never smoked in their lives come in with their lungs coated in tar.”Dr. Wael has treated both residents of Qayyarah and people staying in displacement camps for smoke-related symptoms. He says that the displaced population are at a unique disadvantage due to the living conditions in the camp.“Of course, the first – and most important thing – is for those leaving Mosul to escape Daesh, and live in safety,” he says, using the Arabic acronym for the so-called Islamic State.“But now they’re sick from the smoke, of course, but also the conditions that they are living in at the camps,” Dr. Wael continues, lowering his voice. “They’re wearing the same clothes, and using the same blankets for months – some of them are even using the toilets in the same place that they get their drinking water.”In addition to living in hastily constructed and often squalid living conditions at the camp, its residents also have little access to medical care. Due to strict regulations on checking for ties to ISIS – particularly for military-aged men – many are not allowed to leave the camp for at least one month.While there are medics and medical facilities in the camp, run by international organizations such as Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), most are designed for basic first aid and are not equipped to treat the specific symptoms from which many in Qayyarah are suffering. Other camp residents are deterred from going to the hospital due to the cost of treatment or the lack of available transportation.“We are trying to treat as many people as we can, but I know there are many people we can’t reach,” Dr. Wael says.While the location of the camp in Qayyarah raises serious health concerns, it is not easy to find space suitable for such a mass displacement in Iraq. The U.N. refugee agency has built 11 camps around Mosul, with two more under construction. The land needs to be far enough from the front line to be deemed safe, yet close enough that those fleeing by foot can reach a place of refuge. The area needs to be checked for – and cleared of – land mines, which ISIS frequently leaves behind as they retreat. It must also be large enough to house tens of thousands of people.After the initial relief of escaping from ISIS, many residents of Qayyarah camp are beginning to wonder how long they will have to endure the camp’s conditions.“It was bad enough that we had to experience the worst of ISIS,” Hadia, Abdullah’s wife says. “Now we can’t even breathe.”This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff992c2600004500c47aa0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Energy Secretary Rick Perry supports remaining in the Paris climate agreement, but wants the United States to renegotiate its terms, he said Tuesday. That puts him on one side of a schism forming within President Donald Trump’s White House over how to handle the historic 195-country deal to slash emissions of greenhouse gases that cause global warming. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, first daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior adviser Jared Kushner, support remaining in the agreement; chief strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt ― two of the more radical, far-right voices in the White House ― want Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to exit the agreement.Perry, in a Tuesday morning speech at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference, tempered his view. He touted decreasing emissions last year in the U.S. and China ― the world’s top polluters ― and criticized European countries, such as Germany, for not doing enough to shrink their own carbon footprint.“There’s a lot of cheerleading the Paris accord and keeping the United States involved in that,” Perry said. “But the two countries that are making the real impact on emissions are the U.S. and China. So, I’m looking over at my friends in Germany and France going, ‘What are you all doing?’”It’s true that German emissions rose by 0.7 percent last year, driven largely by an increase in vehicles on the road and the continued use of coal to generate about 40 percent of the country’s electricity. The numbers stand in stark contrast to Germany’s hard-line policy supporting renewable energy, which now produces 30 percent of its electricity. The country plans to shutter all its nuclear power plants by 2022 as part of its energiewende, or energy transition, policy. “You have Germany, for instance, who has made the decision to go away from coal, to get out of the nuclear business, to double down, to hear them tell it, on renewables,” Perry said. “But the fact is their emissions have gone up because they’re using more coal, and they’re using coal that is not clean technology.” “My point is, don’t sign an agreement and then expect us to stay in an agreement if you’re not going to really participate and be part of it,” he added. “The United States has taken actions to affect in a positive way. I’m not going to tell the president of the United States, ‘Let’s just walk away from the Paris accord,’ but we probably need to renegotiate it and they need to get serious about it.”Speaking in the heart of liberal-leaning Manhattan at one of the clean energy industry’s most popular events, Perry repeatedly assailed opponents and critics of the new president, who will complete his first 100 days on Saturday. At one point, the cowboy boot-clad secretary said he would hold his tongue on why Texas trumps New York, so as not to offend his host, Michael Bloomberg, the Bloomberg LP CEO and former New York mayor.Taking aim at German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government in particular is on-message for the Trump administration. Merkel’s support for refugees and global trade contrasts with Trump, whose bombastic style and abrupt policy reversals put him at loggerheads with her soft-spoken and technocratic approach to leadership. Merkel reportedly had to explain the “fundamentals” of European trade to Trump 11 times. During a White House visit, Trump refused to shake hands with the chancellor, who enjoyed a close relationship with former President Barack Obama. After Trump’s surprise victory in November, Merkel was dubbed the “leader of the free world” because of the new U.S. president’s cozy ties and lip service to autocratic dictators.Perry criticized the Obama administration for favoring renewable energy, such as wind or solar power, over carbon-capture technology, a controversial technique of sequestering emissions from burning coal, gas and oil, and pumping them deep underground. The technology provides the basis of Trump’s promise to bolster “clean coal,” despite the fact that attempts to pull it off at power plants in the U.S. and Canada have so far failed.“Our predecessors led a war on coal,” Perry said, referring to the suite of Obama-era policies to limit carbon emissions from new coal-fired plants. He accused the previous administration of scuttling scientific research that offered politically inconvenient conclusions. It’s unclear if he was referring to findings about the cost or viability of renewables, or about greenhouse gas emissions’ role in causing global warming. Perry, who has publicly rejected the overwhelming scientific consensus that global warming is manmade, made no mention of climate change during his roughly 50-minute appearance on stage at the conference.“We will not hijack science for pet causes while suppressing it when it doesn’t fit a political agenda,” Perry said. “The last eight years saw policymaking driven by a political agenda.”“Those days are over,” he added. During his speech, Perry announced that he signed an order authorizing the Golden Pass liquefied natural gas plant in southeast Texas to begin exporting to countries that don’t have a free-trade agreement with the U.S. Construction of the new terminal, he said, would create 45,000 direct and indirect jobs over the next five years. In a clear criticism of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), a close ally of defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Perry bashed unnamed Northeast governors who refuse to green-light natural gas pipelines and projects.“Gas pipelines are a form of transportation that can drive the national economy and improve energy security,” he said. “Part of the country here in the Northeast is being denied natural gas access to their homes because of political opposition. Consumers are going to decide with their wallet, their vote or their feet when they move somewhere else.” That isn’t to say Perry rejected renewable energy outright. During his three terms as Texas governor, wind energy skyrocketed, transforming the oil-rich state into by far the largest wind producer in the country. With 11,592 turbines and 20,321 megawatts, Texas has three times the capacity of Iowa, the runner up. Many economists argue that heavy government investment in renewables is needed to help the industry compete with fossil fuels, which have for over a century enjoyed generous subsidies and tax incentives, and that the societal cost of carbon emissions should be factored into energy markets. Disregarding that, Perry said the Trump administration’s heavy emphasis on fossil fuels was more of a correction for its predecessor’s support for renewables than a complete reversal of policies.“No reasonable person can deny that the thumb and in some cases the whole hand has been put on the scale to favor certain political outcomes,” he said. “It is not reasonable to rely exclusively on fossil fuels. It is not feasible to rely exclusively on renewables. We’re working to find the right balance.” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff69e21400001f00a9bb68.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Billy Porter likes to think of his new album as “resistance with sass.”For “Billy Porter Presents: The Soul of Richard Rodgers,” the Tony-winning “Kinky Boots” star puts a fresh, contemporary spin on 12 classics from the Rodgers songbook. He’s called in a few A-list collaborators, too, including India.Arie, Pentatonix and “Hamilton” veterans Renee Elise Goldsberry, Christopher Jackson and Leslie Odom, Jr.Many of Rodgers’ contributions to musical theater, of course, have gone on to become staples of Americana. Though musicals like “Carousel” and “The Sound of Music” have been performed countless times around the world, Porter feels the political messages at the core of those shows still resonate today.“Because they’re so popular, because they’ve become so ubiquitous in our culture, because we’ve seen high schools do them, all of the politics have been sucked out of these shows,” Porter, 47, told HuffPost. “These people were pushing the envelope way back then! They were pushing it through art, and having these conversations through their work. It was thrilling!”For Porter, “Billy Porter Presents: The Soul of Richard Rodgers” fit perfectly into what he described as his “life’s mission,” which is to show “how the past influences the present and, hopefully, the future.”“Richard Rodgers’s music transcends time, race, ideology – everybody on the planet, even if they think they don’t know a Richard Rodgers song, probably knows one,” he said. “Pop music used to come from the theater, and the charge was lead by Richard Rodgers and his collaborators. They were the Kanye Wests, the Drakes, the Adeles of their day.”Though he began recording his album well before President Donald Trump’s surprise victory in November, Porter said the 2016 election had a heavy influence on the final product, which hit retailers April 7. The actor-singer dropped the album’s first single, a plaintive “Edelweiss,” on Inauguration Day, because the “Sound of Music” ballad is “a prayer for a country in crisis.” Similarly, the actor-singer originally had a female vocalist in mind for the “South Pacific” ditty, “I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair,” but instead, he hit the studio with Todrick Hall to record it as a duet.“They’ve taken gay men off the census, so we have to stay visible. They want to erase our presence,” Porter said. “We have to be active, and as artists, we get to do that through art. This is when we are needed the most.”It’s been a particularly busy few months for Porter. In addition to “Billy Porter Presents: The Soul of Richard Rodgers” and a series of concert engagements, the star is at work on two new plays. The first, he said, is called “The Untitled Sex Project” about “the lost generation of gay men who lived through the AIDS crisis who… know how to fight, but don’t know how to live,” and is currently in development at New York’s Public Theater. The second will be a contemporary gospel musical that has the working title “Sanctuary.” On a personal note, Porter married his longtime partner, Adam Smith, in New York on Jan. 14, just 16 days after getting engaged. Trump’s rise to power, he said, was the impetus for the couple’s decision to tie the knot so quickly. “I’ve been in this climate before,” he explained. “I lived through the AIDS crisis; I’ve been on the front lines fighting for a lot. I knew what was coming and I didn’t want to do it alone, and we were going to get married anyway, so it was just like, ‘Let’s do this now please!’”The conflux of politics and Broadway theater has made headlines as of late. In November, the smash musical “Hamilton” faced a conservative backlash after one of its stars, Brandon Victor Dixon, delivered an impassioned speech to Vice President Mike Pence when he attended a performance. Porter, who collaborated with Dixon on “Billy Porter Presents: The Soul of Richard Rodgers,” said he isn’t concerned about similar repercussions for getting political. “I call bullsh*t on that,” he said. “It’s been since the beginning of time that artists have been the ones who speak truth to power, and they know it.

56,POLITICS,Trump Could Roll Back Decades Of Progress That Made Immigrant Detention More Humane,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-immigrant-detention_us_58f0e2b7e4b0bb9638e34621,Detention centers aren't supposed to be like prisons.,2017-04-25,"A detainee goes to receive medical treatment at Krome, the Cold War missile base turned immigration detention center.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0e44214000021001b4550.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Human rights advocates spent years fighting for even small improvements to the system that detains men, women and children waiting to be either deported or released back into the U.S. Now they fear the progress they have made could disappear under President Donald Trump, who has promised harsher treatment of undocumented immigrants.“This administration is prepared to make conditions at immigrant detention even worse than they already are, which, given that for some people they’re already fatal, is terrifying,” said Mary Small, policy director of the advocacy group Detention Watch Network.Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is considering looser regulations for new contracts with jails to hold immigrants in deportation proceedings, The New York Times reported earlier this month. That agreement would allow jails to treat immigrants detained for civil offenses the same way they treat people charged with crimes. The department also plans to eliminate an office at Immigration and Customs Enforcement that focuses on improving the detention system and to ramp up detention and deportation efforts. Trump’s boosters consider these to be good things ― earlier this month, hosts on “Fox & Friends” gleefully remarked that the “party’s over” at immigrant detention centers, grumbling about detainees being given clean sheets and outdoor recreation time. In reality, immigrant detention centers ― some of which are inside jails facilities or former prisons ― are bleak places. Inmates report being denied medical care, held in solitary confinement, given inedible food and other mistreatment. This is all on top of the struggle of being locked up, often far from family and legal help. The facilities are supposed to be for civil detention, not criminal detention like a prison ― being in the country without authorization is not in itself a crime. Advocates are concerned that the Trump administration’s discussion of new contracts for jails to detain immigrants is more proof that officials will disregard standards meant to make immigrant detention less punitive. Chris Daley, an attorney with Just Detention International, said his group is “very afraid” those standards aren’t going to be enforced and that “we’re just going to lose any sense that folks are not there under criminal charges.” None of these issues were resolved under former President Barack Obama, who oversaw record deportations during his first term and vastly expanded the use of family immigrant detention. But advocates also achieved some gains during his time in office, including increased oversight; policies that limited solitary confinement and transferring detainees; and a new Office of Detention Policy and Planning to oversee reforms. In 2009, Obama’s first year in office, ICE made detention expert Dora Schriro the first director of the Office of Detention Policy and Planning and tasked her with overhauling the immigrant detention system. She laid out recommendations for improvements on oversight and conditions, and ICE officials met with nongovernmental organizations regularly to discuss detention matters. Most of the advocates wanted to reduce immigrant detention rather than simply reform it, said Ruthie Epstein, who at the time worked on detention policy with the advocacy group Human Rights First. “There’s always a tension between ‘Do we get rid of the cage or do we make a better cage?’” said Epstein, who now works for the New York Civil Liberties Union. “In the detention reform movement and prison reform movement there’s always that tension. I now see in retrospect even more clearly that the administration officials that we were communicating with were doing their best to figure out how to make the cage better.”ICE made small but significant changes during the Obama administration. In 2009, it issued a new policy on reporting detainee deaths. In 2010, it created an online detainee locator system so immigrants’ families and legal help could find out where they were. In 2011, the agency released an extensive new set of standards for immigrant detention, including improved medical services, more recreation and increased language assistance. In 2012, it issued a directive on transferring detainees meant to counter reports of abusive transfers that shifted people away from their legal help. In 2013, after reports that immigrants were being held in solitary confinement for weeks at a time, ICE issued a new directive on use of segregated housing. In 2014, as part of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, ICE finalized standards for preventing sexual abuse in detention.Rolling back any of these improvements could have disastrous consequences, advocates say.“If ICE is no longer tracking the use of solitary confinement or no longer requiring that people who are in mental health crisis are checked on every 15 minutes, that can kill,” said Carl Takei, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.It would be difficult for ICE to dismiss the standards set forth in the Prison Rape Elimination Act because they are regulations. But weakening other standards would hurt PREA’s effectiveness, Daley said.“You can’t have effective sexual abuse prevention programs if you have folks who don’t have access to appropriate materials in the right language; who can’t communicate concerns they have about threats or violence; who are just held in solitary confinement as a matter of course or who otherwise are just being treated in a demeaning way that compromises their dignity,” he said.ICE hasn’t made any major changes yet, other than eliminating its Office of Detention Policy and Planning. The office’s staff and mission will be absorbed into other parts of the agency, according to ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez. Officials are “examining a variety of detention models to determine which models would best meet anticipated detention needs” as part of one of Trump’s executive orders on immigration, Rodriguez said. “As new options are explored, ICE’s commitment to maintaining excellent facilities and providing first class medical care to those in our custody remains unchanged.” The new contracts could be evaluated based on a checklist from the U.S. Marshals Service, The New York Times reported last week. That checklist is “ridiculous in its lack of detail,” Takei said. The contracts wouldn't specify what policies jails holding immigrants must maintain for medical health, suicide prevention or solitary confinement, other than that they need to have some sort of policy, according to the Times. Advocates are bracing for the worst. “We’ve seen important but very incremental change, so to see change that’s taken so long to come about ― and that still had gaps but that was at least a step toward greater accountability and toward better conditions in these facilities ― to see that now be threatened to be reversed is troubling,” said Katharina Obser, senior program officer at the Women’s Refugee Commission.They will be watching closely for human rights violations, from detainees being denied due process to poor conditions and even increased deaths in detention.“These policies are a recipe for a human rights catastrophe in immigrant detention,” Takei said, “and we are prepared to sue as soon as that human rights catastrophe comes to pass.” Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

57,BUSINESS,Waymo Is Quietly Winning The Self-Driving Car Race,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/waymo-self-driving-cars-phoenix_us_58ff913fe4b0b6f6014b560b,"While Uber was talking, the Google spin-off was rolling.",2017-04-25,"One of Waymo's self-driving minivans passes by the city hall in Chandler, Arizona, in this undated Waymo handout.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ffbe081c00003a00e81b07.jpeg?cache=EsVzpmy2nk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If actions speak louder than words, the self-driving car company Waymo might as well be shouting.Waymo, the startup spun off from Google last year, said Monday it will add 500 self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans to its fleet, bringing the total number of autonomous vehicles it has on the road to about 600.The bulk of those additional minivans will operate in the Phoenix area, where Waymo has been quietly operating a test program for select families, with plans to open up its free program to hundreds more for a public trial.“Over the course of this trial, we’ll be accepting hundreds of people with diverse backgrounds and transportation needs who want to ride in and give feedback about Waymo’s self-driving cars,” CEO John Krafcik explained in a blog post.“Rather than offering people one or two rides, the goal of this program is to give participants access to our fleet every day, at any time, to go anywhere within an area that’s about twice the size of San Francisco.”The addition of 500 vehicles will dramatically increase Waymo’s ability to capture critical mapping data ― and to use that data to improve its software (read more about that here) ― launching the company even further ahead of competitors like Uber and Lyft (though probably not Tesla, which has a couple billion miles under its belt, compared with Waymo’s 3 million).Waymo’s self-driving fleet isn’t just larger than Uber’s (as of March 8, Uber had 43 cars). It’s also substantially better at driving.According to documents filed with the state of California, Waymo’s human drivers had to take control from the automated system (called “disengagement”) once for every 5,000 miles its cars drove in 2016.Backup human drivers in Uber’s self-driving cars had to take over about once every mile as of March 8, according to documents obtained by Recode (Uber doesn’t make its data publicly available).Some of the difference can be attributed to location. Uber is testing many of its cars in Pittsburgh, which has much more challenging climate and geography than Phoenix. Waymo is also testing vehicles in Texas, California, and Washington state.Waymo and Uber have been fighting a fierce battle over intellectual property. Waymo has accused Uber of stealing some of its critical technology in a lawsuit. The case is scheduled for a hearing May 3, when a judge could halt Uber’s self-driving program until the case is resolved."
58,ENTERTAINMENT,TV Writers Just Authorized A Strike That Would Blackout Late Night,Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hollywood-writers-guild-votes-to-authorize-strike_us_58f628ade4b0b9e9848e962e,The WGA writers' strike just took a big step toward reality.,2017-04-25,"Late-night shows including ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" would go dark immediately in the event of a writers' strike.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f633f114000049001b4e2b.jpeg?cache=mUPOaIDsep&ops=crop_1446_155_1543_1122%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Over nine years after the last writers’ strike shut down production of dozens of popular TV shows for 100 days, another protest looms over Hollywood.After a week of open polls, members of the Writers Guild of America have voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike, should a new contract agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers not be reached before the current one expires May 1. Of the 6,310 people who cast a vote, 96.3 percent voted yes.“We thank you for your resolve and your faith in us as your representatives. We are determined to achieve a fair contract,” the negotiating committee said in a statement.The strike would begin May 2, causing an immediate late-night blackout. Depending how long it lasts, programming for the 2017-2018 season could be delayed along with future movie releases, while the impact on scripted summer shows currently in production would be felt sooner.Although WGA members have authorized a strike, it’s only an option, for now: There is still a small amount of time for their representatives to reach a new agreement with AMPTP, the organization representing producers and studios ― their employers. Once talks between the parties resume after a weeklong break on April 25, the WGA will be able to leverage the threat of a work stoppage in negotiations as it represents 12,000 writers in the entertainment industry who produce content for theaters, traditional networks and online services. The Huffington Post is unionized under the auspices of the WGA-East.The dispute stems from demands by TV writers who, despite living in the “golden age” of television currently enjoyed by viewers, haven’t reaped the benefits themselves. While there are more shows, and more quality shows, available to viewers than ever before ― in 2016, we could flip between more than 450 original scripted series, if you ask FX ― studios are ordering fewer episodes. Instead of two dozen episodes per season, a series on Netflix or HBO, for example, may only contain one dozen or fewer. And since writers are paid per episode, working on a season’s worth results in less pay. Added to the equation are common “exclusivity provisions” that prohibit writers from working on more than one series at a time.Writers have been fighting to ease that exclusivity requirement, for a bump in pay, and for larger contributions to the union’s health plan by employers ― reportedly the biggest sticking point between the two sides."
59,BLACK VOICES,Jaywalker Beaten In Street By Cop Claims Abuse Continued In Jail,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jaywalker-beaten-police-lawsuit_us_58fe5ffbe4b06b9cb9195a97,"Nandi Cain is suing authorities in California for what he calls ""racially biased"" attacks.",2017-04-25,"Nandi Cain, 24, is suing city and county officials in Sacramento, California, alleging civil rights violations for a beating at the hands of police and sheriff's deputies. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ed29c01b0000320016af66.png?cache=SRQqRqCbFh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A black man punched repeatedly by a Sacramento, California, police officer who confronted him for jaywalking claims he was later stripped naked, beaten and taunted by jail guards. Nandi Cain Jr., 24, says in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed Monday against Sacramento city and county officials that the “racially biased” abuse violated his constitutional rights and left him with an untreated concussion, black eye, broken nose and mental condition. A witness video recording shows Cain on April 10 exchanging words on the street with the officer, identified in the lawsuit as Anthony Figueroa. As Cain removes his jacket, the video shows Figueroa tackle him and punch him several times. Cain was charged with resisting arrest. He also was charged with previously missing a Fresno court date stemming from a trespassing case from his days as a homeless 19-year-old. After he was taken to the Sacramento County Jail, the lawsuit says, several sheriff’s department deputies joined Figueroa in a fresh attack. Figueroa forced Cain to lie face-down on the floor of a cell, and the group of officers kneed him in the ribs as they removed his clothing, according to the suit. Cain says feared he would be sexually assaulted and began sobbing. “After robbing Mr. Cain of his manhood and basic human dignity, the men left him alone in his cell, without medical attention, food or the opportunity to make a phone call,” the lawsuit says. Authorities released Cain hours later, citing insufficient evidence for the resisting-arrest charge. His attorney, John Burris, said the only thing Cain did wrong was “walking while black.” Pedestrian advocates agreed, telling the Sacramento Bee that video shows no reason for the officer to accost Cain. “The conduct was wrong and inappropriate,” Burris told HuffPost of the cops’ behavior. “He was traumatized emotionally.”Cain, who lives with his girlfriend, has not returned to work as an electronic-parts salesman. Being outdoors makes him paranoid, and he feels uncomfortable being “that dude who got beat up by police on the internet,” he said in an interview with the Sacramento Bee on Sunday.Sacramento police declined to comment on the lawsuit. The sheriff’s department did not answer HuffPost’s inquiries.Police previously criticized the officer, but declined to identify him, saying only that he was a two-year veteran. “The actions of the involved Sacramento Police Officer are disturbing and does not appear to be reasonable based upon the circumstances,” the department said two weeks ago. Figueroa has been suspended with pay during the investigation.The police account of the confrontation said Cain challenged the officer to a fight, and “the officer charged at the pedestrian to take him into custody.” Cain’s lawsuit says the officer approached with his hand on his gun, so Cain removed his jacket to show that he was unarmed. Cain “informed the officer that if he wanted to pick a fight the officer should at least be a man and remove his duty belt and fight Mr. Cain fairly, as opposed to making up false accusations to justify unwarranted police harassment,” the lawsuit says. The police department says that Cain, even after he was handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police cruiser, remained combative by kicking the seats. Cain acknowledges kicking the seats in his lawsuit, saying he had “an overwhelming feeling of being helpless and abused.” He says he passed out en route to jail. “I’ve been embarrassed and discriminated against, when all I’ve been trying to do is go home from work,” Cain said at a press conference Monday.

62,WOMEN,This Activist Nun Live-Tweeted The Arkansas Executions,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-activist-nun-live-tweeted-the-arkansas-executions_us_58ff4bfce4b0288f5dc7edc8,"""Why do we kill people to show that killing people is wrong?""",2017-04-25,Sister Helen Prejean is an activist and the author of <em>Dead Man Walking.<br></em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ff82321400002000a9bc10.jpeg?cache=dHpgsxlWRw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Monday night, the state of Arkansas killed inmates Jack Jones and Marcel Williams, completing the United States’ first double execution since 2000. For Sister Helen Prejean, an activist nun from Louisiana who has become a leading figure in America’s anti-death penalty movement, it was a night of heartbreak.Prejean, whose book about capital punishment, Dead Man Walking, was made into an award-winning film, has been tweeting her concern about Arkansas since February. That’s when Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced plans for a flurry of executions. The state initially planned to conduct eight executions over a 11-day period in April, arguing its supply of a lethal injection drug would expire on April 30.Prejean has been rallying opponents of the death penalty together to call and tell Hutchinson and Arkansas’ attorney general Leslie Rutledge to “stop the killing spree.”As a Catholic, Prejean’s activism is rooted in her faith. When Gov. Hutchinson tweeted out a Bible verse on April 23, one day before his state planned to carry out double executions, Prejean was quick to respond with some choice words for the fellow Christian. On Monday, after hearing that the last legal avenues to prevent the executions were exhausted, Prejean turned her attention to mourning and telling the inmates’ stories. Jones, 52, faced the death penalty for the 1995 rape and murder of Mary Phillips, an Arkansas bookkeeper, and for attempting to kill Phillips’ 11-year-old daughter. Years later, Jones’ lawyers said he suffered from poor health. He was a diabetic patient and an amputee. His lawyers worried that the high doses of drugs he was on could prevent the lethal injection from working properly. And according to Harvard Law School’s Fair Punishment Project, he also suffered from mental illness and was a victim of sexual abuse.In a series of tweets sent out as Jones faced death, Prejean used research compiled by the Fair Punishment Project to describe the inmate’s past. And in doing so, she reminded her followers of his humanity.The AP reported that Jones was executed shortly after 7 p.m Monday evening.Marcel Williams, 46, was on death row for raping and killing a 22-year-old woman named Stacy Errickson in 1994.Williams, who weighed 400 pounds, was diabetic. His lawyers were concerned that Williams faced a “torturous” death because of his obesity.Like she did for Jones, Prejean took to Twitter to tell her followers about Williams’ past. According to the Fair Punishment Project, Williams had apparently grown up in “crushing poverty” and had been the victim of sexual abuse since he was a child. Prejean used the Fair Punishment Project’s research to tell Williams’ story. Williams’ death was briefly delayed Monday night after his lawyers expressed concern about how Jones’ execution was carried out. The lawyers claimed Jones was “gulping for air,” which Arkansas’ attorney general denied.A federal judge lifted the stay on the execution. The AP reports that Williams was pronounced dead at 10:33 p.m.Gov. Asa Hutchinson initially scheduled eight executions within a span of 11 days, which would have been the highest number of killings in such a compressed period since the Supreme Court death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Arkansas has killed three inmates so far this year, with one more scheduled for Thursday. The four others have been blocked. In a Facebook post last week, Prejean reiterated her belief that the death penalty isn’t merciful or just ― she believes it’s vengeful. “The Jesus that I know spoke out against vengeance, even to the point of giving up his own life. Jesus was a convicted criminal executed by the state,” she wrote. “That’s why I don’t understand how Governor Hutchinson can call himself a pro-life Christian while planning to kill 8 people in 11 days. The death penalty is antithetical to everything Jesus stood for and is a gross violation of the sanctity of life.”"

Irving Ltd, will pay 3.02 percent.All other Canadian producers face a 19.88 percent duty, according to the document.The preliminary determination directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require cash deposits for the duties on all new imports as well as softwood products imported over the past 90 days.To remain in effect, however, the duties need to be finalized by Commerce and then confirmed by the U.S. International Trade Commission after an investigation that includes testimony from both sides.

Actually, he said, “fucking stop it.” On April 19, the “Orange Is The New Black” and “How To Get Away With Murder” actor attended a screening, along with HuffPost, for The Representation Project’s 2015 documentary about masculinity, “The Mask You Live In.”Mic caught up with McGorry at the event and asked the actor what he would say to men who use feminism as a tactic to hit on women. “Fucking stop it and examine your privileges,” McGorry told Mic. “If that’s what your desire is to use feminism for, then understand that you probably have a lot of work to do on yourself, not only to be a better ally but actually to be a happier human being,” adding that men “can’t be our truest and our happiest selves if our masculinity and our happiness is based on controlling others and manipulating others.” McGorry, who recently became an ambassador for The Representation Project, joined on a conversation with Jennifer Siebel Newsom, documentary maker and co-founder of The Representation Project, after the screening about toxic masculinity.While fans have struggled with McGorry’s feminism (as a straight, white, privileged dude), the actor was quick to repeatedly point out his privilege.When one audience member asked McGorry how he approaches people who don’t believe in the feminist cause, the actor was quick to hedge.“The way that I deal with it, is the way I suggest only white people talk to other white people, only men talk to other men,” McGorry told the crowd of about 60 people. “I don’t think it’s my place to say how people of color should talk to white people or how women should educate men.”So, from man to man, please don’t use feminism to pick up women.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fe8f041c00003a00e8174a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“13 Reasons Why” is Netflix’s latest buzzed-about show, sparking dialogue about suicide, mental health and sexual assault among teens and their parents. The series, based on the 2007 book by Jay Asher, tells the story of Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford), who takes her own life after facing numerous traumatic experiences in high school. She records 13 tapes to give to the individuals who she says played some sort of role in her death, leaving her friend Clay (Dylan Minnette) to uncover the harsh reality behind her heartbreaking decision. The show sheds a light on important issues rarely tackled on screen, but conversations around the subject matter have been mixed. Some believe it presents the truth to teens who might be unaware of what’s happening around them in the form of entertainment. Others, including experts, have said the show “glamorizes” suicide with its graphic scenes depicting death and rape. But creator Brian Yorkey and the show’s writers purposely chose to include those hard-to-watch moments to spark awareness about situations going on in our world every day. “Facing these issues head-on — talking about them, being open about them — will always be our best defense against losing another life,” writer Nic Sheff wrote in an essay for Vanity Fair. “I’m proud to be a part of a television series that is forcing us to have these conversations, because silence really does equal death.”Star Kate Walsh, who plays Hannah’s grieving mother on the show, echoed those sentiments in an interview with HuffPost on Build Series Monday.“People have been reacting differently to showing Hannah in the act of suicide and all the other sexual assault scenes, rape scenes. But Brian was intent on making sure there was nothing romantic or mysterious that anybody could project on to this to make it some dreamy, gothy or some romantic Ophelia moment,” she said. “I think there’s a lot of this idea in the mystery and the shame and the secrecy of suicide that no one talks about, that you can project this idea that it’s all going to be peaceful and blissed-out ... [but] to really deal with depression and mental illness and these huge issues and show what it really looks like if someone tries to take their life ― it’s ugly and it’s really hard and it should be seen.”Walsh went on to say that watching “13 Reasons Why” should be “mandatory in schools,” as it opens up discussion about the weighty issues many people face day in and day out. “Parents and teachers and students [should] watch this and have conversations about sexual assault, about bullying, about LGBTQ issues, race issues, gender issues, suicide, depression and mental health, because largely in our country as we see now, it’s still in the shroud of shame or silence,” she said, “So to really see it for what it is and talk about it and get people help, [we can] prevent it.”There’s no doubt the series is tough to watch, but as Walsh says, it gives children the chance to be honest with each other and their parents about the content they’re consuming and how they’re reacting to it. As most of us know, high school is not always an easy place to be, especially in this social media age where bullying is skyrocketing. “I think [parents] should watch it with their kids and I really do think it should be mandatory in schools to watch this and talk about it and have education around it,” Walsh concluded. “Unfortunately, a lot of kids’ lives were lost before schools started having conversations and awareness, and communities started having dialogue about it. As long as anything is shrouded in shame or secrecy, nothing good can come from it.” Watch Kate Walsh’s full interview on “13 Reasons Why” below. The show is now streaming on Netflix."

On the same day, Abe apologized over controversial remarks recently made by his disaster reconstruction minister, who said that the people who voluntarily evacuated from areas tainted by Fukushima nuclear disaster should take responsibility for their own decisions./ Source: Yonhap News</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fdde3b1c00001400e8145a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tokyo correspondent Um Soo-ah & reporter Kim Ye-jinThe recent controversial remarks by ministers in the Cabinet of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have sparked criticism about slackness in the government.According to the Mainichi Shimbun on Sunday, Regional Revitalization Minister Kozo Yamamoto apologized after coming under fire for calling curators “the No. 1 cancer” that needs to be “wiped out” at a seminar in Otsu on April 16. Toshinao Nakagawa, Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, resigned from the ruling party over an extramarital affair.Masahiro Imamura, Disaster Reconstruction Minister, told reporters on April 7 that those who voluntarily evacuated due to high levels of radiation after the outbreak of the Fukushima nuclear disaster were “responsible for taking care of themselves.” He was being asked by reporters about the government’s responsibility for supporting evacuees. He then shouted at one of the reporters who kept asking questions to “get out.”Starting this month, the Japanese government will lift evacuation orders for the “restricted residence areas” and the “areas under preparation for lifting the evacuation order”. Lifting of evacuation orders means an end to support for evacuees.Imamura apologized for being emotional, but failed to appease evacuees’ anger. He visited the disaster-hit public housing in Miyagi prefecture on Saturday and said, “I apologize again for causing concern.”Despite ministers’ verbal gaffes, the approval rating of Abe’s Cabinet was higher than the previous month, according to the Mainichi Shimbun. The result was same for public polls released by major media such as Kyodo News, Asahi Shimbun, and Yomiuri Shimbun.This seems to be the result of the recent Abe administration’s focus on North Korea by emphasizing the possibility of North Korea’s sixth nuclear test. The Mainichi Shimbun poll showed that the approval rating has risen 1% point to 51% compared to the previous month. The survey was conducted on 1,011 people aged 18 and over nationwide by telephone on April 22-23.In a poll released by Kyodo News on Sunday, the approval rating for Abe’s cabinet rose 6.3% points to 58.7%. According to a Asahi Shimbun poll released on April 18, the approval rating increased by 1% point to 50% from the previous month, and a Yomiuri Shimbun survey showed that it was 60%, up 4% points from the previous month.The Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Cabinet members are carelessly making verbal gaffes due to stable approval ratings for the administration which have been exceeding 50% recently. DP Secretary-General Yoshihiko Noda said, “The series of off-key statements made by Cabinet members shows negligence on the part of the administration.” Akira Koike, the secretariat chief of the Japanese Communist Party, urged Yamamoto to resign, saying, “The one who needs to be ‘wiped out’ is someone like this Cabinet member.”"

Who knew! </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58feac1b1400002900a9b9ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What the evidence says about preventing unborn deathsAbortion has been in the news a lot recently. Whether it’s Donald Trump reinstating the global gag rule, new laws in the US defunding women’s health services, or the resurgence here in Australia of support to fully decriminalize abortion, abortion has been talked about a lot recently across the world.This argument is usually a screaming match between one side who thinks that women should have the right to do what they want with their bodies and another who think that a small cluster of cells should have the same rights as a human being.These debates are stupid.Harm ReductionIt’s pretty obvious why a pro-lifer would be against abortion; they’d see it as murder. I disagree (equating a bundle of cells to a baby is flaming hot insanity), but honestly the diffuse moralistic question of whether there is a black-and-white point at which a sperm and egg become a person is bucket of boring philosophizing and not really useful to anyone’s life.This is public health. We don’t care about what feels good. We care about what works.The pro-life argument is that unborn lives are the most important part of the equation. Here are 5 evidence-based strategies that would actually make sure that fewer unborn lives were lost;1. Contraception: it’s important to remember that banning abortion doesn’t work. Abortion bans don’t decrease the number of unborn lives lost, they merely make it less safe for women who need to access the procedure. But something that is absolutely proven to reduce the number of abortions is effective, cheap contraception. The first element of any truly pro-life argument should be making contraception more accessible, particularly for underprivileged women who are more likely to have difficulties accessing health services.2. Preventing Smoking In Pregnancy: It may come as a shock if you have been isolated from the world since 1940, but smoking kills. What’s less commonly known is that smoking is one of the leading causes of death for unborn babies. Smoking is associated with a 20% increased risk of unborn death, as well as a huge array of negative consequences for the baby. The second part of a truly pro-life strategy would be to dramatically increase the funding for smoking prevention programs in pregnant women.3. Preventing Drinking In Pregnancy: another cause of unborn death is alcohol. Depending on the level of drinking during pregnancy, alcohol can increase the risk of unborn death by up to seven times, but even at low levels of drinking there is evidence of serious harm to the baby. A truly pro-life approach would mean putting in place programs to help pregnant women drink less, as well as a population-based approach to make drinking less common generally.4. Reduce Rates Of Obesity: it turns out that another huge risk factor for unborn babies is the weight of the mother. If we want to reduce the number of babies who die before being born one of the most important things we can do is address the social and economic causes of obesity as well as fund programs to help expectant mums lose weight.5. Adequate Women’s Health: another way that we could save countless unborn lives is by making sure that health care for women is adequately funded. This includes sexual health services, pregnancy clinics, post-birth care and a whole bunch more. It’s amazing that so many so called “pro-life” arguments don’t mention making sure that all women can access medical services during their pregnancy. Being truly pro-life would mean increasing funding for free pregnancy care to all women.A Truly Pro-Life AgendaYou’ll notice one very important point; none of these have anything to do with abortion. That’s because calling an anti-abortion stance pro-life is like saying that you’re anti-death because you oppose murder. People don’t just die from murder, and unborn babies die from a lot of things that aren’t abortion. We know that legislating against abortion doesn’t save lives because it doesn’t stop women from having abortions.It just stops women from accessing safe abortions. And unsafe abortions kill.Not very pro-life after all.It’s not that hard to be truly pro-life. Cheap, easily accessible women’s health services do a huge amount to reduce the number of babies (and mothers) who die during pregnancy. In fact, Planned Parenthood in the US provides many of the services that are key to preventing unborn babies from dying.Guess who most “pro-life” activists are vehemently against?A truly pro-life agenda would be to address all the causes of unborn death, not just the one that you are ideologically opposed to. It would encompass increased funding for women’s health, better social programs aimed at preventing smoking, drinking and obesity, and a universal contraception program that was accessible for all women. You’d see fewer babies dying in the womb, but also fewer newborn, child and maternal deaths.Or we could keep arguing about what women are allowed to do with their wombs.An easy choice, methinks.If you enjoyed, take a second to click on the heart below to let me know!

This is the only instance in more than six decades that France has seen a candidate for president in the runoff who ultimately rejects the traditional parties of the left and right. Thus, whoever wins the runoff in May, whether centrist Emmanuel Macron or far-right Marine Le Pen, will have a tricky job ahead of them as they seek to embrace a festering rebellion and push through new policies.In the fall of 2016, the shift began to take shape with surprising primary election results of mainstream parties. Les Républicains saw the elimination of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, as well as Alain Juppé, prime minister under former French President Jacques Chirac. In December of the same year, François Hollande, the outgoing president, decided not to run for re-election because of his dismal approval ratings. In January 2017, Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, was eliminated in the Socialist Party’s primary elections. Voters continued with unabated determination to shake the oldest and most entrenched political establishments to their core, eroding the traditional parties in the process.Now, for the first time in this current governmental system, neither one of the large parties of the right and left, which have shaped France’s political life for over 60 years, is represented in the runoff elections for the presidency. Benoît Hamon, the candidate for the ruling Socialist Party, garnered just above a mere 6 percent of the votes cast, and François Fillon, the candidate of Les Républicains, only got approximately 20 percent. Only an average of about one out of four voters supported one of the two major powers that have historically driven politics in recent years.The two candidates who came out on top of the first round and who will face off again in two weeks, have clearly indicated that they do not wish to be part of the old left-right paradigm. Emmanuel Macron, who obtained close to 24 percent of the votes, calls himself a centrist and a year ago created a new type of movement called “En Marche!” ― which roughly translates to “Onward!” ― that claims to attract supporters from both the right and the left and also from civil society. Marine Le Pen, who garnered close to 22 percent of the votes, also rejects the old left-right dichotomy and intends to play on the opposition between “patriots” and “globalists.”This shift in France is therefore historic because the forces of an open society and those of a society where the focus is on national identity are opposing each other in a way this country is not used to. But it’s also a pattern not unlike what the world is witnessing elsewhere. In Great Britain with Brexit and the United States with the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, an increasing number of nations are experiencing a profound crisis in their established political order and discovering the power of opposing forces when confronting issues such as globalization, a united Europe or even borders. This new dualism on the electoral landscape stems from a social gap between the upper and middle classes on the one hand, and the working class on the other.And we saw it here on Sunday. In the first round of France’s election, 33 percent of white-collar workers voted for Emmanuel Macron, while 37 percent of blue-collar workers chose Marine Le Pen, according to an Ipsos poll. Additionally, 27 percent of voters who claimed to work in a profession that is thriving voted for Macron, whereas 30 percent of those who felt that they practice a profession in decline chose Le Pen. Further, about 32 percent of those who said they can easily make ends meet with their household income voted for Macron, while 43 percent of those who said they do so with difficulty chose Le Pen. The fight in France is therefore both political and social.Currently, Emmanuel Macron appears to have the better odds in the runoff election. As early results poured in for round one, polls showed that 62 percent of voters had indicated their intention to vote for Macron next time, while only 38 percent seemed to favor Le Pen. However, the far-right leader, whose anti-immigrant platform continues to frighten a number of French voters, scored 20 points more than her father ― National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen ― did in the runoff presidential elections of 2002, when he took 18 percent. It is worth noting then that nationalist protests have made great strides in the past 15 years and may continue to prove significant in French political life ― even if Le Pen loses.If Macron wins the presidency next month, he will have to face two additional challenges. He must overcome a strong radical leftist movement centered around Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a candidate who won about 19 percent of the votes. And he must amass a majority in the upcoming parliamentary elections in June without which the new French president will not be able to push through economic and social reforms.As he solidified his spot in the final two, Emmanuel Macron declared his intention “to break completely with a system that has been incapable of dealing with [French] problems for more than 30 years.” He certainly has the ambition, but he will need to acquire the political means if he is to make this ambition a reality.

Growing up in Nigeria, I suffered several bouts of malaria when I was young, with intense headaches and fever. The latest World Health Organization statistics show that more than 400,000 people died from malaria in 2016 and pregnant women and children (like I was) are the most susceptible. My best friend was not as lucky as me, and when we were 9 years old, she died from cerebral malaria because the treatment she was given was ineffective.A long-term outcome of my own experience with malaria and that of my friend is that I have dedicated my professional career to finding innovative ways to stop the spread of malaria infection in Africa. One of the biggest obstacles I see is that despite Africans suffering from malaria infection the most, 92 percent of malaria deaths in 2015 occurred on the African continent, the majority of the research against malaria takes place outside the African continent. This makes no sense. Instead, if we want to control malaria we need donors to invest more of their money in training African scientists who will oversee future malaria control innovations.There is an urgency for this to happen now. Current research shows that the drug used to treat malaria, artemisinins, is failing in Southeast Asia due to drug resistance. Now there are fears that this resistance will spread to Africa, increasing the number of malaria deaths even more. Unfortunately, these fears seem to be justified as a recent study has shown that three patients, who presented with malaria at a hospital in Britain, had already received prior malaria treatment which didn’t clear their parasite infection. These patients were travelers who became infected in Angola, Liberia and Uganda and when they relapsed, the doctors realized that the artemisinin-based drugs had failed and the patients were subsequently treated with different drugs. But this means that the typical drug of choice has started losing its efficacy on the African continent.If this is going to be the African reality in the near future, it means Africans need to be in a position to control the spread of resistance. Fighting malaria requires specialized and skilled scientists, yet the majority of African countries lack them. It is devastating that as a young malaria researcher, I do not see a good representation of Africa scientists carrying out malaria research at international conferences like the American Society for Tropical Medicine. This is simply because Africans do not have the same research opportunities as their counterparts. I personally had to go through my training outside the continent due to the lack of an enabling environment for science research and development.Right now, most of the malaria funding comes from donor organisations and countries and a lot of the research is done in institutions outside of Africa, even though Africa is where the burden is. Various donor organisations have threatened to drastically reduce and, in some instances, stop funding for malaria research to recipient countries because of poor management of donor funds. Recipient African countries simply cannot maintain gains against malaria with the current country contributions and so it is important that international funding does not cease. We need direct investments that improve scientific capacity to be made by both international organisations/donors and governments of African countries. That funding can help ensure that the right scientific skills needed to reduce malaria in Africa are home grown. These skills can be fostered by encouraging Africans’ entry into STEM subjects and through direct investments in science, technology and innovation. It is absolutely important to create innovative ways to maintain transparency in donor fund spending, to prevent incidences of mismanagement if funds are to be directed where they are needed. Then, Africans can find solutions to their own problems and malaria elimination strategies will be planned from within individual African countries as opposed to an office in New York. They will have complete ownership and direction of projects and/interventions. This is especially important as no one African country is the same as the other and a tailored research and implementation approach is necessary. Simply replicating a program in Nigeria, for example, because the same programme worked in the Gambia is not realistic, especially as both countries have different profiles and even political systems which have an effect on the feasibility of malaria control programmes/strategies. Ultimately, although there have been major gains in malaria reduction with the majority of effort from international organisations, to get to the point of malaria elimination, African countries have to be the major drivers of malaria control strategies. Thus, on World Malaria Day, this is a direct call to both international organisations and leaders in African countries to invest directly in research as a means of sustainably controlling and eradication the spread of this scourge.

With May 1 around the corner around the corner, it is a question worth asking.Immigrants are working families and they are under attack like never before in this country.Donald Trump’s administration pursues unprecedented attacks on immigrant and refugee families. Raids on immigrant families are escalating. Mothers who have been here for over a decade have been ripped from the arms of their children. Immigrants with legal status have been unlawfully detained. The deportation police have targeted schools and even gone to courts to track down domestic abuse victims.At the same time, the basic resources families need to get by are under threat. It is becoming harder to pay for doctors when we are sick, earn good wages that allow us to feed our families and keep a roof over our heads or receive paid family leave so we can spend time with young babies. More than 45 million people, or 14.5 percent of all Americans, live below the poverty line.For example, instead of moving to improve the Affordable Care Act or expand Medicare, the GOP instead attempted to pass a new controversial health care bill, which would have resulted in a $600 billion tax cut for the rich at the expense of leaving up to 24 million Americans without health care.I grew up undocumented and my father almost lost his ability to walk because he could not get health care and treatment he needed to treat a chronic condition. I understand the acute stress that immigrants and working people go through in times of hardship. According to a Federal Reserve poll, around 47% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and a family crisis such as a medical ailment can quickly become an existential threat.Bad policies that harm working Americans continue to chip away at our aspirations to strive and do better financially than our parents. But this moment has also sparked a wave of activism and organizing not seen in a long time in this country. Thousands of people have taken to the streets in marches that have touched on issues like Women’s rights, support for science, the release of Trump’s taxes, climate change, and opposition to the Muslim ban.On May 1 in cities, towns, and communities across the country, hundreds of thousands of people will rise up in resistance to demonstrate the power, resilience, and strength of immigrant communities and progressives in America.Keeping families together is an American value that must be defended with all the urgency and passion we can muster.This May Day we will continue to take to the streets to call for what we believe is a progressive platform centered on people that truly empowers and looks out for our communities. We call for a return to real and humane debate over immigration, a raise in the minimum wage to $15 an hour, the end of the for-profit prison system, affordable college education, voter restoration rights to the thousands of disenfranchised voters across the country, equal rights for the LGBTQ community, and climate justice to protect communities, such as those in Florida, that are on the front lines of climate change and sea level rise.President Trump has attempted to discredit these protests by obfuscating crowd sizes and claiming that protestors are paid. It is concerning to see these efforts to undermine the First Amendment of everyday people who seek to have their voices and grievances hurt, which is why it’s more important than ever that people not only protest but also get more deeply involved to fight back against these policies which hurt our country.This May 1st join over 42 organizations across the country that make up Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) and join the fight to protect working and immigrant families across the country, the latter which contributed $105 billion in state and local taxes and nearly $224 billion in federal taxes, according to the Partnership for a New American Economy.America becomes a greater nation when we stand together and reject racism, hatred, and bigotry, and work together to build a better future for everyone.

Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) told a group of high school and middle school students last week that it’s fine to be a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer community ― but if you’re too open about it, don’t be surprised if you get picked on.On Thursday, Enzi was speaking to students at Greybull High School and Middle School when a student asked him what he was doing to support LGBTQ people in Wyoming. Mathew Burciaga, an editor at the Greybull Standard, was at the event. The Standard published a rough transcript and audio of the event Tuesday evening.“What work are you and your comrades doing to improve the life of the LGBT community in Wyoming?” the student asked Enzi. “How do you plan to help Wyoming live up to its name as ‘The Equality State?’”“There are a lot of problems that don’t have a federal, one-size-fits-all solution,” Enzi replied, according to the Standard’s transcript. “Everything can’t be done by law; that’s one of the problems we have in this country, thinking that everything could be done by law. What we need to have is a little civility between people.”“We always say that in Wyoming you can be just about anything you want to be, as long as you don’t push it in somebody’s face,” the senator went on. “I know a guy who wears a tutu and goes to bars on Friday night and is always surprised that he gets in fights. Well, he kind of asks for it. That’s the way that he winds up with that kind of problem. I’d be interested in any solutions that you have for how we can make that work better.”“The biggest thing that we need is civility,” he said.Burciaga told HuffPost in an email that he thought the comment was “tone deaf by my own personal opinion of it.”Reached for comment, Max D’Onofrio, a spokesman for Enzi, said the senator stressed the importance of respecting other people and argued that protections mandated by Washington are not always the best solution. “He talked about how many Wyoming folks take a live and let live approach to life, but we need to be conscious that everyone may not react the same way to differing value and belief systems. He advocates nothing but respect and civil treatment for members of the LGBT community,” D’Onofrio said in an email. He added that “no one should take his remarks out of context or misconstrue them to mean anything but advocacy of kindness toward our fellow citizens.”Enzi apologized in a statement, expressing regret for “a poor choice of words”: I believe all individuals should be treated with respect. I do not believe that anyone should be bullied, intimidated or attacked because of their beliefs. Wyoming’s population is made so great by its mixture – and tolerance – of differing value and belief systems. Our live and let live approach is one of the great aspects of our state. It is important that our students learn that the importance of respecting all people and how it is incumbent on those in the communities we live in to treat others as you would want to be treated. It is such a simple lesson ― it is never permissible to hurt another. Hatred in any form is destructive to the very foundation upon which our society is built. Sara Burlingame, the public education and outreach coordinator for Wyoming Equality, also said Tuesday night that Enzi personally called her organization and apologized for his remarks. “We’re grateful to Senator Enzi for his swift apology to the Greybull students and his constituents. We were deeply disappointed to hear of Senator Enzi’s remarks to students and teachers at Greybull Middle School and felt confident that it did not reflect his commitment to all citizens, including Wyoming’s LGBT population,” she said, adding that Wyoming Equality looked forward to sitting down with him when he returned to the state to further discuss matters. In 1998, Laramie, Wyoming, became the site of one of the nation’s most horrific and infamous anti-gay hate crimes when college student Matthew Shepard, 21, was tortured and left to die. Outcry over his death eventually led to passage of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which extended federal hate crime protections to people targeted because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender or gender identity, or disability. “Sen. Enzi’s comments are exactly the kind of hateful remarks we are working against in Wyoming and beyond,” the Matthew Shepard Foundation said in a statement to HuffPost. “To tell a person that they are ‘asking for it’ is the same kind of harmful rhetoric people use to disqualify the claims of sexual assault victims. It’s the same kind of rhetoric that keeps up to 61% of hate crime victims from reporting because they are afraid of not being believed while also having to be fearful of being re-victimized by those in power, who should be defending their rights. The Matthew Shepard Foundation will continue to fight against this kind of hate speech as long as it continues.”UPDATE: April 27 ― Greybull Principal Ty Flock tells HuffPost that Enzi has spoken to him three times since the event and has authorized him to relay that he’s apologized to Flock and the school, as well as offered to apologize in person to the student who asked the question. Flock said the student declined Enzi’s offer, saying he had already apologized enough. Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."
74,GREEN,We've Hit Yet Another Frightening Milestone For Carbon Dioxide,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/410-ppm-co2-limit_us_58fd8e77e4b018a9ce5c4463,This is going to get worse before it gets better.,2017-04-24,This graph shows the annual mean carbon dioxide growth rates observed at NOAA's Mauna Loa Baseline Atmospheric Observatory.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fda9231400002000a9b5ea.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The level of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere just keeps going up and up, in an ominous trend that suggests the ravages of climate change are only going to get worse.Last Tuesday, the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii recorded its first carbon dioxide reading above 410 parts per million — specifically, 410.28 ppm. For context, in 1780 or so, around the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, that figure was only about 280 ppm; by 1958, when the Mauna Loa observatory began taking continuous measurements of atmospheric CO2, it had come up to about 315 ppm.The planet breached the scary 400 ppm limit in 2013, and now we’re already past 410. The atmosphere hasn’t had similar levels of carbon dioxide in it for about 3 million years.President Donald Trump has dismissed climate change as a “hoax,” despite the nearly universal scientific consensus that it represents a looming threat to the planet. Meanwhile, the ever-growing load of CO2 in the atmosphere is pushing the goals of the Paris climate accords further and further out of reach — regardless of whether Trump chooses to stay in the fight.As the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere keeps rising, scientists are already warning that we could soon surpass records set 50 million years ago.Carbon dioxide spewed into the air by burning fossil fuels is the key greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. CO2 levels in our planet’s atmosphere are rising 100 times faster than at the end of the last ice age, according to NASA. “This is a real shock to the atmosphere,” Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association said last month.Nearly 200 nations around the world have agreed to cut carbon emissions in an effort to hold the average temperature increase to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degress Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.The U.S., however, likely won’t be part of that battle. Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, isn’t convinced that CO2 is a “primary contributor” to increasing temperatures, and thinks we need more precise measurements before we can know exactly what role fossil fuels play in climate change.Earlier this month, Pruitt said the U.S. should “exit” the Paris agreement because it’s a “bad deal” for the country.Even with a strong global commitment to reducing CO2, the stuff that’s already in the air will take a very long time to dissipate, and only then after concerted effort. The rate of CO2 increase will “go down when emissions decrease,” said Tans. “But carbon dioxide will still be going up, albeit more slowly. Only when emissions are cut in half will atmospheric carbon dioxide level off initially.”And even then, scientists agree, the effects of climate change will linger long into the future.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide measured in 1958. It was 315 parts per million, not 280."

Six million Jews, two-thirds of the Jews in Europe, murdered by the Nazi genocide. They were murdered by an evil that words cannot describe, and that the human heart cannot bear,” Trump said in a speech to the World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly in New York on Yom HaShoah, Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day.“On Yom HaShoah, we look back at the darkest chapter of human history,” Trump added. “We mourn, we remember, we pray, and we pledge: ‘Never again.’”In January, on international Holocaust Remembrance Day, a Trump administration statement failed to mention Jews, the overwhelming majority of those who were killed in concentration camps under Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.Earlier this month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer triggered an uproar when he said Hitler did not sink to the level of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad by using chemical weapons.Spicer later apologized after his comments aroused criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that millions of Jews were killed in Nazi gas chambers.Trump’s four-minute message included somber references to Jewish suffering in the Holocaust, a commitment to support Israel and a rebuke of prejudice and anti-Semitism.“We must stamp out prejudice and anti-Semitism everywhere it is found. We must defeat terrorism, and we must not ignore the threats of a regime that talks openly of Israel’s destruction,” Trump said in an apparent reference to Iran.(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

Two decades later, she had to move again after another mine served her an eviction notice. But in 2010, when yet another company threatened to mine on her property, she’d had enough.Bowman, now 83, filed suit, refused offers of millions, and despite being surrounded by mines on three side, has worked to protect her land and an important waterway from contamination ever since.She is one of six conservationists ― one from each inhabited continent ― honored this year with the Goldman Environmental Prize, billed as the world’s most prestigious award for grassroots activism. Past awardees have fought against air pollution in Slovenia, defended land rights in India and helped spearhead lead cleanup efforts in Los Angeles.In Australia’s Hunter Valley, a fertile wine region about 100 miles from Sydney, coal mining has rapidly expanded, spurred by increased demand in Asia. The area is now home to dozens of coal projects, including 16 open cut mines like those Bowman has long fought.Speaking from San Francisco ahead of the award ceremony, Bowman said the region where she lives has changed dramatically over the past 30 years. “The whole landscape has changed,” she said, adding that “even the wind comes in a different direction. ”Along with the environmental impact of huge, city-sized pit mines, most of the families that grew up in the Hunter Valley are no longer there, she said.“The thing is, a lot of those mining people were very cruel and very arrogant, they treated the land owners very badly,” Bowman said. “People just sold and went because they couldn’t stand it any longer. So many of the original families have gone.”Bowman was one of the early landowners who ceded control of their property. Coal dust coated her crops, got in the milk she tried to sell and even settled in her lungs. She says 20 percent of her lung capacity is gone thanks to the pollution. A 2015 report by the Climate and Health Alliance estimated that coal burning in the Hunter Valley contributed to about $450 million in health care costs annually.Two moves later, Bowman landed at a farm called Rosedale and launched a group called Minewatch NSW to help landowners face off against energy companies. But it was only a few short years before another coal company, Yancoal, tried to force her to sell Rosedale as well. Bowman refused, and a court decision protected her land for as long as she decides to keep it.Speaking about the experience, Bowman said she knew at the time that if she sold, a half dozen other farms would be affected by her decision, because the mine would’ve been right next to a creek that irrigated her neighbors’ properties.“It meant that if this water became so bad, like it had before, all the farmers downstream would’ve had to go,” Bowman said. “Having seen the destruction on the two pieces of land I loved so much, I couldn’t see the destruction of this area.”Bowman’s behind-the-scenes work nonetheless drew the notice of those at the Goldman Environmental Foundation. When someone called Bowman to tell her she’d won an award and a one-time grant of $175,000, she thought it might have been a scam.The fight against mammoth corporations, often energy developers, is a common theme linking this year’s Goldman Prize winners. Prafulla Samantara, the winner for Asia, launched a 12-year legal battle to defend an indigenous community from an open-pit aluminum mine. Rodrigo Tot, an indigenous leader in Guatemala, did the same against nickel mining operations. American mark! Lopez worked to hold a battery recycling plant accountable for pollution from heavy metals, and Uroš Macerl of Slovenia helped stop a cement company from fouling the air.Perhaps the most high-profile prize winner this year is Rodrigue Katembo, 41, a wildlife ranger in the Democratic Republic of Congo who was featured in the Oscar-nominated documentary “Virunga.” Katembo, a former child solider, was a longtime ranger in Africa’s oldest national park, a World Heritage site home to the most of the planet’s remaining mountain gorillas and one of the deadliest places on the planet for wildlife defenders, 160 of whom have been killed in the area over the last 15 years.Despite the threats, Katembo went undercover to document how a British oil giant, SOCO International, attempted to conduct illegal oil exploration in the park. The footage he collected cost the company millions in funding and forced SOCO to announce it would give up an oil license in the park.But the effort was not without its own trials: During the campaign to expel the company, Katembo was arrested and tortured for more than two weeks. Upon his release, he went back to work immediately.“I was not more special than the 160 workers who had already died to protect the park,” Katembo said.He has since been transferred to Congo’s Upemba National Park and has faced ongoing threats. He expressed hope that the Goldman Prize would bring Upemba international recognition so it gains its own World Heritage status.All six winners of the Goldman Prize will be celebrated at a ceremony in San Francisco at 5:30 p.m. local time on Monday. The award gala will be streamed live here. A separate ceremony in Washington, D.C., will take place on Wednesday."

Soon after the transfer, Szenia unexpectedly died and now PETA is blaming the death on the company’s decision to separate the pair.“Szenja died of a broken heart, PETA believes,” Tracy Remain, executive vice president of PETA, said in a statement. “After losing her companion of 20 years when SeaWorld shipped Snowflake to the Pittsburgh Zoo in order to breed more miserable polar bears, Szenja did what anyone would do when they lose all hope, she gave up.”Dan Mathews, PETA Senior Vice President, echoed Remain’s words, highlighting the fact that same-sex relationships in the animal kingdom are not a unique phenomenon.“Homosexuality has been observed in more than 500 species, from polar bears to chickens,” he told HuffPost. “This shows not just how natural it is to be gay but also how much we have in common with all animals ― and why their rights must be respected. SeaWorld routinely tears apart marine-mammal families, and in this case, it sentenced a desperate same-sex couple to a miserable life and death. That’s why SeaWorld’s business is tanking.”The video below shows Szenja playing with a new toy days before her death.SeaWorld, however, sees things differently and doesn’t think the separation as the cause of death.“SeaWorld and other accredited and world-class zoological facilities remain focused on our important mission of animal conservation and public education and inspiration,” David Koontz, director of communications at SeaWorld San Diego, told The Huffington Post. “We will not be distracted by organizations with a clear anti-zoo agenda creating false narratives not grounded in any scientific fact.”Koontz then went on to say that polar bears tend to function primarily as solitary animals and that Szenja did not appear to be negatively impacted by Snowflake’s departure.“It is well documented that adult polar bears are typically solitary animals, and Szenja was continually cared for and enriched by her dedicated and passionate animal care team,” he continued. “She did not demonstrate any adverse behavioral changes following Snowflake’s transport to the Pittsburgh Zoo in February as part of the Species Survival Plan (SSP) breeding visit. Unlike wild polar bears facing habitat loss, human encroachment and limited food sources, Szenja lived an long and enriching life at SeaWorld with the passionate and uncompromising care provided to her by her loving trainers, and made a positive impact on the tens of millions of park guests that had the chance to see her over the past 20 years.” Rest in peace, Szenja!"
83,THE WORLDPOST,"A Terror Attack Didn't Sway France's Election, But That's No Surprise",Nick Robins-Early and Eline Gordts,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-terrorism-election_us_58fe5800e4b00fa7de16c485,Last week's deadly attack before the vote didn't shift the polls.,2017-04-24,French President Francois Hollande speaking during a statment at the Elysee Palace in Paris after a shooting on the Champs Elysees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58fe59961c00003a00e816bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Just three days before the French would cast their votes in the first round of an election with potential drastic effects for the future of the country, a French national from an eastern Paris suburb shot dead a policeman and wounded two others on Paris’ famed Champs Elysées. The gunman, identified as 39-year-old Karim Cheurfi, was well known to authorities and had been arrested earlier this year, suspected of planning an attack on police. The so-described Islamic State was quick to claim responsibility for the shooting, although it remains unclear to what extent the militant group was involved. France was already on heightened alert that week. Last Tuesday, in the port city of Marseille, authorities detained two young men, both French nationals, suspected of planning to carry out a violent attack related to the presidential campaign. Police found guns and bomb materials, as well as a video in which one of the men claimed allegiance to ISIS.With polls indicating a neck-and-neck race between four front-runners, far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and conservative contender François Fillon jumped on the incidents to highlight their hawkish proposals on national security. Le Pen doubled down on her anti-immigration argument, vowing that if elected she would reinstate border checks and expel foreigners who are on the watch lists of intelligence services. Fillon, who had steered to the right throughout the campaign hoping to woo some of Le Pen’s supporters, said the fight against “Islamist totalitarianism” should be at the top of the next president’s list of priorities. Even U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in. “Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election!” Trump tweeted on Thursday.  But in fact, last week’s attack and arrests had little or no effect on the results in the first round, according to previous poll predictions, and experts say that should come as no surprise. “I don’t think that attack had any electoral effect,” Mabel Berezin, a professor at Cornell University who writes on European politics, told HuffPost on Monday. “The polls were remarkably consistent.”With 97 percent of votes counted, centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron decisively won Sunday’s first round with 23.9 percent of votes. Macron will meet hardliner Le Pen in the runoff on May 7. Le Pen took home 21.4 percent of the votes. Conservative Fillon and far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon were eliminated, with 19.9 and 19.6 percent respectively. The results were in line with predictions prior to the terror incidents. An Ipsos poll released 10 days ahead of the vote, predicted Macron and Le Pen would each win around 22 percent, Mélenchon 20 percent and Fillon 19 percent.While some research suggests that conservative or right-wing parties could benefit at the polls following terror attacks, Ignacio Lago, an associate professor of political science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, told HuffPost that only a few of the variables that usually play a role in shifting public perception actually applied to France’s case. Lago pointed to three main factors. First, research suggests voters usually rally around the flag after a terror attack, and that effect generally benefits the incumbent, regardless of his or her political affiliation. “Terrorist attacks are good for incumbents, that’s the rule,” Lago explained. Think back to November 2015, when a group of gunmen stormed bars, restaurants, a soccer stadium and a concert hall across Paris in an ISIS-plot, killing up to 130 people. President François Hollande, who was deeply unpopular at the time of the attack, saw his support grow in the aftermath. Secondly, Lago says, how an incumbent responds to the tragedy is a critical factor in voters’ opinions. When the Spanish ruling party initially responded to the 2004 Madrid terror attack by mistakenly blaming Basque separatists, rather than al-Qaeda, voters turned against them at the polls. In France, incumbent President Hollande was not running, nullifying both the rallying effect and the importance of his response. Thirdly, size matters. While a tragic event, the extent of Thursday’s shooting in Paris was small compared to some of the massive attacks France has suffered in recent years. Since January 2015, individual terrorists and groups of militants have attacked the offices satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people; taken hostages at a kosher supermarket, killing four; carried out a large coordinated assault in Paris, leaving 130 dead; attacked the home of a policeman, killing him and his partner; and mowed down at least 84 people celebrating Bastille Day in the southern city of Nice.“At a certain point with these collective traumas … you reach a kind of threshold and people have taken their emotional position on it.” Berezin, the Cornell University Professor, said. Finally, the frequency of threats also played a role in the way voters responded at the polls on Sunday. Professor Christophe Chowanietz, an expert on France’s response to terrorism, suggested in a 2009 University of Montreal research paper that there’s less of a rallying effect if attacks occur on a regular basis. Opposition parties will begin to openly criticize the country’s leaders for failing to stop repeated attacks. In the case of France this week, Chowanietz said, criticizing the government’s approach to the attacks did not win the candidates an edge over one another. “The incumbent isn’t running, so you can’t score points attacking Hollande for not keeping France safe. He doesn’t care, he’s out of a job in five weeks anyway,” Chowanietz said. Instead, candidates like Le Pen and Fillon hammered voters with their own plans for addressing security, but few of those proposals were actually new to voters. In addition, there were serious questions whether border controls, like Le Pen would like to see, would do much to stem the tide of attacks by radicalized French nationals. “It becomes empty rhetoric: close the borders and things like that. It’s nothing new,” Chowanietz said. Le Pen and Macron will face off in the final round of voting on May 7 and while France’s security and history of terror attacks will be an issue for the campaigns, analysts say it would take a much larger terror attack to have a chance at swaying the vote.“Had it been a massive attack where 10, 20 people were killed then the dynamic could have been different,” Chowanietz said."

The measure received bipartisan support.“We are putting our babies first and our legislators understand that,” executive director of the New York Milk Bank, Julie Bouchet-Horwitz, told The Huffington Post. Bouchet-Horwitz noted that “all babies, regardless of the economic status of their parents,” deserve access to pasteurized donor human milk (PDHM) when their own mothers’ milk is not available or sufficient.Access to donor milk is particularly important for preemies because they are at a higher risk for developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an intestinal illness that can be fatal in up to 40 percent of cases. Some studies have suggested that feeding preemies breast milk decreases their risk of developing NEC. “When a mother’s milk is not available, PDHM is the next best option to give these babies a fighting chance. Increased use of PDHM will prevent NEC, decrease hospital stays, prevent infections that could lead to feeding intolerance and potential lifelong intestinal problems and developmental disabilities, and most importantly, decrease mortality rates amongst these fragile infants,” state Sen. Kemp Hannon (R) explained in a press release.The senator backed the budget provision, along with state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried (D) and other legislators, after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) vetoed his bill authorizing this Medicaid coverage, saying the issue should be part of the state budget negotiations.In the press release, Sen. Hannon also noted that he believes providing this coverage will save the state Medicaid dollars in the long run by helping to prevent further complications in premature babies. Although the women who donate their breast milk are not compensated, the New York Milk Bank requires a fee of $4.50 per ounce from recipients. “The fee covers our cost of operations: salaries, rent and utilities, lab supplies, blood tests for donors, office supplies, bottles, etc.,” Bouchet-Horwitz explained, adding that as a nonprofit, the organization places any extra earnings into a charitable fund to help families who cannot afford to pay the fee.There is also an additional delivery fee, but a corp of volunteers ― including the famous “Milk Riders” ― work to offer same day delivery whenever possible. The new state budget will help cover these costs and ease a significant burden on some of the most vulnerable families in New York.“Ensuring our most fragile infants have access to PDHM when in the NICU and the mother’s milk is not an option is the next step in promoting the lifelong benefits of breast milk,” Senator Hannon stated in his press release. While a number of hospitals such as Crouse Hospital and Westchester Medical Center offer donor breast milk to premature babies, which can often be lifesaving, coverage continues to be an obstacle.”By removing the cost barrier to accessibility, Bouchet-Horwitz believes this state coverage will significantly lessen this health disparity. New York joins a handful of other states ― including California, Missouri, Kansas, Texas and Utah ― that already provide Medicaid coverage for donor milk."

On Sunday, the 21-year-old actress posted an infographic to Instagram that illustrates the number of rapes that are reported to the police and how many of those reported are actually tried and found guilty. According to the RAINN infographic, out of every 1,000 rapes, 994 perpetrators will walk free. Only 310 rapes are reported to police per every 1,000, and only six of those assailants will actually be incarcerated. Breslin posted the photo with the comment “#knowthefacts.” Later that day, Breslin posted another image on Instagram ― but this time in response to a commenter who wrote: “Reported rapes are the only rapes that count.” The young actress did not mince words in her powerful response. Breslin explained that she took the comment personally because she was sexually assaulted and didn’t report her abuser. “I did not report my rape. I didn’t report it because of many reasons,” Breslin’s Instagram post reads. “First off, I was in complete shock and total denial. I didn’t want to view myself as a ‘victim’ so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.”Breslin explained that she was in a relationship with her rapist and feared he would retaliate if he found out she was seeking justice. She continued: I was diagnosed with PTSD a year and a half ago. I have made a lot of progress since the event occurred, but I won’t pretend it isn’t something I struggle with. I still have flashbacks, I still get nightmares, I still jump when somebody touches me unexpectedly, even if it’s my best friend tapping me on the shoulder. Read Breslin’s full post below. Breslin summed up her post on a powerful point, writing: “Unreported rapes count. Reported rapes count. End of the story.” "
