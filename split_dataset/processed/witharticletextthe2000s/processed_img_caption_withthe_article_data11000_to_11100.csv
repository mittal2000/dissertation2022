Some 100 other cities hosted smaller marches.Protest organizers estimated that over 25,000 people attended the rally in Washington, D.C., and 20,000 people participated in New York City.Together, the rallies across the country were among the largest anti-Trump demonstrations since the Women’s March drew millions of people into the streets on Jan. 21.“Trump says only the media cares about this taxes. Today, we’ve proved him wrong. It’s time for Trump to come clean, so we know who he’s really working for,” said Working Families Party national membership director Nelini Stamp, a keynote speaker at the New York City, in a statement following the march.In Washington, D.C., the march began with a rally at the U.S. Capitol followed by a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, past the Internal Revenue Service headquarters and the Trump International Hotel ― where protesters chanted “shame” in unison. The rally at times played the role of an all-purpose demonstration against Trump, replete with derisive condemnations of the president ― including references to alleged collusion of staff members from his presidential campaign with the Russian government.Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, gave one of the most impassioned speeches at the U.S. Capitol. Waters, who has become a leading voice of opposition to Trump, vowed to impeach the president for his “contemptible” actions, as she led the crowd in a chant of “impeach 45.” “I have laryngitis. But the only way I would not have been here with you today is if they cut my throat and stopped me from talking,” she declared. “If he thinks he can get away with playing king, he’s got another thing coming!”Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, declared during his speech, “We are taking the gloves off to say knock off the secrecy Mr. President and publicly release your own tax returns!” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) was another leading Democrat to address the D.C. crowd, along with several policy experts and progressive leaders.The rallies also featured Donny the Tax March Chicken, an inflatable chicken made to resemble Trump. The gag is intended to mock Trump for being too “chicken” to reveal his tax returns. The march’s speakers were also calling for a fairer taxation system, which they argue is unfairly skewed to the advantage of wealthy people including Trump. The progressive organizations and labor unions sponsoring the march include Indivisible, Americans for Tax Fairness, MoveOn.org, Public Citizen, Demos, Credo, the Working Families Party, the National Women’s Law Center and the American Federation of Teachers.The coalition of liberal groups organized the “Tax March,” as they called it, to coincide with April 15, because it’s usually Tax Day ― the final day for individuals to submit their tax returns.This year, individual tax returns are due on Tuesday, April 18, since April 15 is a Saturday and on Monday, federal government workers have the day off work for Emancipation Day, a Washington, D.C. holiday.Trump is the first president in four decades who has not released his tax returns or comparable financial information. The practice became a tradition when former President Richard Nixon released his returns after he was audited.In January, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway insisted that Trump would never release his returns, arguing that his election proved that “people didn’t care” about it.But Trump’s critics believe his refusal to disclose his tax returns is a sign that he has something to hide. Questions about his motives have led to speculation that they contain evidence of either major tax avoidance or financial ties to figures close to the Russian government.The FBI confirmed in March that it is investigating Trump associates for their possible ties to Russia, raising the possibility that the president’s allies participated in the alleged Russian interference efforts in some capacity.Watch the complete Washington, D.C., rally here, and the New York City rally here.In D.C., speakers mixed partisan red meat with sincere appeals for transparency and stinging indictments of wealthy tax avoidance.A Trump impersonator regaled the crowd with a nasal, self-mocking routine that concluded with fake secret service members showering protesters with shredded paper that represented destroyed copies of his tax returns.Rep. Waters told the crowd that the president’s missile strike on an airfield in Syria was an attempt to generate “phony tension” between his administration and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a patron of the Syrian regime.Trump’s “motives and his actions are contemptible. And I will fight every day until he is impeached,” she declared.Heather McGhee, president of the liberal think tank Demos, focused on the way tax loopholes and other schemes rich people use to avoid taxes have deprived public institutions and services of much-needed revenue.“Every year at budget time we’re coming up short. They tell us there is not enough money to make the schools better ― or even keep them open in some neighborhoods,” McGhee said.“Across the country, Americans are calling ‘bullshit!’” she concluded, prompting the crowd to repeatedly chant “bullshit” in response.And Rep. Raskin, a constitutional law professor who represents the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., protested the lack of voting representation in Congress for D.C.’s nearly 700,000 residents ― despite the billions of dollars in taxes they pay.He also argued that Trump must disclose his tax returns before he embarks on an effort to reform the country’s tax system.“We cannot debate tax policy in America unless we know what personal, family and business interests are motivating and defining your proposals,” he said.The majority of the activists at the tax march in Washington, D.C., appeared to come from the greater metropolitan area, including the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. There were, nonetheless, many people who traveled long distances to participate in the event.Heavy machinery salvage businessman Paul Kelly, 55, and his son Stafford Kelly, 19, took the train up from Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They were sporting hard hats from their line of work. Stafford Kelly was holding a red and yellow “Trump” flag with old Soviet insignia, while his father held a Syrian flag as a gesture of solidarity with the Syrian people. “We should let the refugees in instead of bombing them,” Paul Kelly said. He identifies as an independent and was not involved in politics until Trump’s election.“We gotta do something to oppose this administration,” he said. “The Russian connections, the misogyny, the sexism, the racism ― it’s pretty much just un-American.”Marcia Lickei, 65, and her husband Paul, 72, flew in from Green Valley, Arizona, to participate in the march alongside Marcia’s sister Margie Weidlich, 63, who lives in Herndon, Virginia.Trump’s decision on Friday to end the practice of publicly disclosing the White House visitor logs has increased Paul Lickei’s suspicion that Trump is hiding something in his tax returns.“I still remember the Vietnam era, and Nixon and Watergate, so that’s why we are highly doubtful about this president at this point, because we don’t feel that he is giving us transparency of any sort,” Lickei said.Here are some images from tax marches across the country:This article has been updated with new details on rally developments throughout."

3,POLITICS,Irresistible Emails And Why I Hate To Love Jon Ossoff,"Madeleine Burnside, ContributorEditor, The Sanity Papers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/irresistible-emails-and-why-i-hate-to-love-jon-ossoff_us_58f29bd1e4b0156697224ffb,"Win or lose, Jon Ossoff’s campaign tells us that progressives can mobilize successfully.",2017-04-15,<p>A pivotal Congressional race is happening in Georgia!</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f29f0c1b0000190016bb93.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We’ll know more about the significance of the race for the 6th Congressional District in Georgia on Tuesday, April 18. There might be a run-off, but we’ll know whether Jon Ossoff is likely to become their new U.S. Representative or if voters stick with the values of Tom Price, the district’s former congressman now serving as Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services. Will they go with a cheery young progressive, or remain aligned with the anti-abortion, pro-gun, pro-tobacco, anti-gay, pro-farmers, pro-Patriot Act program so steadfastly defined by Price?Georgia has been reliably Republican since 1964, unless a southerner was on the top of the ticket. Normally, while all House races are of national importance, the news would not be so tightly focused on the candidates in one race. The reason it is comes down to one man, Jon Ossoff.Jon Ossoff is a phenom. He’s not just a smiling face in a generally Republican district, he’s not just the guy we get two emails from a day, he’s part of a new wave of progressives: He’s someone who went home.Born in Atlanta, Ossoff was raised in the district he seeks to represent. In that his mother is a founder of a PAC that works to elect women to political office in Georgia, I would say he probably learned his progressive values at the kitchen table. He surely found those values expanded and codified when, in high school, he interned for Congressman John Lewis, the Civil Rights activist, whom he considers his mentor. From this auspicious beginning, he went to Georgetown University, and then to the London School of Economics where he wrote his master’s thesis in relations between the United States and China. Most recently he has been making documentary films about political corruption.Okay, perhaps you already read all this in the New Yorker or on Wikipedia, but the point is not so much to present a summary of his education and qualifications as to say that there were career paths he could have more easily taken in New York, Washington, D.C., or even Los Angeles. He might have become a cog in the mighty wheels of power in the nation’s capital, or run for some safe-ish seat in a blue state, or even have become the next Michael Moore. Instead, he did the more difficult thing: He went home.He’s not the first to do so, but he’s the most noticeable. Pete Buttigieg, for example, spoke at the Arena Summit in North Carolina a couple of weeks ago. Progressive and openly gay, Buttigieg is five years older than Ossoff and has been on a similar trajectory, becoming mayor of South Bend, Indiana, in 2012 and holding onto his position even as his former governor, Mike Pence, became vice-president under Donald Trump. Harvard-educated, a Rhodes scholar, and a veteran, Buttigieg had options, but he too went home.Buttigieg is not a household name, but Ossoff has made himself into one. Grabbing the opportunity that Tom Price’s vacated seat presented, Ossoff is a challenger in a district ostensibly sympathetic to Price’s tenets. He’s made the most of the race’s status as a symbol of the Resistance and cranked up the social media machine to make himself a national presence. The question is, not even 100 days into the Trump presidency, are some Georgians sufficiently dismayed, disgusted, or even frightened by what they’ve seen so far to vote for a Democrat? Ranging from the appalling domestic agenda to the most recent horror of dropping the “mother of all bombs” on Afghanistan, how are Trump’s policies working for voters?Campaign supporters wear t-shirts with the slogan “Vote your Ossoff!” But really, why am I sending some young guy in Cobb County five dollars every five minutes when I live in another state and cannot possibly vote for him? Do we really think the Republican establishment will reel at the sight of his 30-year-old face in Congress? Surely not. It will be an irritation, but he’s only one guy.I’m sending my mini-money because if he wins it means something really important for Democrats nationwide. It means that they can take their bright ideas and their coastal savvy and put it to work for their country right where it will mean the most. And that’s the heart of this thing: If we can’t get the rest of the country to move toward us politically on their own, we are going to have to go to them physically, add ourselves to the ballot and change people’s attitudes towards the principles we hold so dear, and we’ll have to do it one battleground at a time.Finally, we all seem to have woken up and realized that the skewed congressional gerrymandering which increasingly stifles our democracy—combined with the power of the electoral college—is never going to give voters a fair shake. A candidate who lost the popular vote by a considerable margin is now president, and states with the lowest populations have come to dominate the Senate. Since our elections are structured largely around mapmaking rather than population, we have to stop hoping that red states turn blue of their own accord. My state, Florida, is red too, and we are hoping for some energetic candidates to emerge here, that some of our ambitious young people discover the disincentives of being small fish in big ponds and come home. Jon’s example, regardless of outcome, will help make that happen.Al Gore “invented the Internet” going into Bill Clinton’s campaign, but it wasn’t advanced enough for him to make use of it when he ran for president. Howard Dean generated a great grassroots campaign on line when he ran for his party’s presidential nomination in 2004, and he almost succeeded. Jon Ossoff has made himself the man I hate to love with his incessant emails—his campaign has social media figured out.I’m writing this piece purposely before we have the result and while there’s still time to look at this as part of a bigger picture. Ossoff’s achievement is less about winning or losing and more about showing up. We need to think about that—not that we won’t think about it afterwards, but I don’t want to find myself lulled into submission or complacency by a win or be overly upset by a loss.It was a very close race in Kansas’ 4th Congressional District a few days ago in which, although there was no actual upset of the Republican chokehold, everyone was put on notice that a reversal is doable. Win or lose, Jon Ossoff’s campaign tells us that progressives can mobilize successfully. It tells us that someone can go from being an unknown to being a national figure. It tells us we can move fast. It can be done."

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked plans by Arkansas to carry out a rapid series of executions this month, after the inmates argued the state’s rush to the death chamber was unconstitutional and reckless.Arkansas, which has not carried out an execution in 12 years, planned to begin the lethal injections of at least six convicted murderers on Monday and complete the executions before the end of April. Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, no state has ever put as many inmates to death in as short a period.The ruling on Saturday by a federal court in Little Rock threatens that plan, as did an order on Friday by an Arkansas state judge. The federal judge, however, provided officials with an opportunity to address her concerns at a hearing on Monday.Arkansas had scheduled the fast-paced series of executions in order to beat the expiration date on its batch of one of the three drugs used in its lethal injection cocktail.U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker, in a 101-page ruling, found the state’s plan would deny the inmates their legal rights by depriving them of adequate counsel because prison officials allow only a single lawyer to be present for any execution.If the attorney had to rush out to file an emergency petition, it would deprive the inmate of a lawyer to witness the execution, Baker said.“The court finds that plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction based on their challenge to (the state’s) viewing policies, in their current form, as unreasonable restrictions of plaintiffs’ right to counsel and right of access to the courts,” Baker wrote.Baker ordered lawyers for the state and the death row prisoners to return to court on Monday with a revised plan for viewing the executions and having defense counsel present.Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge vowed to appeal the temporary restraining order.“It is unfortunate that a U.S. District Judge has chosen to side with the convicted prisoners in one of their many last-minute attempts to delay justice,” Judd Deere, a spokesman for Rutledge, said in a statement.CONDEMNED PRISONERSThe lawsuit behind the injunction was filed on behalf of nine condemned prisoners. One of them was never put into the execution schedule for April. Two others won stays of execution from state courts, leaving six of the original petitioners currently in line for their executions to be carried out.The state’s mixture of drugs used in executions has brought legal challenges, and Baker’s ruling on Saturday also raised questions about whether one of them, midazolam, was effective enough at preventing pain during executions.Arkansas employs potassium chloride in combination with vecuronium bromide and midazolam. The latter drug is intended to render the inmate unconscious before the other two chemicals are administered to paralyze the lungs and stop the heart.Governor Asa Hutchinson has said the state must act quickly because its midazolam supply expires at the end of the month.John Williams, attorney for some of the death row prisoners welcomed Baker’s ruling, saying it was legally sound and reasonable.“The unnecessarily compressed execution schedule using the risky drug midazolam denies prisoners their right to be free from the risk of torture,” he said in a statement.Critics have contended that the drug does not achieve the level of unconsciousness required for surgery, making it unsuitable for executions. Supporters have said it is effective, and the U.S. Supreme Court has authorized its use.On Friday, Arkansas Circuit Court Judge Wendell Griffen, an outspoken opponent of capital punishment, issued an order on Friday blocking the state from using vecuronium bromide after a petition from its maker, McKesson Medical-Surgical Inc. The company, along with other pharmaceutical makers, objects to its drug being used in executions.Rutledge filed an emergency petition with the Arkansas Supreme Court on Saturday seeking to overturn Griffen’s order.(Reporting by Steve Barnes; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Alistair Bell)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f20b881b0000330016bb04.jpeg?cache=AYW3BuF7Rt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"North Korea displayed what appeared to be new long-range and submarine-based missiles on the 105th birth anniversary of its founding father, Kim Il Sung, on Saturday, as a nuclear-powered U.S. aircraft carrier group steamed towards the region.Missiles appeared to be the main theme of a giant military parade, with Kim’s grandson, leader Kim Jong Un, taking time to greet the commander of the Strategic Forces, the branch that oversees the missile arsenal.A U.S. Navy attack on a Syrian airfield this month with Tomahawk missiles raised questions about U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for reclusive North Korea, which has conducted several missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions, regularly threatening to destroy the United States.Kim Jong Un, looking relaxed in a dark suit and laughing with aides, oversaw the festivities on the “Day of the Sun” at Pyongyang’s main Kim Il Sung Square.Goose-stepping soldiers and marching bands filled the square, next to the Taedonggang River that flows through Pyongyang, in the hazy spring sunshine, followed by tanks, multiple-launch rocket systems and other weapons.Single-engine propeller-powered planes flew in a 105 formation overhead.Unlike at some previous parades attended by Kim, there did not appear to be a senior Chinese official in attendance.

China on Friday again called for talks to defuse the crisis.Weapons analysts said they believed some of the missiles on display were new types of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM).The North has said it has developed and would launch a missile that can strike the mainland United States but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering all the necessary technology.“EARLY DAYS”North Korea showed two new kinds of ICBM enclosed in canister launchers mounted on the back of trucks, suggesting Pyongyang was working towards a “new concept” of ICBM, said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the U.S.-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, California.”However, North Korea has a habit of showing off new concepts in parades before they ever test or launch them,” Hanham said.“It is still early days for these missile designs.”The Pukkuksong submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) were also on parade. It was the first time North Korea had shown the missiles, which have a range of more than 1,000 km (600 miles), at a military parade.Displaying more than one of the missiles indicates North Korea is progressing with its plan to base a missile on a submarine, which are hard to detect, said Joshua Pollack, editor of the Washington-based Nonproliferation Review.“It suggests a commitment to this program,” said Pollack. “Multiple SLBMs seems like a declaration of intent to advance the program.”North Korea, still technically at war with the South after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce but not a treaty, has on occasion conducted missile or nuclear tests to coincide with big political events and often threatens the United States, South Korea and Japan.Choe Ryong Hae, a close aide to Kim Jong Un, addressed the packed square with a characteristically bellicose warning to the United States.“If the United States wages reckless provocation against us, our revolutionary power will instantly counter with annihilating strike, and we will respond to full-out war with full-out war and to nuclear war with our style of nuclear strike warfare,” he said.PENCE TO VISIT SOUTHState news agency KCNA said the Trump administration’s “serious military hysteria” had reached a “dangerous phase which can no longer be overlooked”.The United States has warned that a policy of “strategic patience” with North Korea is over.

Forty-four percent of the world’s cigarettes are smoked in China, and the profits show. In 2015, the smoking industry in China recorded $160 billion in revenue, according to Agence France-Presse.Dr. Bernhard Schwartländer, China’s WHO representative, said there needs to be more smoke-free policies across the country.“If nothing is done to reduce these numbers and introduce more progressive policies, the consequences could be devastating not just for the health of people across the country, but also for China’s economy as a whole,” Schwartländer said. Cigarettes have become increasingly more affordable, according to the report. A 50 percent tax increase on cigarettes could see 47 million fewer male smokers and 20 million fewer premature deaths over 50 years. “Raising tobacco taxes is one of the most cost-effective measures to reduce tobacco consumption, while also generating substantial revenue for health and other essential programs – investments that ultimately benefit the entire population,” said Bert Hofman, World Bank Country Director for China, Mongolia and Korea, in the WHO press release.

12,POLITICS,Maxine Waters' Political Career Makes Her Uniquely Suited To Take On Donald Trump,"Ryan Grim, Julia Craven, and Meredith Melnick",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maxine-waters-donald-trump_us_58eb98d5e4b00de141053b7f,"With decades of experience battling injustice, the congresswoman is now aiming her anger at the president.",2017-04-15,Rep. Maxine Waters' fierce attacks of President Donald Trump has caught the attention of Americans.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f1098d14000049001b45c9.jpeg?cache=doFhKyPF8m&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Maxine Waters spends her weekends at home. For most people, this is not an unusual habit. But for Waters, it requires extra effort: Each Monday Congress has been in session over the past 26 years, she has embarked on a 2,300-mile commute from her home in Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., where she currently serves as one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives.A pre-dawn, cross-country flight to head to work in D.C. is irritating business. Former staffers say the six-hour journey suits the 78-year-old congresswoman just about as well as you’d expect. Her 5 p.m. Monday meetings can get hot. Aides who have spent the weekend gathering Capitol Hill intelligence, studying the intricacies of securities law and trying to win new political allies report to the full staff in front of a one-woman firing squad.“It’s definitely a situation that can be slightly intimidating,” said one former staffer, comparing the grillings to the Trump administration’s televised press conferences. “She interrupts, doesn’t let them finish, scolds them. These are people who are just trying to get her up to speed on what’s happening.”Waters yells at staffers for things like making eye contact with other aides. She unceremoniously fires people who give presentations that don’t live up to her standards.The scene, at first, might clash with the image of Waters that has taken off on the internet since the election of Donald Trump. The meme-ified image of “Auntie Maxine” ― a fearless, quirky black woman who may not be related to you, but whom you love and respect for her straight talk just the same ― has become a favorite of millennials and brought Waters’ Twitter account up to hundreds of thousands of followers. But, at a closer look, her staff meetings actually fit with her internet persona: Auntie Maxine, like many black women when it’s time to buckle down at work, isn’t about to play with you.“There’s a genuineness,” said R. Eric Thomas, a columnist for Elle.com who has written several viral articles with headlines like “You Will Never, In Your Entire Life, Get The Best Of Maxine Waters.” “With Maxine, she’s talking like everyone you respect in your life talks, but whom you wouldn’t expect to be in Washington,” he said. “If my mom and my aunt were running Washington, everyone would straighten up and fly right. I think a lot of people feel that way.”And Waters’ comments about Trump have fit that bill.“I think that he is disrespectful of most people,” Waters told The Huffington Post. “He has no respect for other human beings. He lies, he cannot be trusted, I don’t know what it means to sit down with someone like that who you cannot believe one word that they say once you get up by talking to them. I have no trust and no faith in him whatsoever.”Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said he helped coax Waters to come to Georgia for an upcoming event, given her overwhelming popularity in the black community. “She’s hard-edged, hard-nosed, hard-driving, firm in her beliefs, and she is an institution unto herself. African Americans adore her,” Johnson said.Waters’ experience as a black woman in America gives the rage in her voice an added dose of authenticity. Waters has come about that anger honestly: Black people, particularly women, have generally been treated horribly throughout American history. Black men began serving as sheriffs, congressmen and senators as early as 1870, and black women often did a bulk of the work necessary to advance men into those positions and support them while in office. But it wasn’t until 1968 ― when Maxine Waters was 30 ― that Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman elected to Congress.When Trump or his surrogates take on Waters, as they have since she began speaking out against his policies, the attacks come with a barely sheathed racist edge. Fox News host Bill O’Reilly recently mocked her “James Brown wig,” saying he wouldn’t listen to her concerns about Trump’s politics because of it.In a viral response, Waters made clear who she is. “I’m a strong black woman, and I cannot be intimidated,” she said. “I cannot be thought to be afraid of Bill O’Reilly or anybody. And I’d like to say to women out there everywhere: Don’t allow these right-wing talking heads, these dishonorable people, to intimidate you or scare you. Be who you are. Do what you do. And let us get on with discussing the real issues of this country.”The O’Reillys of the world see Waters as nothing but an angry black woman. And she is, indeed, an angry black woman ― rightfully and unapologetically so.“It’s not good advice to get in a fight with Maxine Waters,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former LA county supervisor who has known Waters for decades and who noted that O’Reilly apologized with uncharacteristic speed. “What’s the ‘Man of La Mancha’ quote? ‘Whether the stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits the stone, it’s going to be bad for the pitcher.’” Waters’ anger wards off rivals. It enhances her moral authority. And it comforts and amplifies her often equally angry constituents.“She can sometimes be animated, and I think people might think that that is evidence of lack of control,” said Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), who has long served with Waters on the Financial Services Committee. “But it is not. It is quite calculated, and most of the time, it is very effective.”* * *Maxine Waters, one of 13 children, was born in 1938 in St. Louis, a city that was a capital of black culture and politics at the time. Waters’ high school yearbook predicted she’d become speaker of the House ― an impressively optimistic prediction, given that she graduated a decade before the Voting Rights Act mandated African Americans’ right to vote.Waters started her family at a young age and had two children before moving west to LA and finding a gig as a service representative for Pacific Telephone, while working her way slowly toward a sociology degree. She later became a supervisor for a head start program in Watts, a black working-class neighborhood in South Los Angeles ― her first foray into professional public service.One night in August 1965, cops pulled over an African-American motorist in Watts and beat him badly. Then, as now, police violence was a not-unheard-of occurrence. But there’s no telling when a single moment becomes a spark that lights a fire, and this one lit up Watts. The neighborhood erupted in protest, leading to what became known as the Watts Rebellion — or, to white America, the Watts Riots.Following the rebellion, a small group of black politicians and organizers came together at a crucial meeting in Bakersfield in 1966. Waters, whose activism in the community was becoming increasingly high profile, was among them. From that meeting came a long-term, statewide wave of black politicians from California, focused on improving conditions for communities of color.“Anybody who became ‘somebody’ was there,” James Richardson, a Sacramento Bee reporter who covered much of Waters’ early career, said of the Bakersfield summit. “They plotted over how to gain electoral power and it was a watershed moment that wasn’t really seen.”Waters’ work in the community eventually led to a gig that would define her approach to politics the rest of her life: serving as a top aide to LA Councilman David Cunningham Jr. When she’s been asked since why she continues flying cross-country every single week, despite facing no political threat to her seat, she recalls what she learned as a chief deputy to Cunningham: the importance of constituent service. In 1976, Waters ran for and won a seat in the California State Assembly. She has been in elected office ever since.“It’s as if she never left the public housing projects in Watts in all of her life,” said her longtime ally Willie Brown, a speaker of the Assembly who went on to become mayor of San Francisco.* * *Waters has been in political life long enough to see the Democratic Party transform several times over. She is, in many ways, a holdover from another time. But the world seems to be coming full circle. Today, nearly every Democrat identifies as “progressive,” but decades ago the word had a specific meaning and referred to a movement launched in opposition to urban machine politicians who relied on transactional politics and constituent service to consolidate power. Progressives prioritized anti-corruption and the integrity of the political process. The penny-ante palm greasing of the city machine gave way to the sanitized, large-scale corruption of national politics by corporate money. With government watchdogs on the prowl, politicians lost the ability to bestow jobs and other benefits on supporters in the community. It was all well-intentioned, but as the power to better the community moved to the private sector and out of politicians’ hands, quality of life in the community steadily declined.Waters is not a good-government progressive. She is an old-school liberal, one who believes that outcomes matter more than process. She prides herself on constituent service. And she often wins.“It is hard to think of any single member of Congress who has done more than Maxine to protect the financial reforms and prevent another financial crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “Her work touches every family in America. She’s really been good.”* * *Waters’ keen sense of public opinion is as strong as that of any member of Congress. She has leaned right into the Auntie Maxine persona as yet another method of relating to constituents. At a private meeting of her House colleagues earlier this year, Democrats were debating the stunning level of grassroots energy around the country — and how it could be harnessed to regain power. Waters rose to address her colleagues, stressing the importance of learning the language the kids use today — and explained the meaning of the phrase “stay woke.” (The phrase originated as a way for black activists to remind each other of systemic inequality; it has since evolved to describe anybody who professes concern for social justice ― up to and including ride-share companies.) Waters’ grassroots touch — combined with her grueling work ethic and endless frequent flyer miles — is what allowed Waters to know long before national groups, and before federal regulators, that big banks were engaging in rampant mortgage servicing fraud and foreclosure scams. It has helped her stay far ahead of the national curve on issues such as mass incarceration, the drug war and police brutality. And by sensing — and leaping to satiate — a tremendous hunger among the Democratic base to not only delegitimize and de-normalize Trump, but to actually impeach him, she’s fueled her latest star turn.“Maxine is a grassroots person,” said Yaroslavsky, the former LA county supervisor. “She’s as comfortable in the district as she is in the committee. ... You learn to take care of the people who pay your salary. And sometimes she steps on toes doing that, but usually she takes the populist position because that’s what she thinks is her role.”“Maxine was a tough person. You didn’t cross her. She could give a fiery speech on the floor and send your bill to the dumper. Some nicknamed her ‘Mad Max’ behind her back,” Richardson said of her state Assembly years. “She would represent [Assembly Speaker Willie Brown] in budget meetings, so everyone knew that Maxine was to be taken seriously because she was speaking for him. And for herself.”Waters’ crowning achievement in the Assembly was a bill she co-authored with Brown, who’d also been at the Bakersfield meeting, and convinced Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to sign. It divested California’s mammoth pension system from South African interests in protest of apartheid. Convincing the governor was difficult, Brown reported, but Waters got to work, demonstrating an interest in issues that Deukmejian cared about, such as farming regulations in California’s Central Valley, coastline and water resources in Los Angeles. She was able to demonstrate her commitment to his issues enough to engender the goodwill necessary to receive his support, Brown said. It was in stark contrast to the image of the blustering demagogue, and it’s one colleagues said they’ve seen over and over in the years since. The coastal and farming policy insights she picked up in pursuit of Nelson Mandela’s freedom, indeed, would become handy as she helped shape a flood insurance bill 30 years later.(Brown is selling himself a bit short, as he always played a major role. Richardson notes that the speaker effectively appealed to Deukmejian’s family history. The governor, who was of Armenian descent, lost family in the Armenian genocide.)California blocked its huge pension fund from investing in South African interests in 1986. It was a watershed moment in the anti-apartheid movement, and Mandela was released in 1990. Brown said Mandela traveled to California during his first United States tour following his release to thank Waters for her part in freeing him. “Maxine’s history is replete with successes, but none greater than freeing Nelson Mandela,” Brown said.That may sound like too much credit for a collective action, but Brown says Waters’ move set off a chain reaction ― as she hoped it would ― that led to his release. “Nelson Mandela was freed because Maxine Waters orchestrated a process in the legislature to divest our pension fund on the basis of apartheid,” Brown said. “This was quickly followed by Congress and other municipalities and it led clearly to the ultimate freedom of Nelson Mandela.”Indeed, Waters’ dominance of the Assembly in the 1980s is hard to overstate. Nobody who saw the authority the diminutive young woman wielded in the chamber is surprised at what she has become today. “The things going on in California in the ‘80s make DC look like nothing,” Richardson said. “We’d go months without a government, everything shut down, over pensions and benefits for teachers and the poor.” Waters withstood all of that. Persisted, even, you could say.“That’s her style. She will not be intimidated,” Richardson said, echoing language Waters used in response to O’Reilly’s recent racist attack on her.Although Waters worked the inside game in the Assembly, she held on to her outsider status throughout the 1980s, twice going against the party establishment in backing Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. When he fell short, she floated the possibility that black voters should support a third party if Democrats remained unresponsive to their concerns. And so when she ran for Congress in 1990, the party endorsed her primary opponent ― but Waters won anyway.She has been fighting established power ever since, and her natural impulse with Trump taking the White House this year was to charge right at him. Immediately after the election, the Democratic Party was caught in a debate over how to approach a Trump presidency. Would they try to work with him where possible, or resist his agenda across the board? Waters, who boycotted his inauguration, seems to see the answer as simple and has promised a full-blown rejection of Trump. “As I said earlier to someone I was talking to,” Waters told HuffPost, “I became very offended by him during his campaign the way he mocked disabled journalists, the way he talked about grabbing women by their private parts ... the way he stalked Hillary Clinton at the debate that I attended in Missouri where he circled her as she was standing trying to give her petition on the issues. The way he has praised [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and talked about the great leader he was. And the way that he pushed back even on Bill O’Reilly on the Fox show when Bill O’Reilly said in so many words, ‘Why are you so supportive of Putin? He’s a killer.’ And he said, ‘so what,’ in so many words, ‘[it’s] the United States, people get killed here all the time’ or something like that.”“I think that for the future, we have to deal with this administration and organizing to try and take back the House and the White House,” she continued.Mikael Moore, Waters’ grandson who served as a longtime aide to her in Congress, put it succinctly: “She runs toward the fight.”“She is operating no differently than she did prior to Trump’s arrival,” Brown said. “She generated just as much attention during the Bush years. [During Obama’s and Clinton’s terms] she had the great joy of not having to do that.”During the 2016 election, Waters clashed with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders when she backed Hillary Clinton in the primary instead. Some of her staffers were frustrated by Waters’ early enthusiasm for Clinton, whom they saw as much weaker on Waters’ signature issue of bank reform. When Sanders was invited to address the Democratic caucus in July 2016 — after the primary was effectively over, but while Sanders was continuing to campaign — some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, of which Waters is a member, heckled him. The CBC has a long, fraught relationship with Wall Street, often allying with big banks for fundraising purposes (much like the rest of the party). And since 2013, Waters had been the banks’ chief adversary in leadership, warning members of the caucus that helping Wall Street could result in a lot of pain for their black constituents a few years down the line. But at the Sanders address, Waters gave her colleagues cover by taking on Sanders.“Basically her question was, ‘Why do you keep talking about breaking up the banks when we already fixed this with Dodd-Frank?’” recalls one Democratic staffer who witnessed the confrontation.This fed a narrative the Clinton campaign was trying to foster — Bernie was a dreamer who didn’t understand policy. Most members of Congress, of course, do not understand financial policy ― they defer to leaders on the Financial Services Committee. Here was the top Democrat on that committee saying Sanders didn’t get it. It was powerful. But Waters’ own staffers knew their boss was twisting the policy. “Too big to fail” is alive and well in American banking.Dodd-Frank gave regulators the tools to fix the problem, but they haven’t used them, and Sanders wanted to force their hands. “It was pretty deflating,” one former Waters staffer says.* * *Waters combined her fierce nature with her constituent savvy after the 1992 LA riots, with a response that would come to define her career: She took a hard line with colleagues, but used a soft touch with her those who would vote for her.In April 1992, communities across South Los Angeles, enraged by the acquittals of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, launched what locals still refer to as an uprising — known nationally as the LA riots.In the wake of the chaos, Waters, who was then in her first term in Congress, showed up uninvited to a meeting President George H.W. Bush had called to discuss “urban problems,” according to a New York Times report.“I’ve been out here trying to define these issues,” she told Speaker Thomas S. Foley. “I don’t intend to be excluded or dismissed. We have an awful lot to say.”Back home, she struck a more poetic note, addressing constituents in a letter reprinted by the Los Angeles Times. In it, she employed a canny understanding of the zeitgeist and the language of the moment:My dear children, my friends, my brothers, life is sometimes cold-blooded and rotten. And it seems nobody, nobody cares.But there are the good times, the happy moments.I’m talking about the special times when a baby is born and when gospel music sounds good on Sunday morning. When Cube is kickin’ and Public Enemy is runnin’ it. When peach cobbler and ice cream tastes too good, the down-home blues makes you sing and shout, and someone simply saying, ‘I love you’ makes you want to cry.Her letter went on to condemn police brutality, predatory lending in communities of color, for-profit schools and a racist justice system. Save a few names, it could have been written today.In 1994, Republicans won control of Congress and Waters immediately joined the resistance. When activists from the affordable housing group ACORN were arrested early the next year for protesting newly minted Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) demanded that the Capitol Police release them, but he had no luck. Waters did more than demand. She marched down to the station herself and refused to leave until the protesters were let go. The police relented.Those are exactly the sort of moments that have made Waters’ resistance to Trump so resonant: She stands up to power on behalf of causes and people who are not broadly popular across the political spectrum. Yet she goes there.In one of Waters’ first votes in Congress, on the 1994 crime bill that has since become infamous as an avatar of mass incarceration, she and other Democrats were under tremendous pressure to do something about rising crime rates. Hillary Clinton, who was then first lady, warned of “super predators,” language she apologized for 22 years later.Sanders, an independent representing Vermont in the House, voted for it — a capitulation he would regret during his 2016 presidential campaign. Two-thirds of the Congressional Black Caucus ended up voting for the bill, including a former Black Panther. Waters voted no.But Waters hasn’t just stuck to issues considered traditionally liberal, or to issues that affect a disproportionate number of black Americans, such as criminal justice or housing policy. When Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D-Pa.) was defeated in 2010, “everybody assumed” Waters would stay on the housing subcommittee, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) recalled. She chose securities, not housing. “That surprised people,” he said, “but it was very sensible” — savvy, even, given the rising importance of Wall Street issues to the liberal base — and defied “the notion that she was just some bleeding-heart who could be for poor people but couldn’t handle the hard stuff.”Two years later, when Frank retired, the top position became available. Despite a widespread presumption on K Street that she would be passed over for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a white New York lawmaker much friendlier to Wall Street, Waters took the ranking member position. “She has made a career out of people underestimating her,” said Lynch, who serves with her on the committee. “She really has.”Bank lobbyists quickly found that Waters didn’t need to be a policy wonk on Day One to handle the job. “When Mr. Frank had the committee, he was so well-versed in many of the subjects that the debate tended to center around him, but when Ms. Waters became ranking member, she really sought out members who had expertise in certain areas and it really became more of a team,” Lynch said. “Barney was a wonk, financial policy wonk, a very, very bright guy and has a whole different style than Maxine. She comes to that job with a whole different set of tools and she uses them quite effectively.”She’s been forced into wonk mode since taking the job. “Yeah, she’s not happy about it, but she’s become much more embroiled in the nuances of finance and economic policy,” he said.In 2013, during the fall of her first year as ranking member, Wall Street pushed a bill that would offer taxpayer backing for derivatives trades. It was pitched as a modest technical change and had coasted through the House the session before. Some of Waters’ CBC colleagues were working hard for the bill and trying to get the entire caucus to back it as a bloc.Waters saw it as undermining the safeguards Dodd-Frank had put in place, but it flew through committee on a 53-6 vote, over Waters’ opposition. Then Waters went to war behind the scenes, forcing the caucus to take no position on the bill. On the House floor, it passed, but a majority of Democrats voted against it, rendering it dead in the Senate and meaning it would have less sway with regulators who look to vote totals for guidance.Waters’ bomb-throwing reputation belies an ability to work with Republicans when she needs to. The GOP chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of West Texas, for instance, had no plans to take up a major priority of Waters’, a reform of flood insurance that was critical to a coastal state like California. “West Texas hasn’t had a flood since Noah and he was not open to the idea at all,” Lynch said of the 2013 fight.So Waters went to work. “She actually formed a coalition with coastal Republicans and coastal Democrats and got that bill taken away from Mr. Hensarling. The speaker took control of it and we eventually got it passed, and I thought that was masterful to be in the minority and be able to do that,” Lynch said. “She built those coalitions with Republicans from Mississippi and Florida and California, Louisiana. I thought that was probably the toughest fight but she was very successful.”Wall Street fought Waters again during the lame-duck session of 2014. The period after an election and before a new Congress is sworn in is supposed to be a bit of a time-limited, all-you-can-eat buffet for K Street. A year earlier, Republicans had forced a government shutdown by demanding that Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act as part of any deal to maintain federal operations. Democrats had gone to the mat to stand up for their most high-profile achievement.This time around, Wall Street reform was on the menu. Senate leaders in both parties had agreed to include a new slate of federal subsidies for credit default swaps — the risky trades that demolished AIG in 2008.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and President Barack Obama seemed poised to give the GOP the win. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats’ leader in the House, did not like confronting Obama in public, and she certainly didn’t want to risk a public relations debacle that could result from a government shutdown — not for an obscure Dodd-Frank provision.Waters didn’t give her a choice. She decried the bill in press conferences and TV appearances. More importantly, she started whipping members against the bill. If funding the government required subsidizing risky Wall Street speculation, Democrats should force the shutdown and let Republicans explain why they wanted to help big banks so much, Waters argued. She set up a makeshift war room in her Capitol Hill office, and even recruited Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) — a frequent friend of banks on the House Financial Services Committee — to call members and urge them to shoot down the spending bill.She brought another recruit to the fight, too, reaching out to Rep. Frank, who just a few weeks before had voiced support for the provision Republicans were trying to push through. Frank joined Waters for a phone call with reporters and advocated for killing the bill.“I didn’t change my substantive position,” Frank insists today, putting his advocacy effort in the broader context of a fight to defend the integrity of Dodd-Frank. “I didn’t think [the measure in question] was very important. But I thought it set a very bad precedent to open up Dodd-Frank to amendment without debate.” Frank had become convinced by the argument Waters was making, that the politics were just as important as the policy ― and caving on the politics could lead to much worse policy.The bill, which had been expected to pass with little fanfare, faltered. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) didn’t have the votes. He knew he couldn’t bring around the hard-liners in his own caucus, who were building their own careers by opposing Boehner as a big-spending liberal sellout. He needed Democrats, and the Waters war room was working. Even Pelosi came out against the bill, granting angry Democrats all the cover they needed to vote no.The bill looked dead. Then Obama and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon began making personal phone calls to individual House members imploring them to support the package. They eventually got the votes. Waters dinged the president as a Wall Street collaborator.“I know that the president was whipping and he was supporting this bill and I know that Jamie Dimon was whipping,” she told reporters after the vote. “That’s an odd combination.”The December 2014 fight was painful. Waters lost. But the fight galvanized the party against Wall Street and embarrassed the president. Waters and her allies made their point. Obama and Reid never agreed to slip pro-bank measures into spending bills again.“Maxine led the charge to defeat that bill in the House,” Sen. Warren recalled.That success all goes back to Waters’ connection to her constituents. Former Reps. Brad Miller (D-N.C.) and Mary Jo Kilroy (D-Ohio) both served on the Financial Services Committee with Waters, and both recall that she was the first person they heard identify mortgage servicing fraud as an issue that needed attention. Going around her district, it was something she kept hearing about. “I recall Maxine as being relentless in calling out Wells Fargo and other loan servicers on their policies and practices with respect to the slow place and many obstacles they put on loan modifications,” Kilroy said.“She was really one of the first, maybe the very first, to raise the issue of mortgage servicer conduct, which she heard about from her constituents in California. That was before the national advocacy groups were really on it,” Miller said.“She kept asking witnesses at hearings about servicing problems,” Miller said. “I thought it was a distraction at the time. But it gradually became more and more evident what a problem servicer conduct was.”By 2011, Waters wanted to force the issue. That January, she joined with Miller, Lynch and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to write a letter to the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency challenging a recent settlement with Bank of America, suggesting it had failed to address the problem. Miller thought Waters’ draft was too strongly worded. “I insisted she dial it back,” he recalled, an insistence Lynch recalls as well. She did.Months later, when Miller read the inspector general’s report that had been sparked by the letter, he concluded that her initial scathing letter had been entirely appropriate. “When we got the IG’s report, I wished that we’d sent a letter harsher than her draft,” Miller said. “She sometimes seems like a bomb thrower, but the people at whom she threw the bombs often turn out to have deserved it.”Taryn Finley contributed reporting.Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox.

13,POLITICS,Maxine Waters' Political Career Makes Her Uniquely Suited To Take On Donald Trump,"Ryan Grim, Julia Craven, and Meredith Melnick",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maxine-waters-donald-trump_us_58eb98d5e4b00de141053b7f,"With decades of experience battling injustice, the congresswoman is now aiming her anger at the president.",2017-04-15,A Long Beach police officer searches black drivers and passengers for weapons at a checkpoint during the Watts Rebellion in nearby Los Angeles.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58eb9ddc16000021004d9ac0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Maxine Waters spends her weekends at home. For most people, this is not an unusual habit. But for Waters, it requires extra effort: Each Monday Congress has been in session over the past 26 years, she has embarked on a 2,300-mile commute from her home in Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., where she currently serves as one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives.A pre-dawn, cross-country flight to head to work in D.C. is irritating business. Former staffers say the six-hour journey suits the 78-year-old congresswoman just about as well as you’d expect. Her 5 p.m. Monday meetings can get hot. Aides who have spent the weekend gathering Capitol Hill intelligence, studying the intricacies of securities law and trying to win new political allies report to the full staff in front of a one-woman firing squad.“It’s definitely a situation that can be slightly intimidating,” said one former staffer, comparing the grillings to the Trump administration’s televised press conferences. “She interrupts, doesn’t let them finish, scolds them. These are people who are just trying to get her up to speed on what’s happening.”Waters yells at staffers for things like making eye contact with other aides. She unceremoniously fires people who give presentations that don’t live up to her standards.The scene, at first, might clash with the image of Waters that has taken off on the internet since the election of Donald Trump. The meme-ified image of “Auntie Maxine” ― a fearless, quirky black woman who may not be related to you, but whom you love and respect for her straight talk just the same ― has become a favorite of millennials and brought Waters’ Twitter account up to hundreds of thousands of followers. But, at a closer look, her staff meetings actually fit with her internet persona: Auntie Maxine, like many black women when it’s time to buckle down at work, isn’t about to play with you.“There’s a genuineness,” said R. Eric Thomas, a columnist for Elle.com who has written several viral articles with headlines like “You Will Never, In Your Entire Life, Get The Best Of Maxine Waters.” “With Maxine, she’s talking like everyone you respect in your life talks, but whom you wouldn’t expect to be in Washington,” he said. “If my mom and my aunt were running Washington, everyone would straighten up and fly right. I think a lot of people feel that way.”And Waters’ comments about Trump have fit that bill.“I think that he is disrespectful of most people,” Waters told The Huffington Post. “He has no respect for other human beings. He lies, he cannot be trusted, I don’t know what it means to sit down with someone like that who you cannot believe one word that they say once you get up by talking to them. I have no trust and no faith in him whatsoever.”Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said he helped coax Waters to come to Georgia for an upcoming event, given her overwhelming popularity in the black community. “She’s hard-edged, hard-nosed, hard-driving, firm in her beliefs, and she is an institution unto herself. African Americans adore her,” Johnson said.Waters’ experience as a black woman in America gives the rage in her voice an added dose of authenticity. Waters has come about that anger honestly: Black people, particularly women, have generally been treated horribly throughout American history. Black men began serving as sheriffs, congressmen and senators as early as 1870, and black women often did a bulk of the work necessary to advance men into those positions and support them while in office. But it wasn’t until 1968 ― when Maxine Waters was 30 ― that Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman elected to Congress.When Trump or his surrogates take on Waters, as they have since she began speaking out against his policies, the attacks come with a barely sheathed racist edge. Fox News host Bill O’Reilly recently mocked her “James Brown wig,” saying he wouldn’t listen to her concerns about Trump’s politics because of it.In a viral response, Waters made clear who she is. “I’m a strong black woman, and I cannot be intimidated,” she said. “I cannot be thought to be afraid of Bill O’Reilly or anybody. And I’d like to say to women out there everywhere: Don’t allow these right-wing talking heads, these dishonorable people, to intimidate you or scare you. Be who you are. Do what you do. And let us get on with discussing the real issues of this country.”The O’Reillys of the world see Waters as nothing but an angry black woman. And she is, indeed, an angry black woman ― rightfully and unapologetically so.“It’s not good advice to get in a fight with Maxine Waters,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former LA county supervisor who has known Waters for decades and who noted that O’Reilly apologized with uncharacteristic speed. “What’s the ‘Man of La Mancha’ quote? ‘Whether the stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits the stone, it’s going to be bad for the pitcher.’” Waters’ anger wards off rivals. It enhances her moral authority. And it comforts and amplifies her often equally angry constituents.“She can sometimes be animated, and I think people might think that that is evidence of lack of control,” said Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), who has long served with Waters on the Financial Services Committee. “But it is not. It is quite calculated, and most of the time, it is very effective.”* * *Maxine Waters, one of 13 children, was born in 1938 in St. Louis, a city that was a capital of black culture and politics at the time. Waters’ high school yearbook predicted she’d become speaker of the House ― an impressively optimistic prediction, given that she graduated a decade before the Voting Rights Act mandated African Americans’ right to vote.Waters started her family at a young age and had two children before moving west to LA and finding a gig as a service representative for Pacific Telephone, while working her way slowly toward a sociology degree. She later became a supervisor for a head start program in Watts, a black working-class neighborhood in South Los Angeles ― her first foray into professional public service.One night in August 1965, cops pulled over an African-American motorist in Watts and beat him badly. Then, as now, police violence was a not-unheard-of occurrence. But there’s no telling when a single moment becomes a spark that lights a fire, and this one lit up Watts. The neighborhood erupted in protest, leading to what became known as the Watts Rebellion — or, to white America, the Watts Riots.Following the rebellion, a small group of black politicians and organizers came together at a crucial meeting in Bakersfield in 1966. Waters, whose activism in the community was becoming increasingly high profile, was among them. From that meeting came a long-term, statewide wave of black politicians from California, focused on improving conditions for communities of color.“Anybody who became ‘somebody’ was there,” James Richardson, a Sacramento Bee reporter who covered much of Waters’ early career, said of the Bakersfield summit. “They plotted over how to gain electoral power and it was a watershed moment that wasn’t really seen.”Waters’ work in the community eventually led to a gig that would define her approach to politics the rest of her life: serving as a top aide to LA Councilman David Cunningham Jr. When she’s been asked since why she continues flying cross-country every single week, despite facing no political threat to her seat, she recalls what she learned as a chief deputy to Cunningham: the importance of constituent service. In 1976, Waters ran for and won a seat in the California State Assembly. She has been in elected office ever since.“It’s as if she never left the public housing projects in Watts in all of her life,” said her longtime ally Willie Brown, a speaker of the Assembly who went on to become mayor of San Francisco.* * *Waters has been in political life long enough to see the Democratic Party transform several times over. She is, in many ways, a holdover from another time. But the world seems to be coming full circle. Today, nearly every Democrat identifies as “progressive,” but decades ago the word had a specific meaning and referred to a movement launched in opposition to urban machine politicians who relied on transactional politics and constituent service to consolidate power. Progressives prioritized anti-corruption and the integrity of the political process. The penny-ante palm greasing of the city machine gave way to the sanitized, large-scale corruption of national politics by corporate money. With government watchdogs on the prowl, politicians lost the ability to bestow jobs and other benefits on supporters in the community. It was all well-intentioned, but as the power to better the community moved to the private sector and out of politicians’ hands, quality of life in the community steadily declined.Waters is not a good-government progressive. She is an old-school liberal, one who believes that outcomes matter more than process. She prides herself on constituent service. And she often wins.“It is hard to think of any single member of Congress who has done more than Maxine to protect the financial reforms and prevent another financial crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “Her work touches every family in America. She’s really been good.”* * *Waters’ keen sense of public opinion is as strong as that of any member of Congress. She has leaned right into the Auntie Maxine persona as yet another method of relating to constituents. At a private meeting of her House colleagues earlier this year, Democrats were debating the stunning level of grassroots energy around the country — and how it could be harnessed to regain power. Waters rose to address her colleagues, stressing the importance of learning the language the kids use today — and explained the meaning of the phrase “stay woke.” (The phrase originated as a way for black activists to remind each other of systemic inequality; it has since evolved to describe anybody who professes concern for social justice ― up to and including ride-share companies.) Waters’ grassroots touch — combined with her grueling work ethic and endless frequent flyer miles — is what allowed Waters to know long before national groups, and before federal regulators, that big banks were engaging in rampant mortgage servicing fraud and foreclosure scams. It has helped her stay far ahead of the national curve on issues such as mass incarceration, the drug war and police brutality. And by sensing — and leaping to satiate — a tremendous hunger among the Democratic base to not only delegitimize and de-normalize Trump, but to actually impeach him, she’s fueled her latest star turn.“Maxine is a grassroots person,” said Yaroslavsky, the former LA county supervisor. “She’s as comfortable in the district as she is in the committee. ... You learn to take care of the people who pay your salary. And sometimes she steps on toes doing that, but usually she takes the populist position because that’s what she thinks is her role.”“Maxine was a tough person. You didn’t cross her. She could give a fiery speech on the floor and send your bill to the dumper. Some nicknamed her ‘Mad Max’ behind her back,” Richardson said of her state Assembly years. “She would represent [Assembly Speaker Willie Brown] in budget meetings, so everyone knew that Maxine was to be taken seriously because she was speaking for him. And for herself.”Waters’ crowning achievement in the Assembly was a bill she co-authored with Brown, who’d also been at the Bakersfield meeting, and convinced Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to sign. It divested California’s mammoth pension system from South African interests in protest of apartheid. Convincing the governor was difficult, Brown reported, but Waters got to work, demonstrating an interest in issues that Deukmejian cared about, such as farming regulations in California’s Central Valley, coastline and water resources in Los Angeles. She was able to demonstrate her commitment to his issues enough to engender the goodwill necessary to receive his support, Brown said. It was in stark contrast to the image of the blustering demagogue, and it’s one colleagues said they’ve seen over and over in the years since. The coastal and farming policy insights she picked up in pursuit of Nelson Mandela’s freedom, indeed, would become handy as she helped shape a flood insurance bill 30 years later.(Brown is selling himself a bit short, as he always played a major role. Richardson notes that the speaker effectively appealed to Deukmejian’s family history. The governor, who was of Armenian descent, lost family in the Armenian genocide.)California blocked its huge pension fund from investing in South African interests in 1986. It was a watershed moment in the anti-apartheid movement, and Mandela was released in 1990. Brown said Mandela traveled to California during his first United States tour following his release to thank Waters for her part in freeing him. “Maxine’s history is replete with successes, but none greater than freeing Nelson Mandela,” Brown said.That may sound like too much credit for a collective action, but Brown says Waters’ move set off a chain reaction ― as she hoped it would ― that led to his release. “Nelson Mandela was freed because Maxine Waters orchestrated a process in the legislature to divest our pension fund on the basis of apartheid,” Brown said. “This was quickly followed by Congress and other municipalities and it led clearly to the ultimate freedom of Nelson Mandela.”Indeed, Waters’ dominance of the Assembly in the 1980s is hard to overstate. Nobody who saw the authority the diminutive young woman wielded in the chamber is surprised at what she has become today. “The things going on in California in the ‘80s make DC look like nothing,” Richardson said. “We’d go months without a government, everything shut down, over pensions and benefits for teachers and the poor.” Waters withstood all of that. Persisted, even, you could say.“That’s her style. She will not be intimidated,” Richardson said, echoing language Waters used in response to O’Reilly’s recent racist attack on her.Although Waters worked the inside game in the Assembly, she held on to her outsider status throughout the 1980s, twice going against the party establishment in backing Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. When he fell short, she floated the possibility that black voters should support a third party if Democrats remained unresponsive to their concerns. And so when she ran for Congress in 1990, the party endorsed her primary opponent ― but Waters won anyway.She has been fighting established power ever since, and her natural impulse with Trump taking the White House this year was to charge right at him. Immediately after the election, the Democratic Party was caught in a debate over how to approach a Trump presidency. Would they try to work with him where possible, or resist his agenda across the board? Waters, who boycotted his inauguration, seems to see the answer as simple and has promised a full-blown rejection of Trump. “As I said earlier to someone I was talking to,” Waters told HuffPost, “I became very offended by him during his campaign the way he mocked disabled journalists, the way he talked about grabbing women by their private parts ... the way he stalked Hillary Clinton at the debate that I attended in Missouri where he circled her as she was standing trying to give her petition on the issues. The way he has praised [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and talked about the great leader he was. And the way that he pushed back even on Bill O’Reilly on the Fox show when Bill O’Reilly said in so many words, ‘Why are you so supportive of Putin? He’s a killer.’ And he said, ‘so what,’ in so many words, ‘[it’s] the United States, people get killed here all the time’ or something like that.”“I think that for the future, we have to deal with this administration and organizing to try and take back the House and the White House,” she continued.Mikael Moore, Waters’ grandson who served as a longtime aide to her in Congress, put it succinctly: “She runs toward the fight.”“She is operating no differently than she did prior to Trump’s arrival,” Brown said. “She generated just as much attention during the Bush years. [During Obama’s and Clinton’s terms] she had the great joy of not having to do that.”During the 2016 election, Waters clashed with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders when she backed Hillary Clinton in the primary instead. Some of her staffers were frustrated by Waters’ early enthusiasm for Clinton, whom they saw as much weaker on Waters’ signature issue of bank reform. When Sanders was invited to address the Democratic caucus in July 2016 — after the primary was effectively over, but while Sanders was continuing to campaign — some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, of which Waters is a member, heckled him. The CBC has a long, fraught relationship with Wall Street, often allying with big banks for fundraising purposes (much like the rest of the party). And since 2013, Waters had been the banks’ chief adversary in leadership, warning members of the caucus that helping Wall Street could result in a lot of pain for their black constituents a few years down the line. But at the Sanders address, Waters gave her colleagues cover by taking on Sanders.“Basically her question was, ‘Why do you keep talking about breaking up the banks when we already fixed this with Dodd-Frank?’” recalls one Democratic staffer who witnessed the confrontation.This fed a narrative the Clinton campaign was trying to foster — Bernie was a dreamer who didn’t understand policy. Most members of Congress, of course, do not understand financial policy ― they defer to leaders on the Financial Services Committee. Here was the top Democrat on that committee saying Sanders didn’t get it. It was powerful. But Waters’ own staffers knew their boss was twisting the policy. “Too big to fail” is alive and well in American banking.Dodd-Frank gave regulators the tools to fix the problem, but they haven’t used them, and Sanders wanted to force their hands. “It was pretty deflating,” one former Waters staffer says.* * *Waters combined her fierce nature with her constituent savvy after the 1992 LA riots, with a response that would come to define her career: She took a hard line with colleagues, but used a soft touch with her those who would vote for her.In April 1992, communities across South Los Angeles, enraged by the acquittals of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, launched what locals still refer to as an uprising — known nationally as the LA riots.In the wake of the chaos, Waters, who was then in her first term in Congress, showed up uninvited to a meeting President George H.W. Bush had called to discuss “urban problems,” according to a New York Times report.“I’ve been out here trying to define these issues,” she told Speaker Thomas S. Foley. “I don’t intend to be excluded or dismissed. We have an awful lot to say.”Back home, she struck a more poetic note, addressing constituents in a letter reprinted by the Los Angeles Times. In it, she employed a canny understanding of the zeitgeist and the language of the moment:My dear children, my friends, my brothers, life is sometimes cold-blooded and rotten. And it seems nobody, nobody cares.But there are the good times, the happy moments.I’m talking about the special times when a baby is born and when gospel music sounds good on Sunday morning. When Cube is kickin’ and Public Enemy is runnin’ it. When peach cobbler and ice cream tastes too good, the down-home blues makes you sing and shout, and someone simply saying, ‘I love you’ makes you want to cry.Her letter went on to condemn police brutality, predatory lending in communities of color, for-profit schools and a racist justice system. Save a few names, it could have been written today.In 1994, Republicans won control of Congress and Waters immediately joined the resistance. When activists from the affordable housing group ACORN were arrested early the next year for protesting newly minted Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) demanded that the Capitol Police release them, but he had no luck. Waters did more than demand. She marched down to the station herself and refused to leave until the protesters were let go. The police relented.Those are exactly the sort of moments that have made Waters’ resistance to Trump so resonant: She stands up to power on behalf of causes and people who are not broadly popular across the political spectrum. Yet she goes there.In one of Waters’ first votes in Congress, on the 1994 crime bill that has since become infamous as an avatar of mass incarceration, she and other Democrats were under tremendous pressure to do something about rising crime rates. Hillary Clinton, who was then first lady, warned of “super predators,” language she apologized for 22 years later.Sanders, an independent representing Vermont in the House, voted for it — a capitulation he would regret during his 2016 presidential campaign. Two-thirds of the Congressional Black Caucus ended up voting for the bill, including a former Black Panther. Waters voted no.But Waters hasn’t just stuck to issues considered traditionally liberal, or to issues that affect a disproportionate number of black Americans, such as criminal justice or housing policy. When Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D-Pa.) was defeated in 2010, “everybody assumed” Waters would stay on the housing subcommittee, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) recalled. She chose securities, not housing. “That surprised people,” he said, “but it was very sensible” — savvy, even, given the rising importance of Wall Street issues to the liberal base — and defied “the notion that she was just some bleeding-heart who could be for poor people but couldn’t handle the hard stuff.”Two years later, when Frank retired, the top position became available. Despite a widespread presumption on K Street that she would be passed over for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a white New York lawmaker much friendlier to Wall Street, Waters took the ranking member position. “She has made a career out of people underestimating her,” said Lynch, who serves with her on the committee. “She really has.”Bank lobbyists quickly found that Waters didn’t need to be a policy wonk on Day One to handle the job. “When Mr. Frank had the committee, he was so well-versed in many of the subjects that the debate tended to center around him, but when Ms. Waters became ranking member, she really sought out members who had expertise in certain areas and it really became more of a team,” Lynch said. “Barney was a wonk, financial policy wonk, a very, very bright guy and has a whole different style than Maxine. She comes to that job with a whole different set of tools and she uses them quite effectively.”She’s been forced into wonk mode since taking the job. “Yeah, she’s not happy about it, but she’s become much more embroiled in the nuances of finance and economic policy,” he said.In 2013, during the fall of her first year as ranking member, Wall Street pushed a bill that would offer taxpayer backing for derivatives trades. It was pitched as a modest technical change and had coasted through the House the session before. Some of Waters’ CBC colleagues were working hard for the bill and trying to get the entire caucus to back it as a bloc.Waters saw it as undermining the safeguards Dodd-Frank had put in place, but it flew through committee on a 53-6 vote, over Waters’ opposition. Then Waters went to war behind the scenes, forcing the caucus to take no position on the bill. On the House floor, it passed, but a majority of Democrats voted against it, rendering it dead in the Senate and meaning it would have less sway with regulators who look to vote totals for guidance.Waters’ bomb-throwing reputation belies an ability to work with Republicans when she needs to. The GOP chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of West Texas, for instance, had no plans to take up a major priority of Waters’, a reform of flood insurance that was critical to a coastal state like California. “West Texas hasn’t had a flood since Noah and he was not open to the idea at all,” Lynch said of the 2013 fight.So Waters went to work. “She actually formed a coalition with coastal Republicans and coastal Democrats and got that bill taken away from Mr. Hensarling. The speaker took control of it and we eventually got it passed, and I thought that was masterful to be in the minority and be able to do that,” Lynch said. “She built those coalitions with Republicans from Mississippi and Florida and California, Louisiana. I thought that was probably the toughest fight but she was very successful.”Wall Street fought Waters again during the lame-duck session of 2014. The period after an election and before a new Congress is sworn in is supposed to be a bit of a time-limited, all-you-can-eat buffet for K Street. A year earlier, Republicans had forced a government shutdown by demanding that Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act as part of any deal to maintain federal operations. Democrats had gone to the mat to stand up for their most high-profile achievement.This time around, Wall Street reform was on the menu. Senate leaders in both parties had agreed to include a new slate of federal subsidies for credit default swaps — the risky trades that demolished AIG in 2008.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and President Barack Obama seemed poised to give the GOP the win. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats’ leader in the House, did not like confronting Obama in public, and she certainly didn’t want to risk a public relations debacle that could result from a government shutdown — not for an obscure Dodd-Frank provision.Waters didn’t give her a choice. She decried the bill in press conferences and TV appearances. More importantly, she started whipping members against the bill. If funding the government required subsidizing risky Wall Street speculation, Democrats should force the shutdown and let Republicans explain why they wanted to help big banks so much, Waters argued. She set up a makeshift war room in her Capitol Hill office, and even recruited Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) — a frequent friend of banks on the House Financial Services Committee — to call members and urge them to shoot down the spending bill.She brought another recruit to the fight, too, reaching out to Rep. Frank, who just a few weeks before had voiced support for the provision Republicans were trying to push through. Frank joined Waters for a phone call with reporters and advocated for killing the bill.“I didn’t change my substantive position,” Frank insists today, putting his advocacy effort in the broader context of a fight to defend the integrity of Dodd-Frank. “I didn’t think [the measure in question] was very important. But I thought it set a very bad precedent to open up Dodd-Frank to amendment without debate.” Frank had become convinced by the argument Waters was making, that the politics were just as important as the policy ― and caving on the politics could lead to much worse policy.The bill, which had been expected to pass with little fanfare, faltered. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) didn’t have the votes. He knew he couldn’t bring around the hard-liners in his own caucus, who were building their own careers by opposing Boehner as a big-spending liberal sellout. He needed Democrats, and the Waters war room was working. Even Pelosi came out against the bill, granting angry Democrats all the cover they needed to vote no.The bill looked dead. Then Obama and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon began making personal phone calls to individual House members imploring them to support the package. They eventually got the votes. Waters dinged the president as a Wall Street collaborator.“I know that the president was whipping and he was supporting this bill and I know that Jamie Dimon was whipping,” she told reporters after the vote. “That’s an odd combination.”The December 2014 fight was painful. Waters lost. But the fight galvanized the party against Wall Street and embarrassed the president. Waters and her allies made their point. Obama and Reid never agreed to slip pro-bank measures into spending bills again.“Maxine led the charge to defeat that bill in the House,” Sen. Warren recalled.That success all goes back to Waters’ connection to her constituents. Former Reps. Brad Miller (D-N.C.) and Mary Jo Kilroy (D-Ohio) both served on the Financial Services Committee with Waters, and both recall that she was the first person they heard identify mortgage servicing fraud as an issue that needed attention. Going around her district, it was something she kept hearing about. “I recall Maxine as being relentless in calling out Wells Fargo and other loan servicers on their policies and practices with respect to the slow place and many obstacles they put on loan modifications,” Kilroy said.“She was really one of the first, maybe the very first, to raise the issue of mortgage servicer conduct, which she heard about from her constituents in California. That was before the national advocacy groups were really on it,” Miller said.“She kept asking witnesses at hearings about servicing problems,” Miller said. “I thought it was a distraction at the time. But it gradually became more and more evident what a problem servicer conduct was.”By 2011, Waters wanted to force the issue. That January, she joined with Miller, Lynch and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to write a letter to the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency challenging a recent settlement with Bank of America, suggesting it had failed to address the problem. Miller thought Waters’ draft was too strongly worded. “I insisted she dial it back,” he recalled, an insistence Lynch recalls as well. She did.Months later, when Miller read the inspector general’s report that had been sparked by the letter, he concluded that her initial scathing letter had been entirely appropriate. “When we got the IG’s report, I wished that we’d sent a letter harsher than her draft,” Miller said. “She sometimes seems like a bomb thrower, but the people at whom she threw the bombs often turn out to have deserved it.”Taryn Finley contributed reporting.Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox.

14,POLITICS,Maxine Waters' Political Career Makes Her Uniquely Suited To Take On Donald Trump,"Ryan Grim, Julia Craven, and Meredith Melnick",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/maxine-waters-donald-trump_us_58eb98d5e4b00de141053b7f,"With decades of experience battling injustice, the congresswoman is now aiming her anger at the president.",2017-04-15,"Waters delivers remarks during a ceremony to celebrate the life Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former South Africa President Nelson Mandela on his 95th birthday in the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center on July 18, 2013, in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58eb9d442c00006268ff32cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Maxine Waters spends her weekends at home. For most people, this is not an unusual habit. But for Waters, it requires extra effort: Each Monday Congress has been in session over the past 26 years, she has embarked on a 2,300-mile commute from her home in Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., where she currently serves as one of the most powerful Democrats in the House of Representatives.A pre-dawn, cross-country flight to head to work in D.C. is irritating business. Former staffers say the six-hour journey suits the 78-year-old congresswoman just about as well as you’d expect. Her 5 p.m. Monday meetings can get hot. Aides who have spent the weekend gathering Capitol Hill intelligence, studying the intricacies of securities law and trying to win new political allies report to the full staff in front of a one-woman firing squad.“It’s definitely a situation that can be slightly intimidating,” said one former staffer, comparing the grillings to the Trump administration’s televised press conferences. “She interrupts, doesn’t let them finish, scolds them. These are people who are just trying to get her up to speed on what’s happening.”Waters yells at staffers for things like making eye contact with other aides. She unceremoniously fires people who give presentations that don’t live up to her standards.The scene, at first, might clash with the image of Waters that has taken off on the internet since the election of Donald Trump. The meme-ified image of “Auntie Maxine” ― a fearless, quirky black woman who may not be related to you, but whom you love and respect for her straight talk just the same ― has become a favorite of millennials and brought Waters’ Twitter account up to hundreds of thousands of followers. But, at a closer look, her staff meetings actually fit with her internet persona: Auntie Maxine, like many black women when it’s time to buckle down at work, isn’t about to play with you.“There’s a genuineness,” said R. Eric Thomas, a columnist for Elle.com who has written several viral articles with headlines like “You Will Never, In Your Entire Life, Get The Best Of Maxine Waters.” “With Maxine, she’s talking like everyone you respect in your life talks, but whom you wouldn’t expect to be in Washington,” he said. “If my mom and my aunt were running Washington, everyone would straighten up and fly right. I think a lot of people feel that way.”And Waters’ comments about Trump have fit that bill.“I think that he is disrespectful of most people,” Waters told The Huffington Post. “He has no respect for other human beings. He lies, he cannot be trusted, I don’t know what it means to sit down with someone like that who you cannot believe one word that they say once you get up by talking to them. I have no trust and no faith in him whatsoever.”Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said he helped coax Waters to come to Georgia for an upcoming event, given her overwhelming popularity in the black community. “She’s hard-edged, hard-nosed, hard-driving, firm in her beliefs, and she is an institution unto herself. African Americans adore her,” Johnson said.Waters’ experience as a black woman in America gives the rage in her voice an added dose of authenticity. Waters has come about that anger honestly: Black people, particularly women, have generally been treated horribly throughout American history. Black men began serving as sheriffs, congressmen and senators as early as 1870, and black women often did a bulk of the work necessary to advance men into those positions and support them while in office. But it wasn’t until 1968 ― when Maxine Waters was 30 ― that Shirley Chisholm became the first black woman elected to Congress.When Trump or his surrogates take on Waters, as they have since she began speaking out against his policies, the attacks come with a barely sheathed racist edge. Fox News host Bill O’Reilly recently mocked her “James Brown wig,” saying he wouldn’t listen to her concerns about Trump’s politics because of it.In a viral response, Waters made clear who she is. “I’m a strong black woman, and I cannot be intimidated,” she said. “I cannot be thought to be afraid of Bill O’Reilly or anybody. And I’d like to say to women out there everywhere: Don’t allow these right-wing talking heads, these dishonorable people, to intimidate you or scare you. Be who you are. Do what you do. And let us get on with discussing the real issues of this country.”The O’Reillys of the world see Waters as nothing but an angry black woman. And she is, indeed, an angry black woman ― rightfully and unapologetically so.“It’s not good advice to get in a fight with Maxine Waters,” said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former LA county supervisor who has known Waters for decades and who noted that O’Reilly apologized with uncharacteristic speed. “What’s the ‘Man of La Mancha’ quote? ‘Whether the stone hits the pitcher or the pitcher hits the stone, it’s going to be bad for the pitcher.’” Waters’ anger wards off rivals. It enhances her moral authority. And it comforts and amplifies her often equally angry constituents.“She can sometimes be animated, and I think people might think that that is evidence of lack of control,” said Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), who has long served with Waters on the Financial Services Committee. “But it is not. It is quite calculated, and most of the time, it is very effective.”* * *Maxine Waters, one of 13 children, was born in 1938 in St. Louis, a city that was a capital of black culture and politics at the time. Waters’ high school yearbook predicted she’d become speaker of the House ― an impressively optimistic prediction, given that she graduated a decade before the Voting Rights Act mandated African Americans’ right to vote.Waters started her family at a young age and had two children before moving west to LA and finding a gig as a service representative for Pacific Telephone, while working her way slowly toward a sociology degree. She later became a supervisor for a head start program in Watts, a black working-class neighborhood in South Los Angeles ― her first foray into professional public service.One night in August 1965, cops pulled over an African-American motorist in Watts and beat him badly. Then, as now, police violence was a not-unheard-of occurrence. But there’s no telling when a single moment becomes a spark that lights a fire, and this one lit up Watts. The neighborhood erupted in protest, leading to what became known as the Watts Rebellion — or, to white America, the Watts Riots.Following the rebellion, a small group of black politicians and organizers came together at a crucial meeting in Bakersfield in 1966. Waters, whose activism in the community was becoming increasingly high profile, was among them. From that meeting came a long-term, statewide wave of black politicians from California, focused on improving conditions for communities of color.“Anybody who became ‘somebody’ was there,” James Richardson, a Sacramento Bee reporter who covered much of Waters’ early career, said of the Bakersfield summit. “They plotted over how to gain electoral power and it was a watershed moment that wasn’t really seen.”Waters’ work in the community eventually led to a gig that would define her approach to politics the rest of her life: serving as a top aide to LA Councilman David Cunningham Jr. When she’s been asked since why she continues flying cross-country every single week, despite facing no political threat to her seat, she recalls what she learned as a chief deputy to Cunningham: the importance of constituent service. In 1976, Waters ran for and won a seat in the California State Assembly. She has been in elected office ever since.“It’s as if she never left the public housing projects in Watts in all of her life,” said her longtime ally Willie Brown, a speaker of the Assembly who went on to become mayor of San Francisco.* * *Waters has been in political life long enough to see the Democratic Party transform several times over. She is, in many ways, a holdover from another time. But the world seems to be coming full circle. Today, nearly every Democrat identifies as “progressive,” but decades ago the word had a specific meaning and referred to a movement launched in opposition to urban machine politicians who relied on transactional politics and constituent service to consolidate power. Progressives prioritized anti-corruption and the integrity of the political process. The penny-ante palm greasing of the city machine gave way to the sanitized, large-scale corruption of national politics by corporate money. With government watchdogs on the prowl, politicians lost the ability to bestow jobs and other benefits on supporters in the community. It was all well-intentioned, but as the power to better the community moved to the private sector and out of politicians’ hands, quality of life in the community steadily declined.Waters is not a good-government progressive. She is an old-school liberal, one who believes that outcomes matter more than process. She prides herself on constituent service. And she often wins.“It is hard to think of any single member of Congress who has done more than Maxine to protect the financial reforms and prevent another financial crisis,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). “Her work touches every family in America. She’s really been good.”* * *Waters’ keen sense of public opinion is as strong as that of any member of Congress. She has leaned right into the Auntie Maxine persona as yet another method of relating to constituents. At a private meeting of her House colleagues earlier this year, Democrats were debating the stunning level of grassroots energy around the country — and how it could be harnessed to regain power. Waters rose to address her colleagues, stressing the importance of learning the language the kids use today — and explained the meaning of the phrase “stay woke.” (The phrase originated as a way for black activists to remind each other of systemic inequality; it has since evolved to describe anybody who professes concern for social justice ― up to and including ride-share companies.) Waters’ grassroots touch — combined with her grueling work ethic and endless frequent flyer miles — is what allowed Waters to know long before national groups, and before federal regulators, that big banks were engaging in rampant mortgage servicing fraud and foreclosure scams. It has helped her stay far ahead of the national curve on issues such as mass incarceration, the drug war and police brutality. And by sensing — and leaping to satiate — a tremendous hunger among the Democratic base to not only delegitimize and de-normalize Trump, but to actually impeach him, she’s fueled her latest star turn.“Maxine is a grassroots person,” said Yaroslavsky, the former LA county supervisor. “She’s as comfortable in the district as she is in the committee. ... You learn to take care of the people who pay your salary. And sometimes she steps on toes doing that, but usually she takes the populist position because that’s what she thinks is her role.”“Maxine was a tough person. You didn’t cross her. She could give a fiery speech on the floor and send your bill to the dumper. Some nicknamed her ‘Mad Max’ behind her back,” Richardson said of her state Assembly years. “She would represent [Assembly Speaker Willie Brown] in budget meetings, so everyone knew that Maxine was to be taken seriously because she was speaking for him. And for herself.”Waters’ crowning achievement in the Assembly was a bill she co-authored with Brown, who’d also been at the Bakersfield meeting, and convinced Republican Gov. George Deukmejian to sign. It divested California’s mammoth pension system from South African interests in protest of apartheid. Convincing the governor was difficult, Brown reported, but Waters got to work, demonstrating an interest in issues that Deukmejian cared about, such as farming regulations in California’s Central Valley, coastline and water resources in Los Angeles. She was able to demonstrate her commitment to his issues enough to engender the goodwill necessary to receive his support, Brown said. It was in stark contrast to the image of the blustering demagogue, and it’s one colleagues said they’ve seen over and over in the years since. The coastal and farming policy insights she picked up in pursuit of Nelson Mandela’s freedom, indeed, would become handy as she helped shape a flood insurance bill 30 years later.(Brown is selling himself a bit short, as he always played a major role. Richardson notes that the speaker effectively appealed to Deukmejian’s family history. The governor, who was of Armenian descent, lost family in the Armenian genocide.)California blocked its huge pension fund from investing in South African interests in 1986. It was a watershed moment in the anti-apartheid movement, and Mandela was released in 1990. Brown said Mandela traveled to California during his first United States tour following his release to thank Waters for her part in freeing him. “Maxine’s history is replete with successes, but none greater than freeing Nelson Mandela,” Brown said.That may sound like too much credit for a collective action, but Brown says Waters’ move set off a chain reaction ― as she hoped it would ― that led to his release. “Nelson Mandela was freed because Maxine Waters orchestrated a process in the legislature to divest our pension fund on the basis of apartheid,” Brown said. “This was quickly followed by Congress and other municipalities and it led clearly to the ultimate freedom of Nelson Mandela.”Indeed, Waters’ dominance of the Assembly in the 1980s is hard to overstate. Nobody who saw the authority the diminutive young woman wielded in the chamber is surprised at what she has become today. “The things going on in California in the ‘80s make DC look like nothing,” Richardson said. “We’d go months without a government, everything shut down, over pensions and benefits for teachers and the poor.” Waters withstood all of that. Persisted, even, you could say.“That’s her style. She will not be intimidated,” Richardson said, echoing language Waters used in response to O’Reilly’s recent racist attack on her.Although Waters worked the inside game in the Assembly, she held on to her outsider status throughout the 1980s, twice going against the party establishment in backing Jesse Jackson’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. When he fell short, she floated the possibility that black voters should support a third party if Democrats remained unresponsive to their concerns. And so when she ran for Congress in 1990, the party endorsed her primary opponent ― but Waters won anyway.She has been fighting established power ever since, and her natural impulse with Trump taking the White House this year was to charge right at him. Immediately after the election, the Democratic Party was caught in a debate over how to approach a Trump presidency. Would they try to work with him where possible, or resist his agenda across the board? Waters, who boycotted his inauguration, seems to see the answer as simple and has promised a full-blown rejection of Trump. “As I said earlier to someone I was talking to,” Waters told HuffPost, “I became very offended by him during his campaign the way he mocked disabled journalists, the way he talked about grabbing women by their private parts ... the way he stalked Hillary Clinton at the debate that I attended in Missouri where he circled her as she was standing trying to give her petition on the issues. The way he has praised [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and talked about the great leader he was. And the way that he pushed back even on Bill O’Reilly on the Fox show when Bill O’Reilly said in so many words, ‘Why are you so supportive of Putin? He’s a killer.’ And he said, ‘so what,’ in so many words, ‘[it’s] the United States, people get killed here all the time’ or something like that.”“I think that for the future, we have to deal with this administration and organizing to try and take back the House and the White House,” she continued.Mikael Moore, Waters’ grandson who served as a longtime aide to her in Congress, put it succinctly: “She runs toward the fight.”“She is operating no differently than she did prior to Trump’s arrival,” Brown said. “She generated just as much attention during the Bush years. [During Obama’s and Clinton’s terms] she had the great joy of not having to do that.”During the 2016 election, Waters clashed with Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders when she backed Hillary Clinton in the primary instead. Some of her staffers were frustrated by Waters’ early enthusiasm for Clinton, whom they saw as much weaker on Waters’ signature issue of bank reform. When Sanders was invited to address the Democratic caucus in July 2016 — after the primary was effectively over, but while Sanders was continuing to campaign — some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, of which Waters is a member, heckled him. The CBC has a long, fraught relationship with Wall Street, often allying with big banks for fundraising purposes (much like the rest of the party). And since 2013, Waters had been the banks’ chief adversary in leadership, warning members of the caucus that helping Wall Street could result in a lot of pain for their black constituents a few years down the line. But at the Sanders address, Waters gave her colleagues cover by taking on Sanders.“Basically her question was, ‘Why do you keep talking about breaking up the banks when we already fixed this with Dodd-Frank?’” recalls one Democratic staffer who witnessed the confrontation.This fed a narrative the Clinton campaign was trying to foster — Bernie was a dreamer who didn’t understand policy. Most members of Congress, of course, do not understand financial policy ― they defer to leaders on the Financial Services Committee. Here was the top Democrat on that committee saying Sanders didn’t get it. It was powerful. But Waters’ own staffers knew their boss was twisting the policy. “Too big to fail” is alive and well in American banking.Dodd-Frank gave regulators the tools to fix the problem, but they haven’t used them, and Sanders wanted to force their hands. “It was pretty deflating,” one former Waters staffer says.* * *Waters combined her fierce nature with her constituent savvy after the 1992 LA riots, with a response that would come to define her career: She took a hard line with colleagues, but used a soft touch with her those who would vote for her.In April 1992, communities across South Los Angeles, enraged by the acquittals of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, launched what locals still refer to as an uprising — known nationally as the LA riots.In the wake of the chaos, Waters, who was then in her first term in Congress, showed up uninvited to a meeting President George H.W. Bush had called to discuss “urban problems,” according to a New York Times report.“I’ve been out here trying to define these issues,” she told Speaker Thomas S. Foley. “I don’t intend to be excluded or dismissed. We have an awful lot to say.”Back home, she struck a more poetic note, addressing constituents in a letter reprinted by the Los Angeles Times. In it, she employed a canny understanding of the zeitgeist and the language of the moment:My dear children, my friends, my brothers, life is sometimes cold-blooded and rotten. And it seems nobody, nobody cares.But there are the good times, the happy moments.I’m talking about the special times when a baby is born and when gospel music sounds good on Sunday morning. When Cube is kickin’ and Public Enemy is runnin’ it. When peach cobbler and ice cream tastes too good, the down-home blues makes you sing and shout, and someone simply saying, ‘I love you’ makes you want to cry.Her letter went on to condemn police brutality, predatory lending in communities of color, for-profit schools and a racist justice system. Save a few names, it could have been written today.In 1994, Republicans won control of Congress and Waters immediately joined the resistance. When activists from the affordable housing group ACORN were arrested early the next year for protesting newly minted Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) demanded that the Capitol Police release them, but he had no luck. Waters did more than demand. She marched down to the station herself and refused to leave until the protesters were let go. The police relented.Those are exactly the sort of moments that have made Waters’ resistance to Trump so resonant: She stands up to power on behalf of causes and people who are not broadly popular across the political spectrum. Yet she goes there.In one of Waters’ first votes in Congress, on the 1994 crime bill that has since become infamous as an avatar of mass incarceration, she and other Democrats were under tremendous pressure to do something about rising crime rates. Hillary Clinton, who was then first lady, warned of “super predators,” language she apologized for 22 years later.Sanders, an independent representing Vermont in the House, voted for it — a capitulation he would regret during his 2016 presidential campaign. Two-thirds of the Congressional Black Caucus ended up voting for the bill, including a former Black Panther. Waters voted no.But Waters hasn’t just stuck to issues considered traditionally liberal, or to issues that affect a disproportionate number of black Americans, such as criminal justice or housing policy. When Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D-Pa.) was defeated in 2010, “everybody assumed” Waters would stay on the housing subcommittee, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) recalled. She chose securities, not housing. “That surprised people,” he said, “but it was very sensible” — savvy, even, given the rising importance of Wall Street issues to the liberal base — and defied “the notion that she was just some bleeding-heart who could be for poor people but couldn’t handle the hard stuff.”Two years later, when Frank retired, the top position became available. Despite a widespread presumption on K Street that she would be passed over for Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a white New York lawmaker much friendlier to Wall Street, Waters took the ranking member position. “She has made a career out of people underestimating her,” said Lynch, who serves with her on the committee. “She really has.”Bank lobbyists quickly found that Waters didn’t need to be a policy wonk on Day One to handle the job. “When Mr. Frank had the committee, he was so well-versed in many of the subjects that the debate tended to center around him, but when Ms. Waters became ranking member, she really sought out members who had expertise in certain areas and it really became more of a team,” Lynch said. “Barney was a wonk, financial policy wonk, a very, very bright guy and has a whole different style than Maxine. She comes to that job with a whole different set of tools and she uses them quite effectively.”She’s been forced into wonk mode since taking the job. “Yeah, she’s not happy about it, but she’s become much more embroiled in the nuances of finance and economic policy,” he said.In 2013, during the fall of her first year as ranking member, Wall Street pushed a bill that would offer taxpayer backing for derivatives trades. It was pitched as a modest technical change and had coasted through the House the session before. Some of Waters’ CBC colleagues were working hard for the bill and trying to get the entire caucus to back it as a bloc.Waters saw it as undermining the safeguards Dodd-Frank had put in place, but it flew through committee on a 53-6 vote, over Waters’ opposition. Then Waters went to war behind the scenes, forcing the caucus to take no position on the bill. On the House floor, it passed, but a majority of Democrats voted against it, rendering it dead in the Senate and meaning it would have less sway with regulators who look to vote totals for guidance.Waters’ bomb-throwing reputation belies an ability to work with Republicans when she needs to. The GOP chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of West Texas, for instance, had no plans to take up a major priority of Waters’, a reform of flood insurance that was critical to a coastal state like California. “West Texas hasn’t had a flood since Noah and he was not open to the idea at all,” Lynch said of the 2013 fight.So Waters went to work. “She actually formed a coalition with coastal Republicans and coastal Democrats and got that bill taken away from Mr. Hensarling. The speaker took control of it and we eventually got it passed, and I thought that was masterful to be in the minority and be able to do that,” Lynch said. “She built those coalitions with Republicans from Mississippi and Florida and California, Louisiana. I thought that was probably the toughest fight but she was very successful.”Wall Street fought Waters again during the lame-duck session of 2014. The period after an election and before a new Congress is sworn in is supposed to be a bit of a time-limited, all-you-can-eat buffet for K Street. A year earlier, Republicans had forced a government shutdown by demanding that Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act as part of any deal to maintain federal operations. Democrats had gone to the mat to stand up for their most high-profile achievement.This time around, Wall Street reform was on the menu. Senate leaders in both parties had agreed to include a new slate of federal subsidies for credit default swaps — the risky trades that demolished AIG in 2008.Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and President Barack Obama seemed poised to give the GOP the win. Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats’ leader in the House, did not like confronting Obama in public, and she certainly didn’t want to risk a public relations debacle that could result from a government shutdown — not for an obscure Dodd-Frank provision.Waters didn’t give her a choice. She decried the bill in press conferences and TV appearances. More importantly, she started whipping members against the bill. If funding the government required subsidizing risky Wall Street speculation, Democrats should force the shutdown and let Republicans explain why they wanted to help big banks so much, Waters argued. She set up a makeshift war room in her Capitol Hill office, and even recruited Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) — a frequent friend of banks on the House Financial Services Committee — to call members and urge them to shoot down the spending bill.She brought another recruit to the fight, too, reaching out to Rep. Frank, who just a few weeks before had voiced support for the provision Republicans were trying to push through. Frank joined Waters for a phone call with reporters and advocated for killing the bill.“I didn’t change my substantive position,” Frank insists today, putting his advocacy effort in the broader context of a fight to defend the integrity of Dodd-Frank. “I didn’t think [the measure in question] was very important. But I thought it set a very bad precedent to open up Dodd-Frank to amendment without debate.” Frank had become convinced by the argument Waters was making, that the politics were just as important as the policy ― and caving on the politics could lead to much worse policy.The bill, which had been expected to pass with little fanfare, faltered. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) didn’t have the votes. He knew he couldn’t bring around the hard-liners in his own caucus, who were building their own careers by opposing Boehner as a big-spending liberal sellout. He needed Democrats, and the Waters war room was working. Even Pelosi came out against the bill, granting angry Democrats all the cover they needed to vote no.The bill looked dead. Then Obama and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon began making personal phone calls to individual House members imploring them to support the package. They eventually got the votes. Waters dinged the president as a Wall Street collaborator.“I know that the president was whipping and he was supporting this bill and I know that Jamie Dimon was whipping,” she told reporters after the vote. “That’s an odd combination.”The December 2014 fight was painful. Waters lost. But the fight galvanized the party against Wall Street and embarrassed the president. Waters and her allies made their point. Obama and Reid never agreed to slip pro-bank measures into spending bills again.“Maxine led the charge to defeat that bill in the House,” Sen. Warren recalled.That success all goes back to Waters’ connection to her constituents. Former Reps. Brad Miller (D-N.C.) and Mary Jo Kilroy (D-Ohio) both served on the Financial Services Committee with Waters, and both recall that she was the first person they heard identify mortgage servicing fraud as an issue that needed attention. Going around her district, it was something she kept hearing about. “I recall Maxine as being relentless in calling out Wells Fargo and other loan servicers on their policies and practices with respect to the slow place and many obstacles they put on loan modifications,” Kilroy said.“She was really one of the first, maybe the very first, to raise the issue of mortgage servicer conduct, which she heard about from her constituents in California. That was before the national advocacy groups were really on it,” Miller said.“She kept asking witnesses at hearings about servicing problems,” Miller said. “I thought it was a distraction at the time. But it gradually became more and more evident what a problem servicer conduct was.”By 2011, Waters wanted to force the issue. That January, she joined with Miller, Lynch and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) to write a letter to the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency challenging a recent settlement with Bank of America, suggesting it had failed to address the problem. Miller thought Waters’ draft was too strongly worded. “I insisted she dial it back,” he recalled, an insistence Lynch recalls as well. She did.Months later, when Miller read the inspector general’s report that had been sparked by the letter, he concluded that her initial scathing letter had been entirely appropriate. “When we got the IG’s report, I wished that we’d sent a letter harsher than her draft,” Miller said. “She sometimes seems like a bomb thrower, but the people at whom she threw the bombs often turn out to have deserved it.”Taryn Finley contributed reporting.Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox.

15,HEALTHY LIVING,11 Habits Of Mentally Strong People,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/11-habits-of-mentally-strong-people_us_58efd4a7e4b04cae050dc5bd,"Mental strength is a choice and a discipline, not an innate quality bestowed upon the lucky.",2017-04-15,"<p>Mental strength is a choice and a discipline, not an innate quality bestowed upon the lucky. Dr. Travis Bradberry unveils the habits they rely on so that you can start using them today.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efd4d92600001700c4597a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all reach critical points in our lives where our mental strength is tested. It might be a difficult friend or colleague, a dead-end job, or a struggling relationship.Whatever the challenge, you have to be strong, see things through a new lens, and take decisive action if you want to move through it successfully.It sounds easy. We all want good friends, good jobs, and good relationships.But it isn’t.It’s hard to be mentally strong, especially when you feel stuck. The ability to break the mold and take a bold new direction requires that extra grit, daring, and spunk that only the mentally strongest people have.It’s fascinating how mentally strong people set themselves apart from the crowd. Where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to overcome.When Thomas Edison’s factory burned to the ground in 1914, destroying one-of-a-kind prototypes and causing $23 million in damage, Edison’s response was simple:Thank goodness all our mistakes were burned up. Now we can start fresh again. Edison’s reaction is the epitome of mental strength—seeing opportunity and taking action when things look bleak.There are habits you can develop to improve your mental strength. In fact, the hallmarks of mentally strong people are actually strategies that you can begin using today.1. They’re emotionally intelligent. Emotional intelligence is the cornerstone of mental strength. You cannot be mentally strong without the ability to fully understand and tolerate strong negative emotions and do something productive with them. Moments that test your mental strength are ultimately testing your emotional intelligence (EQ).Unlike your IQ, which is fixed, your EQ is a flexible skill that you can improve with understanding and effort. It’s no wonder that 90% of top performers have high EQs and people with high EQs earn $28,000 more annually (on average) than their low-EQ counterparts. Unfortunately EQ skills are in short supply. TalentSmart has tested more than a million people, and we’ve found that just 36% of these are able to accurately identify their emotions as they happen.2. They’re confident. Mentally strong people subscribe to Ford’s notion that your mentality has a powerful effect on your ability to succeed. This notion isn’t just a motivational tool—it’s a fact. A recent study at the University of Melbourne showed that confident people went on to earn higher wages and get promoted more quickly than others did.Whether you think you can, or think you can’t—you’re right. – Henry Ford True confidence—as opposed to the false confidence people project to mask their insecurities—has a look all its own. Mentally strong people have an upper hand over the doubtful and the skittish because their confidence inspires others and helps them to make things happen.3. They say no. Research conducted at UC Berkeley showed that the more difficulty you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Mentally strong people know that saying no is healthy, and they have the self-esteem and foresight to make their nos clear.When it’s time to say no, mentally strong people avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” They say no with confidence because they know that saying no to a new commitment honors their existing commitments and gives them the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.The mentally strong also know how to exert self-control by saying no to themselves. They delay gratification and avoid impulsive action that causes harm.4. They neutralize difficult people. Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. Mentally strong people control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation rationally. They identify their emotions and don’t allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person’s standpoint and are able to find common ground and solutions to problems. Even when things completely derail, mentally strong people are able to take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring them down.5. They embrace change. Mentally strong people are flexible and are constantly adapting. They know that fear of change is paralyzing and a major threat to their success and happiness. They look for change that is lurking just around the corner, and they form a plan of action should these changes occur.Only when you embrace change can you find the good in it. You need to have an open mind and open arms if you’re going to recognize, and capitalize on, the opportunities that change creates.6. They embrace failure. Mentally strong people embrace failure because they know that the road to success is paved with it. No one ever experienced true success without first embracing failure. By revealing when you’re on the wrong path, your mistakes pave the way for you to succeed. The biggest breakthroughs typically come when you’re feeling the most frustrated and the most stuck. It’s this frustration that forces you to think differently, to look outside the box, and to see the solution that you’ve been missing.7. Yet, they don't dwell on mistakes. Mentally strong people know that where you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you’re facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress, which hinders performance. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy, which produces positive emotions and improves performance. Mentally strong people distance themselves from their mistakes, but they do so without forgetting them. By keeping their mistakes at a safe distance, yet still handy enough to refer to, they are able to adapt and adjust for future success.8. They don't compare themselves to others. Mentally strong people don’t pass judgment on other people because they know that everyone has something to offer, and they don’t need to take other people down a notch in order to feel good about themselves. Comparing yourself to other people is limiting. Jealousy and resentment suck the life right out of you; they’re massive energy-stealers. Mentally strong people don’t waste time or energy sizing people up and worrying about whether or not they measure up. Instead of wasting your energy on jealousy, funnel that energy into appreciation. When you celebrate the success of other people, you both benefit.9. They exercise. A study conducted at the Eastern Ontario Research Institute found that people who exercised twice a week for 10 weeks felt more socially, intellectually, and athletically competent. They also rated their body image and self-esteem higher. Best of all, rather than the physical changes in their bodies being responsible for the uptick in confidence, which is key to mental strength, it was the immediate, endorphin-fueled positivity from exercise that made all the difference.10. They get enough sleep. It’s difficult to overstate the importance of sleep to increasing your mental strength. When you sleep, your brain removes toxic proteins, which are by-products of neural activity when you're awake. Unfortunately, your brain can remove them adequately only while you're asleep, so when you don't get enough sleep, the toxic proteins remain in your brain cells, wreaking havoc by impairing your ability to think—something no amount of caffeine can fix.Mentally tough people know that their self-control, focus, and memory are all reduced when they don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep, so they make quality sleep a top priority.11. They’re relentlessly positive. Keep your eyes on the news for any length of time, and you’ll see that it’s just one endless cycle of war, violent attacks, fragile economies, failing companies, and environmental disasters. It’s easy to think the world is headed downhill fast. And who knows? Maybe it is. But mentally strong people don’t worry about that because they don’t get caught up in things they can’t control. Instead of trying to start a revolution overnight, they focus their energy on directing the two things that are completely within their power—their attention and their effort.Bringing It All TogetherMental strength is not an innate quality bestowed upon a select few. It can be achieved and enjoyed.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more?

16,POLITICS,WTF Happened To Curt Schilling?,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/curt-schilling-right-wing-politics_us_58e7e71be4b05413bfe2e232,How the Red Sox hero went from the top of the world to the bottom of the fever swamps.,2017-04-15,Former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling campaigned for Donald Trump in New Hampshire during the 2016 election. Massachusetts didn't want to hear from him anymore.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c85967140000200006f7b6.jpeg?cache=q3cjUHQcPS&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The sign appeared in a window above Boylston Street as the Red Sox paraded through downtown Boston to celebrate the team’s first World Series title in 86 years.Schilling/Bush ‘04.It was a tribute to Curt Schilling, the pitcher who’d been brought to Boston to boost a team that hadn’t won baseball’s biggest prize since 1918 and that had choked away yet another shot at the World Series the year before.He’d delivered immediately, winning 21 games in the regular season. But it was in the postseason that Schilling became a hero.The Red Sox had trailed the New York Yankees, their hated rivals, three games to two in the American League Championship Series that October. Although he needed sutures to hold his right ankle together, Schilling took the mound in Game 6. He was built for these moments ― he’d never lost a playoff game when his team was facing elimination. Even as he winced in pain, even as the blood soaked through his white sock, he threw seven innings of one-run ball, and the Red Sox won. A night later, they’d win again. A week later, they were World Series champs.Sox fans embraced Schilling, the man who had gutted it out. He may just have been popular enough to win a few votes for President George W. Bush that year, even in the Democratic stronghold of Boston.That sign linked him to Bush ― not the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts’ own Sen. John Kerry ― because Schilling was already an outspoken Republican. While the sign might have been a joke, the idea of him running for office someday didn’t seem that far-fetched ― to him or a lot of people who knew about politics. Baseball had taught him there was nothing he couldn’t do if the rest of the world would just get out of his damn way.By the time, more than a decade later, that Schilling floated the idea he might challenge another Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, in 2018, he’d become a laughingstock, a guy who was fired by ESPN for not shutting up and who shared the sort of idiotic memes once relegated to chain emails. He’d thrown himself behind Donald Trump, who was heading toward certain defeat in the Bay State. He’d taken to referring to Hillary Clinton as “Killary” and to her party as “the Demokkkrats.” And he’d landed a daily radio show on Breitbart News Network, the right-wing outlet that welcomed white supremacists and other angry men.So in October, when Schilling held a rally for Trump outside Boston city hall, perhaps a dozen people bothered to show up. Schilling, arms crossed, hat pulled down over his brow, stood there in the rain. He’d lost his grip on Boston and the world ― and it didn’t make sense. The chances of a high school baseball player being drafted by Major League Baseball are about 0.5 percent, according to Bleacher Report. The great majority of those drafted after the first round will never get out of the minor leagues. The number of players honored in the Hall of Fame is less than half the number who played in the majors just last season. Becoming a potential Hall of Famer requires a loose focus on reality, a stubborn refusal to consider the math that says success is virtually impossible.Schilling built his reputation on overcoming those odds. He didn’t make his high school varsity team until his senior year, and his next stop was junior college. He was drafted in the second round in 1986 and then spent several years bouncing between the minors and the majors as a reliever. He was traded three times early in his career and only broke through as a starter for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1992, when he was 25. Then he overcame a mid-career lull to lead the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks to the World Series in 2001. By the time he left Boston, he was a 200-game winner with three World Series championships and an outside shot at enshrinement in Cooperstown.Schilling arrived in Boston with a reputation as a no-nonsense pitcher who did whatever it took to win, and some saw his willingness to pitch through pain — see the Bloody Sock — as reminiscent of baseball’s old-timers. “You simply put their names in the lineup, and then sat back and watched the game,” a Boston Herald columnist wrote.There’s a sort of coded language in sportswriting, where praise about “grit” and “scrappiness” is often reserved for white athletes. The words draw a contrast, wittingly or not, with black and Latino players, who are described as flashier and more reliant on natural ability. The same code has long had a home in America’s political discourse. So while sports columnists saw Schilling’s pugnacious drive as an asset on the field, politicians like Bush saw his “blue-collar” approach to baseball as an asset on the campaign trail ― primarily by helping them appeal to white, working-class voters.President Bush’s advisers “shared high-fives,” the Boston Globe reported, when Schilling went on “Good Morning America” a few days after the 2004 World Series victory and urged viewers to “Vote Bush!” The Bush team immediately invited the pitcher to campaign with the president in New Hampshire, where Schilling could bolster the president’s efforts to paint himself as a man of the people. Meanwhile, they were pushing an elitist critique of Kerry, the man who windsurfed off Nantucket. Schilling appeared with Bush in Pennsylvania during the campaign’s final days. He cut radio ads that ran across New England.Three years later, Schilling hit the campaign trail for another Republican presidential candidate with the same goal in mind. A month after the Red Sox won the 2007 World Series — Schilling went 3-0 that postseason — Arizona Sen. John McCain, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination, brought Schilling on stage in New Hampshire. McCain’s team believed Schilling “personifies the Arizona senator’s grit and determination,” the Globe wrote.Schilling, who had signed a new contract with the Red Sox that October, hoped to pitch one more season in Boston. But he’d already thrown his last Major League pitch. His throwing shoulder began to act up during spring training in 2008. He wanted to have surgery; the team thought rehab would do the trick. Top brass also floated the idea of voiding his $8 million deal if he went under the knife against their wishes. In Schilling’s version of the tale, which he has recounted in multiple radio appearances since, the team accused him of hiding the shoulder injury to get that final contract.Schilling missed the entire 2008 season and ultimately retired early in 2009. He’s still mad about how his career ended and believes Red Sox management essentially gave up on him.“They’re up in the ivory tower and they’re trying to pass judgment,” Schilling said of how the team approached his injury in a 2016 interview. “They said things … that made me realize that they never gave a shit about me.”Schilling and Red Sox owner John W. Henry, according to the pitcher, battled over politics as well. Henry, who endorsed and campaigned with Kerry in 2004, “went nuts” when Schilling endorsed Bush, he said in that same interview.When Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) died six months into Schilling’s retirement, rumors began to circulate that Schilling was being recruited to run for the open seat. McCain told reporters that he had called Schilling to urge him to jump in the race.Schilling routinely stoked the rumor mill too ― and why not? Politics were a natural fit for the former pitcher. As a player, he’d always craved the sort of attention, positive or negative, that comes with being high-profile. His teammates in Philadelphia had dubbed him “Top Step Schill” and “Red Light Curt,” nods to his knack for finding the camera even when he wasn’t pitching. When the Globe asked Red Sox players about the election in 2004, another pitcher pointed the reporter straight to Schilling’s locker.“Curt had a large personality and a lot of opinions on a variety of subjects,” Pedro Martinez, Schilling’s co-ace in Boston’s pitching rotation, wrote in his 2016 autobiography, “but I didn’t spend any time listening or reading up on what he was saying to the media. I cared about him as a pitcher.”Schilling found a reliable sparring partner in Democratic outfielder Gabe Kapler. “Gabe Kapler and I used to have a ton of debates, he’s very liberal,” Schilling said during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session in 2016. Kapler was a “top 5 teammate of ALL TIME...even though politically he’s a bit ‘short,’” Schilling tweeted last year.As his baseball career neared its end, Schilling had increasingly filled his time by airing his political opinions ― through regular segments on Boston-area radio shows and posts on 38 Pitches, the blog that he’d launched to connect with fans and where he began to closely follow the 2008 election. (Thirty-eight was the number he wore throughout his career.)Schilling often engaged his critics on the blog, but he was not yet a firebrand. He was an “independent” and “will always be,” he wrote in a Sept. 5, 2009, blog post. He had voted for Bush twice and Bill Clinton before that, he said. He wanted lower taxes but was happy to pay his share. He opposed abortion and gay marriage but believed both were “so far beyond the scope or responsibility of one person to legislate it’s laughable.” He was “absolutely for the 2nd Amendment,” he wrote. “But I also think this country has become so beholden to special interest and lobbyists that we have completely sacrificed the safety and well being of the individual American citizen.”Schilling’s main political position was that “the status quo is not working” for ordinary people. “The person that works 9-to-5 for crap dollars gets spat on,” Schilling said in one interview about his potential candidacy, “and [Massachusetts is] becoming a state that’s next to impossible to live and prosper in, and I think it was anything but when it was founded.”But Schilling had little patience for far-right theories. In one post, he brushed aside right-wing concerns about Barack Obama’s supposed ties to Bill Ayers, the college professor who had co-founded the violent revolutionary group Weather Underground. The day after Obama won, Schilling congratulated the new president with a hint of admiration for the way he’d campaigned, if not for his politics.Schilling still seemed, in short, like the sort of Republican who might be able to pull off an upset in deep-blue Massachusetts. Newspapers and their columnists all but asked him to run for the Senate. A poll or two even showed he had an outside shot. And as he outlined his views ahead of a potential campaign, he painted himself the way Bush or McCain might have: as a moderate Republican willing to fight against a broken establishment.Politics, though, weren’t yet Schilling’s passion, and he ultimately chose not to run for Kennedy’s seat. Instead, he went on the campaign trail again as a surrogate for state Sen. Scott Brown, the Republican choice to pursue the opportunity he’d passed up. Just as Bush and McCain had before, Brown thought Schilling would bolster the working-class, anti-establishment image he’d crafted for himself (Brown made a show of driving a pickup truck and often draped a barn jacket over his suit).Schilling remained a baseball hero, and his exploits played into the race when the Democratic candidate, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, failed to grasp what the sport means to Bostonians. First, she sneered at the idea of “standing outside Fenway Park … in the cold … shaking hands” with voters. Later, she awkwardly suggested that Schilling was a Yankees fan.Schilling played it perfectly, with a diplomatic tone that still twisted the knife. “It’s not really that big of a deal,” he told reporters in January 2010. “But again, I think it’s another sign of her aloofness, or just the fact that she’s very out of touch with the people.”Brown pulled off the upset a few days later.After passing on the Senate race, Schilling turned his focus back to 38 Studios, a video game company he’d launched in 2007. A relentless work ethic and boundless confidence (plus his share of good luck) had earned him more than $90 million in 20 years of baseball. Now he dreamed his gaming startup would take him to the next level, making him “Bill Gates rich,” Boston Magazine wrote in 2012.Schilling was able to attract top-name talent, in part because of his money ― he pledged to finance much of the company himself ― and in part because he was Curt Schilling. His persistence didn’t hurt, either. In 2006, he called Todd McFarlane, an artist known for his work on Marvel Comics’ Spider-Man series and for creating Spawn, among the most popular comic characters ever. He wanted to share his business plan. He even flew McFarlane to Kansas City during a Red Sox road trip to discuss it in person. Schilling offered McFarlane a job as the company’s art director, but the designer didn’t commit on the spot.A few nights later, McFarlane’s phone rang for what felt like the hundredth time since the meeting. It was Schilling again, and he was whispering.“Todd, I’m in the locker room,” Schilling said, as McFarlane remembers now. “It’s the fifth inning. I’m not supposed to be making a call.” But he needed to know if McFarlane would take the job. McFarlane would eventually say yes.To achieve 38 Studios’ ambitious goal ― the creation of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game ― Schilling would also need more money. In July 2010, the state of Rhode Island agreed to help, giving 38 Studios a $75 million, taxpayer-backed loan guarantee. In return, Schilling moved the company to Providence and promised to create 450 jobs by the end of 2012. Alas, money, talent and Curt Schilling would not be enough. By 2012, 38 Studios was on the fast track to collapse, bleeding cash with little hope that it could actually produce a game. The company filed for bankruptcy in June of that year.Schilling had failed, and as he’d done when his pitching days ended, he pointed fingers. He blamed the government of Rhode Island, at least in part. If they’d just given him more time. He turned on Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who had begun to re-evaluate the loan guarantee deal.“They did everything in their power to make sure this went the way it went,’’ Schilling said later.As 38 Studios collapsed, a presidential election was heating up, once again featuring a Massachusetts politician, former Gov. Mitt Romney. Under different circumstances, Schilling might have made an effective campaign surrogate. Romney, a wealthy Republican venture capitalist, certainly needed help bolstering his connections to the working class, as the Obama campaign hammered him with devastating ads about people who’d lost jobs when Romney’s firm re-organized their companies. But Schilling’s shine had begun to tarnish. He’d left dozens of people out of work and cost Rhode Island taxpayers more than $100 million ― a fact that had soured much of New England on the former pitcher. His public fights with former employees and with Chafee, as well as the endless media examinations of 38 Studios’ downfall, didn’t help. The Romney campaign didn’t embrace him.Goodbye, pitching career. Goodbye, gaming empire. Goodbye, establishment camaraderie. Goodbye, fan worship. What had happened to the world as Curt Schilling understood it?After Obama was elected the nation’s first black president in 2008, social scientists and journalists noted a growing counter-phenomenon: “angry white men” who feel “they have been screwed, betrayed by the country they love, discarded like trash on the side of the information superhighway,” as sociologist Michael Kimmel wrote in his 2015 book. The defining characteristic of angry white men ― aside from being white and male ― is that they suffer from what Kimmel called “aggrieved entitlement”: the belief that America is “their country” and that it is being taken away from them. Although they’re angry at politicians, bureaucrats and the system writ large, the primary targets of their ire are women, minority groups and immigrants ― the people they perceive as the undeserving beneficiaries of their troubles. Seeking validation of their worth, they turned to “unapologetically ‘politically incorrect’ magazines, radio hosts, and television shows,” Kimmel wrote. And their rage only intensified when Obama was re-elected in 2012. That contest represented “the demise of the white American male voter as a dominant force in the political landscape,” Kimmel wrote. (They showed otherwise in 2016, when Trump won in part because of his strength with white men.)Schilling fits the pattern almost perfectly. It didn’t matter that baseball had made him a far richer and more privileged man than the middle-class subjects of Kimmel’s studies. Over the two years following the collapse of 38 Studios, Schilling sought out and found answers in the angrier and more paranoid corners of political thought. He started talking more about politics on the radio and social media. His views, at least those he expressed publicly, began to shift further right. He latched on to the Benghazi “scandal” that found fault with every Obama administration decision leading up to and following the deadly attack on that U.S. mission in Libya. His pet cause ― proving that climate change was a fraudulent hoax foisted on the American public ― became an even bigger passion.Schilling regularly called local radio shows during his playing days to urge fans not to trust sports reporters. After 38 collapsed, he moved on to the idea that news reporters were also peddling “fake news.” Judging from the links he shared, he was reading right-wing sites further and further from the mainstream. And he was isolating himself: “I don’t seek out people I disagree with,” he said in a 2016 interview. “I don’t seek out the content they create. It’s a waste of my time.”Kapler, Schilling’s old sparring partner in the Boston clubhouse, noticed the shift in 2013, when Schilling posted a link to a story on InfoWars.com, the conspiracy-driven site run by Alex Jones:As Schilling descended into the fever swamps of right-wing politics, one vestige of the old sports hero remained: his job as a baseball analyst at ESPN. He was good at it.The cable sports network had warned its talent about sharing political views online. Schilling earned his first suspension from ESPN in August 2015 for posting a meme comparing Muslims to Nazis. He kept posting controversial memes even after the suspension, railing against “illegals” and other immigrants and pondering a looming apocalypse. He told a Kansas City radio show that Clinton “should be buried under a jail somewhere” for keeping her emails on a private server. Then, in April 2016, Schilling crossed ESPN’s line for good. North Carolina’s GOP-controlled legislature had passed a law to bar transgender people from using the public bathrooms that match their gender identity, a move that sparked a nationwide backlash. Schilling chose to repost an image on Facebook that showed a portly man dressed in drag. “LET HIM IN,” it read.He was widely criticized on sports news sites. ESPN fired him two days later.Schilling blamed what he saw as the growing scourge of political correctness and ESPN’s alleged turn toward liberal politics. Never mind that two years earlier, the network had suspended baseball writer Keith Law for defending evolution in a debate with Schilling. Sarah Palin rushed to Schilling’s defense. “ESPN continues to screw up,” she said on Facebook.Untethered from the Red Sox, 38 Studios and now ESPN, Schilling grew louder and louder. He suggested he was planning to run for public office “soon” and laid out an ambitious path: “... state office first, white house in 8 years ... or 4 if by some amazing illegal event this country elects another clinton.”Schilling initially backed neurosurgeon Ben Carson in the 2016 Republican primary. But soon he threw his weight behind Trump, the candidate who best matched his own bombastic approach and in whom Schilling perhaps saw something of himself. “I realized very quickly this was a man decisive in action and confident in his ability,” Schilling wrote in a blog post announcing his endorsement. “I also realized that regardless of his net worth, he worked his ass off.”Although Trump never brought the former pitcher on the campaign trail, Schilling became something of a faux surrogate, appearing occasionally on cable to defend the candidate’s positions ― a role he seemed to earn for no other reason than that some viewers might remember him as a ballplayer.In October, Schilling landed a daily morning show at Breitbart, which had grown into an online behemoth by stoking the fears of the same white voters that politicians had once used the pitcher to reach. Schilling had long believed that someone else ― Red Sox management, the media, Chafee, ESPN ― was standing in the way of his ultimate success. Breitbart was the place where that kind of belief is a founding principle.The site, which was practically a house organ for the Trump campaign, pushed the idea that the American system was broken, especially for white working men, and it blamed immigrants, Muslims, feminists and Obama. In the words of its former chief Steve Bannon, Breitbart was “a platform for the alt-right” ― the white nationalist and racist movements that were supporting Trump.From the earliest days of his show, which he named “Whatever It Takes,” Schilling espoused the conspiracy theories and racial resentment that fed Trump’s base. The polls that showed Clinton ahead were cooked, he said. Early votes in favor of Trump were being destroyed. “Voters in Amarillo are saying their votes are being changed,” Schilling claimed during the show’s first week. “Just another day in America, boys. Gosh dang.”If Clinton were to win, he warned there could be “an IRS retaliation, an FBI retaliation” against conservative media. “You’re talking about Russia. Soviet-era KGB type stuff. I don’t think we’re that far from it.”Democratic immigration policies, he insisted, were an underhanded way to collapse the health care system in order to institute a full government takeover of the industry. He railed against “open borders.” At one point, he suggested a Clinton presidency could lead to an American apocalypse. “I’m not an Armageddon guy,” Schilling said. “But I don’t think this country can survive on this trajectory for four more years. And she’s going to be worse.”The Black Lives Matter movement was “founded on a complete lie” perpetrated by the media, he said. If the KKK is racist, he said, so is Black Lives Matter. “I’m tired of being made to feel bad about the history of my country,” Schilling told one caller. “I am being made to feel wrong when I stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or put my hand over my heart for the national anthem,” he blared. “I don’t care what you think.”Listen to the show, and it’s as if Schilling is back on the mound again, and the criticism he receives for his increasingly outlandish opinions is no different than the boos that once rained down on him in Yankee Stadium. They’re all proof that he’s right. “Yankee fans,” Schilling reminds his listeners now and again, “never booed a player who sucked.” Since October, when Schilling first told a Boston radio host that he planned to run for Warren’s seat, I’ve immersed myself in Schilling’s world – listened to his radio show, dug through his Twitter feed and blog posts, read old news clippings, and called former associates and Massachusetts political observers. Nearly everyone I spoke to agreed that Schilling’s extreme approach to politics had almost erased the joyous memories of his triumph in October 2004 and all but killed his Hall of Fame chances. It was ridiculous to think he could win a Senate race in Massachusetts, they said.“Curt’s not running,” one state GOP official told me bluntly this past winter. Schilling “doesn’t fit the mold of the kind of Republican that historically can be competitive here,” said Matthew Baron, a longtime Massachusetts political consultant. “If this were Alabama, maybe he’d have a shot,” said Dan Payne, a Democratic consultant. “But not in Massachusetts.”The polls and pundits both say Schilling doesn’t have a chance against Warren. They said that about Trump, as Schilling would surely remind you. But Schilling is less skilled as a provocateur than Trump. No matter your political views, his radio show isn’t any good. He’d proved himself a compelling contributor when he analyzed baseball at ESPN and called in to other people’s programs. He’s less capable when it comes to carrying a broadcast, so his show lacks the raw entertainment value of, say, a Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck production. He just sounds like what he is: a bitter man with a microphone.Schilling refused multiple interview requests made through Breitbart and his lawyer, who told me that the pitcher had “no interest” in talking. So in late February, I went to the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside the nation’s capital to make one last effort.CPAC is an annual gathering of conservative luminaries, lawmakers, media pundits and prospective politicians, a place where stars are born. There Schilling hardly fit the mold of a future candidate. He hunkered behind his microphone at Breitbart’s booth on radio row in a black button-down shirt, baggy jeans and leather flip-flops. At times, he drew the attention (and even admiration) of some bright lights of the right ― people like radio host Mark Levin, Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke and Trump deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka. But most people barely seemed to notice his presence.On the second afternoon of CPAC, Schilling stepped from behind radio row to mingle in the crowd, and I caught up with him for a brief moment. At first he was cordial. But when he realized I was a reporter, he took off through the crowd, the slap of his flip-flops audible for a few steps before he disappeared.The next day, back at the Breitbart booth, he decided he would entertain my central question. How had he gone from a standard-issue Republican to a conspiracy-mongering Breitbart host? How had a man to whom the world had given so much become so … angry?“It’s a natural progression,” he said.Then he turned and walked away.CORRECTION: GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was a wealthy venture capitalist, but he was not a billionaire."
17,POLITICS,WTF Happened To Curt Schilling?,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/curt-schilling-right-wing-politics_us_58e7e71be4b05413bfe2e232,How the Red Sox hero went from the top of the world to the bottom of the fever swamps.,2017-04-15,"Schilling became a legend in Boston during the 2004 postseason, when he helped the Red Sox win their first World Series title in 86 years. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c856961400001f0006f7ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The sign appeared in a window above Boylston Street as the Red Sox paraded through downtown Boston to celebrate the team’s first World Series title in 86 years.Schilling/Bush ‘04.It was a tribute to Curt Schilling, the pitcher who’d been brought to Boston to boost a team that hadn’t won baseball’s biggest prize since 1918 and that had choked away yet another shot at the World Series the year before.He’d delivered immediately, winning 21 games in the regular season. But it was in the postseason that Schilling became a hero.The Red Sox had trailed the New York Yankees, their hated rivals, three games to two in the American League Championship Series that October. Although he needed sutures to hold his right ankle together, Schilling took the mound in Game 6. He was built for these moments ― he’d never lost a playoff game when his team was facing elimination. Even as he winced in pain, even as the blood soaked through his white sock, he threw seven innings of one-run ball, and the Red Sox won. A night later, they’d win again. A week later, they were World Series champs.Sox fans embraced Schilling, the man who had gutted it out. He may just have been popular enough to win a few votes for President George W. Bush that year, even in the Democratic stronghold of Boston.That sign linked him to Bush ― not the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts’ own Sen. John Kerry ― because Schilling was already an outspoken Republican. While the sign might have been a joke, the idea of him running for office someday didn’t seem that far-fetched ― to him or a lot of people who knew about politics. Baseball had taught him there was nothing he couldn’t do if the rest of the world would just get out of his damn way.By the time, more than a decade later, that Schilling floated the idea he might challenge another Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, in 2018, he’d become a laughingstock, a guy who was fired by ESPN for not shutting up and who shared the sort of idiotic memes once relegated to chain emails. He’d thrown himself behind Donald Trump, who was heading toward certain defeat in the Bay State. He’d taken to referring to Hillary Clinton as “Killary” and to her party as “the Demokkkrats.” And he’d landed a daily radio show on Breitbart News Network, the right-wing outlet that welcomed white supremacists and other angry men.So in October, when Schilling held a rally for Trump outside Boston city hall, perhaps a dozen people bothered to show up. Schilling, arms crossed, hat pulled down over his brow, stood there in the rain. He’d lost his grip on Boston and the world ― and it didn’t make sense. The chances of a high school baseball player being drafted by Major League Baseball are about 0.5 percent, according to Bleacher Report. The great majority of those drafted after the first round will never get out of the minor leagues. The number of players honored in the Hall of Fame is less than half the number who played in the majors just last season. Becoming a potential Hall of Famer requires a loose focus on reality, a stubborn refusal to consider the math that says success is virtually impossible.Schilling built his reputation on overcoming those odds. He didn’t make his high school varsity team until his senior year, and his next stop was junior college. He was drafted in the second round in 1986 and then spent several years bouncing between the minors and the majors as a reliever. He was traded three times early in his career and only broke through as a starter for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1992, when he was 25. Then he overcame a mid-career lull to lead the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks to the World Series in 2001. By the time he left Boston, he was a 200-game winner with three World Series championships and an outside shot at enshrinement in Cooperstown.Schilling arrived in Boston with a reputation as a no-nonsense pitcher who did whatever it took to win, and some saw his willingness to pitch through pain — see the Bloody Sock — as reminiscent of baseball’s old-timers. “You simply put their names in the lineup, and then sat back and watched the game,” a Boston Herald columnist wrote.There’s a sort of coded language in sportswriting, where praise about “grit” and “scrappiness” is often reserved for white athletes. The words draw a contrast, wittingly or not, with black and Latino players, who are described as flashier and more reliant on natural ability. The same code has long had a home in America’s political discourse. So while sports columnists saw Schilling’s pugnacious drive as an asset on the field, politicians like Bush saw his “blue-collar” approach to baseball as an asset on the campaign trail ― primarily by helping them appeal to white, working-class voters.President Bush’s advisers “shared high-fives,” the Boston Globe reported, when Schilling went on “Good Morning America” a few days after the 2004 World Series victory and urged viewers to “Vote Bush!” The Bush team immediately invited the pitcher to campaign with the president in New Hampshire, where Schilling could bolster the president’s efforts to paint himself as a man of the people. Meanwhile, they were pushing an elitist critique of Kerry, the man who windsurfed off Nantucket. Schilling appeared with Bush in Pennsylvania during the campaign’s final days. He cut radio ads that ran across New England.Three years later, Schilling hit the campaign trail for another Republican presidential candidate with the same goal in mind. A month after the Red Sox won the 2007 World Series — Schilling went 3-0 that postseason — Arizona Sen. John McCain, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination, brought Schilling on stage in New Hampshire. McCain’s team believed Schilling “personifies the Arizona senator’s grit and determination,” the Globe wrote.Schilling, who had signed a new contract with the Red Sox that October, hoped to pitch one more season in Boston. But he’d already thrown his last Major League pitch. His throwing shoulder began to act up during spring training in 2008. He wanted to have surgery; the team thought rehab would do the trick. Top brass also floated the idea of voiding his $8 million deal if he went under the knife against their wishes. In Schilling’s version of the tale, which he has recounted in multiple radio appearances since, the team accused him of hiding the shoulder injury to get that final contract.Schilling missed the entire 2008 season and ultimately retired early in 2009. He’s still mad about how his career ended and believes Red Sox management essentially gave up on him.“They’re up in the ivory tower and they’re trying to pass judgment,” Schilling said of how the team approached his injury in a 2016 interview. “They said things … that made me realize that they never gave a shit about me.”Schilling and Red Sox owner John W. Henry, according to the pitcher, battled over politics as well. Henry, who endorsed and campaigned with Kerry in 2004, “went nuts” when Schilling endorsed Bush, he said in that same interview.When Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) died six months into Schilling’s retirement, rumors began to circulate that Schilling was being recruited to run for the open seat. McCain told reporters that he had called Schilling to urge him to jump in the race.Schilling routinely stoked the rumor mill too ― and why not? Politics were a natural fit for the former pitcher. As a player, he’d always craved the sort of attention, positive or negative, that comes with being high-profile. His teammates in Philadelphia had dubbed him “Top Step Schill” and “Red Light Curt,” nods to his knack for finding the camera even when he wasn’t pitching. When the Globe asked Red Sox players about the election in 2004, another pitcher pointed the reporter straight to Schilling’s locker.“Curt had a large personality and a lot of opinions on a variety of subjects,” Pedro Martinez, Schilling’s co-ace in Boston’s pitching rotation, wrote in his 2016 autobiography, “but I didn’t spend any time listening or reading up on what he was saying to the media. I cared about him as a pitcher.”Schilling found a reliable sparring partner in Democratic outfielder Gabe Kapler. “Gabe Kapler and I used to have a ton of debates, he’s very liberal,” Schilling said during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session in 2016. Kapler was a “top 5 teammate of ALL TIME...even though politically he’s a bit ‘short,’” Schilling tweeted last year.As his baseball career neared its end, Schilling had increasingly filled his time by airing his political opinions ― through regular segments on Boston-area radio shows and posts on 38 Pitches, the blog that he’d launched to connect with fans and where he began to closely follow the 2008 election. (Thirty-eight was the number he wore throughout his career.)Schilling often engaged his critics on the blog, but he was not yet a firebrand. He was an “independent” and “will always be,” he wrote in a Sept. 5, 2009, blog post. He had voted for Bush twice and Bill Clinton before that, he said. He wanted lower taxes but was happy to pay his share. He opposed abortion and gay marriage but believed both were “so far beyond the scope or responsibility of one person to legislate it’s laughable.” He was “absolutely for the 2nd Amendment,” he wrote. “But I also think this country has become so beholden to special interest and lobbyists that we have completely sacrificed the safety and well being of the individual American citizen.”Schilling’s main political position was that “the status quo is not working” for ordinary people. “The person that works 9-to-5 for crap dollars gets spat on,” Schilling said in one interview about his potential candidacy, “and [Massachusetts is] becoming a state that’s next to impossible to live and prosper in, and I think it was anything but when it was founded.”But Schilling had little patience for far-right theories. In one post, he brushed aside right-wing concerns about Barack Obama’s supposed ties to Bill Ayers, the college professor who had co-founded the violent revolutionary group Weather Underground. The day after Obama won, Schilling congratulated the new president with a hint of admiration for the way he’d campaigned, if not for his politics.Schilling still seemed, in short, like the sort of Republican who might be able to pull off an upset in deep-blue Massachusetts. Newspapers and their columnists all but asked him to run for the Senate. A poll or two even showed he had an outside shot. And as he outlined his views ahead of a potential campaign, he painted himself the way Bush or McCain might have: as a moderate Republican willing to fight against a broken establishment.Politics, though, weren’t yet Schilling’s passion, and he ultimately chose not to run for Kennedy’s seat. Instead, he went on the campaign trail again as a surrogate for state Sen. Scott Brown, the Republican choice to pursue the opportunity he’d passed up. Just as Bush and McCain had before, Brown thought Schilling would bolster the working-class, anti-establishment image he’d crafted for himself (Brown made a show of driving a pickup truck and often draped a barn jacket over his suit).Schilling remained a baseball hero, and his exploits played into the race when the Democratic candidate, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, failed to grasp what the sport means to Bostonians. First, she sneered at the idea of “standing outside Fenway Park … in the cold … shaking hands” with voters. Later, she awkwardly suggested that Schilling was a Yankees fan.Schilling played it perfectly, with a diplomatic tone that still twisted the knife. “It’s not really that big of a deal,” he told reporters in January 2010. “But again, I think it’s another sign of her aloofness, or just the fact that she’s very out of touch with the people.”Brown pulled off the upset a few days later.After passing on the Senate race, Schilling turned his focus back to 38 Studios, a video game company he’d launched in 2007. A relentless work ethic and boundless confidence (plus his share of good luck) had earned him more than $90 million in 20 years of baseball. Now he dreamed his gaming startup would take him to the next level, making him “Bill Gates rich,” Boston Magazine wrote in 2012.Schilling was able to attract top-name talent, in part because of his money ― he pledged to finance much of the company himself ― and in part because he was Curt Schilling. His persistence didn’t hurt, either. In 2006, he called Todd McFarlane, an artist known for his work on Marvel Comics’ Spider-Man series and for creating Spawn, among the most popular comic characters ever. He wanted to share his business plan. He even flew McFarlane to Kansas City during a Red Sox road trip to discuss it in person. Schilling offered McFarlane a job as the company’s art director, but the designer didn’t commit on the spot.A few nights later, McFarlane’s phone rang for what felt like the hundredth time since the meeting. It was Schilling again, and he was whispering.“Todd, I’m in the locker room,” Schilling said, as McFarlane remembers now. “It’s the fifth inning. I’m not supposed to be making a call.” But he needed to know if McFarlane would take the job. McFarlane would eventually say yes.To achieve 38 Studios’ ambitious goal ― the creation of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game ― Schilling would also need more money. In July 2010, the state of Rhode Island agreed to help, giving 38 Studios a $75 million, taxpayer-backed loan guarantee. In return, Schilling moved the company to Providence and promised to create 450 jobs by the end of 2012. Alas, money, talent and Curt Schilling would not be enough. By 2012, 38 Studios was on the fast track to collapse, bleeding cash with little hope that it could actually produce a game. The company filed for bankruptcy in June of that year.Schilling had failed, and as he’d done when his pitching days ended, he pointed fingers. He blamed the government of Rhode Island, at least in part. If they’d just given him more time. He turned on Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who had begun to re-evaluate the loan guarantee deal.“They did everything in their power to make sure this went the way it went,’’ Schilling said later.As 38 Studios collapsed, a presidential election was heating up, once again featuring a Massachusetts politician, former Gov. Mitt Romney. Under different circumstances, Schilling might have made an effective campaign surrogate. Romney, a wealthy Republican venture capitalist, certainly needed help bolstering his connections to the working class, as the Obama campaign hammered him with devastating ads about people who’d lost jobs when Romney’s firm re-organized their companies. But Schilling’s shine had begun to tarnish. He’d left dozens of people out of work and cost Rhode Island taxpayers more than $100 million ― a fact that had soured much of New England on the former pitcher. His public fights with former employees and with Chafee, as well as the endless media examinations of 38 Studios’ downfall, didn’t help. The Romney campaign didn’t embrace him.Goodbye, pitching career. Goodbye, gaming empire. Goodbye, establishment camaraderie. Goodbye, fan worship. What had happened to the world as Curt Schilling understood it?After Obama was elected the nation’s first black president in 2008, social scientists and journalists noted a growing counter-phenomenon: “angry white men” who feel “they have been screwed, betrayed by the country they love, discarded like trash on the side of the information superhighway,” as sociologist Michael Kimmel wrote in his 2015 book. The defining characteristic of angry white men ― aside from being white and male ― is that they suffer from what Kimmel called “aggrieved entitlement”: the belief that America is “their country” and that it is being taken away from them. Although they’re angry at politicians, bureaucrats and the system writ large, the primary targets of their ire are women, minority groups and immigrants ― the people they perceive as the undeserving beneficiaries of their troubles. Seeking validation of their worth, they turned to “unapologetically ‘politically incorrect’ magazines, radio hosts, and television shows,” Kimmel wrote.

(They showed otherwise in 2016, when Trump won in part because of his strength with white men.)Schilling fits the pattern almost perfectly. It didn’t matter that baseball had made him a far richer and more privileged man than the middle-class subjects of Kimmel’s studies. Over the two years following the collapse of 38 Studios, Schilling sought out and found answers in the angrier and more paranoid corners of political thought. He started talking more about politics on the radio and social media. His views, at least those he expressed publicly, began to shift further right. He latched on to the Benghazi “scandal” that found fault with every Obama administration decision leading up to and following the deadly attack on that U.S. mission in Libya.

Early votes in favor of Trump were being destroyed. “Voters in Amarillo are saying their votes are being changed,” Schilling claimed during the show’s first week. “Just another day in America, boys. Gosh dang.”If Clinton were to win, he warned there could be “an IRS retaliation, an FBI retaliation” against conservative media. “You’re talking about Russia. Soviet-era KGB type stuff. I don’t think we’re that far from it.”Democratic immigration policies, he insisted, were an underhanded way to collapse the health care system in order to institute a full government takeover of the industry. He railed against “open borders.” At one point, he suggested a Clinton presidency could lead to an American apocalypse. “I’m not an Armageddon guy,” Schilling said. “But I don’t think this country can survive on this trajectory for four more years. And she’s going to be worse.”The Black Lives Matter movement was “founded on a complete lie” perpetrated by the media, he said. If the KKK is racist, he said, so is Black Lives Matter. “I’m tired of being made to feel bad about the history of my country,” Schilling told one caller. “I am being made to feel wrong when I stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or put my hand over my heart for the national anthem,” he blared. “I don’t care what you think.”Listen to the show, and it’s as if Schilling is back on the mound again, and the criticism he receives for his increasingly outlandish opinions is no different than the boos that once rained down on him in Yankee Stadium. They’re all proof that he’s right. “Yankee fans,” Schilling reminds his listeners now and again, “never booed a player who sucked.” Since October, when Schilling first told a Boston radio host that he planned to run for Warren’s seat, I’ve immersed myself in Schilling’s world – listened to his radio show, dug through his Twitter feed and blog posts, read old news clippings, and called former associates and Massachusetts political observers. Nearly everyone I spoke to agreed that Schilling’s extreme approach to politics had almost erased the joyous memories of his triumph in October 2004 and all but killed his Hall of Fame chances. It was ridiculous to think he could win a Senate race in Massachusetts, they said.“Curt’s not running,” one state GOP official told me bluntly this past winter. Schilling “doesn’t fit the mold of the kind of Republican that historically can be competitive here,” said Matthew Baron, a longtime Massachusetts political consultant. “If this were Alabama, maybe he’d have a shot,” said Dan Payne, a Democratic consultant. “But not in Massachusetts.”The polls and pundits both say Schilling doesn’t have a chance against Warren. They said that about Trump, as Schilling would surely remind you. But Schilling is less skilled as a provocateur than Trump. No matter your political views, his radio show isn’t any good. He’d proved himself a compelling contributor when he analyzed baseball at ESPN and called in to other people’s programs. He’s less capable when it comes to carrying a broadcast, so his show lacks the raw entertainment value of, say, a Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck production. He just sounds like what he is: a bitter man with a microphone.Schilling refused multiple interview requests made through Breitbart and his lawyer, who told me that the pitcher had “no interest” in talking. So in late February, I went to the Conservative Political Action Conference just outside the nation’s capital to make one last effort.CPAC is an annual gathering of conservative luminaries, lawmakers, media pundits and prospective politicians, a place where stars are born. There Schilling hardly fit the mold of a future candidate. He hunkered behind his microphone at Breitbart’s booth on radio row in a black button-down shirt, baggy jeans and leather flip-flops. At times, he drew the attention (and even admiration) of some bright lights of the right ― people like radio host Mark Levin, Milwaukee County sheriff David Clarke and Trump deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka. But most people barely seemed to notice his presence.On the second afternoon of CPAC, Schilling stepped from behind radio row to mingle in the crowd, and I caught up with him for a brief moment. At first he was cordial. But when he realized I was a reporter, he took off through the crowd, the slap of his flip-flops audible for a few steps before he disappeared.The next day, back at the Breitbart booth, he decided he would entertain my central question. How had he gone from a standard-issue Republican to a conspiracy-mongering Breitbart host? How had a man to whom the world had given so much become so … angry?“It’s a natural progression,” he said.Then he turned and walked away.CORRECTION: GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney was a wealthy venture capitalist, but he was not a billionaire."
18,POLITICS,WTF Happened To Curt Schilling?,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/curt-schilling-right-wing-politics_us_58e7e71be4b05413bfe2e232,How the Red Sox hero went from the top of the world to the bottom of the fever swamps.,2017-04-15,"As the 2016 campaign neared its end, Schilling landed a radio show on Breitbart and suggested that he might even run for the Senate in 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c856052c00002000fee64a.jpeg?cache=tOTjxeNmP1&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The sign appeared in a window above Boylston Street as the Red Sox paraded through downtown Boston to celebrate the team’s first World Series title in 86 years.Schilling/Bush ‘04.It was a tribute to Curt Schilling, the pitcher who’d been brought to Boston to boost a team that hadn’t won baseball’s biggest prize since 1918 and that had choked away yet another shot at the World Series the year before.He’d delivered immediately, winning 21 games in the regular season. But it was in the postseason that Schilling became a hero.The Red Sox had trailed the New York Yankees, their hated rivals, three games to two in the American League Championship Series that October. Although he needed sutures to hold his right ankle together, Schilling took the mound in Game 6. He was built for these moments ― he’d never lost a playoff game when his team was facing elimination. Even as he winced in pain, even as the blood soaked through his white sock, he threw seven innings of one-run ball, and the Red Sox won. A night later, they’d win again. A week later, they were World Series champs.Sox fans embraced Schilling, the man who had gutted it out. He may just have been popular enough to win a few votes for President George W. Bush that year, even in the Democratic stronghold of Boston.That sign linked him to Bush ― not the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts’ own Sen. John Kerry ― because Schilling was already an outspoken Republican. While the sign might have been a joke, the idea of him running for office someday didn’t seem that far-fetched ― to him or a lot of people who knew about politics. Baseball had taught him there was nothing he couldn’t do if the rest of the world would just get out of his damn way.By the time, more than a decade later, that Schilling floated the idea he might challenge another Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, in 2018, he’d become a laughingstock, a guy who was fired by ESPN for not shutting up and who shared the sort of idiotic memes once relegated to chain emails. He’d thrown himself behind Donald Trump, who was heading toward certain defeat in the Bay State. He’d taken to referring to Hillary Clinton as “Killary” and to her party as “the Demokkkrats.” And he’d landed a daily radio show on Breitbart News Network, the right-wing outlet that welcomed white supremacists and other angry men.So in October, when Schilling held a rally for Trump outside Boston city hall, perhaps a dozen people bothered to show up. Schilling, arms crossed, hat pulled down over his brow, stood there in the rain. He’d lost his grip on Boston and the world ― and it didn’t make sense. The chances of a high school baseball player being drafted by Major League Baseball are about 0.5 percent, according to Bleacher Report. The great majority of those drafted after the first round will never get out of the minor leagues. The number of players honored in the Hall of Fame is less than half the number who played in the majors just last season. Becoming a potential Hall of Famer requires a loose focus on reality, a stubborn refusal to consider the math that says success is virtually impossible.Schilling built his reputation on overcoming those odds. He didn’t make his high school varsity team until his senior year, and his next stop was junior college. He was drafted in the second round in 1986 and then spent several years bouncing between the minors and the majors as a reliever. He was traded three times early in his career and only broke through as a starter for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1992, when he was 25. Then he overcame a mid-career lull to lead the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks to the World Series in 2001. By the time he left Boston, he was a 200-game winner with three World Series championships and an outside shot at enshrinement in Cooperstown.Schilling arrived in Boston with a reputation as a no-nonsense pitcher who did whatever it took to win, and some saw his willingness to pitch through pain — see the Bloody Sock — as reminiscent of baseball’s old-timers. “You simply put their names in the lineup, and then sat back and watched the game,” a Boston Herald columnist wrote.There’s a sort of coded language in sportswriting, where praise about “grit” and “scrappiness” is often reserved for white athletes. The words draw a contrast, wittingly or not, with black and Latino players, who are described as flashier and more reliant on natural ability. The same code has long had a home in America’s political discourse. So while sports columnists saw Schilling’s pugnacious drive as an asset on the field, politicians like Bush saw his “blue-collar” approach to baseball as an asset on the campaign trail ― primarily by helping them appeal to white, working-class voters.President Bush’s advisers “shared high-fives,” the Boston Globe reported, when Schilling went on “Good Morning America” a few days after the 2004 World Series victory and urged viewers to “Vote Bush!” The Bush team immediately invited the pitcher to campaign with the president in New Hampshire, where Schilling could bolster the president’s efforts to paint himself as a man of the people. Meanwhile, they were pushing an elitist critique of Kerry, the man who windsurfed off Nantucket. Schilling appeared with Bush in Pennsylvania during the campaign’s final days. He cut radio ads that ran across New England.Three years later, Schilling hit the campaign trail for another Republican presidential candidate with the same goal in mind. A month after the Red Sox won the 2007 World Series — Schilling went 3-0 that postseason — Arizona Sen. John McCain, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination, brought Schilling on stage in New Hampshire. McCain’s team believed Schilling “personifies the Arizona senator’s grit and determination,” the Globe wrote.Schilling, who had signed a new contract with the Red Sox that October, hoped to pitch one more season in Boston. But he’d already thrown his last Major League pitch. His throwing shoulder began to act up during spring training in 2008. He wanted to have surgery; the team thought rehab would do the trick. Top brass also floated the idea of voiding his $8 million deal if he went under the knife against their wishes. In Schilling’s version of the tale, which he has recounted in multiple radio appearances since, the team accused him of hiding the shoulder injury to get that final contract.Schilling missed the entire 2008 season and ultimately retired early in 2009. He’s still mad about how his career ended and believes Red Sox management essentially gave up on him.“They’re up in the ivory tower and they’re trying to pass judgment,” Schilling said of how the team approached his injury in a 2016 interview. “They said things … that made me realize that they never gave a shit about me.”Schilling and Red Sox owner John W. Henry, according to the pitcher, battled over politics as well. Henry, who endorsed and campaigned with Kerry in 2004, “went nuts” when Schilling endorsed Bush, he said in that same interview.When Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) died six months into Schilling’s retirement, rumors began to circulate that Schilling was being recruited to run for the open seat. McCain told reporters that he had called Schilling to urge him to jump in the race.Schilling routinely stoked the rumor mill too ― and why not? Politics were a natural fit for the former pitcher. As a player, he’d always craved the sort of attention, positive or negative, that comes with being high-profile. His teammates in Philadelphia had dubbed him “Top Step Schill” and “Red Light Curt,” nods to his knack for finding the camera even when he wasn’t pitching. When the Globe asked Red Sox players about the election in 2004, another pitcher pointed the reporter straight to Schilling’s locker.“Curt had a large personality and a lot of opinions on a variety of subjects,” Pedro Martinez, Schilling’s co-ace in Boston’s pitching rotation, wrote in his 2016 autobiography, “but I didn’t spend any time listening or reading up on what he was saying to the media. I cared about him as a pitcher.”Schilling found a reliable sparring partner in Democratic outfielder Gabe Kapler. “Gabe Kapler and I used to have a ton of debates, he’s very liberal,” Schilling said during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session in 2016. Kapler was a “top 5 teammate of ALL TIME...even though politically he’s a bit ‘short,’” Schilling tweeted last year.As his baseball career neared its end, Schilling had increasingly filled his time by airing his political opinions ― through regular segments on Boston-area radio shows and posts on 38 Pitches, the blog that he’d launched to connect with fans and where he began to closely follow the 2008 election. (Thirty-eight was the number he wore throughout his career.)Schilling often engaged his critics on the blog, but he was not yet a firebrand. He was an “independent” and “will always be,” he wrote in a Sept. 5, 2009, blog post. He had voted for Bush twice and Bill Clinton before that, he said. He wanted lower taxes but was happy to pay his share. He opposed abortion and gay marriage but believed both were “so far beyond the scope or responsibility of one person to legislate it’s laughable.” He was “absolutely for the 2nd Amendment,” he wrote. “But I also think this country has become so beholden to special interest and lobbyists that we have completely sacrificed the safety and well being of the individual American citizen.”Schilling’s main political position was that “the status quo is not working” for ordinary people. “The person that works 9-to-5 for crap dollars gets spat on,” Schilling said in one interview about his potential candidacy, “and [Massachusetts is] becoming a state that’s next to impossible to live and prosper in, and I think it was anything but when it was founded.”But Schilling had little patience for far-right theories. In one post, he brushed aside right-wing concerns about Barack Obama’s supposed ties to Bill Ayers, the college professor who had co-founded the violent revolutionary group Weather Underground. The day after Obama won, Schilling congratulated the new president with a hint of admiration for the way he’d campaigned, if not for his politics.Schilling still seemed, in short, like the sort of Republican who might be able to pull off an upset in deep-blue Massachusetts. Newspapers and their columnists all but asked him to run for the Senate. A poll or two even showed he had an outside shot. And as he outlined his views ahead of a potential campaign, he painted himself the way Bush or McCain might have: as a moderate Republican willing to fight against a broken establishment.Politics, though, weren’t yet Schilling’s passion, and he ultimately chose not to run for Kennedy’s seat. Instead, he went on the campaign trail again as a surrogate for state Sen. Scott Brown, the Republican choice to pursue the opportunity he’d passed up. Just as Bush and McCain had before, Brown thought Schilling would bolster the working-class, anti-establishment image he’d crafted for himself (Brown made a show of driving a pickup truck and often draped a barn jacket over his suit).Schilling remained a baseball hero, and his exploits played into the race when the Democratic candidate, state Attorney General Martha Coakley, failed to grasp what the sport means to Bostonians. First, she sneered at the idea of “standing outside Fenway Park … in the cold … shaking hands” with voters. Later, she awkwardly suggested that Schilling was a Yankees fan.Schilling played it perfectly, with a diplomatic tone that still twisted the knife. “It’s not really that big of a deal,” he told reporters in January 2010. “But again, I think it’s another sign of her aloofness, or just the fact that she’s very out of touch with the people.”Brown pulled off the upset a few days later.After passing on the Senate race, Schilling turned his focus back to 38 Studios, a video game company he’d launched in 2007. A relentless work ethic and boundless confidence (plus his share of good luck) had earned him more than $90 million in 20 years of baseball. Now he dreamed his gaming startup would take him to the next level, making him “Bill Gates rich,” Boston Magazine wrote in 2012.Schilling was able to attract top-name talent, in part because of his money ― he pledged to finance much of the company himself ― and in part because he was Curt Schilling. His persistence didn’t hurt, either. In 2006, he called Todd McFarlane, an artist known for his work on Marvel Comics’ Spider-Man series and for creating Spawn, among the most popular comic characters ever. He wanted to share his business plan. He even flew McFarlane to Kansas City during a Red Sox road trip to discuss it in person. Schilling offered McFarlane a job as the company’s art director, but the designer didn’t commit on the spot.A few nights later, McFarlane’s phone rang for what felt like the hundredth time since the meeting. It was Schilling again, and he was whispering.“Todd, I’m in the locker room,” Schilling said, as McFarlane remembers now. “It’s the fifth inning. I’m not supposed to be making a call.” But he needed to know if McFarlane would take the job. McFarlane would eventually say yes.To achieve 38 Studios’ ambitious goal ― the creation of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game ― Schilling would also need more money. In July 2010, the state of Rhode Island agreed to help, giving 38 Studios a $75 million, taxpayer-backed loan guarantee. In return, Schilling moved the company to Providence and promised to create 450 jobs by the end of 2012. Alas, money, talent and Curt Schilling would not be enough. By 2012, 38 Studios was on the fast track to collapse, bleeding cash with little hope that it could actually produce a game. The company filed for bankruptcy in June of that year.Schilling had failed, and as he’d done when his pitching days ended, he pointed fingers. He blamed the government of Rhode Island, at least in part. If they’d just given him more time. He turned on Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who had begun to re-evaluate the loan guarantee deal.“They did everything in their power to make sure this went the way it went,’’ Schilling said later.As 38 Studios collapsed, a presidential election was heating up, once again featuring a Massachusetts politician, former Gov. Mitt Romney. Under different circumstances, Schilling might have made an effective campaign surrogate. Romney, a wealthy Republican venture capitalist, certainly needed help bolstering his connections to the working class, as the Obama campaign hammered him with devastating ads about people who’d lost jobs when Romney’s firm re-organized their companies. But Schilling’s shine had begun to tarnish. He’d left dozens of people out of work and cost Rhode Island taxpayers more than $100 million ― a fact that had soured much of New England on the former pitcher. His public fights with former employees and with Chafee, as well as the endless media examinations of 38 Studios’ downfall, didn’t help. The Romney campaign didn’t embrace him.Goodbye, pitching career. Goodbye, gaming empire. Goodbye, establishment camaraderie. Goodbye, fan worship. What had happened to the world as Curt Schilling understood it?After Obama was elected the nation’s first black president in 2008, social scientists and journalists noted a growing counter-phenomenon: “angry white men” who feel “they have been screwed, betrayed by the country they love, discarded like trash on the side of the information superhighway,” as sociologist Michael Kimmel wrote in his 2015 book. The defining characteristic of angry white men ― aside from being white and male ― is that they suffer from what Kimmel called “aggrieved entitlement”: the belief that America is “their country” and that it is being taken away from them. Although they’re angry at politicians, bureaucrats and the system writ large, the primary targets of their ire are women, minority groups and immigrants ― the people they perceive as the undeserving beneficiaries of their troubles. Seeking validation of their worth, they turned to “unapologetically ‘politically incorrect’ magazines, radio hosts, and television shows,” Kimmel wrote. And their rage only intensified when Obama was re-elected in 2012. That contest represented “the demise of the white American male voter as a dominant force in the political landscape,” Kimmel wrote. (They showed otherwise in 2016, when Trump won in part because of his strength with white men.)Schilling fits the pattern almost perfectly. It didn’t matter that baseball had made him a far richer and more privileged man than the middle-class subjects of Kimmel’s studies. Over the two years following the collapse of 38 Studios, Schilling sought out and found answers in the angrier and more paranoid corners of political thought. He started talking more about politics on the radio and social media. His views, at least those he expressed publicly, began to shift further right. He latched on to the Benghazi “scandal” that found fault with every Obama administration decision leading up to and following the deadly attack on that U.S. mission in Libya. His pet cause ― proving that climate change was a fraudulent hoax foisted on the American public ― became an even bigger passion.Schilling regularly called local radio shows during his playing days to urge fans not to trust sports reporters. After 38 collapsed, he moved on to the idea that news reporters were also peddling “fake news.” Judging from the links he shared, he was reading right-wing sites further and further from the mainstream. And he was isolating himself: “I don’t seek out people I disagree with,” he said in a 2016 interview. “I don’t seek out the content they create. It’s a waste of my time.”Kapler, Schilling’s old sparring partner in the Boston clubhouse, noticed the shift in 2013, when Schilling posted a link to a story on InfoWars.com, the conspiracy-driven site run by Alex Jones:As Schilling descended into the fever swamps of right-wing politics, one vestige of the old sports hero remained: his job as a baseball analyst at ESPN. He was good at it.The cable sports network had warned its talent about sharing political views online. Schilling earned his first suspension from ESPN in August 2015 for posting a meme comparing Muslims to Nazis. He kept posting controversial memes even after the suspension, railing against “illegals” and other immigrants and pondering a looming apocalypse. He told a Kansas City radio show that Clinton “should be buried under a jail somewhere” for keeping her emails on a private server. Then, in April 2016, Schilling crossed ESPN’s line for good. North Carolina’s GOP-controlled legislature had passed a law to bar transgender people from using the public bathrooms that match their gender identity, a move that sparked a nationwide backlash. Schilling chose to repost an image on Facebook that showed a portly man dressed in drag. “LET HIM IN,” it read.He was widely criticized on sports news sites. ESPN fired him two days later.Schilling blamed what he saw as the growing scourge of political correctness and ESPN’s alleged turn toward liberal politics. Never mind that two years earlier, the network had suspended baseball writer Keith Law for defending evolution in a debate with Schilling. Sarah Palin rushed to Schilling’s defense. “ESPN continues to screw up,” she said on Facebook.Untethered from the Red Sox, 38 Studios and now ESPN, Schilling grew louder and louder. He suggested he was planning to run for public office “soon” and laid out an ambitious path: “... state office first, white house in 8 years ... or 4 if by some amazing illegal event this country elects another clinton.”Schilling initially backed neurosurgeon Ben Carson in the 2016 Republican primary. But soon he threw his weight behind Trump, the candidate who best matched his own bombastic approach and in whom Schilling perhaps saw something of himself. “I realized very quickly this was a man decisive in action and confident in his ability,” Schilling wrote in a blog post announcing his endorsement. “I also realized that regardless of his net worth, he worked his ass off.”Although Trump never brought the former pitcher on the campaign trail, Schilling became something of a faux surrogate, appearing occasionally on cable to defend the candidate’s positions ― a role he seemed to earn for no other reason than that some viewers might remember him as a ballplayer.In October, Schilling landed a daily morning show at Breitbart, which had grown into an online behemoth by stoking the fears of the same white voters that politicians had once used the pitcher to reach. Schilling had long believed that someone else ― Red Sox management, the media, Chafee, ESPN ― was standing in the way of his ultimate success. Breitbart was the place where that kind of belief is a founding principle.The site, which was practically a house organ for the Trump campaign, pushed the idea that the American system was broken, especially for white working men, and it blamed immigrants, Muslims, feminists and Obama. In the words of its former chief Steve Bannon, Breitbart was “a platform for the alt-right” ― the white nationalist and racist movements that were supporting Trump.From the earliest days of his show, which he named “Whatever It Takes,” Schilling espoused the conspiracy theories and racial resentment that fed Trump’s base. The polls that showed Clinton ahead were cooked, he said. Early votes in favor of Trump were being destroyed. “Voters in Amarillo are saying their votes are being changed,” Schilling claimed during the show’s first week. “Just another day in America, boys. Gosh dang.”If Clinton were to win, he warned there could be “an IRS retaliation, an FBI retaliation” against conservative media. “You’re talking about Russia. Soviet-era KGB type stuff. I don’t think we’re that far from it.”Democratic immigration policies, he insisted, were an underhanded way to collapse the health care system in order to institute a full government takeover of the industry. He railed against “open borders.” At one point, he suggested a Clinton presidency could lead to an American apocalypse. “I’m not an Armageddon guy,” Schilling said. “But I don’t think this country can survive on this trajectory for four more years. And she’s going to be worse.”The Black Lives Matter movement was “founded on a complete lie” perpetrated by the media, he said. If the KKK is racist, he said, so is Black Lives Matter. “I’m tired of being made to feel bad about the history of my country,” Schilling told one caller. “I am being made to feel wrong when I stand for the Pledge of Allegiance or put my hand over my heart for the national anthem,” he blared. “I don’t care what you think.”Listen to the show, and it’s as if Schilling is back on the mound again, and the criticism he receives for his increasingly outlandish opinions is no different than the boos that once rained down on him in Yankee Stadium. They’re all proof that he’s right. “Yankee fans,” Schilling reminds his listeners now and again, “never booed a player who sucked.” Since October, when Schilling first told a Boston radio host that he planned to run for Warren’s seat, I’ve immersed myself in Schilling’s world – listened to his radio show, dug through his Twitter feed and blog posts, read old news clippings, and called former associates and Massachusetts political observers. Nearly everyone I spoke to agreed that Schilling’s extreme approach to politics had almost erased the joyous memories of his triumph in October 2004 and all but killed his Hall of Fame chances. It was ridiculous to think he could win a Senate race in Massachusetts, they said.“Curt’s not running,” one state GOP official told me bluntly this past winter. Schilling “doesn’t fit the mold of the kind of Republican that historically can be competitive here,” said Matthew Baron, a longtime Massachusetts political consultant. “If this were Alabama, maybe he’d have a shot,” said Dan Payne, a Democratic consultant. “But not in Massachusetts.”The polls and pundits both say Schilling doesn’t have a chance against Warren.

19,ARTS & CULTURE,A One-Woman Show Explores The Fragmented Life Of Frida Kahlo,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frida-kahlo-play-andrea-dantas_us_58f0d253e4b0b9e9848b312f,"""Fragmented Frida"" creator Andrea Dantas was drawn to Kahlo's incredible resilience.",2017-04-14,"A portrait of Frida Kahlo by her father, Guillermo Kahlo, is displayed at the Frida Kahlo museum in Mexico City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0ea0b2600004500c45b70.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"A few years ago, Brazilian-born writer, actor and dancer Andrea Dantas heard back about her audition to dance flamenco on Madonna’s world tour. She didn’t get the job. “I thought, ‘OK, you’re allowed to feel sorry for yourself for 10 minutes,’” Dantas told The Huffington Post. “After, I thought, ‘What do you want to do now? What do you want to do with your life?’ And I swear, I heard a voice that said ‘Frida,’ and I just knew.”The fruits of Dantas’ labor are currently on view at Brooklyn’s BAM Fisher, in a one-woman show called “Fragmented Frida.” Dantas plays the role of the iconic painter Frida Kahlo, starting as a young, awkward yet precocious child ― complete with a bowl cut and a limp ― and ending up as the most renowned woman artist of all time: braided hair, unibrow and all.Far more than Dantas focuses on the specifics of Kahlo’s artistic craft, she zooms in on her life story, an extraordinary journey riddled with hardship. At the age of 6, Kahlo was stricken with polio, leaving her right leg incapacitated and in tremendous pain. At 18 she was involved in a near-fatal bus crash, which left her pelvis crushed. While recovering, and spending most of her time in a wheelchair, Kahlo began to paint, famously declaring: “I don’t paint dreams or nightmares, I paint my own reality.”It was Kahlo’s incredible resilience that drew Dantas to her as a character. “At that time in Mexico, being a woman wasn’t cool, being a feminist wasn’t cool, divorcing a man wasn’t cool, being a bisexual wasn’t cool, being so free sexually was not cool at all,” Dantas said. “How did she manage to do so much in spite of all the illness and all the betrayals? How does the underdog become the hero?”Dantas read around 20 Kahlo biographies before writing the script, taking about eight months to research. She then trained with movement coach Thiago Felix to accurately convey how Kahlo moved through the world, crippled at various points by illness, injury and heartbreak.Even after receiving recognition for her dreamlike self-portraits, which translated her brutal physical and emotional wounds onto her painted flesh, Kahlo continued to suffer. After being told she could not conceive, she became pregnant, only to suffer a grisly miscarriage. She experienced infidelity on the part of her husband, painter Diego Rivera, most painfully with her own sister. While today Kahlo is regarded as a figure of strength and courage, it was important for Dantas to capture the softer, more vulnerable aspects of her personality to show how, despite the mythical status she achieved, she was an emotional, fallible human being.“She had such a subtlety to her and a magnetism, she was a hopeless romantic,” Dantas said. “She was soft, she had a great sense of humor. It’s not just about the pain and the suffering. She was not a victim. This is a woman who, when her leg was amputated, the first thing she did was custom-make a boot for herself. She painted it red so everyone could see what was happening to her. She had an amazing zest for life.”Although Dantas could not have predicted the political climate in which her play would debut, the current moment seems to make its message all the more pressing. “In the 1930s Frida said: ‘If the American people rebelled against everything that is wrong here, this would be a very different place,’” Dantas said. “Even then, she always said that women matter, that the LGBTQ community matters, that art matters. All the craziness that is happening in the country regarding immigration, she would have a lot to say about that for sure.” There have already been countless retrospectives, books, essays and films devoted to the life of Ms. Kahlo. Through “Fragmented Frida,” Dantas hopes to add her own perspective to the mix with a performance revolving around one particular thread of Kahlo’s many accomplishments: Her exceptional ability to turn vulnerability into strength.“She overcame so much,” Dantas said. “She shows, with certainty, there is nothing a person cannot overcome.”“Fragmented Frida,” directed by Christine Renee Miller, runs until Sunday, April 16, at BAM Fisher in Brooklyn, New York.

20,ARTS & CULTURE,A One-Woman Show Explores The Fragmented Life Of Frida Kahlo,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/frida-kahlo-play-andrea-dantas_us_58f0d253e4b0b9e9848b312f,"""Fragmented Frida"" creator Andrea Dantas was drawn to Kahlo's incredible resilience.",2017-04-14,"A visitor looks at ""Self-Portrait"" by Frida Kahlo during an exhibition in Rome.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0ea281b0000320016b923.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"A few years ago, Brazilian-born writer, actor and dancer Andrea Dantas heard back about her audition to dance flamenco on Madonna’s world tour. She didn’t get the job. “I thought, ‘OK, you’re allowed to feel sorry for yourself for 10 minutes,’” Dantas told The Huffington Post. “After, I thought, ‘What do you want to do now? What do you want to do with your life?’ And I swear, I heard a voice that said ‘Frida,’ and I just knew.”The fruits of Dantas’ labor are currently on view at Brooklyn’s BAM Fisher, in a one-woman show called “Fragmented Frida.” Dantas plays the role of the iconic painter Frida Kahlo, starting as a young, awkward yet precocious child ― complete with a bowl cut and a limp ― and ending up as the most renowned woman artist of all time: braided hair, unibrow and all.Far more than Dantas focuses on the specifics of Kahlo’s artistic craft, she zooms in on her life story, an extraordinary journey riddled with hardship. At the age of 6, Kahlo was stricken with polio, leaving her right leg incapacitated and in tremendous pain. At 18 she was involved in a near-fatal bus crash, which left her pelvis crushed. While recovering, and spending most of her time in a wheelchair, Kahlo began to paint, famously declaring: “I don’t paint dreams or nightmares, I paint my own reality.”It was Kahlo’s incredible resilience that drew Dantas to her as a character. “At that time in Mexico, being a woman wasn’t cool, being a feminist wasn’t cool, divorcing a man wasn’t cool, being a bisexual wasn’t cool, being so free sexually was not cool at all,” Dantas said. “How did she manage to do so much in spite of all the illness and all the betrayals? How does the underdog become the hero?”Dantas read around 20 Kahlo biographies before writing the script, taking about eight months to research. She then trained with movement coach Thiago Felix to accurately convey how Kahlo moved through the world, crippled at various points by illness, injury and heartbreak.Even after receiving recognition for her dreamlike self-portraits, which translated her brutal physical and emotional wounds onto her painted flesh, Kahlo continued to suffer. After being told she could not conceive, she became pregnant, only to suffer a grisly miscarriage. She experienced infidelity on the part of her husband, painter Diego Rivera, most painfully with her own sister. While today Kahlo is regarded as a figure of strength and courage, it was important for Dantas to capture the softer, more vulnerable aspects of her personality to show how, despite the mythical status she achieved, she was an emotional, fallible human being.“She had such a subtlety to her and a magnetism, she was a hopeless romantic,” Dantas said. “She was soft, she had a great sense of humor.

They launched the cruise missiles at Syria. But the U.S. military, stung when it was sent to war before without a clear plan and then blamed for the resulting mess, is expressing caution about being thrust deeper into any of the conflicts raging around the world.Combat-ready American and allied troops are deployed today against heavily armed opposing forces in Europe and the Korean peninsula. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, U.S. and NATO commander in Europe and the former top U.S. commander in South Korea, last year described their situation like this: They’re ready “to fight tonight if deterrence fails.” But a plan would be good.After 15 years of bloody, inconclusive war in Iraq and Afghanistan, experienced military officers are looking to President Donald Trump not just to pull the trigger on military action when needed. They’re looking for a coherent statement of American goals and a coordinated strategy that combines military force with economic, political, diplomatic, cyber and media power ― and doesn’t leave the war to the military alone.“There is a limit, I think, to what we can do,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this week at a Pentagon news conference, when asked about next steps the military might take in Syria following the April 7 missile attack.Mattis, a retired Marine four-star general with years of warfighting experience, indicated that he’s in no rush to send U.S. forces into combat as the sole instrument of American power.In a book he co-authored with Hoover Institution scholar Kori Schake last year, Mattis argued that the public and politicians are “implausibly expecting military force to produce sophisticated political, economic and cultural outcomes.” That’s not the military’s job, but “inherently a political undertaking.”“In free societies, politicians must choose the political ends,” Mattis and Schake wrote. “They must also determine what price ― in blood, treasure and national credibility ― to pay for those ends.”Retired Army Maj. Gen. Paul D. Eaton put it more simply. By failing to coordinate and focus all elements of power, he told The Huffington Post, the United States has “outsourced foreign policy to the U.S. military, and we are frequently not the very best tool.”While Trump praised the “flawless” missile strike on Syria, he’s been quick to complain about America’s recent war record. “We never win,” he groused earlier this year. “And we don’t fight to win.” When a U.S. Navy SEAL was killed during a military raid in Yemen in February, Trump was ready to blame “the generals.”It may seem counterintuitive, but many generals say war is too important to be left up to them. “I don’t think it’s fine, personally, to leave it up to the generals at the top level,” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Benjamin Freakley, who has served at all levels of command including leading the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan on his third combat tour.“I don’t believe in leaving it to the generals because the generals need help in harnessing political and economic and informational power,” he told HuffPost. “The political work has to be synchronized with the military, with one strategic outcome for America’s use of power.”That might require Trump’s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, to structure the White House’s thinking about war the same way that military commanders approach it.In combat operations, military leaders always write down and then brief their subordinates on their goal for the mission. This “commander’s intent” details precisely what the mission is intended to accomplish. Everyone should understand how each action contributes to the desired end state ― that is, the situation the commander envisions when the smoke clears.Given the commander’s intent, staff officers can then plot out what resources will be needed to make the plan work ― troops, heavy-lift helicopters, ammunition, fuel, intelligence on enemy positions, even good weather (or bad, to cover troop movements).At a higher level, the same kind of “commander’s intent” from the White House would help clarify, for instance, how a U.S. missile strike in Syria fits into an overall strategy of bringing down the regime of President Bashar Assad or ending the Syrian war. Guidance from the top would also help various staff allocate non-military resources to reach the goal.That’s the sort of next steps that Mattis seemed to have in mind when he said the U.S. strategic plan for defeating the Islamic State exists “in skeleton form.” He said the plan is “being fleshed out now. This has got to be done in a methodical way, where we look at each element of it.”“And it’s not something you can simply add water to a dehydrated plant and it’s suddenly a full-fledged plan. This is hard work and it’s going to take time,” Mattis added.No such direction on any of the military conflicts in which the U.S. is engaged has come from the Trump administration ― or from Congress, which alone has constitutional war-making authority. The Pentagon has recently mounted operations in Somalia, Libya and Syria and has re-engaged in Iraq under the authority of legislation passed in 2001 to allow attacks on al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Congress has declined to update that authorization.“Congress has been very content to go to ground, stay in foxhole defilade, if you will, and while the rounds are going over the foxhole, they’re not really involved,” Eaton said.On Thursday, U.S. forces escalated the air war in Afghanistan, striking with a massive bomb on what was described as an ISIS tunnel complex. But the White House did not explain how the attack fit into an overall strategy or contributed to a clear end state. White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to talk about strategy and referred all questions to the Defense Department.Similarly, the White House ordered the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its accompanying warships to head toward the Korean peninsula this week after Trump made vague threats about halting North Korea’s missile and nuclear weapons development. But the White House gave no explanation of the naval armada’s precise purpose, and did not address what reaction it anticipated or how the U.S. would handle a North Korean escalation.The military’s insistence that it operate with a coherent strategy and a defined end is hardly academic. They want to make sure that lives ― their own, their buddies, all the men and women they command ― are not spent in vain.“One third of the Army’s general officers have children serving in the military. I have three children who have served,” said Eaton, a West Pointer who now serves as a senior adviser to the progressive group VoteVets. With his two sons still on active duty, Eaton said, “we are consumed with the outcome of the mission and the human lives that are at stake, both American and on the other side.”So when they look to the commander-in-chief, they have a blunt request.“If you’re going to give a four-star [general] a mission, then you better be clear about what your end state is,” Eaton said.No strategy or clear end state has ever been defined for the ongoing U.S. military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now, he said, with more potential conflicts tempting American intervention, “we as a military class do not want a mission where we’re going to be set up for failure.”"

The Harvey Mine, owned by CNX Coal Resources, is part of the largest underground mining complex in the United States.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efd1cf1b0000330016b6fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SYCAMORE, Pennsylvania — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency chose a Pennsylvania coal mine with a history of violating environmental laws as his venue for unveiling a new plan to refocus his agency in a way that he says will both protect the planet and promote economic growth. Ignoring the fact that the U.S. coal industry’s troubles are primarily the result of market forces, Scott Pruitt offered roughly 75 miners at the Harvey Mine this hopeful message: The “regulatory assault” on coal is over.It was here in Appalachian coal country, at North America’s largest producing underground coal complex, that Pruitt formally launched the EPA’s “Back-To-Basics agenda.” But instead of sharing details about that plan, he commiserated with those in the room. What happened to coal under former President Barack Obama, Pruitt said in a four-minute address, is “really sad.”Pruitt, a climate change denier and longtime ally of the fossil fuel industry, claimed that coal, oil and gas companies are both pro-environment and pro-growth. Now that Obama is out of office, he said, America doesn’t have to chose between the two.“It’s been said — I think you’ve heard it said — you can’t have your cake and eat it too,” Pruitt said. “I’ll tell you, whoever says that doesn’t know what you’re supposed to do with cake.”Pruitt’s message wasn’t surprising, but his choice of venue was somewhat baffling.Consol Energy was fined $3 million just last year for dumping mine wastewater into Ohio River tributaries. Consol Energy owns the Bailey Mine Complex, which includes Harvey Mine. The company exceeded its daily or monthly effluent limit more than 300 times between 2006 and 2015, according to the EPA complaint. Consol, which now focuses primarily on natural gas production, has voiced its intent to sell off its remaining coal assets.Patrick Grenter, a senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, told The Huffington Post that Consol has operated recklessly for many years. In a 2005 settlement, the company paid $36 million to replace a dam that it was accused of damaging with its operations. Grenter called Pruitt’s visit to Harvey Mine “very concerning.” He said the only reasonable conclusion he could draw is that “’back-to-basics’ means back to promoting polluters over public health.”Pruitt’s visit to coal country comes a little over two weeks after President Donald Trump, surround by coal miners, signed an executive order instructing the EPA to review Obama’s Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The order also took measures to further protect the coal industry, namely by instructing the Department of the Interior to lift a temporary ban on coal leasing on federal lands that the Obama administration put in place last year.The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 700,000 federal and D.C. government employees, including EPA workers, has called the order the latest in “a continued assault on the country’s top-line of defense for community health.”Miners, most of whom were in their 30s and 40s and many of whom were covered in dust from their morning shift below ground, began to gather inside a large common area of the portal building before Pruitt’s address. At one end, workers wearing headlamps, hardhats and reflective suits came and went from a silver elevator shaft. On a long wall, a board covered in tags indicated who was on shift.“[It’s] no lie that the [coal] industry in the last eight years, we’ve all felt a lot of pain,” said Jimmy Brock, CEO of CNX Coal Resources, which operates the Harvey Mine. But the Bailey complex persevered somehow, he said. “It’s easy to be optimistic now,” Brock said following Pruitt’s speech. He added that coal miners should never apologize for the work they do.Other miners in attendance seemed to share Brock’s optimism about the future of coal.Eben McClay, of the nearby town Claysville, has worked at the Bailey complex for a decade. He told HuffPost that he sees Trump as being “all about America” and likes to see the administration standing up for coal and bringing jobs and industry back to the U.S. “The coal mine produces a lot of money and a lot of jobs for this area — for a lot of families,” he said. Harvey Mine is located in Pennsylvania’s Greene County, which has a population of just over 35,000. The coal industry here employs between 7,000 and 8,000 people, according to Robbie Matesic, executive director of the county’s Department of Economic Development. The county probably couldn’t withstand a sudden death of the industry, she said, but added that she is seriously concerned about climate change and believes coal companies must be held accountable for the environmental damage they cause. “Here’s our problem: We have an economy dependent on it,” she said. “The truth is our economy is not healthy because of the way it is dependent on the energy industry.”The community has been working hard to diversify its economy for the last several years, Matesic said. But it needs more time. Mark Kusky, a coal miner who has been with Consol for 11 years, said it’s encouraging to see Trump follow though on his campaign promise. Asked about climate change and the argument for cutting carbon emissions and moving toward renewable energy, Kusky said all energy sources have their downsides.He added that he’s hopeful coal will make a comeback, but that only time will tell if it can become the powerhouse it once was.“The future looks bright from where we’re standing,” he said.Matesic, however, said the only way to have healthy economies is to diversify ― meaning Trump and Pruitt are giving the coal industry, and communities like her own, false hope. “If the Trump administration is really concerned about the economic health and the environmental health of this country — if they really are — they’re not going about it the right way,” she said.See more about EPA’s “Back-To-Basics” Agenda here.

Asked about climate change and the argument for cutting carbon emissions and moving toward renewable energy, Kusky said all energy sources have their downsides.He added that he’s hopeful coal will make a comeback, but that only time will tell if it can become the powerhouse it once was.“The future looks bright from where we’re standing,” he said.Matesic, however, said the only way to have healthy economies is to diversify ― meaning Trump and Pruitt are giving the coal industry, and communities like her own, false hope. “If the Trump administration is really concerned about the economic health and the environmental health of this country — if they really are — they’re not going about it the right way,” she said.See more about EPA’s “Back-To-Basics” Agenda here.

Cooper is Swenson’s 6-year-old son, who has severe autism and is nonverbal. In the video, Swenson said that during a visit to a park that is accessible for kids with disabilities in Woodbury, Minnesota, a family confronted her and Cooper after the 6-year-old bumped a girl who was playing near him.“This is the first time that Cooper and I have been made to feel like we were not truly welcome somewhere,” she said in the video.Swenson told The Huffington Post that her son was on a slide platform when the incident happened and that she was next to him. “As a mom to a boy with severe autism, I am always one step ahead of him,” she said. “He flexed his body and bumped a little girl who slid down the slide. Instead of checking on his daughter, the father immediately stood over Cooper and yelled at him. Cooper didn’t understand what he did and ran off laughing and smiling. I immediately apologized to the family and explained that my son had nonverbal, severe autism and didn’t even see their daughter. I asked if she was OK even though it was obvious that she was.”Swenson said she apologized multiple times for what happened, but the family insisted that she and her son should not be at the park. As Swenson noted in her video, the park is one of the few places she is comfortable visiting with Cooper.“They refused to acknowledge autism as a reason their daughter got bumped,” she told HuffPost. “And for the first time I saw the hard road that my son is going to have ahead of him. I saw how easily he can be misunderstood. I cried the whole drive home and honestly felt that we weren’t going to be able to leave our house again.”In her video, Swenson explained that what happened at the park left her discouraged about how people who might not know much about autism interact with people who have it. She apologized numerous times for what her son did.Swenson also asked that people learn more about autism and what it means to have it. Then, she said, they will understand that her son has severe sensory issues and is obsessive about certain things like trains, but that he also loves jumping and being tickled and “wakes up every single day like it’s the best day of his life.”“I want people to take time to get to know him and see all the joy that he brings to the world,” she told HuffPost. “His disability does not define him. He is so much more than autism. He is Cooper.” Follow Swenson’s journey with Cooper on her site and Facebook.H/T BabbleThe HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting."

The effort aims to reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, which can be transmitted via shared needles.“There’s zero downside and lots of pluses,” Dr. Jerry Cade, co-founder of the HIV clinic at University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, told CBS News.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 of 10 AIDS diagnoses in 2015 were attributed to intravenous drug use. And heroin use among young people (18-25 years old) has more than doubled over the past decade. The vending machines will dispense kits with 10 syringes, a tourniquet, a disposal container for used syringes, alcohol swabs and adhesive bandages as well as an information sheet about where to get treatment for addiction. Three vending machines located in central Vegas will be operational by the end of May, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Southern Nevada Health District, Nevada AIDS Research and Education Society and Trac-B Exchange will run the machines, which are funded through private donations.Users must register to access the machines, though personal identifying information won’t be required, officials told the Reno Gazette-Journal. Once registered, users will receive a card and a code that gives them access to the machines twice a week.“This is a harm-reduction approach,” Trac-B Exchange program manager Chelsi Cheatom told KSNV-TV. “Anytime someone’s engaging in a behavior that could cause them some potential health side effects, we want to encourage them to reduce their risk.”While the Vegas machines will be the first in the nation to dispense syringes, needle vending machines have been used for years in Puerto Rico, Europe and Australia.“The debate over whether syringe exchanges are beneficial has long been settled,” Daniel Raymond, deputy director of planning and policy at the Harm Reduction Coalition, said per NBC. “The issue now is more, what method is appropriate for my community?”"

G. Paul Nardo has been the clerk of the Virginia state House for five and a half years. Schaar was making $175,392. The less-experienced Nardo was making $194,341. It’s hard to find a more blatant display of gender pay disparity than what has been going on in the Virginia General Assembly.Republican leaders in the state Senate recently authorized a raise for Schaar, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, so that she now makes $195,500 ― essentially the same as her male House counterpart who has been on the job for 21 years fewer than she has. Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment, Jr. (R) has been trying to fix the imbalance for months, saying, “I just think that she’s entitled to be compensated at the same level as the clerk of the House. She’s been here 30 years.”He first filed a budget amendment in January to try to raise Schaar’s salary.Norment had the support of Democrats in the House, but some of his fellow Republicans in that chamber opposed his move. Del. S. Chris Jones (R), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, for example, argued that Nardo does more work than Schaar. “The clerk in the House of Delegates is the keeper of the rolls,” he said in February. “Next year when we get here, his office and he (will) take care of the inauguration. So the jobs are not equal in what they do as far as their task at hand.”House Republicans also rejected a Democratic budget amendment to bring Schaar’s pay in line with Nardo’s at that time. Norment and the Senate Rules Committee ultimately authorized the raise for Schaar. Nardo started in the clerk position in 2011 with a salary of $157,540. He received routine raises, but also a significant boost thanks to a move by House Speaker William J. Howell (R). Before being clerk, Nardo was chief of staff to Howell from 2002-2011.Schaar has worked in the state Senate for a total of 43 years, starting at the age of 23. She told the Times-Dispatch she was satisfied with the new pay arrangement and did not return an additional request for comment from The Huffington Post.Nardo said he didn’t have any comment on the matter, because it was an issue that was between Schaar and the legislative chamber.“The Senate Clerk works for a separate coequal legislative body and her pay is set completely separate from and by non House members,” he said. “The Speaker sets mine as Clerk and Keeper of the Rolls of the Commonwealth.”Jeff Ryer, spokesman for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, said neither he nor anyone else from the caucus would comment for this piece because they do not consider The Huffington Post “a legitimate news organization.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

But the DCCC still trails its Republican counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, which raised $36 million in the first quarter.The DCCC, nonetheless, massively outpaced the NRCC in online fundraising over the same period, bringing in around $13.7 million compared with the Republicans’ $1.7 million. The digital fundraising total came from 750,000 individual contributions, including gifts from 121,000 first-time donors, according to the DCCC.The Democratic campaign arm touted the strong fundraising performance, including the online figures, as evidence that the backlash to President Donald Trump is lifting Democratic fortunes.“Our record-breaking fundraising is a clear reflection of the urgency that people have towards fighting back against a reckless Republican agenda, including ongoing efforts to rip apart the Affordable Care Act,” DCCC spokesman Tyler Law said in a press release. “The massive amount of small-dollar, online donations – much of which came from first time donors – provides another clear sign that the grassroots energy is behind House Democrats this cycle.”The DCCC’s announcement follows other signs that Democrats are benefiting from high enthusiasm within their base in the wake of Trump’s election. ActBlue, the website that processes donations to Democratic candidates and causes, reported last week that it had processed more than $111 million in online donations in the first quarter of the year. The figure is four times the total haul in the first quarter of 2015, the last non-election year.Special elections for several open House seats and dozens of posts in state legislatures give Democrats a chance to capitalize on this excitement long before the 2018 midterm elections. In a special election to fill the congressional seat in Kansas’ deep-red 4th district last Tuesday, the Democratic candidate James Thompson lost by just 7 percentage points, after Republican Mike Pompeo, who is now CIA director, won by more than 30 points in 2016. Thompson benefited from a last-minute infusion of $200,000 raised by readers of the liberal site Daily Kos and other activists, but got only a modicum of assistance from the DCCC.Democrats now have their hearts set on special elections in Montana and Georgia’s 6th district. The latter race, to fill a seat vacated by Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, has received significant investment from the DCCC and outside groups like Daily Kos.Jon Ossoff, the leading 30-year-old Democratic candidate in Georgia’s 6th district, is hoping to win an outright majority in the first round of voting next Tuesday. Strong Democratic turnout in early voting looks good for him, but if he fails to gain a majority in the first round, where he is competing with many candidates, he will have to enter a runoff with a Republican on June 20. His chances in the runoff look considerably slimmer."

Americans are griping about the government. And partisanship is becoming an all-encompassing identity. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 14, 2017.REPUBLICANS’ NARROW WIN IN KS-04 COULD PORTEND MIDTERM PROBLEMS FOR THE GOP - Nate Cohn: “This season’s special congressional elections are being heralded as a test of whether newly energized Democrats will fare better with an unpopular Republican president. So far, the Democrats are passing the test. On Tuesday, Republicans won an unexpectedly close race in Kansas’ Fourth Congressional District. The Republican Ron Estes won by seven points over James Thompson, even though President Trump won the district by 27 points in November. No Democrat holds a House seat as Republican as this one, so it’s startling that the seat was even competitive…The small and imperfect lesson of Tuesday’s special election in Kansas is that the Republicans might be in quite a bit of trouble. Mr. Estes’s seven-point victory is extremely poor for this district, whether under politically neutral circumstances or an environment deeply unfavorable to the president’s party. Even with Mr. Trump’s approval rating around 40 percent, Mr. Estes should still have been considered a 20-plus-point favorite in the district.” [NYT]...or not - Sean Trende: “To put this in context, this district is about 15 points more Republican than the country as a whole, so a Republican loss here would be a bit more extreme than a Republican winning a special election for a Senate seat in Massachusetts. So this is not a great result for Republicans, and it is consistent with a story of Republicans potentially losing the House next year. But to suggest that ‘few districts are safe’ is an exaggeration….Estes overall ran better than Gov. Sam Brownback did in 2014, and Brownback had a Democratic opponent. So if we use the 2014 elections as our baseline, this district actually looks pretty good for Republicans….[M]idterm elections correlate heavily with presidential approval rating, and Donald Trump’s approval rating is in the low 40s. If this state of affairs continues, Republicans will likely find themselves in real danger of losing the House. We didn’t need a special election to know that.” [RCP] Is Trump to blame for the loss? - Harry Enten: “Democrats, of course, are proclaiming the closer-than-expected race as a referendum on President Trump and evidence that a liberal wave is building in advance of the 2018 midterms. Republicans are pointing out that this is just one election and there were local factors at play. It’s true that Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is super unpopular, and it’s difficult to know how much Brownback hurt Estes compared to Trump and his poor approval ratings….We can, though, make a rough attempt to separate the Trump and Brownback factors….[T]he four Republican candidates for the House in Kansas in 2014 did 3 to 15 percentage points worse than expected given the national environment. On average, they did 8 points worse. So let’s say there was an 8-point Brownback Drag in 2014. An 8-point drag doesn’t come anywhere close to explaining how Estes did 22 percentage points worse than would be expected in a neutral national environment….The 2017 Kansas 4 special election result probably wasn’t just about local issues.” [538]DISSATISFACTION WITH GOVERNMENT NAMED AS A TOP PROBLEM - Art Swift: “More than one in five U.S. adults cite dissatisfaction with the government and political leadership as the most important problem in the country. This is by far the problem U.S. adults most frequently mention, followed by healthcare, immigration and the economy….The current level of dissatisfaction with the government is the highest since October 2013 to January 2014, after the partial government shutdown that October. The only other period during Gallup’s polling history when a higher percentage of Americans cited government as the most important problem was in 1973 and 1974 during the Watergate crisis….Much of the increase in dissatisfaction stems from negativity toward the president, as substantial percentages of Americans simply say ‘Donald Trump’ when asked to name the most important problem facing the country.” [Gallup] ‘PARTY AFFILIATION HAS BECOME AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING IDENTITY’ - Amanda Taub: “Why do people vote against their economic interests? The answer, experts say, is partisanship. Party affiliation has become an all-encompassing identity that outweighs the details of specific policies….For American voters, party affiliation is a way to express a bundle of identities….[W]hen people do switch, it is often because they feel that the other party has become a better representative of the groups that they identify with. Preliminary data suggests that is what happened with the Democratic voters who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, said Lilliana Mason, a professor at the University of Maryland who studies partisanship….Everyone has multiple identities: racial, religious, professional, ideological and more. But while those multiple identities might once have pushed people in different partisan directions — think of the conservative Democrats of old in the South or all the liberal Republicans in the Northeast — today it’s more common to line up behind one party.” [NYT] HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING UP WITH THE NEWS? YOU’RE IN THE MINORITY - HuffPollster on a new HuffPost/YouGov survey: “[A]mong respondents who say they generally try to stay informed on what’s happening in politics, just 30 percent say that they feel political news is changing so quickly that they can’t keep up. Sixty percent say they don’t have any problems doing so….Older Americans are less likely than younger ones to feel overwhelmed. Seventy percent of Americans over 65 who try to keep up with politics say they have no problems doing so, compared to just half of politically engaged Americans under age 45. Being on the winning team also seems to help. Seventy-two percent of Trump voters who try to keep up with political news say they don’t have any problems doing so, compared to 58 percent of politically engaged Clinton voters and 48 percent of those who didn’t vote in the 2016 election.” [HuffPost]FEWER THAN BEFORE SAY GOP IS ‘TOO EXTREME’ - HuffPollster: “Fewer Americans now view the Republican Party as “too extreme” than did so a year ago, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Forty-two percent of Americans currently say the GOP is too extreme, down modestly from the 48 percent who said that in a survey last May, and from the 50 percent who held that view two years ago. Views of the Democrats have changed relatively little over the same time period ― 40 percent now say the party is too extreme, compared to 38 percent last year and 39 percent in 2015.” [HuffPost]ECUADOREAN AUTHORITIES RAID A POLLING FIRM AFTER AN ELECTION - Associated Press: “Ecuadorean prosecutors and police have searched the office of a Gallup polling affiliate whose presidential election exit poll fueled protests by projecting a six-point win for the losing opposition candidate. An exit poll by Cedatos and two other firms showed conservative banker Guillermo Lasso winning Sunday’s race. Official results wound up showing him losing by two points to ruling-party candidate Lenin Moreno. Outgoing President Rafael Correa accused people close to Lasso’s campaign of hiring Cedatos to intentionally spread false results and sow confusion. But it’s not clear why the firm’s offices were raided Friday. Cedatos accurately predicted the results of the eight-way first round and said it has nothing to hide.” [WashPost]U.S. and international polling organizations condemn the move - Per a press release: “The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and the World Association for Public Opinion Research (WAPOR) strongly condemn the reported government forced entry into the offices of the Ecuadoran polling firm CEDATOS. The confiscation of computers and the arrest of two CEDATOS employees ― now released ― appear to have been a response to disagreements involving the findings from exit polls conducted in conjunction with that nation’s April 2 Presidential election….Exit polls and public opinion surveys in general are important facilitators of democratic society and governance. While survey results of any election may vary depending on such factors as sampling techniques and question wording, efforts to discredit particular polls and intimidate and harm their authors create a chilling atmosphere, aimed at suppressing the free flow of information. Those in positions of power in democratic governments have a responsibility to encourage, not discourage that flow of information.”HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this update every Tuesday and Friday morning via email!

Now he says it's clear the agency viewed him as expendable.,2017-04-14,"Carlos Toro, seen at his Miami home in 1982, before he went to work for the DEA.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fab2951e0000b300705927.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals court ruled against a former confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration this week, siding with the government in his lawsuit to receive compensation for his 29-year career at the drug agency.In a Wednesday ruling, judges upheld a previous decision against Carlos Toro, a 67-year-old Colombian national who has lived in the U.S. for 50 years. Toro was seeking $5 million in damages as a result of what he calls the DEA’s breach of contract. A federal judge ruled last March that a six-year statute of limitations ― beginning when Toro agreed to inform for the DEA in 1986 ― barred his claim.Toro first told his story to The Huffington Post in 2015, at which time he ceased his involvement with the DEA. In a series of interviews, Toro described his decades of work with the agency, starting when he became a confidential informant and began gathering intelligence to help take down his former compatriots in the Medellin Cartel.For nearly three decades, Toro continued to work on and off as an undercover operative, providing intelligence in a number of high-profile drug trafficking cases in the U.S., South America and Europe. But Toro says he was only minimally compensated for his work, despite repeated assurances that the agency would eventually repay his sacrifices.“I had no quarrels with the DEA for the first 12, 15, 20 years,” Toro told HuffPost this week. “I always believed what they promised me.”Toro says he was confident he would eventually be rewarded with money and support from the government he’d served. Those promises were never set in stone, however, and when he became ill with cancer in 2015, he says, it became clear that the DEA had no intention of paying him or helping him secure a visa or green card that would give him permanent status in the U.S.He has been stuck in legal limbo ever since, and lives in fear that he could be deported to Colombia, where he says he’d likely be killed by remnants of the cartel. His health continues to falter, and he’s currently awaiting an update on the status of a petition for political asylum that he filed almost two years ago.Toro’s story provides a rare glimpse into the shadowy world of confidential sources, who include around 18,000 operatives working for the DEA alone, according to a Justice Department audit released last year. Many of these people are facing criminal charges and agree to inform for the DEA in exchange for more lenient treatment, as Toro did at first, following a drug arrest in the 1980s. But like Toro, some also choose to continue contributing after their obligations are fulfilled, often assuming great risk with few legal protections and little promise of fair treatment.The government’s decision in Toro’s case shows how easy it is for the DEA to take advantage of confidential informants, and how difficult it is for informants to seek legal recourse.A contract is a very specific thing in the eyes of the law, said Toro’s attorney, Michael Avery, and DEA officials generally avoid giving their sources clear guarantees.“Agents on the street either don’t know, or they’re not telling the informants what they need to know in terms of the reality of entering an agreement when it comes down to money,” Avery said.Avery has represented informants in a number of cases against the government, and said he’s never seen an example of a written contract setting out specific terms of compensation.Toro’s DEA contracts never included concrete information about payment, he said, and his handlers would send him out on missions with only vague assurances that they’d take care of him. Most of the money he took in came from skimming cash off the top of whatever operational funds the agency gave him so he could put on his facade as a wealthy drug dealer, Toro claimed.“I cheated and I’m not scared to admit it,” he said.Although Toro feels that he didn’t play by the rules at times, the Justice Department’s 2016 audit of the DEA informant program suggests few people on either side of these agreements were.“We found that the DEA did not adequately oversee payments to its sources, which exposes the DEA to an unacceptably increased potential for fraud, waste and abuse, particularly given the frequency with which DEA offices utilize and pay confidential sources,” the report found.And while some informants may have been able to take advantage of such lax oversight, others, like Toro, have been left high and dry.“When informants agree to work for whatever deal they make, they’re probably not entering into an enforceable agreement or contract,” Avery said. “It’s a huge minefield.”The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.The appeals court’s decision is a punch in the gut for Toro, who likens his career at the DEA to a complicated marriage.“The government’s argument is like saying that I only had a six-year window of opportunity to seek a divorce or file claims against them for a problem,” he said. “But why would that make sense, if I remained married for 25 years and never considered breaking up and believed we’d have a perfect retirement?”Toro would have taken a different approach had he known he had only six years from his start date to decide his future at the DEA, he said. But he admitted things were different back then.“We were still in our honeymoon,” Toro said, recalling his early years as an informant. “I was still doing cases in Cuba and the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Everybody loved me and I loved them. I felt like I was Superman, and they were going to put me on a pedestal when I got old.”Many law enforcement agencies have to come to rely heavily on the work of confidential informants in order to build cases. With some of them likely in positions similar to Toro’s, his struggle to get what he believes he’s owed could serve as a warning.“If you’re going to enter into an agreement with a government agency as a confidential informant, you need to talk to a lawyer first,” Avery said.“Those people out there who are being told to come be a snitch ― watch who you’re negotiating with,” Toro said. “You’re dealing with the devil.”"

If your child does swallow one of these little guys, it can absorb water and expand inside the body, causing intestinal obstructions, dehydration and vomiting. Children could need surgery to remove the toy and it might not show up on X-rays, according the CPSC.

That’s why we are honored to endorse Tom Perriello for governor of Virginia,” said Weaver, emphasizing the and in the statement sent to reporters to signal it was not enough for a candidate to simply share the right values. They must also be willing to stand up and fight Trump. The implicit charge is that his opponent, Ralph Northam, a country doctor who has admitted to voting twice for George W. Bush, will not.When Perriello jumped into the race late in the game, his bid was dismissed by most national and Virginia observers as quixotic. Northam is lieutenant governor and was backed in the race by Gov. Terry McAuliffe as well as much of the Democratic establishment. But as he has crisscrossed the state, he has steadily climbed in the polls, pulling even in the past few weeks, and this week posting a 5-point lead in a Quinnipiac survey. (Polling a primary is notoriously difficult, so no firm conclusions should be drawn from the numbers, but the direction of the polling has been markedly in Perriello’s favor.)Our Revolution’s backing comes in the wake of an endorsement by Sen. Sanders himself, who campaigned last Thursday in Virginia with Perriello. “Tom’s victory will send a message across this country that people do not want our nation to move in the Trump direction,” Sanders told The Huffington Post in an interview the day after the rally.With Democratic enthusiasm surging in a progressive direction, Perriello has effectively staked out the left flank in the primary, both with his populist economics and now the endorsement of Sanders and Our Revolution.It wasn’t obvious that Sanders would go his way. Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta had earlier backed Perriello, scrambling the neat Clinton-Sanders divide that is often used to frame conversation about the Democratic electorate. What’s more, while Perriello was a diplomat during the presidential primary, and therefore not involved in electoral politics, he personally supported Clinton, making Sanders’ endorsement that much more noteworthy. Perriello has cast himself as not just the most populist and progressive candidate in the race, but one who can unite the party. The endorsements of Podesta, Sanders and Our Revolution will help him make that case. Northam’s spokesman, Ofirah Yheskel, cited grassroots fundraising and signature-gathering to argue that, in fact, Northam has the momentum.“The lieutenant governor has been barnstorming the state and meeting with thousands of Virginians, he’s submitted more than 30,000 signatures to get on the ballot compared to Perriello’s 20,000, and he’s received over 12,000 individual contributions with 91% coming in under $100,” he said. “That’s real grassroots energy and it shows the momentum is with Ralph Northam in this primary. We feel good about what our internal polls are saying, and are confident in our position to win in June.”The primary will be held June 13. The winner is expected to take on GOP lobbyist Ed Gillespie. Take a survey: Who would you like to see win the Democratic primary?"

On Thursday, the cable network revealed that Queen Latifah, Jill Scott, Betsy Brandt and Marin Ireland will star in the Craig Zadan and Neil Meron-produced film, which is inspired by writer Josh Sanburn’s 2016 Time magazine cover story “The Toxic Tap.”“Flint” will depict the true story of three activists from the city ― portrayed by Scott, Brandt and Ireland, with Latifah playing a fourth resident ― who are fighting to expose and bring justice to the events surrounding their lead-tainted water supply, according to a press release.Since details surrounding the quality of Flint’s water supply emerged in 2014, many have expressed their frustrations with the lack of prevention efforts and referred to the disaster as environmental racism. The humanitarian disaster later prompted former President Barack Obama to issue a state of emergency to the area in 2016, and drew a slew of donations from the likes of Beyonce, Mark Wahlberg, Sean “Diddy” Combs, Eminem and Cher ― who recently withdrew from her role in the Lifetime film due to a “serious family issue.”Previously, Scott and Latifah co-starred in Lifetime’s 2012 remake of the 1989 film “Steel Magnolias.”Production for “Flint” begins next week."

Jackson stars in a new radio ad encouraging residents of Georgia’s 6th Congressional District to vote Democratic in Tuesday’s special election.The narrater of the ad, released Friday by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, introduces Jackson as an award-winning actor and civil rights activist, as well as a graduate of Morehouse, a historically black college in Atlanta. Then Jackson makes his pitch.“Stop Donald Trump, the man who encourages racial and religious discrimination and sexism,” Jackson says. “Remember what happened the last time people stayed home: We got stuck with Trump.”The ad does not mention any Democratic candidates by name. But it clearly aims to help Jon Ossoff, the 30-year-old documentary filmmaker who has mounted a competitive challenge in the normally Republican district.The minute-long audio spot will air Saturday through Tuesday on urban radio stations in the Atlanta area with the goal of turning out black voters. It is part of a larger six-figure radio ad buy aimed at turning out African-American voters, according to the DCCC.”We have to channel the great vengeance and furious anger we have for this administration into votes at the ballot box,” Jackson says in the ad. “Do your friends and family a favor ― hell, do yourself a favor, and vote on April 18th!”Georgia uses a nonpartisan “jungle primary” system to elect members of Congress. That means Ossoff will compete alongside several Democrats and Republicans in Tuesday’s contest. He will win outright if he obtains a majority of votes. If no candidate obtains a majority, the top two candidates will proceed to a runoff election on June 20.Ossoff’s candidacy has attracted millions of dollars in grassroots and party fundraising as Democrats try to translate the backlash to President Donald Trump, and the enthusiasm of the liberal base, into concrete electoral gains. In addition to Jackson, television star Alyssa Milano has pitched in for Ossoff by offering residents free rides to early voting.Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, whose appointment opened up the seat, won re-election in the affluent district by 23 points in November. But Trump captured the district by a mere 1.5 points.Preliminary data suggests that Democratic voters have disproportionately participated in early voting in the district, which could be a positive sign for Ossoff."

Miss Piggy. Elmo. Cookie Monster. The Fraggles. You will soon have a chance to see these and plenty more beloved creatures in the flesh ― or rather, in the fuzz ― thanks to a comprehensive Jim Henson exhibition headed, permanently, to the Museum of Moving Image (MOMI) in New York. The Museum launched a Kickstarter campaign on Tuesday, calling on all Henson buffs to help raise $40,000 to realize the creatively named “Jim Henson Exhibition” in all its glory. And boy did they deliver. In just two days, the museum met its initial mark. We can officially say, the show will happen. Now they’re hoping to reach their “stretch goal” of $100,000, in order to welcome even more bug-eyed creatures with squeezable noses and unruly mops of hair into their new Queens home. The permanent MOMI exhibition was first announced in 2013, with help from $2.75 million in backing from New York City, a place many muppets would have called home if they could talk.“Many of the Muppets who you’ve come to love were made right here in New York City,” Jim’s daughter Cheryl Henson said at the time. “They were sewn, glued, designed and built right here.” The money helped fund a 2,200-square-foot gallery on the museum’s second floor and ensure that it is puppet-proof. Given the fact that the Jim Henson’s Creature Shop is based in Queens, the setting was a perfect spot for the muppets to settle down in. This next round of fundraising is geared toward the restoration of the puppets themselves, around 40 of which will appear in the exhibition. The crop is any puppet-head’s dream come true, featuring original beasties from all the Henson classics: we’re talking “Sesame Street,” “The Muppet Show,” “Fraggle Rock,” “The Dark Crystal” and “Labyrinth.” The delicate creatures are to be spruced up by designers and builders at Henson’s legendary Creature Shop, where they’ll be preserved for future generations to ogle, as well. If you’re not based in New York, worry not, a traveling version of “The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited” is also slated to go on tour, starting off at Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture on May 20. Clarification: The Center for Puppetry Arts, based in Atlanta, also received a major donation from the family of Jim Henson and has a permanent exhibit devoted to Henson on view.

Don Beyer is trying to set the record straight on a committee led by a chairman who disparages climate science.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f112371b0000330016b9e2.jpeg?ops=crop_0_113_5400_2864%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Fed up with the anti-science nonsense that now dominates hearings of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, vice ranking member Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) has launched a project to make it easier for scientists to set the record straight.The appropriately named FactCheck Project was sparked in particular by last month’s hearing on climate change, which committee Chairman Lamar Smith (R-Texas) stacked with three likeminded climate change skeptics. The panel’s Democratic minority got to name one witness: Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University who advocates for urgently tackling human-caused climate change.To no one’s surprise, the hearing’s main focus was not how to tackle the crisis but whether the vast majority of climate scientists — roughly 97 percent — are correct in their consensus that it is real and that humans are the primary cause. The goal of the FactCheck Project is to provide a venue for credentialed experts to correct inaccurate and misleading statements that might be made at future hearings, Beyers said. Such corrections can be submitted either through a form on Beyer’s website or via Twitter using the hashtag #FactCheckSST and will become part of a hearing’s official record.“Republicans on the House Science Committee would like to create doubt and confusion on climate change rather than contemplate solutions, but we cannot allow them to succeed,” Beyer said in a statement on Friday. “This project gives scientists and others who are not invited to speak the chance to support their colleagues like Dr. Mann with scientific fact.”In addition to calling for expert rebuttals, Beyer sent a letter to Smith that includes corrections to several statements made at the March 29 hearing.Witness John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama, claimed in his written testimony that “consensus ... is a political notion, not a scientific notion.” In response, Scott Mandia, assistant chair of Suffolk County Community College’s Physical Sciences Department, offered a 2016 study that concluded “the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.”Another correction targets Smith’s wild claim that the widely respected Science magazine is not known to be “objective.” The two-paragraph rebuttal comes from an article published in Snopes and written by freelance science writer Alex Kasprak. It says in part:Among the numerous monumentally significant papers published in the journal are Albert Einstein’s formulation of gravitational lensing, the complete map of the entire human genome, the first evidence of a link between HIV and AIDS, and numerous Nobel Prize winning discoveries. Based on a combination of factors (including the number of times its papers are cited), Science is consistently ranked (including by the NIH, an organization over which Smith’s committee has jurisdiction) as being among [the] highest-impact journals in all of science.These examples and additional fact-checking ― including from Harvard professor, science historian and Merchants of Doubt co-author Naomi Oreskes ― will be entered in the hearing record, according to Beyer.In his letter to Smith, Beyer wrote of his increasing concern about the “sweeping statements and allegations not supported by accepted science or fact” that come from the Republican committee members and their witnesses. He said it was hard not to see them as an attempt to undermine climate science. The congressman said at last month’s hearing that he’d come to realize that the opposing sides of the climate debate can’t get along because the “stakes are so high.”“If the vast majority of scientists are correct about the human impact on global warming, you have 55 million people in Bangladesh that will be displaced, many countries, including the Maldives, that will disappear from the planet,” he said. “There’s a lot at stake,” Beyer observed."

40,POLITICS,Critics Fear Donald Trump Is Backing Off China Trade Crackdown,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-china-trade-policy_us_58f01dace4b0b9e9848ad61b,"Even if China is no longer manipulating its currency, reforms are still needed, they say.",2017-04-14,"President Donald Trump, left, and China's President Xi Jinping walk along the front patio of the Mar-a-Lago estate after a bilateral meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, on April 7, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f020a41b0000330016b80b.jpeg?cache=WaUmXUOPFM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump announced in a Wednesday interview with The Wall Street Journal that he would not try to label China a “currency manipulator.”It was one of several recent about-faces on policy ― from Syria to NATO to the Federal Reserve ― hailed by mainstream political analysts as evidence that Trump is finally walking back some of the more unorthodox stances from his presidential campaign.But some economists who agree that China is not presently depressing its currency nonetheless worry that Trump’s evolving thinking could signal a diminished appetite for tackling the broader issue of China’s currency policies and the closely related issue of its massive global trade surplus.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, welcomed Trump’s recognition that China is no longer manipulating its currency as an indication that the president is “being more connected to the reality of the situation than he was.”He is nonetheless concerned that Trump’s comments could reflect the rising influence of Goldman Sachs alumni ― such as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and deputy national security adviser Dina Powell ― who, by virtue of their backgrounds, are more sympathetic to the status quo.“There is still the potential for significant and distortionary imbalances in international trade and finance. One worries that the Goldman [Sachs] wing of the White House is kind of assuming that away,” said Bernstein, who was former Vice President Joe Biden’s chief economist from 2009 to 2011.Former finance executives are less likely to view rebalancing trade with China and other trading partners as an urgent priority, since making it easier to import cheaper foreign goods has fattened the profits of companies they invest in, Bernstein argued.“If you are a multinational corporation … your stakes in the game are pretty different than a family in a manufacturing community in the Rust Belt,” he said.As Bernstein noted, Trump was technically correct when it comes to China’s current behavior.“Currency manipulation” is when a country uses foreign currency it earns from exporting goods to buy up assets denominated in that currency. By stockpiling foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, the purchasing country can raise a currency’s value on the global market, thereby making goods sold in that currency more expensive and less competitive.The exact criteria used to determine whether a country’s currency policies have crossed the line into manipulation vary.It is clear though that China has not been manipulating its currency in a way that would advantage its exports for a few years now. In fact, for over a year and a half, China’s central bank has been propping up the yuan by steadily selling off its foreign currency reserves. It now holds some $3 trillion in foreign reserves, down from a peak of almost $4 trillion in 2014.Of course, China is acting to stave off a precipitous drop in the yuan’s value as an economic slowdown prompted its citizens to move their money overseas. Its actions have not resulted in an appreciable rise relative to the dollar. The yuan has roughly the same value relative to the dollar that it had in 2010.Some centrist and liberal economists who disagree with Trump on other matters, however, were sympathetic to his insistence that the U.S. needed to reduce its trade deficit with China ― even when they disliked the way he went about saying it. From the early to mid-2000s through about 2013, China was indeed manipulating its currency, the largest of several techniques it used to become a net exporter of goods to both the United States and the world.A broad array of experts now agree that these practices contributed to a massive loss in U.S. manufacturing jobs that harmed the American middle class. A January study released by Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute, estimated that trade with China cost the U.S. 3.4 million jobs from 2001 to 2015, the vast majority of them in manufacturing. An academic study using more conservative assumptions concluded that Chinese trade deprived the U.S. of as many as 2.4 million jobs from 1999 to 2011.Economists who believe the trade deficit should be smaller argue that China’s accumulated surplus of foreign currencies still tilts the scales for its exports.“While it may be technically true that China is no longer acquiring dollar-denominated assets, they still hold more than $3 trillion in foreign currency reserves, and probably $1 trillion in other investments,” Scott said. “It is clear that China’s currency needs to rise in value.” The yuan would need to rise in value by 25 to 30 percent to reasonably rebalance global trade, he estimated.Few dispute that China needs less than the $3 trillion in foreign currency reserves it currently holds to withstand a major financial shock.In fact, it needs no more than $2 trillion and probably significantly less, according to Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the centrist Peterson Institute for International Economics who has co-authored a book on currency manipulation due out in June, Currency Conflict and Trade Policy: A New Strategy for the United States.Gagnon agrees with Scott about the need for the U.S. to rebalance trade with China, albeit for different reasons. He maintains that importing so many goods from China and other nations is financially unsustainable for the United States because of the private and public borrowing it requires.But China’s steady drawdown of its currency reserves in recent years has convinced Gagnon that Trump should not pressure China to accelerate the pace at which it is already reducing its stockpile.“I would be hard-pressed to justify asking China to do more than it’s already been doing in the past two years on the currency,” said Gagnon, a former economist at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. “To fault them right now would be insane because it would be punishing good behavior.”Trade negotiations are always a give and take between the different parties, however. Eswar Prasad, a Cornell professor who led the International Monetary Fund’s China desk in the 2000s, told The New York Times that the United States was aware of the currency manipulation issue at the time, but obtaining “greater market access, better intellectual property rights protection, easier access to investment opportunities” were simply higher priorities.Prasad’s comments support the belief of economists such as Dean Baker, co-director of the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research, that putting more emphasis on issues like currency that affect workers could lead to significantly different outcomes.  “The trade-offs to date have been in favor of the pharmaceutical industry, the entertainment industry, the software industry, the financial industry, and against U.S. workers. And I’d flip those priorities,” he said. Trump seems to have a different type of bartering in mind when it comes to U.S.-China commerce. He tweeted on Tuesday that he is open to relaxing his trade-related demands on China if it would help defuse tensions with North Korea. The comments disconcerted Scott of the Economic Policy Institute.“I am increasingly concerned that Trump is going to follow in the footsteps of his predecessors and not sanction China for currency manipulation and trade off the interests of working Americans for other vague foreign policy goals like convincing the North Koreans to slow down production of nuclear weapons. It is a serious mistake,” Scott said.Trying to achieve geopolitical goals through policies that enable offshoring of manufacturing jobs “rarely works,” he added.Asked whether Trump still views China’s currency value as problematic and plans to take steps to address it, the White House referred The Huffington Post to press secretary Sean Spicer’s comments about Trump’s currency manipulation pivot on Thursday. “It’s a very complex issue and I’m going to leave it to the president to specifically answer that,” Spicer said. “The president is going to continue to make significant progress when it comes to that issue and to how our relationship is with China.”Spicer also dismissed the notion that Trump had dramatically changed the policy positions that he campaigned on.“If you look at what’s happened ― it’s those entities or individuals in some cases ―or issues ― evolving toward the president’s position,” he said."

The dancers were dressed in the costumes they’ll wear onstage at the Joyce Theater later this month, where they’ll be performing three works by Latina choreographers, all of whom are women. Founded in 1970, Ballet Hispánico defines itself as a community-building institution dedicated to exploring the diversity of Latino culture, involving dancers and choreographers from Venezuela, Cuba, Trinidad, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia in a mix of classical, Latin and contemporary dance. This year, its New York Season will not only celebrate the depth of expression found in the various corners of Latin America, it will shine light on the women creating art in a traditionally male-dominated field.“Ballet Hispánico was born out of the need to give voice to Latino/Latina artists at a time when they did not have a strong presence in mainstream performing arts,” Eduardo Vilaro, the artistic director of Ballet Hispánico since 2009, told The Huffington Post. Today, the company is taking its mission a step further, by choosing to honor the female choreographers who are seizing positions of leadership in dance: Michelle Manzanales, Annabelle Lopez Ochoa and Tania Pérez-Salas.“It is imperative that we nurture and give voice to those who may not have opportunities within the field,” Vilaro added. “By nurturing and celebrating the work of these Latina artists, Ballet Hispánico hopes to contribute to the process of making the dance field more equitable.”Vilaro’s sense of duty to marginalized voices is heightened, he says, by the company’s 46-year legacy in New York City. Since the 2015 opening of Ballet Hispánico’s Arnhold Center on 89th Street ― with its unmistakable banners and open windows ― the organization has embarked on a five-year plan to nurture its relationship with the neighborhood it calls home. It’s doing so by hosting free performances, outdoor events and Hispanic heritage celebrations. Judging by the public’s captivation upon seeing dancers like Melissa Fernandez and Lyvan Verdecia leaping in front of a nearby parking garage, local interest is pronounced.“The photo shoot certainly underlined the magic and richness of culture that Ballet Hispánico brings to the Upper West Side,” Vilaro added. “It is our duty to continue this legacy and build upon it as we navigate the terrain of today’s immigrant and race relations and the new challenges that our communities face.”Ahead of the company’s April 18 debut at the Joyce, HuffPost’s Damon Dahlen ventured to the Upper West Side to photograph members of Ballet Hispánico in the familiar spaces just beyond its front doors. Check out images of Fernandez, Verdecia and other members of the company paying tribute to their neighborhood in the best way they know how: through dance.Ballet Hispánico’s 2017 New York Season at the Joyce Theater will take place April 18-23, featuring “Con Brazos Abiertos” by Michelle Manzanales, “Línea Recta” by Annabelle Lopez Ochoa and “3 Catorce Dieciséis” by Tania Pérez-Salas."

And all I seen was smoke,” she told local WREG TV. Abigail ran to her parents’ bedroom.“She said it was smoky and she could hardly breathe,” Nick Bruce told local KAIT TV. “She said she thought it was hailing outside but when I got up to check, it was the fire that was coming around the outside window.”Turns out the garage was on fire, but the Bruces were able to jump out of the bedroom window and onto the front lawn.The fire department showed up minutes later and extinguished the fire. However, the smoke and soot damaged everything in the house.Everything but their admiration for their lifesaving goat.“He knew what to do and everything,” Abigail told WREG TV. “I think he was special before we got him.”Investigators believe the fire was caused by an electrical problem.The Bruce family is staying at a friend’s home until they can get back on their feet. Speedy is staying in another friend’s barn.Bruce told KAIT TV that he is happy his family is OK since, unlike his home, they are irreplaceable. Abigail also thinks Speedy may be the best birthday present ever.“I’m glad we got it before the fire happened or we wouldn’t be here,” she told the website."

When her agent contacted her again, she told the actress that “Mean Town” wasn’t actually a show, it was an anagram for “Woman Ten.” Turns out, Mackie wasn’t just auditioning for a poorly titled drama or sitcom, she was now in the running to become the newest female companion on “Doctor Who” Season 10. “I was like, riiight, OK, I’m never gonna get that,” the London-born Mackie told The Huffington Post in a phone interview. Long story short, she did. After an initial audition, she performed lines alongside a theatrical Peter Capaldi, the resident Doctor entering into his final season as a time-traveling alien this year. “He’s running pressing buttons and pulling levers, because he knows where everything is in the TARDIS,” Mackie recounted. “And I’m sort of just standing, open-mouthed, looking around in wonder, kind of thinking ― What is going on here? This is the maddest experience of my life. I’ve just had the most intense experience, and I can’t even tell anyone about it.”Secrecy is par for the course when it comes to the BBC show, which ran for 26 seasons between the 1960s and 1980s, only to return in a 2005 revival that’s about to air its Season 10 premiere on BBC America on April 15. But Mackie’s character, Bill Potts, is anything but traditional. According to The Guardian, she’ll be the show’s first openly gay companion, a woman who’s been described as “completely fresh and new,” perhaps due in part to the fact that the actress behind the role has never really watched more than one episode of the show.Check out our entire interview with Mackie, in which we talked about her character’s persona, the pressures of joining the “Doctor Who” family, and what representation on television means to her.I love your character’s name ― Bill. Is there anything behind the name? Is it short for anything?Well, no, not as far as I know. She’s just called Bill! I wondered the same, but I haven’t discovered anything, unless they’ve got big plans for a reveal later on. No, as far as I know, it’s just Bill.Fans have been speculating that Bill is from the ‘80s and that there might be a parallel to a former “Who” companion, Ace ― is any of this true? I’ve read that “Doctor Who” showrunner Steven Moffat has hinted otherwise.She is not from the ‘80s, no. She is very much from now. She’s very much a present-day woman. Kind of a normal young woman, really. Kind of a nod there, in her vintage-inspired outfits, but she’s definitely not from the ‘80s.Is there anything else you can tell us about Bill’s origins that won’t incite utter rage from the BBC?Yeah! In terms of personality, she’s very open and she’s very real. When I read Steven’s script, I was very struck by how fully rounded the character was. Not sort of struck in terms of being surprised by Steven’s writing ― because, I mean, we all know how good that is ― but it was very much more that I felt she was already there. She had a history. She felt like a real person that you would meet. And someone that you’d like. She’s quite open. She’s quite honest ― sometimes to her detriment. She doesn’t necessarily always think things through before saying them. But I don’t do that very well either, so maybe that’s why I related to her. But yeah, she’s quite witty and quite intelligent and very human and driven by her gut and the way she feels about things, which is something that I really liked.Do we know how old she is or where she was born?I mean, she’s about early 20s, I would say. Yeah, that kind of age. Aaand I don’t know if I can say where she’s born. In the U.K.! To be vague.Well, obviously the entire “Doctor Who” universe is filled with a ton of secrecy and a lot of these really really dedicated fans. I saw that kids are already dressing up as your character online. What has your life as a companion been like so far ― even before the show has aired?It’s been kind of a whirlwind. It’s sort of like being welcomed into like the biggest, most enthusiastic family at a family gathering and being introduced to them all at the same time. And, you know, everyone’s got really strong opinions about what it is you’re about to do, which can be a little bit overwhelming at times. But I think, for me, it’s been amazing. It’s such a wonderful thing to be part of a show that means so much to so many people. You know, people relate to “Doctor Who” in such a personal way, which I think is why people have their own personal favorite Doctor, their favorite companion, their favorite monsters, their favorite episodes. It’s a very strong relationship for a lot of people. And it’s been wonderful to be to be welcomed so wholeheartedly into it.Did you do any particular research before you took on the role? Did you brush up on any of the history or any of the fan theories?You know, I didn’t watch much of “Doctor Who” when I was a kid. I didn’t watch any of the feature series ― I think I’ve watched one episode. But obviously you’d have to be living in some type of a hole to not be aware of the show. After getting the job, I said to Steven and [executive producer] Brian [Minchin], “Look, give me the back catalog and let me watch everything.” And they said, “Well, what you’re doing at the moment is great. You’re bringing a really nice sort of freshness to it. And, you know, you experiencing things as Bill is kind of experiencing things seemed to work really well. So don’t watch it!”And also, I kind of felt like as an actor watching someone play what is essentially your role [as a companion] and watching them do it so well, it would be hard not to borrow a little bit here and there, even subconsciously. And I really didn’t want to do that because I thought Bill was supposed to be completely fresh and completely new to this. So I thought it was best not to [watch]. Did Peter Capaldi or some of the other cast and crew members give you any memorable advice during your first moments on set?Peter was great. He gave me a little card and a scented candle for my new flat in Cardiff. It was really sweet. It’s such a big beast of a show, you know, in terms of its its reach and its fan base and all the extra little bits that make up the world of Doctor Who. But he said, “Remember why you’re here. You’re here because you’re really good.” Which was very kind of him to say. “The acting is what you’re here to do ― that’s the main job. We’re here to create this show and everything else is on top. But all of that can be a bit too much sometimes. It can seem like a lot, but if it does, here’s my number. Feel free to have a chat with me about it if anything seems too overwhelming.” Which was very lovely.The trailer for the upcoming “Who” season contains the line, “2017 needs us.” And Peter Capaldi has hinted in interview that while Season 9 began to reflect on the modern world a bit more, he thinks we might see more of that in Season 10. Does this mean we’re going to hear about contemporary politics at all on the show?Ummm, there might be some areas of contemporary politics in this series. Yes, indeed. But not in a very direct way. In a way that is open to interpretation, as all good art that imitates life is. If you know what I mean? Am I being too abstract?I can’t imagine keeping secrets, so I applaud you. On to the next question! One of my favorite “Doctor Who” fan theories claims that the Doctor always regenerates into a face he’s seen before. So, is there any chance the character of Bill is just one giant teaser for your eventual takeover as the Doctor? Would you turn down the role?What, would I turn down the role of Doctor Who? No, I’d be mad to do that, wouldn’t I? Can you imagine if someone was like, “Do you want to be Doctor Who?” And you were like, “Nah, I’m alright. One of the most exciting jobs in television? Nah, you can leave that, actually. I’m over it.” That’s not to say that’s what is going to happen. I mean, who knows?  There’s been loads of discussion about the all-male Doctor roster ― we’ve yet to see a woman tackle the role. What do you make of the show’s track record with representation? I think in terms of representation, this series is doing pretty well from what I’ve seen so far. Hopefully, by the end of the series, we might have another conversation, or you might think the same. But in terms of playing the character of Doctor Who next, hopefully, they get whoever is best for the job, whatever gender or race that may be.You mentioned in a Guardian interview that you didn’t see many people who looked like you on TV growing up. When you think about your role on this show, are you thinking about the fans today who might still feel the same way you did?I think as an actress of color, there’s always that kind of responsibility. And especially in a prime-time, widely reaching show. For me, if even a couple of kids can look at Bill on “Doctor Who” and think, hey, she looks like me, maybe that means there’s more room for me in the world of acting or the world of television or the world of fighting aliens, then that’s a good thing, you know? I think it is important to see people that look like you and to show that there is a place for you in the world. That you do exist and that you are important. But then, that said, you know, I am only playing one person and she’s not supposed to be representative of every person and every young woman of color, because that would be a generalization that we wouldn’t want to make either.“Doctor Who” Season 10 premieres Saturday, April 15 at 9 p.m. ET on BBC America."

But the “one-state” solution Trump and Netanyahu now speak of would not be a democratic bi-national state where Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs have equal rights. Instead, Trump and Netanyahu’s solution would effectively be an apartheid state, where Israel would maintain its control over the Palestinian population indefinitely.While the Obama administration refused to take any concrete actions, such as targeted sanctions, to stop the expansion of settlements, its public criticisms of Israel may have had at least some impact in curbing the extent of their expansion in the occupied territories. But the new administration is abandoning even those criticisms. Trump appears to be rejecting the long-held international consensus that Israeli colonization of the Palestinian West Bank and East Jerusalem is both illegal and an obstacle to peace, and pledged to block any international action to prevent it.This gives particular urgency for peace and human rights activists to challenge U.S. policy toward Israel and Palestine—and given Trump’s unpopularity and the far-right extremism of his stances, it creates an opening to shift the terms of debate.A Bipartisan ConsensusFor years, the United States has been in the contradictory role of being the sole mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the primary military, financial and diplomatic supporter of the more powerful of the two parties. At this point, with the Trump administration effectively endorsing a permanent Israeli occupation, there should no longer even be the pretense that the United States is an “honest broker.”Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization have long recognized Israel within its internationally accepted borders, which encompass 78% of historic Palestine, and have agreed to accept a mini-state comprising only the territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. However, as the remaining Palestinian population centers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank have become surrounded by large Israeli settlement blocs, the creation of a viable contiguous Palestinian state alongside Israel is becoming increasingly problematic.If changing demographics makes the creation of a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel impossible, Palestinians would have no choice but to demand equal rights within a greater Israel. Israelis would then have to decide whether to remain a Jewish state, in which non-Jewish Palestinians no are second-class citizens, or become a truly democratic state, in which both peoples participate in governance on equal footing. They could no longer claim to be both. This reality was recognized by then-Secretary of State John Kerry’s address on Dec. 28, 2016— an address that was strongly denounced by the Israeli government, the Republicans and many congressional Democrats.That even Kerry’s relatively moderate observation was opposed by members of both major U.S. party establishments shouldn’t be surprising.The Republican Party’s 2016 platform not only fails to support the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel, as it had in previous years, it puts the party in opposition to virtually the entire international community by proclaiming Republicans “reject the false notion that Israel is an occupier.” It also insists that Israel “stands out among the nations as a beacon of democracy and humanity,” that “support for Israel is an expression of Americanism,” and that there should be “no daylight between America and Israel.”The platform also declares that the United States should withhold funding from the United Nations, the World Court or any other international authority that attempts to pressure Israel to withdraw or impose any kind of peace settlement.The Trump administration has already put this extreme anti-Palestinian position into action. In early February, the United States blocked the appointment of former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, a pro-Western moderate, to become the UN Secretary General’s Special Envoy to help resolve the conflict in Libya—simply because he was Palestinian.Ironically, this rightward shift in U.S. policy comes at a time when public opinion has never been more moderate. This is an area where the Democratic Party could take some leadership in distinguishing itself from Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress on a key foreign policy issue. However, it appears unlikely that this will happen any time soon.For example, the 2016 Democratic Party platform—while supporting the concept of a two-state solution in theory—insists it could only come on Israeli terms through direct negotiations, ignoring how the gross asymmetry in power between the occupying power and those under occupation provides little incentive for Israel’s right-wing government to compromise. Not only did the platform refuse to oppose or even acknowledge the occupation and settlements, it criticized the United Nations and civil society movements for their efforts to stop them, while praising Israel’s supposed commitment to “equality, tolerance and pluralism.”There is probably no issue where elected Democratic Party officials take positions so far to the right of their constituents. Polls show most Democrats believe the United States should impose sanctions or even more strenuous measures against Israel to stop the expansion of illegal settlements. Yet when Obama refused to veto a mildly worded and largely symbolic UN Security Council resolution critical of Israel’s colonization drive, most congressional Democrats voted for a resolution criticizing the president. A majority of rank-and-file Democrats believe the United States should support the United Nations formally recognizing the State of Palestine, but the overwhelming majority of Congressional Democrats have gone on record insisting the United States should veto such a measure.In fact, Democrats in Congress have joined bipartisan majorities this past year passing a series of bills and resolutions defining “Israel” as including “territories controlled by Israel.” Such a legal redefinition of what constitutes “Israel” has in large part been designed to make it more difficult to oppose the Israeli occupation or colonization of the West Bank, such as through boycotting or even simply labeling products produced in illegal settlements.The list goes on: Eighty percent of Democratic voters believe the United States should at least be neutral (some even said the U.S. should favor Palestinians) in the peace process, yet the voting records and statements of congressional Democrats near-universally favor Israel. Less than one-third of registered Democrats believed that Israel’s actions during the 2014 war on Gaza were justified, yet congressional Democrats joined Republicans in backing a series of resolutions by unanimous consent giving unconditional support for the Israeli offensive.A number of state legislatures, with Democratic support, have passed bills punishing companies which refuse to do business with Israeli settlements or the Israeli military.This disconnect between the Democratic rank-and-file and their elected leadership is growing, particularly given that younger Americans take a far more critical, or at least more balanced, view of Israel than older Americans. The movement on college campuses in support for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against the Israeli occupation has support comparable to similar campaigns on South Africa thirty years ago, yet Democrats in both Washington and in state capitols have joined Republicans in denouncing BDS as “anti-Semitic,” alienating many up-and-coming activists whose support they will need in future campaigns.Going on OffenseAs with Vietnam, Central America, the nuclear arms race, South Africa, East Timor and Iraq, this could simply be another case where there is a lag time between when anti-war/pro-human rights sentiments first take hold among rank-and-file Democrats and when these sentiments lead to changing Democratic Party policy, and eventually U.S. policy. So, it should be possible to eventually force the Democratic Party to support a policy on Israel/Palestine more consistent with human rights and international law. Indeed, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign shattered the myth that a serious Democratic presidential candidate could not take a more balanced stance on Israel and Palestine.Israel will not end its occupation, colonization, and repression in the Palestinian territories as long as it continues to receive unconditional military, financial and diplomatic support from the United States. Washington will not end its military, financial and diplomatic support for the Israeli government as long as congressional Democrats continue to support the administration’s right-wing policies.And the Democrats will not end their support for the administration’s policies until progressives, peace activists and human right advocates make ending the Israeli occupation a priority. These groups could counter the perceived clout of the pro-Israel lobby and pro-occupation campaign contributors by forming a committed anti-occupation bloc dedicated to opposing members of Congress and candidates for federal office who support the Israeli occupation and related violations of international humanitarian law.Unfortunately, some progressive organizations have continued to endorse even some of the most hardline Democratic supporters of Israel’s right-wing government, effectively overlooking the sort of hawkish foreign policy positions that would have been seen as unacceptable during prior struggles against U.S. policy in Iraq, Central America and elsewhere.Targeting anti-Palestinian candidates is not a single-issue approach. Rather, it is a matter of consistency, of applying progressive principles of human rights and international law in Israel and Palestine in the same way that earlier like-minded activists approached Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador, South Africa and East Timor. In the 1980s, for example, organizers protested the offices of “Death Squad Democrats” who supported Reagan's polices in Central America. Today, any political office-holder or candidate who advocates unconditional support for a right-wing government engaged in a persistent pattern of gross and systematic violations of human rights and international law should not be considered “progressive except Palestine,” as some describe them. They aren’t progressive, period, and must either be convinced to change or be replaced.The way to create such a movement is to avoid getting bogged down in ideological debates over the nature of Zionism or about conflicting historical narratives or past atrocities, but to focus on human rights and international law. Most Americans are sympathetic toward these normative values of peace and justice, and in past struggles they’ve proven a powerful tool. Whether the solution should be one state or two is a legitimate question, but whatever the answer, the movement must emphasize the need to recognize that both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs have equal rights that must be acknowledged and defended.It should no longer be acceptable for pro-Democratic groups to avoid addressing Israel/Palestine because it is supposedly “complicated.” Instead the movement can emphasize that the situation is not exceptional, that this is yet another case of the United States aiding and abetting a repressive right-wing ally engaging in gross and systematic violations of international legal norms.By emphasizing the same kind of pro-peace and pro-human rights agenda that resulted in stopping U.S. support for other repressive governments and occupations, movements like BDS are more likely to be understood and accepted by the mainstream as advancing a consistent agenda for peace and justice—and thus more likely they can force a change in U.S. policy.While allegations that progressives unfairly “single out” Israel are often unfounded, a broader anti-militarist and pro-human rights campaign might include calling for an end to U.S. arms transfers to Israel, Saudi Arabia and all governments that violate human rights. It could do more to challenge those elements of the far Left who really do rationalize human rights abuses by perceived “anti-imperialist” actors like Syria. And it could expand the BDS campaign to include Morocco’s occupation of Western Sahara, the only other case of a UN-recognized non-self-governing country suffering under a foreign belligerent occupation.While a plethora of other urgent issues brought to the fore by Trump administration policies could distract activists from the plight of the Palestinians, the striking similarities between Trump and Netanyahu—discriminatory practices towards Muslims, the defense of war crimes in the name of fighting terrorism, close ties to the religious right, militarism, ultra-nationalism, intolerance of dissent, opposition to the United Nations and more—could help build broader alliances against their two administrations.As a result, the coming to power of the most right-wing government in modern American history might paradoxically allow for Americans to see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a new light. The starkness of Trump’s policies could break down the bipartisan consensus in support of the occupation and end the political marginalization of pro-Palestinian activists, drawing attention to the underlying racism of denying a conquered people their fundamental rights. And a renewed peace movement could draw on the tradition of past foreign policy struggles to paint the conflict in simpler terms: Those who support peace, human rights, international law and self-determination versus those who do not."
48,THE WORLDPOST,Syria Will Not Survive Conflict Between Russia And The United States,"Abbas Kadhim, ContributorSenior Foreign Policy Fellow, FPI-SAIS, Johns Hopkins University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rhetoric-aside-us-russian-cooperation-is-the-only_us_58f0e99ee4b048372700d7a9,A seeming proxy war between the two countries would leave Syria in shambles.,2017-04-14,"<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (R) and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L), Moscow, Russia. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58f0ea572600004700c45b71.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States is slowly reversing its stated policy toward Syria from a careful tolerance of Russia’s effort to keep President Bashar al-Assad in power, at least for the short term, to a combination of restricted missile attack and a call for his removal. At the heart of this sudden change was the attack on a terrorist-held area with chemical weapons that left many casualties among innocent civilians. Between the U.S. affirmation of Assad’s culpability for the attack and Syria’s denial, and in the absence of credible investigation, we will have to wait for a long time before we know what actually took place and who was responsible for this atrocious war crime. While the Syrian regime has demonstrated its will to use great brutality against opponents, without regard for innocent civilians being caught in the crossfire, it is a valid question to ask: “Why would Assad provoke the U.S. and the international community shortly after the U.S. administration stated that his removal from power was not a priority?”Given the level of commitment Russia is making to its Syrian allies, the U.S. has a fine calculation to make. It is very hard to claim that vital U.S. interests in Syria are at stake and the defense of these interests justifies a showdown with Russia in the Middle East. In fact, U.S. policy in Syria has been fine-tuned to the interests of its regional allies: Israel and some members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), most particularly Saudi Arabia. Israel’s interest is to ensure that the situation in Syria does not disintegrate into a permanent chaos that would threaten its security. Although Israel has not counted the Assads among its friends, the Syrian border has not been an active threat to Israel since the 1973 war. But some of the possible alternatives to Assad may well be in the future, if given a chance. Saudi Arabia and some like-minded GCC states have been more interested in ousting President Assad as a means to curb Iranian westward expansion. Their miscalculated involvement in the Syrian revolt and their financing and arming certain extremist elements of the rebellion was detrimental to Syria’s chances of replicating the Tunisian and Egyptian experiences. Now, they want the U.S. to pick up the pieces.Russia, on the other hand is determined not to lose an ally with whom it maintained a long history of relations. In fact, after the collapse of Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq, Syria became Russia’s most valuable country to have access and geo-strategic relevance in the region. From this viewpoint, Russia’s national interests in Syria are stronger, and more immediate, than the U.S. interests, which are secondary at best. And just like the U.S. has friends and allies, who are keeping their hands very busy in Syria, so does Russia. Iran is a strong ally of Russia and is a major player in Syria. The Iranians view the survival of President Assad as a vital national security interest and a major part of their plan to project their power and influence all the way to the Mediterranean.In addition to their clash of interests, there remains the great question for the United States and Russia: How would Syria look the morning after President Assad leaves power by force or voluntarily?For Russia, this question is already answered by the long-standing philosophy of its foreign policy. Russia deals with the governments as they are and expresses no interest in molding them into a preferred form. It does not make a difference to the Russians if the government is a democracy or an authoritarian regime as long as it holds a seat in the United Nations. The U.S., on the contrary, has a long-standing foreign policy of promoting democratization and it has put this policy into action in many places, albeit often unsuccessfully. Also, this policy has been challenged by a double-standard of considering some despots as “more equal than others.”The problem in Syria is that President Assad, despite his brutality, is challenged by people whose atrocities and the ideologies they espouse are more brutal and exceedingly dangerous for the region at large. It is unwise to assume that in every conflict there is a good side and a bad side. In the case of Syria, both sides are bad, and supporting either camp is morally repugnant. If the U.S. and Russia continue to back the opposite sides, there will be no winner in the foreseeable future and the only guaranteed result will be more torment to the innocent civilians who are held hostage by the warring parties. The only possible solution for this crisis is a political one, and this political solution can only be accomplished by the coordination and cooperation of Russia and the United States, within the legal framework of a United Nations Security Council mandate.Abbas Kadhim is a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Institute, School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University.

Or at least, not one about the largest colonies of Gentoo penguins in Antarctica. But a new study released today in the journal Nature Communications suggests that they stumbled upon a real caper.Roberts and company went to Antarctica to collect lake bed sediments, which give us regional insights into the historical impacts of climate change.“We know the broader scale picture of past climate change, say the last 10 or 12,000 years on a global basis, based on a lot of the ice core records,” said Roberts. “But a lot of the impacts that might happen in certain places are kind of regional changes. Because we have a lot more lakes than ice sheets in a lot of areas, we’re able to reconstruct the temperatures from a lot more places with techniques such as this.”While analyzing lake sediments from Antarctica’s Ardley Island, they stumbled upon an unexpected bounty: penguin bones. “The original purpose of the study wasn’t to go there to find the history of the penguin colony on Ardley Island, it was for relative sea level change,” said Roberts. “But having found the bones and having found some very disparate patterns of geochemistry in the core sample, we thought it’d be an interesting thing to investigate a bit further.”cientists had known for a while that Gentoo penguins, which have lived on Ardley Island for 6,700 years, have periodically experienced sharp population declines. Gentoo penguins, which currently number around 5,000 pairs on Ardley Island, are identifiable from other penguins by a white patch on their black feathers that begins behind their eye and wraps around, connecting behind the crown. Similarly, while other Antarctic penguins like the Adélie spend much of their time on frozen pieces of Antarctic sea ice, the Gentoo penguins—which are the northernmost Antarctic penguins—spend much of their time on dry land.Historical records show that the Gentoo population has declined precipitously five times over the past 6,700 years. But not all of the declines were correlated with climate changes and broader environmental effects. The lake sediment provided a much-needed clue.Roughly 62 miles southeast of Ardley Island lies the ominously-named Deception Island — so called because from the outside it looks like a normal island, but slip through a passageway into its interior and you’ll discover that it’s actually a ring. The inner waterway is in fact the flooded caldera of a large, active volcano.The researcher’s geochemical analyses of the lake sediment sample, which included a new kind of biological marking technique to reconstruct the changes through time — and which looked at the varying concentration of guano or penguin poop and volcanic ash — helped uncover a tragic truth: each time Deception Island’s volcano had a sizable eruption, the resulting fallout was enough to almost completely wipe out Ardley Island’s penguin population.“This study reveals the severe impact volcanic eruptions can have on penguins, and just how difficult it can be for a colony to fully recover,” Claire Waluda, a penguin ecologist for the British Antarctic Survey, said in a statement. “An eruption can bury penguin chicks in abrasive and toxic ash, and whilst the adults can swim away, the chicks may be too young to survive in the freezing waters. Suitable nesting sites can also be buried, and may remain uninhabitable for hundreds of years.”Exactly how the ash disrupts their population, what happens to the penguins, and why it takes between 400 and 800 years for their numbers to rebound are subjects for future research. But the study is a sobering reminder of how seemingly distant events can have catastrophic effects that linger for centuries. And this unfortunate past might not stay buried: the penguin populations wiped out by historical eruptions were about the same size as the one that exists today, and the volcano is still active.This article originally appeared on Popular Science."

These youngsters, who come from immigrant communities in Florida, told Mayor Gimenez that their wish for the holidays was that he protect their families from detainment and possible deportation.In late January, Mayor Gimenez caved in to Donald Trump’s executive order threatening to strip funding from “sanctuary cities” effectively allowing county jails to indefinitely hold immigrants for ICE to deport. The same group of children went back to the Mayor’s office to tell him that he had broken their hearts by putting them at risk of being separated from their families.Now, these children are speaking up even louder and taking their message to the President himself. Instead of enjoying their spring break like so many children nationwide, these young activists joined a press conference Monday in Downtown Miami, where they delivered a failing report card to Mayor Gimenez for following Trump’s anti-immigrant policies. Then about 40 children boarded a bus to Washington D.C. to join with young people from D.C., New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and other places nationwide for a demonstration Thursday in front of the White House.“I want to send a message to Donald Trump that we belong together. We’re all connected and we should stick up for each other,” said Yoana, who is a 13 year-old from Homestead, Florida. “That’s why we’re going to the White House. We have to stand up for each other. For me, this is an opportunity to show my mom how much I love her. She works hard in the fields every day to be able to feed us. Protecting her from Trump is the least I can do.”These children are the collateral damage that comes from the anti-family immigration policies being pushed by the Trump administration, which is focused on more deportations, family separation, lack of investment in schools and the criminalization of communities. All these actions by the administration put our children and their families under threat more than ever before.When I was growing up, I looked towards my parents whenever I felt scared or uncertain. However, for undocumented families, the roles of parent and child can be reversed, especially when the children are U.S. citizens. These children live with the fear that their parents will be taken away from them. Instead of enjoying their childhood, these inhumane immigration policies rob them of their innocence.A report by the Southern Poverty Law Center shows that the children of immigrant families fear the possibility of being separated from their families and also experience bullying and harassment by other students, leading to stress and a decline in performance at school.Leah, who is 11 from Miami and whose mother is a domestic worker facing a deportation order, knows that fear all too well.“I live with the fear of being separated from my mother every day,” she said while rallying outside of the White House. “It is like when somebody you care about can die at any moment, why can’t I just enjoy being a kid? I cannot sleep or do my homework. All I can think about is my mother being taken away from me. I am so worried about my life.”Leah might be 11 years old, but she is one of the country’s most determined immigration advocates. When she was 10, Leah asked her fifth grade teacher for permission to organize her class and eventually got her classmates to write twenty two letters to immigrant children who are being detained at immigration detention facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania.Children should not have to feel the weight of the world on their shoulders because of the threat of being separated from their family. It’s unfortunate that our inhumane immigration system forces children like Leah, who will grow up seeing her parents work so hard yet suffer so much and so needlessly, have the burden of having to step up to protect their families.Thomas Kennedy is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change."

But for someone who supports a family of three on the minimum wage, Tax Day is something else: it’s an annual reminder that I need taxpayer dollars just to survive.That’s why this Tax Day, I’ll be travelling to Washington D.C. to join thousands of others in a historic march on the U.S. Capitol to demand an end to the rigged tax system that buoys the wealthy and corporations, but keeps working people down.I’ve worked in the fast-food industry for six years, mostly at Wendy’s. I wake up early to get into the store by 7 am, unpack the day’s food, and man the drive-thru for hours at a time. Yet when I come home to my grandma and my seven-month-old son, Noah, after a 40-hour week, I have hardly anything to show for it. I want to be able to stand on my own two feet, but on my bi-weekly paycheck of $200, it’s impossible. I’m forced to turn to food stamps and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children to feed my family.Noah is my second child. I was forced to give my first up for adoption because my Wendy’s salary was so low that I couldn’t feed us both. The second time I got pregnant, I couldn’t bear the thought of losing another child. I took six weeks of unpaid leave to care for Noah and then I was back at Wendy’s — on my feet all day serving customers and on my feet all night caring for Noah. I thought my hard work would eventually be recognized with a raise, but nothing changed.While my low wages have forced me to give up a child and rely on public assistance, Wendy’s rakes in many millions a year in profits. Studies even show that the industry has some of the worst pay disparity, with fast-food CEOs earning on average nearly $24 million in 2013.Fast-food companies can afford to pay workers $15/hour ― but they choose not to because they know taxpayers will pick up the tab. National brands like McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s keep loyal, hard-working employees like me on minimum wage, forcing us to turn to public assistance for food, shelter, healthcare and more. Low wages in the fast-food industry cost taxpayers $7 billion a year in public assistance. Across the economy, working families like mine account for more than three-quarter of public assistance recipients, at a cost of more than $150 billion a year to taxpayers.It’s unfair not only to the workers but also to taxpayers.For the past two years, I’ve been a leader in the Fight for $15 – the movement for $15/hour and union rights – in Richmond. With my fellow workers I’ve walked off the job and marched in the street to make sure that everyone from President Trump to wealthy corporations hear our demand for change.It’s no secret the system is rigged against working people. But I also believe we can change the system; America can work for the majority of us – not just the wealthy few. The thousands of people turning out to protest on Saturday confirms that by standing together and speaking out, we can change our fates and win a wage that lets us get off public assistance and support our families. We can force companies and politicians to do the right thing. We can win.Priscilla Evans, 25, is Wendy’s worker from Richmond, Virginia."

Twenty-four days later on November 26, Michael and Kristen McCloy became parents to Lucas, Emalyn and Colton. And on December 16, Jeri and Aaron Wright welcomed Finn, Beckett and Oliver. Paul recently reunited with all three sets of triplets for a baseball-themed photo shoot, as there were enough babies to fill the nine fielding positions in baseball.“Missouri Baptist (or MoBap, as our community often refer to us as) is a very team-oriented hospital and we love our Cardinals in St. Louis,” Paul told The Huffington Post. “So when someone said, ‘hey, that’s enough babies for a baseball team,’ we knew it was something special and the perfect way to celebrate Opening Day, since the moms had really created a team spirit with each other.”As an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk births and multiples, Paul has seen his fair share of triplets ― normally one set every other month at the hospital. But 2016 was record-setting.“To have three sets of triplets born so close together was something truly unique for both me and the team in the Missouri Baptist Childbirth Center’s NICU,” he said, adding, “Not to mention, we had another set born in January ― they are the ‘bull pen’ of our baseball team.”Multiples pose a higher risk for complications during pregnancy, birth and in the early postpartum weeks, but these triplets beat the odds. All nine babies and three mothers are healthy and home with their families now. Still, there were some challenges, which brought the three mothers together. “Many moms who are pregnant with multiples are hospitalized for extended periods of time, which can make them feel isolated,” Paul told HuffPost. “All three of these moms met during their pregnancies and instantly connected over their shared experiences. They set goals together and all had the same mission to get to as close to 34 or 35 weeks as possible to deliver.”He added, “That bond grew through visits to the hospital during each other’s bed rests and continued during their babies’ time in the NICU. They were sharing challenges, leaning on each other for support and celebrating milestones.”The doctor said the photo shoot was a sort of reunion for the Kennedy, McCloy and Wright families and also gave them a chance to reconnect with their nurses. “We have so many MoBap moms who stay in touch with their nurses through birthday cards or attending our annual NICU reunion,” he said. “It says a lot about the people who provide care here and reinforces just how special MoBap is.”Paul said the NICU and childbirth center employees are glad to see the photo shoot and story have taken off. He hopes people who read about the triplets see that Missouri Baptist is a special place with compassionate caregivers who act as “coaches,” “trainers” and “cheerleaders,” too. Said the doctor, “It takes teamwork and camaraderie to get through challenging times, and hospital experiences are no different.”"

They were sharing challenges, leaning on each other for support and celebrating milestones.”The doctor said the photo shoot was a sort of reunion for the Kennedy, McCloy and Wright families and also gave them a chance to reconnect with their nurses. “We have so many MoBap moms who stay in touch with their nurses through birthday cards or attending our annual NICU reunion,” he said. “It says a lot about the people who provide care here and reinforces just how special MoBap is.”Paul said the NICU and childbirth center employees are glad to see the photo shoot and story have taken off. He hopes people who read about the triplets see that Missouri Baptist is a special place with compassionate caregivers who act as “coaches,” “trainers” and “cheerleaders,” too. Said the doctor, “It takes teamwork and camaraderie to get through challenging times, and hospital experiences are no different.”"

In their year-and-a-half lifespans, they drew only a few headlines, no debates on the House floor, no protests in the streets.The next month there was no such silence in Canada.The author of another anti-Islamophobia resolution stood before the House of Commons in Ottawa and read aloud a sampling of the thousands of bigoted messages and death threats she’d received online.“We will burn down your mosques, draper head Muslim,” said one message read by Iqra Khalid, a member of the Liberal Party who represents an Ontario district. Khalid is a Muslim who was born in Pakistan and immigrated to Canada as a child.“Kill her and be done with it,” read another message. “I agree, she is here to kill us. She is sick, and needs to be deported.”“I’m not going to help them shoot you, I’m going to be there to film you on the ground crying,” said another.The messages didn’t exactly feel like empty threats. Just a month before, a white supremacist had opened fire on a mosque in Quebec, killing six people praying there. As she read the messages, Khalid politely replaced curse words by saying “blank.”“Blank you gently with a chainsaw, you camel-humping terrorist incubator blank.” “Shoot this blank.”The horrifying messages, sent to Khalid after she introduced the M-103 resolution in the House of Commons, seemed to prove its premise: that anti-Muslim hate in Canada was real and scary, and that the government needed to take a stand.M-103 called on all members of Parliament to condemn Islamophobia, collect information about hate crimes, and create a committee to investigate how best to combat religious discrimination in Canada. It was not a bill and did not create a new law.Still, its introduction precipitated heated debates, with some Conservative Party lawmakers taking issue with the word “Islamophobia” itself and arguing that the resolution would somehow stifle free speech.“If I think of myself, I am afraid that if ISIS jihadists came over, they might cut my head off and rape me. Is that Islamophobia?” Conservative MP Marilyn Gladu said. “I do not know.”Gladu and other Conservatives pushed for a different resolution, one that condemned all forms of bigotry.Khalid defined Islamophobia clearly for the House as “the irrational hate of Muslims that leads to discrimination.” Liberal MP Mélanie Joly, the minister of Canadian heritage, called the Conservatives’ new resolution “weakened and watered down.”“The Conservatives have brought this motion forward in a cynical attempt to serve their political purposes and avoid addressing the real issue concerning Islamophobia,” Joly said.Anti-Muslim websites were apoplectic over M-103, claiming that it would both criminalize criticism of Islam and lead to the implementation of Sharia law in Canada. Such falsehoods fueled tense anti-M-103 protests across the country.Meanwhile, the press churned out over 1,000 news articles about the resolution in the space of just a few months, according to a search on Lexis-Nexis.Finally, in March, the House of Commons, led by its Liberal majority, passed M-103 by a vote of 201 to 91. Although it was still just a nonbinding resolution, Khalid had accomplished something significant: a big, messy, very public discussion about Islamophobia in Canada.That’s the discussion that former Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.) wanted here in the United States. Honda, who lost his bid for re-election in November, was a co-sponsor of House Resolution 569, which denounced “in the strongest terms the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim.”He chose to sponsor the resolution out of personal experience. He and his family were among some 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry incarcerated in so-called internment camps during World War II, where they lived behind barbed wire under the watch of armed guards.Honda argued last year that what had happened to his family “could happen again” — this time to Muslim Americans, who were increasingly scapegoated and targeted for hateful speech in the wake of the 2015 terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Hate crimes against Muslims rose 67 percent in 2015. While the FBI hasn’t released hate crime statistics for 2016 yet, media reports show Muslims are still being targeted.Honda was especially horrified in November, when Carl Higbie, a retired Navy SEAL and prominent surrogate for then President-elect Donald Trump, cited the World War II prison camps as “precedent” for a Muslim registry ― which was one of Trump’s campaign proposals.The important lesson of his family’s story, Honda told The Huffington Post, is that “what they did to us was unconstitutional and they made it legal.” HR 569, he said, could have sparked “a debate about Islamophobia in the bright sunlight” ― like M-103 did in Canada ― and might have been a step toward defending Muslim Americans from future persecution.Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) also had an anti-Islamophobia resolution ― HR 413 ― die in the House at the end of the last Congress. HR 413 sought to recognize and honor “the victims of hate crimes of Islamophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.” It specifically cited nine murders of Muslims or those perceived to be Muslim in the five weeks after 9/11.In a statement to HuffPost this week, Johnson said she wrote HR 413 as a rebuke to years of Islamophobic speech and government policy since the U.S. launched its “War on Terror.”“A general climate of fear and anger toward Muslims and those who appear to be Muslim was fomented,” Johnson said. “Politicians kept using [such] terms as ‘Islamic jihadism’ in their speeches. This climate of fear has manifested itself for the past 16 years in institutional policies that view American Muslims as a threat. This climate of fear is unjust.”She also said her Muslim constituents are worried.“There is a vibrant, active Muslim community in my congressional district and not a day passes that I don’t hear from Muslim American constituents in North Texas about their concerns, fears or well-being for themselves or their families,” Johnson said.Half of all resolutions introduced in the House of Representatives are never passed, many falling between the cracks during a busy legislative schedule. And the two anti-Islamophobia resolutions in the 114th Congress faced an especially uphill battle: They were introduced and sponsored by Democrats in a Republican-controlled chamber.Still, resolutions condemning hate and violence against millions of Americans would seem like an easy “yes” vote for any member of Congress.Robert McCaw, national government affairs director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, would put the blame in part on the rise of Trump.“The fear among Republicans,” McCaw told HuffPost last year, “is that if they stand up to Islamophobia, they are going to be challenged by the 70 percent of the GOP that wants to ban Muslims entering the U.S.” ― another one of Trump’s campaign proposals. “There’s a lack of moral backbone in the Republican Party to stand up to Islamophobia and that’s what needs to be addressed,” he said.The failure of the two resolutions to even get out of committee suggests how deeply anti-Muslim sentiment is entrenched in the House, with or without Trump. Among the committee members responsible for denying the resolutions a vote were three of the most Islamophobic congressmen: Reps. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Steve King (R-Iowa) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas).Franks once endorsed a virulently anti-Muslim film titled “The Third Jihad: Radical Islam’s Vision for America” and spoke at a conference called “The Enemy of Freedom: Islam.”Gohmert once claimed that Muslim terrorists were sending pregnant women to the U.S. to give birth to “future terrorists” who would “help destroy our way of life.”And King ― who recently made headlines for tweeting a white nationalist message ― has said that the government should spy on mosques and that Muslims should have to renounce Sharia before entering the U.S.“I don’t know if we as a nation are at the point yet where we’ll have a [Congress] condemning Islamophobia,” McCaw said this week. “America right now is facing its highest uptick of hate crimes in years, and we have a presidency unwilling to address its own anti-Muslim bias or the hate crimes happening on the streets,” he added.While Canada transitioned from a Conservative government under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper to a Liberal one under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in its last federal election, America did essentially the opposite.“The resolution in Canada addresses the systemic anti-Muslim bias that was seen to culminate in the Harper government,” McCaw said, “and under Trudeau’s leadership, the Canadian people are acknowledging the harmful effects of Islamophobia in their society.”McCaw sees one bright spot in Congress with the April 5 passage of Senate Resolution 518, which condemns all hate crimes targeting “religious, racial, and ethnic minorities,” including Muslims. It also calls on federal law enforcement to expedite hate crime investigations.“So while we haven’t seen individual resolutions singling out Islamophobia passing Congress, we have seen resolutions against all forms of hate,” he said.If a measure like that can find bipartisan support and get adopted, McCaw said, maybe “there is hope” for other legislation to combat Islamophobia.Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), who co-sponsored HR 569 last year with Honda, told HuffPost recently that he plans to reintroduce that resolution sometime this year. Last month in his district, a Muslim family returned home to find a Quran destroyed and “FUCK MUSLIMS” written on the wall. Rep. Johnson said she also plans to reintroduce HR 413 this year. Last month at the University of Texas in Dallas, a few miles from Johnson’s district, someone dumped Qurans in a campus toilet. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

Two pandas arrived Wednesday from China to stay at the Ouwehands Dierenpark zoo in the town of Rhenen, located in the province of Utrecht. The zoo has been requesting a pair of pandas from China for 16 years, and finally got permission to host the animals, Xing Ya and Wu Wen, from the Chinese government, according to Ouwehands Dierenpark’s website. China’s program of sending pandas to other nations is often called “panda diplomacy,” which we guess makes this pair panda diplomats.This particular agreement was reached in October 2015, but the zoo wasn’t given an official green light until March after an inspection of the facilities. The pandas’ first night in their new home went well, according to a news release from the zoo. They’ll have to stay in quarantine for a few weeks, but will soon be living in the laps of luxury. Xing Ya and Wu Wen are two incredibly lucky animals who will be enjoying their Dutch stay in a £7 million (about $7.4 million) compound built in a traditional Chinese style. During their fifteen-year stay, the hope is that the pair will feel at home enough to mate and have little panda cubs, according to Dutch News. Panda pregnancy is a big deal, and pretty rare. According to the World Wide Fund, which uses a panda as its logo, the bears produce one cub every two years. And that’s only if the mama bears get pregnant all. Female pandas only ovulate once every mating season, which is March to May.“The Chinese government has put in 30 years of hard work in pandas—[they are] not going to let the panda go extinct,” Dr. M. Sanjayan, senior scientist at Conservation International told National Geographic. Panda cubs are not only absolutely adorable, they’re also crucial to keeping their species alive. Pandas, widely considered a symbol of wildlife conservation, were taken off the endangered species list in September 2016.Hopefully, their very expensive new home will be conducive to a little panda romance, so that Xing Ya and Wu Wen can keep our favorite type of bear alive and well. This story has been updated to clarify that the Netherlands zoo is located in the province of Utrecht, not the city. The zoo is in the town of Rhenen."

While Erdogan and the ruling AK Party waged a fervent, months-long campaign to push a “yes” result, Sunday’s vote did not yield a decisive victory but instead highlighted stark divisions in the country. With nearly all ballots opened, Erdogan’s supporters took home 51.3 percent of the vote, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. But members of the opposition on Sunday night demanded a recount, blasting a last-minute decision by the electoral commission to accept unstamped ballots as valid votes. The changes to the constitution will have wide-ranging effects, such as increasing the number of seats in Parliament, but the greatest change is the powers granted to the president. Erdogan will be head of the executive and of the state, doing away with the role of prime minister. He can dismiss Parliament, call a state of emergency, appoint ministers and judges ― all without approval from lawmakers. The constitutional changes also include a provision that the president will be eligible to hold office for two five-year terms. Turkey has elections scheduled in two years, which means that Erdogan could be in power until 2029. Turkey has been mired in turmoil since an attempted coup last year failed to topple Erdogan, and the government continues to crack down on perceived dissent in public and private institutions in its aftermath. There is also a resurgent conflict between Kurdistan Worker’s Party (PKK) militants and the government, which has led to rebel bombings and harsh reprisals from authorities. Erdogan argued that an executive presidency through a new constitution will provide the reform that Turkey’s often gridlocked political system needs, as well as bring about more stability. Throughout the campaign, Erdogan also tried to drum up nationalist support by pushing a narrative that Turkey is taking a stand against other nations seeking to vilify it ― a tactic that included him accusing Dutch and German governments of Nazism during a diplomatic spat last month. The political situation in Turkey has changed significantly since the 2016 coup attempt, which Erdogan blames on exiled U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. In an attempt to remove dissent, Turkish authorities have fired or imprisoned tens of thousands of people, including academics, journalists and members of the armed forces. At least 40,000 teachers alone have been removed from their posts for allegedly supporting Gulen. Political opposition parties have also been targeted. The pro-Kurdish HDP, which won a surprising number of seats in the 2015 elections, has had many of its prominent members arrested on vague charges. Amid the government’s crackdown, Sunday’s vote had become less a referendum on constitutional reforms and more about Erdogan himself. In past years, a number of opposition parties had backed the idea of constitutional reform to remedy the country’s fractious coalition governments ― but as Erdogan grew more authoritarian and the new constitution focused heavily on the presidency, there was strong resistance against the changes. Amid the political crackdown, however, many of Erdogan’s political opponents worried about reprisal if they were to speak out too forcefully against reforms. And in the end, the opposition campaign was unable to rival the strong push from Erdogan and the AKP. “Against insurmountable odds, complete blanket coverage of the ‘yes’ campaign, there is stiff resistance to this among the Turkish population,” said Aaron Stein, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, in the days leading up to the vote.Even though the president has become increasingly repressive and has moved toward illiberal government, Erdogan still commands huge support.But Sundays’ vote has left the country deeply divided. Voters in Turkey’s three biggest cities, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, appeared to have narrowly rejected the referendum. Residents of several Istanbul neighborhoods on Sunday night banged pots and pans from their windows to protests Erdogan’s claims of victory. Erdogan is no longer counting on a wide range of voters to back his presidency, Stein explained. Instead, he relies on a loyal base of conservative supporters and some elements of the far-right. “[Erdogan’s] weakness is that he now relies entirely on political polarization for popularity,” Stein said. “It’s no longer consensus-building across different factions in Turkey. It is a very right-wing, nationalist base that supports him.”This story was updated throughout to reflect the results of Sunday’s vote. "

It is a very right-wing, nationalist base that supports him.”This story was updated throughout to reflect the results of Sunday’s vote. "

Malnourished children under five years are especially vulnerable.Already 25,424 infected people have been identified since the start of the year, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said by email, adding: “These numbers are projected to increase to 50,000 by summer.”The case fatality rate for the disease, spread by contaminated food or water, is already 2.1 percent in Somalia, twice the emergency threshold, he said. At least 524 deaths have been recorded.Cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration solution. Severe cases will need rapid treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, according to the WHO.Death rates among Somalis infected with cholera now reach 14.1 percent in Middle Juba and 5.1 percent in Bakool, U.N. spokesman Jens Laerke told a news briefing.“We still have 2.9 million people in level 3 and 4, level 4 being the step just before we declare a famine,” Laerke said, referring to the U.N. classification. “So almost 3 million in those critical and crisis emergency levels.”The center of cholera outbreak is Baidoa, David Akopyan, U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) deputy country director for Somalia, told the briefing by telephone from the capital Mogadishu.Thirteen of Somalia’s 18 regions are affected, he said.Some 500,000 Somalis have been internally displaced, many in search of water, as well as some 3 million pastoralists who have lost 70 percent of their livestock due to drought, he said.Akopyan, asked about famine, replied: “We are not exactly there, the fear is that in two months if things are not scaled up we will get there ... Hopefully famine will be prevented.”"

You walked away while I was speaking. ...

He went on to advocate for state-managed health care programs and so-called high-risk pools, prompting someone in the crowd to yell incredulously, “Are you in a high-risk pool?”The congressman’s dismissal of Christine’s characterization of him prompted a response from another woman. “I’m really getting tired of you guys treating us like we don’t have eyes, and ears, and that we can’t think for ourselves,” she said. “For you to stand here and treat her like she didn’t see is a real insult.”Even some conservative members of the at-capacity crowd came with sharpened questions.One man, who self-identified as a Republican who had voted for Lamborn, pressed the representative on his logic regarding tax cuts for millionaires. “Tax cuts should go to whoever pays taxes,” the congressman replied. “If you’re not paying taxes … a tax cut may not help you.”The man continued to press Lamborn. “Are you wiling to stand on the floor of the House of Representatives and call on the president to release his taxes?” he added, as the crowd cheered. “I’m not happy telling the IRS to go after people,” Lamborn said. A crowd of about 50 people gathered outside the venue as well, expressing displeasure that they weren’t permitted into the full meeting and also that it had been held in such a small space at such an inconvenient time.

A passerby captured the disturbing scene on video, leading to public outcry even from the mayor.The incident occurred in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday. Only two weeks earlier, the white officer with the heavy step had managed to avoid charges related to fatally shooting a black man in 2016, local 10 TV News reported.Columbus Officer Zachary Rosen was responding to a report of a discharged firearm this past weekend when video recorded his use of what appears to be unreasonable force on the restrained suspect. The latter man, identified as DeMarco Anderson, is black.“Are you serious?” Anderson is heard shouting after he was hit. “I got cuffs on, sir! Are you serious?”The Columbus police agency distanced itself from the officer’s behavior, which it said in a statement “does not meet the standards [of] the Columbus Division of Police.” “It appears to be inconsistent with the values and training we instill in our officers,” the agency said. “The officer self-reported a kick to the suspect while the suspect was in custody. We’ll learn more as the investigation continues and take appropriate actions based on the facts gathered. The officer has been temporarily reassigned.”Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther also condemned the officer’s actions in a post on Twitter, calling his behavior “unacceptable.”According to court records cited by The Daily Beast, police originally confronted Anderson for allegedly threatening to shoot people inside a nearby home. He elbowed a different officer in the face and ran. Police caught up with him a block away. The suspect was allegedly found carrying a handgun and a substance suspected of being crack cocaine. He has since been charged with resisting arrest, obstructing official business, aggravated menacing, possession of controlled substances, and having weapons under disability.Rosen has been reassigned to non-patrol duty while an investigation into the incident is conducted, Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs said at a press conference on Tuesday. While taking questions from reporters, she emphasized that while the video is disturbing, the investigation needs to run its course.“Really, we don’t know enough yet,” Jacobs said after stressing that the video captured “only one angle.”“You can’t always tell if contact was made. Video is recorded in 2D,” she said. “So there is potential that the camera does not see everything that occurred the way that it occurred.”Still, she said, “using force against handcuffed prisoners is an issue.”Officer Rosen’s conduct has been questioned before. He was one of two officers involved in a June 2016 shooting that killed 23-year-old Henry Green. The grand jury declined to indict either officer on charges related to that incident last month, WOSU reported.Green had been walking with another man when he crossed paths with Rosen and fellow Officer Jason Bare, who were patrolling in an unmarked vehicle and wearing civilian clothes, The Columbus Dispatch reported. The officers said Green pointed a gun at the vehicle.The two officers said they got out, identified themselves as police and ordered Green to drop his weapon. Instead he fired the gun at them, the officers said. They fired too. Green was hit seven times.That description of events was later disputed by the man who had been walking with Green. That man said the officers did not identify themselves or give Green time to react, according to the Dispatch."

Leonard Lance's town hall meeting in New Jersey.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efb3501600002000658463.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When House Republicans returned home this week for a long Easter recess, they found themselves facing rooms packed with loud, furious constituents — and in some cases relied on extra security.It turns out, governing with complete control of the federal government is harder than Republicans may have expected. After failing to rally enough support to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last month, the party has struggled to come up with a coherent legislative agenda, and the scandal-ridden Trump administration isn’t helping.Despite the hostile atmosphere, a number of rank-and-file Republicans held town hall meetings in their districts. Health care dominated the conversation. But constituents also wanted answers on immigration, climate change, Russia, and whether lawmakers were going to demand President Donald Trump’s tax returns.Constituents greeted Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) on Wednesday with boos and hisses at his town hall, where gigantic sand trucks were parked outside and officers patrolled with K-9 units on the ground and the roof. The audience members pressured Lance, who ultimately pulled his support of “Trumpcare,” to do more to fight his party’s Obamacare repeal efforts. Republicans have continued to negotiate over a repeal and replace plan, but the deep divisions between the right and center wings of the party present a near insurmountable barrier. “You have the majority, so govern,” attendees shouted at Lance. Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) also faced constituents’ anger over health care. The congressman — who is perhaps best known for shouting “You lie!” at then-President Barack Obama during an address to Congress in 2009 — had his own words thrown back at him by rowdy attendees. The chant started after Wilson claimed that Obamacare was obstructing health services, according to The New York Times.Moderate Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) took heavy fire from hundreds of constituents at two town halls for helping House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) craft the GOP’s Obamacare replacement bill, which would have left an estimated 24 million people uninsured. One resident in his district accused him of abandoning the “middle way,” according to The Oregonian. “I feel you’ve abandoned me for the right, the far right,” Gretchen Kimsey, who has lived in The Dalles, Oregon, for 50 years, told the congressman. “Where are you, Greg Walden?” Health care was also the theme in Colorado Springs, where Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn fended off questions from a heavy liberal bloc. One woman told Lamborn she feared how changes in health care policy would affect her son, who has a rare disability. “I have to choose between paying my mortgage and paying my son’s medical care,” she added. In several states, constituents attacked their representatives for failing to hold the Trump administration accountable. In California, one town hall attendee called Republican Rep. Tom McClintock “a rubber stamp for Donald Trump.” The audience also asked McClintock about investigations into potential ties between Trump campaign aides and Russia. Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) took heat from constituents who wanted answers on Trump’s tax returns and conflicts of interest. Given the strong presence of liberal activists at the events, it’s not surprising that the topic of climate change also came up. In Mesa, Arizona, they booed loudly when Republican Rep. Andy Biggs, a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, explained why he had doubts about climate change, according to the Arizona Republic. And while Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) acknowledged that “the climate changes” at his town hall, he also fended off boos when he added, “the data set we’re dealing with is very small,” MLive.com reported.Since Trump’s inauguration, Republicans have faced tougher crowds during their visits home, but the April recess is one of the longest breaks they’ve had this year ― giving voters ample time to pressure them.In some cases, frustrated organizers held town halls for Republican lawmakers who never showed. Hundreds of people attended an event in Indiana on Sunday with the hope of luring Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) into discussing health care. When she didn’t attend, they resorted to writing questions on index cards to be delivered to her later, according to WNDU. And about 500 people gathered at a banquet hall in Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday to interrogate a cardboard cutout of GOP Rep. Mike Bishop after the congressman held “listening sessions” capped at a few dozen people the day before.Speakers blasted Bishop for trying to repeal Obamacare and encouraged attendees to get involved in efforts like a campaign to put a redistricting amendment on the state ballot in 2018.In Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Markwayne Mullin got into a testy exchange with constituents, telling them they don’t pay his salary, according to a video posted on Facebook. “You say you pay for me to do this? That’s bullcrap,” he said. “I pay for myself. I paid enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary. This is a service.”Mullin later canceled a different town hall 15 minutes before it started, citing “safety concerns.” The abrupt cancellation was a surprise for constituents on both sides of the aisle. Pamela Coonce, president of Cherokee County Republican Women, told the Tahlequah Daily Press, they were “very disappointed, and none of us are really sure what happened.” Other conservatives simply blamed liberal activists for the disruptions. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was heckled and booed at a town hall earlier this year, and said he’s not holding any during this recess.In an interview with USA Today, Brat characterized protesters showing up to Republican lawmakers’ town halls this way: “We were asleep; we thought Hillary was going to get in. We’re ticked off, so we’re going to take it out on you.’”Either way, Brat admitted, every Republican showing up to town halls across the country is “getting just annihilated.”Kate Abbey-Lambertz, Andy Campbell and Ryan Grenoble contributed reporting.

The letter is signed by Marines of all ranking including colonel, lieutenant colonel and major. “In a culture that prizes masculinity, it is easy to mistake barbarism for strength.” the letter reads. “Yet we respectfully disagree with the notion that to fight and win our country’s battles, we must preserve an institution where men are permitted or even expected to behave like animals, and women trespass at their peril.”The letter, which was obtained by The Washington Post on Tuesday, was written in response to the nude photo scandal that rocked the Marine Corps March.

Alongside the open letter, over 400 female Marines have created their own Facebook group to lobby for a change in the service’s sexist culture, according to the Post. The group, titled Actionable Change, was created by Lt. Col. Ann Bernard. “We love the Marine Corps, and this is about making it better,” Bernard told the Post. “We fought the fight and thought we got the job done, and now we’re realizing we’re not quite there yet.

He has also been compared to civil rights hero Rosa Parks. On Tuesday, Dao’s lawyer Thomas Demetrio appeared on national TV and said he received an email that described Dao as the modern-day “Asian version of Rosa Parks.”“Dr. Dao, I believe to his great credit, has come to understand that he is the guy, the guy to stand up for all passengers going forward,” Demetrio said.Many on Twitter have criticized the comparison, saying Parks, who refused to be removed from her seat on a segregated bus during the height of the Jim Crow era, showed a form of defiance and experienced struggles that have absolutely no parallel to Dao’s experience.Yes, Dao’s mistreatment is certainly something to be angry about, and yes, he deserves respect and justice. But we can understand and unpack his case without comparing it to the very specific and very pointed level of racial hate black people like Parks experienced ― and continue to experience.Users on Twitter, many of them black, collectively weighed in to shut down the comparison and flatly label it offensive. Others even responded directly to USA Today’s tweet to slam the question they proposed: “Is United Airlines Passenger Dr. Dao an ‘Asian Version of Rosa Parks?’”Read some of the reaction tweets below: "
72,POLITICS,Trump Administration Hits Small Farmers With More Bad News,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-farmers-gipsa-rule_us_58efb450e4b0da2ff85f0409,An Obama-era rule meant to help livestock farmers fight meat industry abuses could be on death row.,2017-04-13,"A farmer feeds chickens on his farm on August 9, 2014, near Osage, Iowa. Many chicken growers have spoken out against abusive practices in their industry in recent years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efb50e1b0000320016b63f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Farmers already concerned with President Donald Trump’s policies on trade and immigration just got another reason to worry.The U.S. Department of Agriculture this week delayed implementation of an Obama administration rule aimed at making it easier for livestock producers to sue the large meat-processing companies they contract with over abusive practices.The USDA Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration rule, proposed in 2010 and approved by the Obama administration in December, had been set to take effect later this month. The USDA postponed it for at least six months.The government delay was welcomed by industry groups, including the National Chicken Council, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the National Pork Producers Council. The groups claim the rule would welcome frivolous, “government-sanctioned” lawsuits targeting corporations, and could raise prices for consumers and put farmers out of business.Colin Woodall, vice president for government affairs at National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, said his organization wants the rule eliminated altogether.“Our request to the Trump administration is that they withdraw this rule and throw it away,” Woodall told HuffPost. “We don’t believe there’s anything that can be done to fix it. We believe it’s bad across the board.”Influential members of Congress agree. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), the Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, this week called the rule “disastrous.” House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) similarly criticized the rule last month.The meat industry typically contracts with farmers to raise animals until they are old enough for slaughter. Farmers, particularly those in the highly consolidated poultry industry, have increasingly accused companies like Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride of deceptive and retaliatory practices.One lawsuit filed earlier this year called the companies a “cartel” and said they have colluded to depress pay for contractors, who are saddled with high debt that threatens their businesses. The industry rejects the allegations.“We’re hoping to bring about a change in this system,” a West Virginia farmer who has been raising chickens for Pilgrim’s Pride for 16 years, told The Associated Press this year. “It has to be done. If not, the American family farmer is going to disappear.”Lawsuits, however, run into the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which courts have interpreted to require an extremely high burden of proof. Farmers suing companies must prove practices they’re forced to follow affect not just one farmer, but the entire industry.“It’s like if your house was burned down by an arsonist and you would have to show that all the houses in your neighborhood or city were impacted by that to prove you were damaged by the arson,” Paul Wolfe, senior policy specialist at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, told HuffPost. “That’s very hard to do in any case.”The Obama rule would change that, and is long overdue, according to Barbara Patterson, director of government relations at the National Farmers Union, the nation’s second-largest farm organization.“This rule is such common sense and such a plain-language interpretation of the regulation that it’s hard to believe that they need more time,” Patterson said. “These are pretty basic protections and there has been plenty of time to review this. It should have been put into place eight years ago.”It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will scrap the rule. Trump’s pick for agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, hasn’t been confirmed by the Senate. A vote on his nomination has been scheduled for April 24.Supporters said they hope Perdue’s background as governor of Georgia — the biggest U.S. producer of broilers — shapes his thinking on the rule. Georgian Zippy Duvall, president of the powerful American Farm Bureau Federation, recently expressed support for some aspects of the rule.“We hope that he [Perdue] has heard this story from the poultry farmers in his state, and hopefully that experience will help him rethink this decision that was made without him,” Wolfe said.Meanwhile, many farmers in rural communities who backed Trump’s presidency are growing anxious his administration will renege on campaign promises to make America great again.Sally Lee, program director at the Rural Advancement Foundation International-USA, told HuffPost the majority of the farmers she works with voted for Trump and believed his administration would be a boon for their communities. “They felt sure this would be a no-brainer for the Trump administration, and there’s a lot of anxiety about this,” Lee said. “There’s a feeling that this is an action that does not reflect the commitment this administration made to rural America.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

73,POLITICS,"No Matter What Happens To Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions Will Press His Anti-Immigrant Agenda",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-steve-bannon_us_58efb376e4b0bb9638e23542,"Bannon may have fallen from President Donald Trump's graces, but his ethno-nationalist ally has been busy.",2017-04-13,"White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon has reportedly been sidelined in the Trump administration by the president's children, who also serve as his advisors.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efb4ba1600001f00658470.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― White House chief strategist Steve Bannon came into President Donald Trump’s administration with what he called an “economic nationalist” agenda. But now, Bannon is reportedly on the outs, and Trump has flip-flopped on NATO, Chinese currency manipulation and the Federal Reserve.No matter what Bannon’s fate, however, his strand of ethno-nationalism will live on in the Trump Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The 70-year-old former Alabama senator has already set the Justice Department on a new path by targeting immigrants, reining in police department reform efforts and curtailing efforts to protect voting rights.“While many are focused on how Bannon is losing influence in the White House, those concerned with immigrant justice ― and I suspect those concerned with racial justice, police reform and voting rights, too ― are focused on the rise of a turbocharged Sessions,” Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration reform group America’s Voice, said in an email to HuffPost.Bannon and Sessions share a long history of mutual support and policy agreement. They spent months together with Stephen Miller, a former Sessions aide who now works in the White House, plotting strategy on how to enact their shared agenda of limiting immigration to the U.S. in order to maintain a European and Christian identity. In 2016, Bannon declared Sessions “one of the intellectual, moral leaders of this populist, nationalist movement in this country.” After both moved to Trump’s administration, Bannon called Sessions the White House “clearinghouse for policy and philosophy.” Like Bannon, Sessions declares his policy objective as defeating “soulless globalism.”Sessions was a frequent guest on Bannon’s Breitbart radio show, and praised Trump’s proposed Muslim ban during the presidential campaign. “It’s appropriate to begin to discuss this, and he has forced that discussion,” Sessions said. He later said he opposed a total ban, but endorsed freezing immigration and refugee resettlement from Muslim countries.In another appearance on Bannon’s radio show, Sessions endorsed the Immigration Act of 1924, which specifically limited immigration based on race and religion, in the context of current immigration trends. “In seven years, we’ll have the highest percentage of Americans, non-native born, since the founding of the Republic,” Sessions said, while praising the 1924 law that was used to prevent Jewish immigration before and during the Holocaust.Like Bannon, Sessions believes immigration from Middle Eastern countries poses a national security risk. He agrees that Western leaders have failed to protect their Judeo-Christian heritage by opening the door to refugees.In one radio interview, after Bannon compared the migration of Syrian refugees to an infamous racist French book, he asked Sessions.: “Do you believe the elites in this country have the backbone, have the belief in the underlying principles of the Judeo-Christian West to actually win this war?”“I’m worried about that,” Sessions replied.The two nationalist Trump supporters share more than immigration policy preferences. The reversal of police reform efforts and reinvigoration of the War on Drugs pushed by Sessions as attorney general fits with Bannon’s efforts at Breitbart to label Black Lives Matter protesters as racists, while perpetuating racist stereotypes of African Americans through the site’s Black Crime section.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

74,POLITICS,Oklahoma Is Trying To Undermine Science In Classrooms (Again),Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-science-education_us_58efa19fe4b0b9e9848a1837,This is the seventh year in a row Sen. Josh Brecheen has introduced   a bill targeting science education.,2017-04-13,"“Parents want our kids to be innovators and problems solvers, and evidence-based science education is an essential prerequisite,” Climate Parents director Lisa Hoyos said to the press.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efcd5a14000021001b4317.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A bill that could undermine science education in schools is moving through Oklahoma’s legislature ― again. If the Oklahoma Science Education Act, which allows the state’s public school teachers to challenge scientific facts during classroom instruction, sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the seventh year in a row Sen. Josh Brecheen (R) has introduced some iteration of this bill. The bill passed Thursday in the the House General Government Oversight and Accountability Committee after the House Common Education Committee declined to hear it. The bill, which already passed in the state’s Senate 34-10 last month, could proceed to the floor of the House for consideration.The proposal seeks to create a classroom environment in which students “respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues” and in which neither the State Board of Education nor any school district officials can prohibit public school teachers from “helping students understand, analyze, critique and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories covered in the course being taught.”Critics of this bill and the six failed ones that came before it say the language is merely a backdoor attempt to let teachers inject science denialism into lessons about climate change, evolution and other hot-button subjects. The bill “would allow science teachers to teach anything they pleased, while preventing responsible educational authorities from intervening,” the National Center for Science Education said in a press release Thursday. “No scientific topics are identified as controversial, but the main sponsor is [Brecheen], who introduced similar legislation that directly targeted evolution in previous legislative sessions.”The Sierra Club’s Climate Parents organization and the social change network Credo Action have launched petitions that have gained traction against the bill. “Parents want our kids to be innovators and problems solvers, and evidence-based science education is an essential prerequisite,” Climate Parents director Lisa Hoyos said in a press statement.“We urge legislators to stand up for students, and their right to science education free of political interference, by rejecting this misguided ‘science miseducation’ bill.”Brecheen did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the bill’s purpose. Cyndi Munson (D), one of the lawmakers who voted against the bill at Thursday’s hearing, told The Huffington Post that proposals like this one reflect badly on the whole state.“Oklahoma has an incredible and unique opportunity to attract businesses known for their focus on STEM professions. However, we diminish those opportunities every time legislation like this becomes legitimized by our state legislature,” she said. If it were to become law, it would complicate an already-existing student achievement issue, she said. “[I]t puts our state in a dangerous situation when preparing students for national exams and future STEM careers. Currently, Oklahoma ranks 48th out of 50 on the Quality Counts Achievement Index. This is simply unacceptable.”It’s unclear how this bill would conflict with Oklahoma’s existing science education standards, which include lessons on both evolution and climate change.Climate change has had a pronounced impact on the state. The temperature in Oklahoma hit 99 degrees in the dead of winter earlier this year, and federal reports show that the increase in temperatures is changing crop growth cycles.CORRECTION: This article previously stated that temperatures hit 100 degrees in the state in February. The temperature in Mangum, Oklahoma, tied a state record of 99 degrees, but didn’t officially hit triple digits."

He wants to make deals of all kinds, everywhere, Now. Yalta on cell and tweet. And that is a far riskier route.Making snap judgments about world leaders with nuclear weapons ― or even claiming that you are making such judgments ― can complicate things quickly, and do irreversible damage in societies that don’t get that the tweet-paced palaver is show.The possibility of fateful escalation in this social media age is extreme.Sending the Navy to troll North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may feel like fun, but what if Kim decides to attack nearby Seoul with conventional weapons?Trump’s developer’s penchant for wanting to make deals at any cost comes with an equally evident willingness to welch on deals if it serves his purposes.But it’s one thing to stiff a subcontractor. It’s another to stiff, say, the Chinese. They have methods of getting payment that far exceed that of a floor-tile jobber on a highway in Paramus.It looks as though Trump indeed made a quick deal on the phone with Xi, and it was a disastrously bad one if you care about China overwhelming the American economy with underpriced goods.Maybe it’s a coincidence, but Trump has decided to stop calling China a currency manipulator; China, for its part, at the United Nations abstained from voting against an American resolution condemning Bashar Assad for his gas attack on Syrian civilians.“I was honored by the vote,” the president said, as though accepting a gift from China. It seems that Xi also made some promises about helping out on North Korea by stopping coal shipments.Were either of things worth the abandonment of the main American economic argument against China? Probably not. Did Trump run the traps of his national security team before cutting a deal with Xi? Probably not, since it all happened in a couple of hours.Putin is a bully, but if you answer him with bullying of your own you had better be patient, consistent and unflinching. Tillerson demanded that Moscow accept responsibility for the gas attack in Syria. But back in Washington, Trump was milder in tone on that topic.Like Henry Kissinger back in the 1970s, Trump seems to think he can corner Russia by siding with China. But unlike Kissinger, Trump knows next to nothing about either country. And a one-week flirtation with Xi is not enough to scare Putin. The last problem is that Trump mistakenly believes he knows the world because he has built hotels and licensed his name all over the globe. But in most places, he only learned what he had to learn to close the deal—which consisted largely of knowing which local officials to flatter, cajole or threaten.Does he know anything about the history and culture of China, Russia, North Korea or Syria? Another businessman, Henry Ford, said that “history is bunk.” To Trump, that is an overstatement.As for NATO, Trump stood in the East Room Wednesday and pledged his new-found love of an alliance he denounced during the campaign as a bunch of deadbeats who were crying wolf about Russia, but who were unwilling to pay to protect themselves. It’s an “enduring partnership,” Trump said Wednesday, and a “great alliance.” Jens Stoltenberg, the stolid Norwegian who serves as NATO secretary general, stood on the stage with the president. He didn’t smile much, which was smart. For there is no guarantee that Trump will say the same thing tomorrow.Tomorrow is another episode."

But back in Washington, Trump was milder in tone on that topic.Like Henry Kissinger back in the 1970s, Trump seems to think he can corner Russia by siding with China. But unlike Kissinger, Trump knows next to nothing about either country. And a one-week flirtation with Xi is not enough to scare Putin. The last problem is that Trump mistakenly believes he knows the world because he has built hotels and licensed his name all over the globe. But in most places, he only learned what he had to learn to close the deal—which consisted largely of knowing which local officials to flatter, cajole or threaten.Does he know anything about the history and culture of China, Russia, North Korea or Syria? Another businessman, Henry Ford, said that “history is bunk.” To Trump, that is an overstatement.As for NATO, Trump stood in the East Room Wednesday and pledged his new-found love of an alliance he denounced during the campaign as a bunch of deadbeats who were crying wolf about Russia, but who were unwilling to pay to protect themselves. It’s an “enduring partnership,” Trump said Wednesday, and a “great alliance.” Jens Stoltenberg, the stolid Norwegian who serves as NATO secretary general, stood on the stage with the president. He didn’t smile much, which was smart. For there is no guarantee that Trump will say the same thing tomorrow.Tomorrow is another episode."
77,POLITICS,Judge Compares Trans Student’s Case To America’s Greatest Civil Rights Battles,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-compares-trans-students-case-to-americas-greatest-civil-rights-battles_us_58e81cd8e4b058f0a02f6657,"The case of Gavin Grimm ""is about much more than bathrooms.""",2017-04-13,"Judge Andre Davis, center, has been a federal judge since 1995.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ef997f1b0000320016b5a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From shoutouts at awards shows to White House protests to multiple media appearances, Gavin Grimm has turned into a leading activist in the cause for greater rights for transgender students in the United States.And he hasn’t even graduated high school yet.But graduation day is fast approaching, and Grimm’s legal battle — which at its core is about his rights as a trans student — will remain stuck in the court system well past the moment he gets his diploma. On Wednesday, his legal team and that of the Gloucester County School Board proposed a new schedule that will likely push the resolution of the case well into the fall.Perhaps anticipating that delay, the same appeals court that last year gave his case a big boost also recognized Grimm for his persistence through it all. And it did so with language that was at once stark and inspirational.Grimm “takes his place among other modern-day human rights leaders who strive to ensure that, one day, equality will prevail, and that the core dignity of every one of our brothers and sisters is respected by lawmakers and others who wield power over their lives,” wrote in a court order last week U.S. Senior Circuit Judge Andre Davis, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit.Last month, the Supreme Court sent Grimm’s case back to the Richmond-based court for a do-over — a direct response to the Trump administration’s rollback of Obama-era guidance directing schools on how to accommodate trans students. Relying on that guidance, Grimm sued his school district for barring him from using the restroom that all other boys use, which his lawyers contend is a form of sex discrimination.With the federal guidance no longer in the books — and Grimm’s case prolonged well after he graduates in June — the 4th Circuit had no option but to go back to square one and reconsider the case. But before the case moved any further, Davis and another judge in the 4th Circuit gave Grimm a tribute of sorts — likening his struggle to that of some of the greatest civil rights plaintiffs in American history.“Our country has a long and ignominious history of discriminating against our most vulnerable and powerless,” wrote Davis. “We have an equally long history, however, of brave individuals — Dred Scott, Fred Korematsu, Linda Brown, Mildred and Richard Loving, Edie Windsor, and Jim Obergefell, to name just a few — who refused to accept quietly the injustices that were perpetuated against them.”Davis added: “It is unsurprising, of course, that the burden of confronting and remedying injustice falls on the shoulders of the oppressed. These individuals looked to the federal courts to vindicate their claims to human dignity, but as the names listed above make clear, the judiciary’s response has been decidedly mixed.”Grimm’s lawyers were moved by Davis’ words, which, among other flourishes, also quotes Martin Luther King, reprints a poem by Palestinian-American poet Naomi Shihab Nye, and links to Grimm’s own testimony before school authorities pleading for equal treatment just as the rest of the student body receives.To Davis, whose opinion is worth reading in full, Grimm’s case is not just about a high school teen wanting to use a bathroom that aligns with his gender identity.“It’s about a boy asking his school to treat him just like any other boy,” he wrote. “It’s about protecting the rights of transgender people in public spaces and not forcing them to exist on the margins. It’s about governmental validation of the existence and experiences of transgender people, as well as the simple recognition of their humanity.”Davis went on: “His case is part of a larger movement that is redefining and broadening the scope of civil and human rights so that they extend to a vulnerable group that has traditionally been unrecognized, unrepresented, and unprotected.”There’s no telling what will happen next in Grimm’s case and others like it advancing in the courts. But Davis’ observations reflect that at least some members of the judiciary believe that the struggle for transgender rights is no different from other struggles past.Davis ended his court order highlighting Nye’s poem, not something that judges ordinarily do, David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Grimm, wrote in the New York Review of Books.“Poetry and judicial opinions do not often mix,” Cole wrote. “Judging is ordinarily a prosaic task: weighing arguments, applying tests of legal doctrine, finding facts, stating conclusions, declaring winners and losers, announcing law. This is not the stuff of poetry. But every once in a while, poetry is called for.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee4d721600002000658102.jpeg?cache=PenYkqWXcb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On President Donald Trump’s 83rd day in office, CNN correspondent Jim Acosta called for an easing of tensions between two warring factions. “I think at some point we’re going to need a détente between this administration and the news media, or else it’s just going to get worse and worse and worse,” he said.Acosta appeared on stage Wednesday at the Newseum as part of a marathon session of speeches, panels and interviews tackling the fraught relationship between the president and the press.There’s always been an inevitable, and healthy, tension between the White House and the media, with disputes over access and differing views as to what information is truly in the public interest. Some of Trump’s top aides appearing at the event cited grievances with the press that would have had Obama administration officials nodding in agreement. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway described the press’ coverage as “incomplete.” The media ignores stories the administration would like to have highlighted, she said, and focused on others, such as an “attenuated, unproven relationship from the campaign with a certain country” ― or, Russia. White House press secretary Sean Spicer questioned the press corps’ “priorities” when it comes to “what gets covered, what doesn’t get covered, and sort of the obsession with some of the process.”Trump’s White House isn’t the first to complain about so-called process stories, which may reveal closed-door wrangling over policies and “palace intrigue” ― the bickering and backstabbing ― inside the West Wing. Jennifer Palmieri, a top communications official for both former President Barack Obama and recent Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, said Wednesday that her old bosses also griped about reporters “dumbing down politics to just process.”But the Trump team came to town promising the press that “business as usual is over,” and the relationship between the two forces has been unusually hostile. “The tone was set the day after the inauguration when Sean Spicer came out and decided to berate the media about the crowd size at the inaugural,” New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush said during a panel of White House correspondents.“My problem with that is he came in, shouted at everybody, and refused to take questions,” Thrush said. “To me that was a fundamental violation of the purpose of that room, which is not about questions. It’s about answers.”Spicer set the tone in the briefing room, but it was Trump who first lied about his inauguration crowd size ― thus forcing the press secretary to try spinning the unspinnable on Day One. It was the next day when Conway infamously cited “alternative facts” as an attempt to defend Spicer’s bogus claims to the press corps.Conway later came under fire for inventing a terrorist attack, and Spicer’s briefing room tirades have been spoofed on “Saturday Night Live.” He also spent the first couple of minutes during an interview on Wednesday apologizing again for claiming a day earlier that Adolf Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons. “I screwed up,” he said.Spicer’s Holocaust screw-up lasted barely a day, but Trump’s missteps can drag on for weeks because of his unwillingness to apologize and move on. The president’s baseless claim that Obama wiretapped his phones in Trump Tower led to weeks of Spicer wasting the press’ time defending it and amplifying another baseless claim in the process (for which he also reportedly apologized).What became even more apparent as journalists conversed with top officials of the past and present is that the biggest obstacle to returning the White House-press relationship to a normal level of combativeness is the president himself. The White House’s war with the press has been fueled by defending the president’s repeated falsehoods and attacking journalists in response to unflattering stories. “We need people to trust us,” Acosta said. “And I think we have been acting in a way that garners that trust. But the president doesn’t like bad stories about him and this is how he responds. We’ve got to figure out a way around it.”Trump has continued to use his Twitter account to vilify the press, as he did during the campaign ― but now he also wields the bully pulpit of the presidency. He has responded to scrutiny with cries of “fake news,” adopted the language of tyrants in calling news organizations the “enemies of the people,” and claimed journalists fabricate their sources. Newseum CEO Jeffrey Herbst said as Wednesday’s event began that he hoped it’d be possible to find “some solutions and common ground.” And veteran media writer Michael Wolff, who interviewed Conway, likened their exchange to “a little family therapy.”But such conversations are unlikely to lead to any lasting peace when Trump can upend relations with a single baseless charge or a tweet about changing libel laws. These are the sorts of things that reporters are going to understandably view as an assault on free speech. Trump recently decided to skip the upcoming White House Correspondents Dinner. His staff followed in solidarity, marking the first time no member of the White House attended the event in its nearly century-long history.Although the White House is still invited, Spicer signaled that the two sides are unlikely to meet up on April 29 in a cramped Washington ballroom. “I don’t think we should fake it,” Spicer said, suggesting it wouldn’t be right to pretend like everyone gets along. “If things get better,” he said, “maybe we’ll attend next year.”"

Pittman began arguing with commenters on a number of issues, including his support for a law to make the Supreme Court ruling that legalized marriage equality “null and void” in North Carolina.Pittman wrote this now-deleted post in one of his replies: The comments drew swift rebuke, first within Pittman’s Facebook page and then well beyond.“When American ultra-conservatives have come to believe beloved Abraham Lincoln is equivalent to Hitler, their politics have jumped the shark and gone from eye-rolling to dangerous for our democratic republic,” North Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin wrote on his on Facebook page.Pittman has made national news before, for cracking birther jokes about President Barack Obama and calling Planned Parenthood “murder for hire.” His Lincoln comments came just one day after White House press secretary Sean Spicer claimed Hitler never used chemical weapons, a comment he later apologized for making.

The reboot starring Emma Watson and Dan Stevens crossed the $1 billion line at the worldwide box office, Disney announced in a statement issued Thursday.This marks Disney’s second live-action remake to join the billionaires’ club, after “Alice in Wonderland” in 2010. “The Jungle Book” came close last year but ultimately stalled at $967 million. Without accounting for inflation, “Beauty and the Beast” is easily the most lucrative non-animated movie musical of all time. It’s the 29th title in history to hit $1 billion, a feat that 13 other Disney releases, mostly recently “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” have also accomplished.“Beast” has consistently overperformed at the box office, spending two weeks in the No. 1 spot and another two at No. 2. Released March 17, the movie took less than a month to accrue $1 billion. “Rogue One” required 39 days, and “Zootopia” and “Frozen” both spread the love across approximately three months. “Captain America: Civil War,” on the other hand, needed only three weeks.This news signals a bright future for Disney’s live-action onslaught, with remakes of “Dumbo,” “Mulan,” “The Lion King,” “Aladdin,” “The Little Mermaid” and other classics on the horizon. Lukewarm reviews and lingering controversy over the so-called “exclusively gay moment” did not prevent “Beauty and the Beast” from finding more than enough guests."

After months of intense negotiations and years of fighting, the United States women’s national soccer team has a new contract and a pay raise. Their pay increased by 30 percent and auxiliary benefits like bonuses and travel and play conditions increased too. They still won’t be paid the same as the U.S. men’s national team, but I’m checking this off as a win in our march toward equity for women.The experience of playing sports while female is both empowering and regrettably frustrating. It is a constant battle to discover your inner strength, bask in your own excellence, and fight an omnipresent voice in your head that tells you that you aren’t good enough.As a competitive swimmer for over 10 years, I pushed myself every day to work harder and go faster.

After months of intense negotiations and years of fighting, the United States women’s national soccer team has a new contract and a pay raise. Their pay increased by 30 percent and auxiliary benefits like bonuses and travel and play conditions increased too. They still won’t be paid the same as the U.S. men’s national team, but I’m checking this off as a win in our march toward equity for women.The experience of playing sports while female is both empowering and regrettably frustrating. It is a constant battle to discover your inner strength, bask in your own excellence, and fight an omnipresent voice in your head that tells you that you aren’t good enough.As a competitive swimmer for over 10 years, I pushed myself every day to work harder and go faster.

87,POLITICS,Trump Inches Toward A Bigger U.S. Role In Another Middle East War,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-yemen-civil-war_us_58ee795be4b0da2ff85dabc5,"Absent a plan from the president, U.S. partners Saudi Arabia and the UAE are moving forward despite strategic and humanitarian concerns.",2017-04-12,"Yemeni students study in a classroom in the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, on March 15, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee9e3a1600002000658214.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After years condemning U.S. interventionism in the Middle East, President Donald Trump stunned the world last week by escalating American involvement in Syria’s six-year civil war. But Trump has also been quietly preparing to boost the U.S. role in a war on the other side of the troubled region ― specifically in Yemen, an impoverished nation where 17 million people do not know where their next meal will come from and where all sides of a two-year civil war are implicated in alleged war crimes.The Trump administration is slowly ramping up support to a Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed militants, according to government sources, advocates and analysts. In the weeks ahead, they believe, Trump will approve a major transfer of bombs to Saudi Arabia, and may greenlight a coalition assault on Hodeidah, an essential port for food imports. Such a move would worsen the humanitarian crisis and damage United Nations efforts to negotiate a political solution.“A week and a day ago, it looked inevitable and imminent,” Scott Paul, a senior humanitarian policy adviser at Oxfam America, said Tuesday of the move on the port. “It seems as if the combination of humanitarian concerns and more recently airstrikes in Syria seems to have at least diverted attention in the administration, but there is going to come a time when the eye goes back to Yemen.”Katherine Zimmerman, an expert at the Republican-leaning American Enterprise Institute think tank, said coalition representatives went to recent meetings like a summit between Trump and the Saudi defense minister with arguments tailored toward Trump’s stated goal of weakening Iranian influence. They brought clear requests for tactical support, including lifting the Obama-era hold on the weapons transfer, providing more intelligence and logistical help, and increasing the U.S. involvement in the seas around Yemen, where the Iran-linked militia, the Houthis, has targeted American, Saudi and Emirati vessels. “They came with a very good engagement strategy and understood that the U.S. was open to suggestions,” Zimmerman said.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis reportedly wants to provide some help to the Saudis and their close ally in the coalition, the United Arab Emirates, in their effort to take Hodeidah, though he has stopped short of recommending a deployment of American Special Operations forces. Coalition forces have been advancing on the city in recent days, apparently in the hopes of reaching its outskirts before the holy Muslim month of Ramadan begins in early June, and then attacking after Ramadan, Zimmerman said.Pentagon spokesman Adam Stump declined to answer an emailed question about potential Defense Department involvement in planning for Hodeidah, citing force protection concerns. He also refused to comment on whether the U.S. would begin targeting the Houthi militia.Stump said the current deployment of American support is still where it was under the Obama administration, which approved major assistance to the Saudi-led coalition in terms of aerial refueling that enabled the coalition’s bloody bombing campaign and other logistical aid.“Four U.S. Air Force personnel, who have long been assigned to Saudi Arabia as part of an air defense liaison team, continue a narrow range of functions related to the Yemen conflict to include coordinating refueling, facilitating checks of a no-strike list, and sharing intelligence related to defense of the Saudi-Yemen border,” Stump told HuffPost. “The U.S. military’s support remains in a non-combat advisory and coordinating role.”And a source in Congress, which must receive a notification of Trump’s approval of the weapons transfer to the Saudis, told HuffPost that notification had not arrived yet, despite a blessing for the move from the State Department last month.But the stasis in Washington doesn’t prevent the U.S.-backed coalition and others from moving forward in ways that could limit Trump’s ability to shape events ― and threaten both the United States’ long-term goals in Yemen and the country’s desperate civilian population.The Saudis, for instance, feel more certain of American support than they have since the beginning of the war.“The intent is there and the meeting of minds is there,” said Ali Shihabi, the executive director of a new D.C. think tank called the Arabia Foundation, which is considered close to Saudi thinking. “It boils down to the details and what exactly America can do more than it has done previously... The fundamental problem which has already been solved was the overall attitude.”The Saudi view of Hodeidah, which the U.N. has repeatedly asked warring parties to keep safe, seems set.“Saudi Arabia has said... that port needs to be either taken over, or if you’re saying taking it over is a huge humanitarian problem, then let the U.N. go in and supervise it. The U.N. sort of is shrinking away,” Shihabi said, citing coalition worries about Iranian weapon shipments through the port and the Houthis’ manipulation of food supplies received there to deprive civilians living outside of their areas.Stump, the Pentagon spokesman, made clear that Iran’s role is central to U.S. thinking. “If Iran continues its destabilizing and malign activities, then the United States will work with its partners to respond,” he said.It seems unlikely that the weapons transfer is really in question either. While some lawmakers are pushing for greater transparency about alleged war crimes by the Saudi-led coalition before they approve the transfer, action against Iran is a popular goal on Capitol Hill, and the Saudis successfully secured a Senate vote on a tank transfer last year despite vocal criticism of their approach and low enthusiasm for the war in the White House. U.S. support in other forms ― like greater intelligence-sharing and coordination to benefit the coalition as part of regular American counter-terror activities in Yemen ― can grow regardless of congressional squabbles.“In addition to degrading the [al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] threat to the United States, recent U.S. military counterterrorism operations against [al Qaeda] in Yemen supported the Yemeni government and partner nation forces,” Stump wrote. The Saudi-backed faction in Yemen comprises the internationally recognized government.With a friend in the Oval Office, the Saudi-led coalition can push ahead. But U.S. experts believe Washington should be wary.“The US must not out-source its Yemen policy to Saudi Arabia or the UAE,” Zimmerman wrote at AEI’s Critical Threats blog in February. “Neither will act to secure US interests in full in Yemen and their divergence on key questions may prolong instability.”The coalition’s strategy of pummeling its opponents, in the hope that that will weaken them and force them to negotiate, has remained largely the same since the conflict began in 2015 and has failed to provide results, she told HuffPost.“The biggest contribution the United States can make to this fight is leadership to start to extricate our partners from Yemen,” Zimmerman said. She believes the administration should urge a political settlement as soon as possible, because that would force the pro-Iran group to recognize its internal fissures and start to splinter ― helping assuage Saudi concerns about an Iranian proxy on the border. (The Saudi-backed side is clearer in its long-term goals, she argued.)A continuation of the war in its present form seems unlikely to have strategic benefits, even with high-profile efforts like the attack on the port. And meanwhile, Yemen will continue to bleed.“All sides of the conflict are acting inappropriately, demonstrating a clear disregard for the lives of civilians, not fulfilling their obligations under international human rights law,” Paul said. “One task would have been to convince the coalition that taking the port is impractical and doesn’t lead to a political solution.”“That would have been the correct course,” he went on. “Instead what’s happening is, we’re moving further and further down the road towards an invasion of Hodeidah every day where there isn’t a public opening for a realistic and flexible approach to the peace process.”"

Spanish defender Marc Bartra suffered injuries to his arm and wrist.The attack forced a 24-hour postponement of the team’s high-profile clash with AS Monaco. Officials said security had been stepped up for the rescheduled match on Wednesday night, and for a second Champions League quarter-final between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid.Ralf Jaeger, interior minister in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes Dortmund, said the investigation was looking “in all directions,” and it was unclear if one or several attackers were involved.A spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor’s Office, which handles probes into suspected terrorism, said the explosive devices had contained strips of metal.Spokeswoman Frauke Koehler said investigators had found three letters near the scene, all with the same content suggesting a possible Islamist motive.She said the letters referred to the use of Tornado reconnaissance planes in Syria, which Germany has deployed as part of the military campaign against Islamic State, and also called for the closure of the U.S. military base at Ramstein in western Germany.Investigators had identified two suspects from the “Islamist scene,” searched their apartments and detained one man, she said.DEFENDER INJUREDThe blasts smashed windows on the bus carrying the players to the stadium. Bartra was operated on for a broken bone in his right wrist and shrapnel in his arm, a team spokesman said.“We all agree that we are dealing with a despicable act,” Merkel said at a business event in the western town of Allendorf.“We were all appalled yesterday when we heard about the attack on the bus with the players of BVB in Dortmund,” she added, praising Dortmund fans for offering accommodation to AS Monaco fans after the postponement.Bartra, 26, joined Dortmund for 8 million euros ($8.5 million) last year from Barcelona, after coming through the Catalan club’s youth system. He has made 12 appearances for the Spanish national team.European soccer’s governing body, UEFA, said there had been no specific intelligence regarding any threat to any of Wednesday’s Champions League fixtures, which also include a match in Spain between Atletico Madrid and England’s Leicester City.UEFA “is reviewing the security arrangements for tonight’s matches and security procedures will be enhanced accordingly wherever needed,” it said, asking supporters to allow extra time for the possibility of enhanced checks.Police in Munich said they were deploying an additional 80 officers and strengthening security around hotels and key routes for the match there.The blasts revived memories of Islamist militant attacks in Paris in November 2015 whose targets included a stadium where France were playing Germany in a soccer friendly.Security is among the issues at the heart of Germany’s parliamentary election on Sept. 24, a tight battle in which Merkel is running for a fourth term. In December, a Tunisian man killed 12 people when he plowed a truck through a Berlin Christmas market.(Additional reporting by Joseph Nasr, Paul Carrel, Anneli Palmen and Jens Hack; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)"

The powerful election vetting body is close to Khamenei as he appoints half of its members.Mehr news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying that he registered as a candidate “only to support Baghaei.”While conservatives are worried that Ahmadinejad or Baghaei’s presence might split their votes, allies of Rouhani are also concerned about the attractiveness of populist candidates with nationalist anti-establishment slogans.Baghaei, 48, was held under arrest in 2015 for almost seven months on charges that were not made public but many suspected were related to corruption. Iran’s judiciary spokesman said in March that his case was still open."

I’m a science-minded person and I have a science background. But stuff is in the media too much … It’s hard for me to be convinced sometimes.”In an apparent attempt to put out the fire, Hall issued a press release Wednesday in which he spelled out his goal to make the city run on clean energy — something he said would require cooperation and coordination.“We will not be satisfied by checking boxes on grant applications,” he said in a statement. “We will measure our carbon reduction, but even more importantly, we’ll measure the human and economic benefits that will truly be our milestones of success.”Hall, who is now serving his third term on the city council, also took the opportunity to clarify what he had said the day before:“I did not articulate where I am coming from clearly, at all. I believe in science and the overwhelming scientific consensus that tells us that our planet is warming and it is caused by humans burning fossil fuels. What I’m not sold on is the politicization of big issues like climate change. A lot of it is senseless propaganda, and it comes from both sides.Georgia State Sen. Vincent Fort (D) was among those who blasted Hall for his initial comments.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article identified Hall as a Republican."
