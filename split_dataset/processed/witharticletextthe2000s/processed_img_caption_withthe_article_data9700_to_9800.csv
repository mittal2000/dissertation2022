REUTERS/Peter Nicholls",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5924a33f1600002200ddc743.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Following the suicide bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, people around the world have expressed their horror at the senseless violence, condolences for the victims’ loved ones and fears the future. Given that so many of the concert attendees were teens and kids with their parents, this tragedy has particularly hit home for parents. Among the first victims confirmed dead are 8-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos and 18-year-old Georgina Callander. A U.K. ambulance official reported that the 59 injured victims include 12 children under age of 16, and parents are still desperately searching for their missing kids.HuffPost spoke to several parents about their reactions to the tragic news and how they are talking about it with their children. Due to Grande’s young fan base, kids are more aware of this concert attack than they might be of other major world events.“As a parent, my heart was broken by the news last evening!” author Lyss Stern said. “I made sure to give my children extra hugs and kisses last night. I want to scream for the families hurt and affected by this act or horror.”Stern added that she and her husband spoke to their 9- and 13-year-old sons over breakfast after the boys saw news of the attack on TV. “I really wish we did not have to have these discussions with our children. But this is the new world we are living in and unfortunately, we need to have these open and honest conversations,” she said. “We talked about how there are angry and hurt people in this world, and they want to make others feel as they do,” parenting blogger Adam Cohen told HuffPost. “It’s a tough day all around as we try to explain the senseless to the ones who ask the most questions.”In the aftermath of the attack, many parents on social media shared a video with advice that has become rather iconic in times of crisis ― Mr. Rogers’ “Look For The Helpers.”New York Times bestselling author and special education teacher, Rachel Macy Stafford echoed Rogers’ message about the power of a parent’s guidance and reassurance.“Children can feel safe through the daily presence of one caring adult, no matter how dark and scary the world is,” she told HuffPost. “The most powerful kind of protection is not about security walls, bulletproof vests, or staying out of harm’s way; the most powerful kind of protection comes from daily offerings of presence, wisdom, acceptance, and unconditional love.”Stafford said she always tells her children the truth about the state of the world in a way they can understand and also reminds them that they have the power to “negate the bad.” Said the mom, “Instead of worrying about harm that is beyond our control, we try to focus on spreading love, kindness, and positivity to the world through our words and actions. This approach gives my family hope, no matter what has happened in the world.” The circumstances of the tragedy felt all too familiar to many parents, especially those with young daughters. “My daughter is 7, and she absolutely loves pop music and Ariana Grande,” said blogger Heather Spohr, who has taken her daughter to large concerts in the past and has tickets to more upcoming shows.“The Manchester attack really hits home for us,” she explained. “Having lost a child myself, my heart is ripped open for the parents whose children were injured and killed.”Though Spohr normally tries to shield her kids from this kind of unsettling news, she didn’t want her daughter to hear about the Manchester bombing at school first. “My husband and I kept it simple: We told her that someone did something very bad, and many people were injured and some even died,” she said, adding that they didn’t go in-depth but answered all of the little girl’s questions as honestly as they could without oversharing.“It’s really hard, and devastating, and something I wish no parent had to try to explain to their children.”Jim Lin of The Busy Dad Blog was particularly struck by the news because he’s planning to take his 7-year-old daughter to a big concert next weekend. “I’d be lying if I told you it didn’t cross my mind to reconsider when I heard the news. At the end of the day, however, violence (whether terror, crime, or random) is prevalent in so many forms that you simply cannot predict or avoid it,” he explained. “What you can do as a parent is to explain to your children to the intellectual and emotional degree they can comprehend it that this stuff happens and it’s going to affect them in some way directly or indirectly during their lifetimes.”Lin emphasizes giving kids coping mechanisms so that they can trust their gut and know how to make quick decisions in potentially dangerous situations. “I would rather my child walk around with a healthy distrust of this world than a naive assumption of security,” he said.Still, the tragedy has left many parents with a sense of uncertainty. “Part of me is angry. The fact that there are people capable of targeting kids is unthinkable,” said blogger Lauren Cormier. “Part of me is scared. I wish I could keep my kids in a protective bubble, safe from physical harm and the knowledge of all the evil in the world. But another part of me knows that if we let fear win, we’ve given the terrorists exactly what they want. I don’t have any good answers on how to deal with something like this. I wish I did.”Author Ilana Wiles expressed similar sentiments. “Going to her first concert is something my 7-year-old has recently started talking about, and I was excited to have that experience with her. Now I am scared to take her to one,” she said. “On the one hand, I think fear is the terrorists winning. On the other hand, this is our children, and obviously, we don’t want to put them in any potential danger.”Ultimately, parents see their children as beacons of hope for a future of love and tolerance. Blogger Mike Reynolds affirmed his family’s commitment to living life to the fullest and raising their kids to be a force for good.“Our plan will be to continue to teach our daughters about the importance of trying to help people in ways they see they might need help and that while these events most definitely occur, there are more of us who want to help,” the dad said.“We’ll also make sure we keep doing the things that bring us joy and bring us pleasure,” he added. “So we’ll dance in the kitchen and sing songs we make up to do our part to bring joy.”"

Before he left, Trump briefly signed the memorial’s guest book. True to form, Trump’s note was blunt and appeared a bit rushed. Times of Israel correspondent Raoul Wootliff tweeted out an image of the note. “It is a great honor to be here with all of my friends - So amazing and will NEVER FORGET!” the president wrote.In response to the strangely curt note, an image of the message former President Barack Obama left in the guestbook started circulating on social media on Tuesday. Obama’s note, written while he was still a senator in 2008, demonstrated the striking differences in personality between Trump and his predecessor.“Let our children come here, and know this history, so that they can add their voices to proclaim ‘never again,’” Obama wrote. “And may we remember those who perished, not only as victims, but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us, and who have become symbols of the human spirit.”Avner Shalev, the chairman of Yad Vashem, told ABC that he didn’t think Trump’s guestbook message was insensitive, especially because of the strong statements the president made during a speech at the center that remembered the victims as human beings and reminded people of the importance of speaking up in the face of evil.Shalev told ABC that the remarks were “very meaningful” and that the president “touched all the essential elements that should be touched.”Most foreign dignitaries who visit Israel make it a point to stop at Yad Vashem. Visits to the center, which preserves the memories of the six million Jewish people who were systematically murdered by Nazis during World War II, usually take about and hour and a half.Obama spent about an hour touring the museum during another trip in 2013, visiting a children’s memorial, the Hall of Names, and the center’s Museum of Holocaust Art before spending several minutes writing in the museum’s guest book. President George Bush spent a longer amount of time at the museum during a visit in 2008. Trump didn’t tour the museum during his brief visit on Tuesday, citing his busy schedule during his first foreign trip as president. He did, however, attend a prayer ceremony inside Yad Vashem’s Hall of Remembrance, along with his wife, Melania Trump, and his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner.The president lit the memorial’s eternal flame and laid a wreath, and spoke out against the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, calling it “the most savage crime against God and his children.”“Millions of innocent and wonderful and beautiful lives, women and children, were extinguished as part of a systematic attempt to eliminate the Jewish people,” he said during a speech at Yad Vashem.He also expressed firm support for Israel.“The State of Israel is a strong and soaring monument to the solemn pledge we repeat and affirm: Never again,” he said. Before he left Yad Vashem, Trump was given a replica of a diary that belonged to Ester Goldstein, a German-Jewish teen who was murdered during the Holocaust.Trump has been criticized in the past over how his administration addressed the Holocaust. In January, his team released a statement about Holocaust Remembrance Day that neglected to mention Jewish victims. And earlier this year, his press secretary Sean Spicer made the strange claim that Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons, when in fact, the Nazis gassed millions of Jews in concentration camps.Trump has tried to make amends since those incidents, forcefully speaking out against anti-Semitism during an annual Holocaust remembrance ceremony in late April.Steven Goldstein, Executive Director, Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, told HuffPost in an email that the president’s 30 minutes at the center was “better” than the originally reported 15 minutes. “But it was nowhere close to the 90 minutes or more recommended length of a visit to Yad Vashem that would have allowed for a significant learning and reflection experience - the kind of deeper experience that would have countered the President’s odd signing of the guest book as ‘SO AMAZING.’ (Caps his.)”"

Zinke’s half-hour call with Charles “Chuck” Johnson, the CEO and founder of Gotnews.com, and Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus VR, occurred just after lunch on April 12, according to a recently published log of Zinke’s scheduled meetings last month. The call’s listed topic of discussion: “Border Wall building plans.” What knowledge or expertise Johnson and Luckey could bring to such a conversation, and why the man tasked with managing some 500 million acres of federal land would agree to the meeting, is anyone’s guess. A conservative journalist with serious credibility issues, Johnson is perhaps best known for being banned from Twitter in 2015 after asking for donations to help him “take out” civil rights activist DeRay McKesson. He also unsuccessfully sued Gawker for defamation, seeking $66 million over articles addressing rumors that Johnson defecated on the floor at some point during college.In January, Forbes reported that Johnson was “working behind the scenes with members of the [Trump] transition team’s executive committee” to “recommend, vet and give something of a seal of approval to potential nominees from the so-called ‘alt-right’” to work in the administration.Luckey, the multimillionaire founder of Oculus VR, has come under fire for funding a pro-Donald Trump internet group that pumped out anti-Hillary Clinton memes during the 2016 presidential race, and for donating $100,000 to Trump’s official inauguration committee. The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost’s multiple requests for comment. However, a spokeswoman for the agency told Gizmodo that the April 12 call was arranged by Zinke’s friend Scott McEwen, a co-author of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle’s autobiography American Sniper.“The Secretary had a brief meeting where he listened to [Johnson and Luckey’s] ideas about using technology on the border and referred the gentlemen to the Department of Homeland Security,” the spokeswoman told Gizmodo. “Regarding setting up the meeting, a friend of the Secretary’s suggested he talk with them about their technology,” she added. “As a result, they had a very brief meeting with the Secretary. There was no action after.”Johnson did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Contacted by Gizmodo via Twitter, Luckey reportedly referred the publication to a response he’d previously given them, which read, “I could give you an answer, or I could tell you to fuck yourself.”Paul Blumenthal contributed to this report.

But despite his close association with the Bond franchise, Moore actually came to hate guns at a young age, and especially despise the way society glorified men who wielded them as he got older.“Of course I do not regret the Bond days,” Moore once said, according to BBC.“I regret that sadly heroes in general are depicted with guns in their hands, and to tell the truth I have always hated guns and what they represent.”In his memoir, My Word Is My Bond, Moore explained that his feelings on firearms were born in childhood. As a young kid, a gun once “blew up in [his] hands, which deafened [him] for a few days.” Then, as a teenager, a friend shot him in the leg with a BB gun. The fear from those incidents carried over over into adulthood. As Bond, Moore would “clench [his] eyes” as he squeezed the trigger of a fake gun ― “an old Gary Cooper trick,” he said. While filming 1974’s “The Man With the Golden Gun,” director Guy Hamilton wanted More to embrace the idea of a more violent Bond.“That sort of characterization didn’t sit well with me,” Moore wrote in his book. “I suggested my Bond would have charmed the information out of her by bedding her first. My Bond was a lover and a giggler, but I went along with Guy.”When he sat down and watched the last of his seven Bond films ― 1985’s “A View to a Kill” ― he found himself disgusted by the level of violence. “That wasn’t Bond,” he later told Reuters.“I am happy to have done it, but I’m sad that it has turned so violent,” he said in 2008. Later in his life, Moore became “completely opposed to small arms and what they can do to children.” He had a hard time even looking at photos of his iconic pose with a Walther PPK gun. Moore received some criticism for his portrayal of Bond as a sillier, funnier man than many of the actors who came before or after him.

Despite getting soaked by thunderstorms the majority of my days in the city, the light never seemed to stop shining brightly during my five weeks there. The bustling city streets and endless traffic may feel overwhelming to many, but between moments of chaos exists a culture as rich as any I have seen. Closing my eyes immediately takes me back: the sweet smells from the esquites pushcarts, the high-pitched notes from the organilleros that turn every city square into a romantic plaza, and the radiant facades and front gates that can make even the shabbiest of homes look regal. But opening my eyes today slaps me with the heartbreak of Tuesday’s disastrous 7.1 earthquake and the sadness I feel for our brothers and sisters there, for the displaced families, and for all those who lost their loved ones. This week, the city is draped in darkness more profound than any eclipse could ever deliver. This story actually starts several weeks prior, when an earthquake alarm blasted through the afternoon drizzle. Nothing happened, but the following night I was awoken by that same alarm. As I faded back into my pillow, my bed started shaking as the ceiling lamp swayed violently. While this was a relatively small episode in the city, southern Mexico was struck with a magnitude 8.2 quake that killed dozens. On Tuesday, as I was preparing my final meal in the borough of Coyoacan before hailing an Uber to the airport, a violent thud shook the house as if the front door was forcefully slammed. The emergency alarm system sounded two seconds later, and at this moment I understood the gravity of the situation; the earthquake beat the alarm, so the epicenter must be close. I exchanged a wide-eyed glance with Diana, my very good friend and host, before hastily walking to the back patio. From there the trees swayed as if someone was trying to shake the leaves off and the screams of neighboring people and pets left a haunting melody in the air. The rest of the day was a surreal dream: power outage and cell towers down…no Uber services…nine kilometer drive that took two hours…the airport like a refugee camp…a terrifying aftershock false alarm…walking over cracked sidewalk and fallen plaster…flight services back online…in my bed in San Diego. Everything happened too quickly to process. I sit here in San Diego with a guilty conscience after returning home just hours after the event while my friends and their families came together to lend helping hands to all who were affected. For five weeks, I was welcomed with open arms by a community that accepted me as the strange white dude with no hair and an egregious Spanish accent. I wish now more than ever I could reach for those open arms and embrace each one of them during this unspeakable time. Though I am here, my heart and mind are with them, and I cannot help but reflect on this experience. In my five weeks abroad, natural disasters pounded this region of the world with constant thunder and lightning, record-setting hurricanes, and back-to-back earthquakes that triggered tsunami and volcanic eruption warnings. I couldn’t help but notice that each of these tragic events on the macroscale were mirrored on the personal level. Earthquake alarms rang like wake-up calls to my comfortable lifestyle of California beachside living, reminding me once again how precious this life truly is. On occasion, frustrations of personal growth in a foreign city fumed like Popocatépetl. I fell for a girl whose captivating eyes instilled a calmness more blissful than the eyes of the hurricanes that ripped through the Atlantic. My time in the city came and went like a bolt of lightning, but the thunder will resonate with me forever. My grandma wrote to me the day after the earthquake. Among her words of heartbreak and condolence, she wrote, “Yin and yang...all part of the life experience.” As evidenced by this recent wave of natural destruction, it can be argued that we are living in an age of imbalance between yin and yang. However, based on personal experiences and the public outpour of post-disaster philanthropic support, I see a resilient city that is capable of restoring balance through unification and love. I see a community prepared for social and environmental progress catalyzed by a new generation of passionate change-makers, perhaps even more than they realize. And I see a future that not only restores balance, but one that rises from the ruins stronger than ever. The country has many deep-rooted problems, this cannot be denied. But neither can the power of the people, and their unity during a time of disaster and fear should be admired. They are proving what humans are capable of, and a community that comes together during a time of crisis can come together at any time to spark positive change. I see an opportunity for growth to rebuild in a way that can enhance social equity and create a dynamic urban environment more closely aligned with natural systems and sustainable development. The city’s traffic congestion, affordable and environmentally-sound housing, and air pollution mitigation are just several large-scale problems that will need large-scale planning efforts and cooperation, but I am hopeful for them. My five weeks in Mexico City renewed my soul more than I ever thought possible, and on my final day I saw the city crumble. The guilt I feel today for walking away from a place that provided me with so much personal development will not fade away. With my education and expertise, I hope to return the favor and help redevelop this country for a sustainable future. I will return. I am not Mexican, but I feel a love for the people that I cannot quite describe. Why is this American Jew so drawn to the country that some of my fellow countrymen fear or despise? Just like the earthquake, I believe that it goes beneath the surface. Mexico has malicious or immoral people like any other country, but this event shows that it is filled with a loving population who are severely misrepresented and mistreated in my country. As my family celebrates the Jewish New Year today, and I am reminded of how my ancestors have been victimized throughout history, rarely feeling accepted outside of their communities and encountering wall after wall in their search for a home. I feel empathy for my neighbors to the south and frustration towards those in the United States who fear them, misjudge them, or want to expel them. After the disaster, Donald Trump tweeted, “God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you.” At the very least, I am hoping that this earthquake managed to knock his wall down. "

Yet when most people think of China’s rise, they don’t tend to think of movies. But maybe they should, says one China scholar.″[China uses film] to try and promote so-called soft power all over the world, telling China’s story,” Stanley Rosen, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California specializing in Chinese politics and society, says of China’s most recent developments in the industry. This has made it difficult for Hollywood to figure out what approach to take. The large population of viewers in China is a market it wants to continue to tap into ― but China’s success may also create more competition. One problem, according to Rosen, is that the Chinese government’s film regulations are far too inconsistent.“What’s acceptable now doesn’t mean it’s going to be acceptable tomorrow or the next day.” In a four-part interview with The WorldPost, Rosen discusses how Hollywood must carefully navigate collaboration with the Chinese film industry, and why the United States needs to be shrewd in its approach. Ultimately, he analyzes what has happened, and where the relationship is headed next. Today, China may entice Hollywood with its large potential audience, which accounted for close to 50 percent of the worldwide box office earnings in 2017. This has led to the idea of co-production between Hollywood and the Chinese film industry, Rosen says.But, China’s changing regulations are a major challenge for co-production, making it an unpredictable market, he argues.In fact, in other parts of the entertainment industry, companies like Netflix have given up on approaching the Chinese market on their own, due to inconsistencies of censorship regulations. Some have decided the best approach to the Chinese market is through technical partnerships with local companies, a move that has been incredibly profitable over the past year. “Wolf Warrior 2,” a Chinese film that employed technical support and guidance by Hollywood directors and producers Joe and Anthony Russo, was one of the all-time top grossing films in a single market.In spite of the challenges, some American filmmakers ― like the Russo brothers ― have realized that the Chinese market is far too profitable to give up on entirely. This is why, Rosen argues in an op-ed for The WorldPost, “one solution, already well underway, is the participation of Hollywood studios in the direct production of local language films intended solely for the Chinese market.”Whether this will be the future of the complex China-Hollywood relationship remains to be seen.For more on Hollywood and China, watch The WorldPost’s four-part interview with Stan Rosen here."
9,POLITICS,Here's The Simplest Reason Lisa Murkowski Likely Won't Support This ACA Repeal Bill,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lisa-murkowski-obamacare-repeal_us_59c27eafe4b0186c220748a4,It's just math.,2017-09-22,Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) being coy with reporters on how she'll vote on yet another Obamacare repeal bill.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c522521900002500565296.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has all but killed Obamacare repeal, but there’s still one senator in particular who could make it a done deal and nobody knows where she stands: Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).She’s been wavering on the Graham-Cassidy bill for days, and given her role in killing previous bills to gut the Affordable Care Act, she’s left people clamoring to know if she’s prepared to do it again. In light of McCain’s announcement on Friday that he’ll oppose the bill, a “no” vote by Murkowski would officially kill the repeal effort for now.Her office had no comment in response to McCain’s decision. “No update from us,” Murkowski spokeswoman Karina Petersen said.There are plenty of reasons to think she won’t support this bill. Murkowski already took a political risk in July when she voted down the last repeal bill. She was hailed as a hero for it by many in Alaska, too, greeted by hugs and flowers when she went back home. She’s also not up for reelection until 2022, and this photo of her hula-hooping soon after that vote seemed to show a liberated senator living her best life and not looking back.But there’s a simpler reason, too. It’s just math.Various experts have already explained why Alaska would lose under the Graham-Cassidy bill. Avalere Health, a consulting firm, said the bill would yield an 11 percent loss in federal funding in the state, or $1 billion, between 2020 and 2026. Groups like Kaiser and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities show similar numbers. Even the Centers for Medicare for Medicaid Services, which has the rosiest numbers, shows a negative effect on Alaska. Murkowski’s governor also opposes the bill, and on Friday, Alaska’s health department unveiled a new report projecting that Graham-Cassidy would mean a 65 percent cut in federal funding for the state by 2026.Those are terrible numbers, and they’ve left bill supporters desperate to figure out a way to win over Murkowski. One idea that’s been floated is to create a carve-out for the state. In that scenario, the bill would be amended to let Alaska keep Obamacare while it’s repealed for nearly every other state.Murkowski hasn’t said if she’d bite on something like that. But a longtime Republican operative familiar with the dynamics at play in Alaska said the senator is better off not taking any deal on this bill ― and she likely knows it.“So Lisa Murkowski votes for this bill, she gets to keep the benefits of the Affordable Care Act in Alaska. She votes against the bill, she keeps them as well. Why would she go for that?” said this GOP operative. “The only cost is political in terms of a high profile flip-flop that results in irritating all the constituents who aren’t already angry.”“This is a win-win for Alaska that would end as a political loss on the scoreboard [if Murkowski voted for the bill],” added the Republican insider.In this light, the best possible scenario for Murkowski is to reject the bill.Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare are by no means dead for good, and it’s entirely possible that Murkowski would be up for cutting a deal on a future bill. But if the only thing she’ll gain by voting for Graham-Cassidy is the status quo and a fresh herd of angry voters at home, it’s hard to see the point. "

All neighborhoods ― Black or white, wealthy or poor ― were hit with the same torrential winds and downpours. But in the aftermath, low-income Black and Brown communities will be the ones who face the worst destruction and the slowest recovery plagued of discrimination and inequality.It’s what we have seen over and over again ― after Hurricane Katrina, after Sandy, after Ike and Rita.It’s time for us as a country to face up to this painful fact, and to start doing something about it.Natural disasters land hardest on such communities for a number of reasons. Before a storm, for example, low-income communities have fewer resources to evacuate and safeguard homes, vehicles, and other property, if they have resources. The belongings they lose could be the only ones they have.It is even harder for undocumented immigrants or those who cannot speak English. In Houston, home to an estimated 575,000 undocumented immigrants, many hesitated to access a homeless shelter because they feared deportation. They had good reason to be scared. In Texas, the Border Patrol refused to suspend its checkpoints even during the storm. In Florida, a sheriff threatened to station agents at the doors of shelters to check identification.This time around, many immigrants were also battling the uncertainty of a potential DACA phase-out and the implementation of an anti-immigrant law in Texas.For vulnerable communities, just preparing for a storm can be debilitating. But for those who are hit, the pain grows far worse.Families coming back to their homes often face the unthinkable: an eviction notice. Residents in apartment complexes across Texas have already been kicked out of their homes in the wake of Harvey.Those who can’t get to work face an equally unthinkable scenario: getting fired. In Florida, a Naples business owner fired an employee who refused to work through the hurricane, saying callously: “When we hire you, you sign a statement saying you might be required to work through hurricane events.”In addition, decades of racist policies have put chemical plants and environmentally hazardous sites closest to neighborhoods of color. In Houston, massive chemical plants and Superfund sites near those neighborhoods have caught fire and begun leaking toxic chemicals. Floodwaters have been contaminated with E. coli. Finally, construction workers critical to the recovery, many of them undocumented, face exploitation and wage theft from unscrupulous employers seeking a speedy recovery for wealthier communities.And in a cruel twist, many of these issues get worse in the post-disaster recovery process.Hurricane Katrina set in motion, for example, a massive privatization of the New Orleans school system, hurting a generation of children of color. When Hurricane Ike hit southeast Texas in 2008, many communities were still living under blue tarps left by Hurricane Rita, a powerful storm from 2005. Even so, the first round of disaster aid after Ike largely went to apartment owners, even though it was unclear their buildings were even damaged. The unsustainable state of affairs prompted the creation of a local community organizing group in Houston, the Texas Organizing Project. By mobilizing residents, they were able to ensure families benefitted from subsequent rounds of aid. Today, the Texas Organizing Project, a CPD state affiliate, is back in the middle of the fight, organizing tenants to fight evictions and fight for a fair share of aid. And other organizations across the country, including our organizing groups in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, are following their model. Over and over again, these groups have watched outside organizations fundraising on their pain, only to walk away after the cameras leave. What did the Red Cross do with the half billion they received for Haiti? They built six homes. In Houston, two CPD affiliates, the Texas Organizing Project Education Fund and Workers Defense Project, along with other trusted organizations, established the Harvey Community Relief Fund to pool resources and coordinate their distribution to meet the needs of the most vulnerable.In Florida, along with other community and labor organizations, CPD affiliates Organize Florida and New Majority Florida have set up the Hurricane Irma Community Recovery Fund to provide first response and humanitarian aid. Most recently, in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria has devastated the island, leaving so far over 10 deaths, 100 percent of families without electricity and thousands more homeless.

The fund will support organizations working on the frontlines with these communities. When the cameras leave, and national attention shifts, these are the organizations that will be healing and restoring their communities - and building long-term power from the ground.

Among other recommendations, the guidance had set forth a lower “preponderance of evidence” standard for finding that students had committed sexual assault and thus could be punished. Under DeVos, schools can now raise that standard.“Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,” DeVos said in a statement. “There will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.”In just her first six months, the secretary has also rolled back protections for transgender students and seriously scaled down campus rape investigations by the Education Department.Know Your IX, a national youth-led campaign to end sexual violence, called the latest decision a betrayal of survivors of sexual assault.“Today’s guidance allows schools to systematically stack campus investigations against survivors and push survivors out of school,” the group said in a statement. “The Department of Education is sending the message that they value survivors’ access to education less than that of the students who assault and abuse them.”The department’s Office for Civil Rights has 360 open sexual assault investigations, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.“Betsy DeVos and Donald Trump are more concerned with protecting the rights of predators and abusers over the rights of survivors of sexual assault,” Chaudhary said in a statement. “Sadly, given President Trump’s history of bragging about sexual assault, this isn’t that surprising.”"

Truman. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c55c6b1a00004400f0816f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“We don’t serve Mexicans here,” said the restaurant owner at The Oasis Café. Macario García became enraged, and a fight ensued. Bottles of ketchup and salt shakers and bowls flew across the room, shattering a mirror and windows, according to accounts. An arrest followed. Macario was in handcuffs. They said he was drunk, unruly, and that he started the fight. The same accusations were leveled against countless Mexican-Americans who fought back because they recognized that they were being denied their humanity.“I’ve been fighting for people like you, and now you mistreat me,” he said.The year was 1945. Only a few weeks before this incident, President Harry S. Truman had presented Sergeant Macario García with the Congressional Medal of Honor. He also received the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star and the Combat Infantry Badge. Macario was born in México, but he served and fought for his home country, the United States.Felix Longoria died fighting in the Pacific in 1945. He was a Mexican-American from Three Rivers, a quiet rural town in south Texas that was home to segregated cemeteries and a racially-divided population. Longoria returned to his family in a coffin only to be denied a proper wake at the town’s sole funeral home. T.W. Kennedy, the owner, said he could not hold Longoria’s wake at Rice Funeral Home because “the white people would not stand for it.”These are only two historical anecdotes of the countless instances of racism and inequality that Mexican-Americans endured for centuries. Both are painful to read and difficult to comprehend, yet these incidents that happened decades ago feel eerily familiar nowadays. We are living under a presidential administration staffed by people who blatantly hate Hispanics, like Stephen Miller. It’s an administration with policies that were at one point influenced by a white nationalist, Stephen K. Bannon, and a president who began his campaign calling Mexicans criminals, rapists and thieves. Racist attacks against Mexicans and Latinos have increased, fueled by a president who disparages our community and toys with the lives of Dreamers by threatening to deport them every time he wants to cheer up the racists in his base. It’s an administration that is proposing policies that will cause irrevocable damage to the civil rights that members of the Hispanic, African-American, and LGBTQ communities fought for and, in many cases, died for.When we recognize that history repeats itself, as it is doing now, we must seek to understand the patterns that emerge in the most iconic historical anecdotes of discrimination and civil rights violations, one harrowing and the other hopeful. The harrowing part of these incidents is that when they occurred, they were legal. The hopeful part is that in many incidents, helpers emerged from within the community and its allies to help change the course of history by correcting the wrongs committed against the oppressed.For instance, leaders of the Mexican-American community, including LULAC, rallied in support of Sgt. Macario García until the charges were dropped. In Felix Longoria’s case, the American G.I. Forum, guided by Dr. Hector P. García, advocated on behalf of the Longoria family, and in a way, lit the match that kindled the Chicano movement’s fire. Longoria was buried with full military honors in Arlington Cemetery thanks to a young U.S. Senator named Lyndon B. Johnson. These situations were among the precursors to the Civil Rights Movement as were landmark trial cases such as Hernández v. Texas, which offered equal protection under the Constitution to Mexican-Americans and other nationalities. Laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Higher Education Act of 1965 ― the results of the fight for equal justice lead by community leaders from all backgrounds ― became the promise of the future, the promise of our future. They are proof that we do not have to sit back and accept the status quo or laws designed to weaken our civil liberties.Our eyes are a bit downcast this year as we continue through Hispanic Heritage Month, our smiles a bit weathered after eight months of attacks, and that is okay. But there is one thing that must remain as strong as it did for those who bore the struggle before us: our corazón. We have been the downtrodden, victims of everything from casual discrimination to lynchings, yet we’ve always emerged with strength and determination to offer our children a better future. Raza, there’s always hope. We just have to fight for it."
14,IMPACT,Why I Distribute Overdose Reversal Kits In Asheville,"Hillary Brown, ContributorFounding member of Steady Collective a harm reduction organiza...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-i-distribute-overdose-reversal-kits-in-asheville_us_59c5447fe4b06ddf45f7bc78,Our opioid crisis deserves as much attention as our tourism.,2017-09-22,<em>A vial of the naloxone Steady Collective distributes (Photo: Hillary Brown)</em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c5698c190000250056537b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Asheville, North Carolina, like the rest of the nation, is experiencing an opioid overdose crisis. Local statistics documenting increased emergency room visits for overdoses and drug-related illnesses look very similar to statistics from other comparably-sized cities throughout Appalachia and the Southeast.Things do feel different in Asheville though.In Tennessee and West Virginia, the issue of widespread opioid use and overdose is explained in the context of a larger story about economic depression, flagging industry, and ever-diminishing access to social services. But over the past year, Western North Carolina’s liberal enclave was ranked the best travel destination in the United States, the best American city to retire to, a foodie hot spot, and one of the top 10 least-stressed cities in the U.S. due, in part, to its incredibly high number of entertainment establishments.In a city powered by tourism and leisure, discussions about overdose and the plight of drug users feel misplaced, too heavy. Allocation of local government funding highlights that disjuncture. In the first half of this year Buncombe county emergency medical services responded to 520 incidents related to overdoses and poisonings. Yet recently when Asheville, Buncombe’s county seat, approved an increased budget for policing in the city, it was to expand the police force in tourist-centric downtown, not to purchase naloxone (which can treat a narcotic overdose in an emergency situation) for every officer. Over the course of the last couple of years, large breweries opening sites in Asheville have received millions of dollars in tax breaks from the city and county, while treatment centers, peer support services and harm reduction organizations dealing directly with the opioid crisis have had to fight for a fraction of those funds.A little over a year ago, I started working with a drug user harm reduction organization based out of Asheville called Steady Collective. In the first six months of this year, Steady Collective handed out 561 naloxone kits to drug users and their families. In the same period of time, recipients of those kits reported performing 124 reversals. Like most syringe access programs, we create the fewest possible barriers to receiving service. If program participants just want to get needles and naloxone and leave, that’s possible. When I started working with Steady, I anticipated that my days would be spent putting clean injecting supplies in a bag, handing them across a table, and briefly reminding folks to never use alone as they walked out the door. But that’s not what happened.Every Tuesday, I carry a plastic bin of supplies including clean syringes and nasal and intra-muscular naloxone into the back room of a bookstore on Asheville’s hip west side. I wait behind a folding table, with a volunteer, for people who have heard about our outreach from other drug users. Regulars trickle in first. I bag up their requested items and ask them if they have performed any overdose reversals with the naloxone kits they got the last time they came by. More often than not now, because of the presence of fentanyl in so much of the heroin supply, the answer is yes. When I started tabling at this location, I just asked for the details we need to keep track of inventory and understand where in the county the kits are being used. Now, usually without asking, I get all the details of a reversal.A couple of weeks ago, I arrived at the bookstore to find a regular named Lewis waiting on me. Before asking for anything, he started telling me about an overdose reversal he had performed over the weekend. The reversal required six vials and one nasal unit of naloxone. These multi-kit reversals have become extremely common, but this is staggering. I ask where this person is now. Lewis tells me that EMS arrived after he revived the man. They took him to the hospital for follow-up care, and he was released from the hospital into the custody of police. The state Good Samaritan law didn’t cover the overdose victim, because he had more than one gram of heroin on his person at the time of his overdose. Buncombe county jail had 800 prisoners on detox protocol in 2016. This man will be part of the guaranteed higher number for the current year.Lewis isn’t homeless, but the majority of Steady Collective’s participants are. We have several participants who take supplies for themselves and the rest of their camp. Like Lewis, they bring back used needles and overdose reversal reports. One homeless participant named Gus, takes needles back to an area of town where particularly high doses of fentanyl have made it into the white heroin being sold there. He has used opiates for a dozen years with very few overdoses. But this white stuff, he can tell it’s not right. His friends can tell it isn’t right, but it’s what is available where they live and they don’t want to be dope sick.I like Gus. He will sit and talk with me for long periods during program hours. He mostly talks to me about changes in the drug supply and where different kinds of heroin are being sold. Gus gives me information he knows will be useful to me. But occasionally he talks to me about his young daughter and about work he used to do. During one of those more relaxed conversations recently he said:Ya know, it feels a little like they want us to die. They know there is a problem. They know we’re dying all the time and they just won’t do anything. All I can think is that they want us dead.Last time I saw Gus was several weeks ago. He was walking with a severe limp from what we both suspected might be injection-related staph. I asked him to go see a doctor. He said he would try.In the second-fastest gentrifying city in the United States, where the economy is built around providing wealthy people with stress-free vacations, Gus and Lewis are unpleasant reminders of a real world public health emergency. I, along with other harm reductionists, try to address that emergency by providing clean injecting equipment that prevents the spread of HCV and HIV. I try to make sure that free naloxone makes it into the hands of drug users without the means to buy it. But the single most important thing I do every week is listen to people who use drugs. I have never met a group of people in this country who have witnessed so much death in such a short period of time. The fact that they live in fear of arrest and incarceration, even during life-threatening medical emergencies, further isolates them and exacerbates trauma.People who use drugs deserve so much more than an empathetic listener. We should do everything in our power to see that they receive as much support as our weekend visitors."
15,IMPACT,Why I Distribute Overdose Reversal Kits In Asheville,"Hillary Brown, ContributorFounding member of Steady Collective a harm reduction organiza...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-i-distribute-overdose-reversal-kits-in-asheville_us_59c5447fe4b06ddf45f7bc78,Our opioid crisis deserves as much attention as our tourism.,2017-09-22,<em>An old water tower in Asheville's River Arts District <em>(Photo: Hillary Brown)</em></em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c569b21900003a0056537c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Asheville, North Carolina, like the rest of the nation, is experiencing an opioid overdose crisis. Local statistics documenting increased emergency room visits for overdoses and drug-related illnesses look very similar to statistics from other comparably-sized cities throughout Appalachia and the Southeast.Things do feel different in Asheville though.In Tennessee and West Virginia, the issue of widespread opioid use and overdose is explained in the context of a larger story about economic depression, flagging industry, and ever-diminishing access to social services. But over the past year, Western North Carolina’s liberal enclave was ranked the best travel destination in the United States, the best American city to retire to, a foodie hot spot, and one of the top 10 least-stressed cities in the U.S. due, in part, to its incredibly high number of entertainment establishments.In a city powered by tourism and leisure, discussions about overdose and the plight of drug users feel misplaced, too heavy. Allocation of local government funding highlights that disjuncture. In the first half of this year Buncombe county emergency medical services responded to 520 incidents related to overdoses and poisonings. Yet recently when Asheville, Buncombe’s county seat, approved an increased budget for policing in the city, it was to expand the police force in tourist-centric downtown, not to purchase naloxone (which can treat a narcotic overdose in an emergency situation) for every officer.

And U.S. immigration detention seems to be filled with them. News stories abound with images of immigrant women, hands stretched out, as they are ripped from their children. Well-meaning journalists and advocates alike who are trying to achieve maximum sympathy from the audience dramatize the pain and suffering of people in immigration detention to promote reform or abolition.The problem is this victim narrative is not helping us win the fight to abolish immigration detention. If all we see are images of people in immigration detention who suffer, how can we imagine a country where immigrants thrive outside of detention? If all we read are stories of desperate people with little to no agency of their own, how can we expect our culture to embrace a radical shift in immigration policy led by immigrants themselves? The victim narrative leaves no room for moments of resilience and strength, which are essential ingredients in any struggle to dismantle a system. In this way, the victim narrative perpetuates a story that is self-defeating.In a sense, the victim narrative re-detains immigrants, this time into a worldview that says victims―and only victims―are deserving of empathy.The Dutch sociologist Jan van Dijk explains that “victims” lose the empathy of others when they act “in an un-victim-like way by not exhibiting the passive behaviour deemed normal for victims.” It’s easier to tell immigrant stories through a victim narrative because it allows the storyteller and the audience to continue to think of immigrants as the “other” or the “good” victim. The storyteller gets to decide how to portray what immigrants think or feel. The storyteller remains in power, censuring the humanity of their subjects.Under the Trump administration, which has made anti-immigration the cornerstone of its work, coverage of immigration detention has significantly increased. In fact, immigration detention is at least three times more visible now than in 2009.But the narrative remains the same. Rather than reflecting and representing a nuanced understanding of what it means to survive in immigration detention, most news articles present a one-dimensional view of immigrants as passive individuals devoid of the capacity to thrive.We’ve all heard it before: a good story needs a victim deserving of our compassion. But a good story also needs a hero. For us, those heroes are the people in immigration detention, those who have suffered through this horror and their families. They have been victimized by our government, but they have not allowed this victimhood to define them. If we want to end immigration detention, then we must subvert the victim narrative. We must reframe the issue by adopting a new narrative, one that puts people in immigration detention and their families at the center of the story as the heroes. For example, it was heroes held in the privately-run Adelanto Detention Facility who used their bodies as a form of protest in a 300-person hunger strike that led to the introduction of the Dignity Not Detention Act. This month, California Governor Jerry Brown is deciding whether to sign this bill, which will end for-profit immigration detention contracting in a state that incarcerates a quarter of the federal immigration detention population each year.When we refocus the narrative in this way, advocates are required to change their relationship to those in immigration detention. There is no longer a place in this story for advocates at the center as the hero or the savior. For advocates, our place becomes that of an accomplice to the hero―the Robin to the Batman, if you will.Only when we eliminate the victim narrative will we be able to reshape our collective consciousness into one that welcomes immigrants to the center stage. Only when we embrace the power of people in immigration detention will we have a shot at abolishing immigration detention.This opinion piece was co-authored by Christina Fialho and Christina Mansfield. Fialho is an attorney, and Mansfield is a cultural anthropologist. They are co-founders/executive directors of Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC). "
17,ENTERTAINMENT,WWE Fans Shout 'That's Too Far' At Racist Scripted Comments In The Ring,David Moye,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wwe-racist-comments-jinder-mahal_us_59c534a5e4b01cc57ff1d28b,WWE responded with a non-apology for Jinder Mahal's scripted anti-Japanese comments.,2017-09-22,Jinder Mahal delivered a prewritten promo that was laced with racist stereotypes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c535d419000025005652e9.png?cache=zR28E8mih4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pro wrestling has never had any problem trading on racist tropes to arouse the fans, but times may be changing.On Tuesday night’s episode of “WWE Smackdown,” current league champion Jinder Mahal did a promo in which he, well, tried to smack down rival Shinsuke Nakamura. But the crowd didn’t take too kindly to the champ’s insults, which relied on racist stereotypes for laugh lines.“You always ‘rook’ the same,” Mahal said during the live telecast. “They call you Mr. Miyagi,” he added ― a reference to the karate master in the “Karate Kid” movies.Mahal’s backup goons, the Singh Brothers, mimed martial arts poses from those films while laughing hysterically at their leader’s scripted jokes.Typically, these types of racially inspired insults have a WWE crowd roaring in laughter, but not this week at Oakland, California’s Oracle Arena, according to DeadSpin.Instead, many audience members decided enough is enough. They shouted “That’s too far!” in unison. One man could be heard yelling, “That’s too racial.”You can see the complete segment below. The crowd gets upset around the 3:16 mark.Pro wrestlers, especially “heels” like the character Mahal plays, commonly rile up the crowd for effect. But this incident has left a bad taste in the mouths of WWE fans like 15-year-old Noumaan Faiz, who was in the audience.“WWE should have never approved this,” Faiz told The Washington Post. “Racism is definitely an idiotic way to get heat and not necessary.”He added, “It also makes the writers look bad.”Mahal has said that WWE boss Vince McMahon personally helped him with promos, which inspired this remark from blogger Vince Terror at BleedingCool.com:Which makes sense, of course, because who other than a 72-year-old billionaire who thinks burritos are called steak wraps would think the best way to deal with sensitive real-world issues is to reference a movie made in 1984?The rant by Mahal, a Canadian of Indian descent, is also inspiring anger on Twitter: However, Sporting News columnist Kevin Eck argues that context is important in understanding Mahal’s prewritten rant.“Mahal is a heel character who has accused American fans of being prejudiced against him because he’s Indian,” Eck wrote. “Now, in an attempt to get into Nakamura’s head before their match at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view on Oct. 8, Mahal is trying to convince Nakamura that while the fans may cheer him, deep down they are prejudiced against him as well because of his ethnicity.”Eck continued, “Mahal made intentionally bad racist jokes about Nakamura and put the blame on the audience, saying that’s how they truly feel, not necessarily how he feels. It’s not like Mahal is out there angrily spouting racial epithets in an effort to convey that his character is truly racist.”Still, as a result of the outcry, WWE released this statement to The Washington Post:Just like many other TV shows or movies, WWE creates programming with fictional personalities that incorporates real world issues and sensitive subjects. The Post noted that the apology is very similar to the one WWE released in 2015 when it canned Hulk Hogan after company executives heard an audiotape of him using the N-word repeatedly."

DeGioia.“We have been confronted with an abhorrent act of anti-Semitism,” DeGioia wrote, as students and staff marked the beginning of the Jewish High Holidays.DeGioia said the Nazi symbol was “accompanied by threatening and derogatory language advocating for violence against women.”Claire Goldberg, an undergraduate and co-president of Georgetown’s Jewish Student Association, said anti-Semitic incidents have become more common after the 2016 presidential election. In the three weeks since the academic school year began, there have been at least three acts of anti-Semitic vandalism.“It’s been really hard on the community, especially for the new students who are Jewish, to be immediately faced with something so awful,” Goldberg told HuffPost. “It’s also the High Holidays, so it’s been difficult for us to have this time to celebrate the Jewish new year and come together as a community when there’s also someone on campus who is doing these things that are so explicitly anti-Semitic.”Campus and D.C. metropolitan police are investigating the incident, according to a press release by university officials. The university also said campus police have increased surveillance at residence halls and that the perpetrators could face criminal charges.“Georgetown University strongly condemns acts of hatred, racism, bigotry, anti-Semitism, sexism, and Islamophobia,” the university said in the press release.DeGioia noted that it was “disturbing” that the vandalism occurred on Rosh Hashanah, on the same night that he joined campus chaplains and students for holiday services in an auditorium several blocks from the LXR residence hall.The incident highlights security concerns many Jewish organizations are facing during the High Holidays, amid rising anti-Semitism and in the wake of recent neo-Nazi and white supremacist rallies.“Anxiety levels are high,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, told HuffPost. “We’re seeing an increase in anti-Semitic incidents over the past year, and in light of the anti-Semitism at full display in Charlottesville, this public display of hate is fresh in the minds of Jewish groups.”"

He barely knows the difference between Melania and Ivanka.”,2017-09-22,Dozens of medical associations and insurance groups have come out against the Graham-Cassidy legislation to repeal Obamacare.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c49f3e1900003a005651a9.png?cache=7zRndxxkYz&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel continued his crusade against a Senate bill meant to repeal the Affordable Care Act on Thursday night with a pointed attack against President Donald Trump.For the past three nights, Kimmel has used his opening monologue to target legislation co-sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.). The new measure, which GOP leaders are trying to force through the Senate by the end of the month, would compel states to cut programs that would in turn leave millions of people without insurance coverage. The bill would leave states with substantially less money to spend on health care and would also allow them to waive rules that guarantee coverage to those with preexisting conditions.In Kimmel’s Thursday opener, he accused Trump of trying to repeal the ACA simply “because it’s got Obama’s name on it.”“He likes his name on things,” he said. “At this point he would sign anything that meant getting rid of Obamacare. He’d sign copies of the Quran at the Barnes and Noble in Fallujah if it meant he could get rid of Obamacare.”He also prodded the president’s understanding of the measure after Trump sent out several tweets defending Cassidy and claiming the legislation protected those with preexisting conditions, even though experts have said it would directly put such people at risk.“I guarantee he doesn’t know anything about this Graham-Cassidy bill,” Kimmel said. “He doesn’t know the difference between Medicare and Medicaid. He barely knows the difference between Melania and Ivanka.”Cassidy, Graham and their supporters have lambasted Kimmel for stepping outside his area of expertise and politicizing his infant son’s health after he accused the Louisiana senator of lying to him when Cassidy pledged that people would be able to get health insurance regardless of income. In May, Kimmel told viewers his son Billy was born with a congenital heart defect and had undergone open-heart surgery. Of that experience, the host said Wednesday, he “learned there are kids with no insurance in the same situation.” “Some people tell me I should give [Cassidy] the benefit of the doubt, and, you know what, I do give him the benefit of the doubt,” Kimmel said Thursday. “I doubt all the benefits he claims are part of the new health care bill.”The host continued to note that he didn’t believe he was an expert on the topic, but pointed to a raft of medical groups ― representing a majority of the health care system ― who oppose the new Obamacare repeal bill. The list of those lined up against it is extensive and includes the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Heart Association. “His supporters say, ‘Well, he’s a doctor and you’re not. What do you know?’” Kimmel said. “To them I say all of these very reputable organizations ... the list goes on and on, all of these groups populated by doctors say this bill is bad. We haven’t seen this many people come forward to speak against a bill since Cosby.”Watch the full clip above."

Ricardo Rosselló said at a news conference Friday. “We are evacuating everywhere.”The Army Corps of Engineers considers all of Puerto Rico’s 37 dams to be “high hazard potential dams” ― not because they’re all at risk of failure but because of the risk they pose to human lives, the economy and the environment should they fail.Jery Stedinger, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Cornell University who has studied dam safety, told HuffPost that Puerto Rico’s dams are particularly vulnerable because Hurricane Irma also swiped the island just two weeks ago.“We’re seeing a lot more hurricanes these days, and this was back to back,” he explained. “The first one probably got the ground wet, and it really enhances the runoff from the second one.“So when doing dam safety studies, one worries about more than one flood. If you’ve just had a big hurricane come through and the ground is saturated and the reservoir fills up when the second one rolls through, you’re in a really vulnerable position.”A study by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials found extreme weather events like these are by far the most common causes of dam failure.“Those are designed to get you through the maximum conceivable event that would happen,” Stedinger added. “But we’re dealing with people and physical systems, and sometimes worse things happen than we imagine was conceivable.”Travis Waldron contributed reporting."
23,ENTERTAINMENT,Macklemore To Fans: Use Music To Resist Trump,"Ryan Hampton, ContributorAuthor, recovery advocate, person in recovery from a substance...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/macklemore-gemini-resist_us_59c5603ae4b0f2df5e83ae0c,"The rapper's new album, Gemini, is released today, calls for social progress, justice.",2017-09-22,<p>Macklemore’s ‘Gemini’ album release party on Thursday night at Echoplex in Los Angeles.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c5608c190000280056535c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last night, I was in the front row at the Echoplex in Los Angeles when Macklemore took the stage. It was the album release party for Gemini. The crowd was primed. When Macklemore bounded to the mic, the packed venue roared. I wasn’t the only sober one there: it was a massive party of people in recovery, fans, and hip-hop appreciators.Of course, the show was awesome.Tall and animated, with a magnetic presence, Macklemore drops some serious knowledge in his new album Gemini. The album weaves together personal stories of recovery and socially conscious lyrics that insist we’ve got to do better. At the show, he said that “music is resistance,” and called on his fans and listeners to keep rising up and calling for justice.Macklemore speaks a message of inclusion, honesty, and positive change. “I believe that music is a form of resistance, and so is love,” he said. After denouncing the arbitrary visa bans that target Muslim-Americans, immigrants, and Dreamers, he went into his hit “Same Love.” The song supports gay marriage and equal rights for the LGBTQ community. He rapped, “No freedom til we’re equal: damn right, I support it.”His message is resonating with fans. Concert tickets sell out in under three minutes. Macklemore’s massive underground following makes him one of the world’s most successful independent artists. He’s using his platform to discuss issues like the racial violence in Charlottesville, civil rights, and fulfilling America’s promises for everyone. “Regardless of the God you believe in, or the God you don’t believe in, you are welcome here,” he said.Macklemore, whose real name is Ben Haggerty, has always been an outspoken advocate for change. The rapper’s hit tracks, like “Drug Dealer,” call for stronger regulation of pharmaceutical companies. “My drug dealer was a doctor, had the plug from Big Pharma. He said that he would heal me, but he only gave me problems.” The song names the many celebrities and friends who lost their lives to drugs and calls out Congress, Big Pharma, and other billionaire drug dealers. That song really spoke to me, for obvious reasons. I’ve lost too many friends to the disease of addiction, and I won’t rest until the opioid epidemic and the people responsible for starting it, feeding it, and profiting off it are held accountable.Macklemore, who is also in recovery, is open about his status. After a relapse following the 2012 release of his album The Heist with Ryan Lewis, Macklemore is sober again. He told Rolling Stone that coming face to face with his substance use disorder helped him make progress in his music. “And, as it always works, the minute that I start actively seeking recovery — not just sobriety, but recovery — music is there,” he said.His recovery is all over his music. The lyrics of “Drug Dealer” include the Serenity Prayer, which is popular in 12-Step groups like Alcoholics Anonymous. He shares his personal story often in order to smash the stigma of addiction and be a positive role model. Gemini, like his earlier albums, is powerful and introspective, reflecting on the progress Macklemore has made and all the changes he’s undergone. As he points out, hip hop can glamorize thug life, drug dealing, and drug use: his music, however, strives to be a tool for transformation.What he’s doing is working, too. YouTube users often post their sobriety dates in the comments of Macklemore’s videos, as well as personal stories of recovery. One listener shared, “I’ve been an addict since I was 16. I’m 31 and have gone to jail, mental institutions, etc. I’m currently in a private detox and this song is REAL. Thank You Macklemore; I needed you in my darkest time. You lifted my spirit to fight and not give up. The message is powerful.”"

The company recently launched an ad campaign called “Golden Rule,” which highlights the humanity and dignity of diverse communities.“If they’re declaring that their corporate values are centered around diversity and inclusion, then hosting an anti-Muslim hate convention would be counter those values,” Simpson said.The company hadn’t responded to Simpson’s letter as of Friday, he said. A Marriott spokesperson told HuffPost: “We are a hospitality company that provides public accommodations and function space. Acceptance of business does not indicate support or endorsement of any group or individual.”The Southern Poverty Law Center designates ACT for America an anti-Muslim hate group. ACT rejects this characterization.“ACT for America has never, and will never, tolerate any bias, discrimination, or violence against anyone, based on their religion, gender, race, or political persuasion. Freedom to practice one’s religion in peace is afforded to each of us by the U.S. Constitution and we will defend it vigorously,” the organization said in a statement provided to HuffPost.The statement claimed that Muslim Advocates and SPLC are attempting “to redefine legitimate political differences as hate, in an effort to stop any public conversation about them.” It also noted that the conference will include a Muslim speaker, as well as other presenters from underrepresented groups.“By attempting to pressure the venue to cancel it through the distribution of outright lies, Muslim Advocates simply exposes itself as a dishonest political partisan on issues important to millions of Americans,” the statement said.Despite the group’s claims of promoting religious liberty, Gabriel has been quoted as saying, “Every practicing Muslim is a radical Muslim,” according to The New York Times. ACT’s Facebook page also attracts many anti-Muslim users who regularly echo rhetoric that frames Islam as inherently violent and at odds with American values.ACT organized a series of “March Against Sharia” events around the country this summer, attended by a smattering of Islamophobic hate group members, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and armed anti-government militia members.The group has long pushed the conspiracy theory that sharia ― a deeply misunderstood legal or philosophical code within Islam, interpreted differently by Muslims across the world ― poses a threat to the U.S. Constitution. The American Civil Liberties Union debunked this as a myth in a 2011 report.If Marriott refuses to cancel the conference, Simpson said he hoped the company would alert its staff and guests about the event.“The folks who will be staying at the Crystal Gateway Marriott on Oct. 2 and 3 should be made aware that their hotel is not going to be a hate-free zone,” he said. “The employees should know that as well. There are people who are known anti-Muslim bigots who will be there.”"

It’s also estimated that 75 percent of people living with MBC were initially diagnosed with an earlier stage of breast cancer. The #KissThis4MBC campaign hopes to raise at least $200,000 in research funds. “There’s so many barriers to healthcare with people of color and with women, so you have a double whammy when you’re talking about breast cancer,” Longoria said. “I know for the Latino community it’s the aversion of interacting with institutions, whether it’s a bank or a school or a hospital or a doctor. There’s that hesitance to interact with institutions therefore that leads to late detection, late check-ups, catching it too late [or when] it’s developed too far.”“Then as women, we put ourselves last on every list. It’s our kids, it’s our husband, it’s our family, it’s our mom, it’s my job ― everything goes first,” she adds. “So, of course, who suffers is women because they don’t take care of themselves and they don’t put their health as a priority.”Longoria says she also hopes that Latinos become more comfortable advocating for their health and asking for second opinions. “A lot of the women I talk to with MBC, they were misdiagnosed or they got a late diagnosis, even though they went and they asked,” the actress said. “In our community, if a doctor goes ‘You’re fine, you’re fine’ and you go ‘but should I get a sonogram? Should I get that MRI? Should I get that extra thing?’ and when a doctor says ‘No, you’re fine’ we trust that instead of questioning it.”“You have to question it and say ‘I want a second opinion, I want to know is there any other test I should do? Let’s just be safe,’” she adds. “You have to be your own biggest health advocate and sometimes women in our community have trouble doing that.” "

Despite craft chocolate being A Thing since the mid-90s, and the bean-to-bar movement following well in the footsteps of the specialty coffee boom, few writers have dedicated such journalistic and literary attention to the personalities making American chocolate happen. Her stories were just that: stories, not trend pieces or industry insider chatter, examining the obsessions, science, ethics and economics of making quality chocolate for the masses, at a geeky level of particularity that few publishers would allow.After completing her initial plan of 12 profiles, she added on some more, and as these things go, the website became a book. “Bean-to-Bar: America’s Craft Chocolate Revolution” comes out next week. Part cookbook, part story collection and part visually-driven nerdery, it’s a multifaceted crystallization of one idea: The $10 chocolate bar is here to stay, and it’s only the beginning. I sat down with Giller to learn what the future holds for one of America’s fastest growing food industries, and what it all means for our national sweet tooth.The subtitle of your book is ‘The Craft Chocolate Revolution,’ which sounds pretty bold, but there really does seem to be a whole new bean-to-bar industry where there wasn’t one before. What are there, a hundred craft chocolate makers in the U.S.?Even more. Ten years ago there were... five? Now there are over 200. And John Nanci, who started the site called Chocolate Alchemy and figured out how to jerry-rig machines to make chocolate at home, has said that for every one maker who’s at market, there are three or four more in their basements just learning how to make chocolate and about to launch. And it’s only going to explode more over the next few years.What’s causing the boom? Greater access to machinery?That’s part of it. It’s easier to find chocolate-making machines and figure out how to make your own. And there’s also more resources for people, like Chocolate Alchemy. Dandelion Chocolate in San Francisco has a book coming out too, and it’s very technical; I think it’ll be so useful for the industry.At the beginning, most makers had to start from scratch: “How do I roast these beans? What’s the right temperature? How long do I grind and refine?” But as people share more information, it’s going to become easier for newcomers.Which gets to a sticking point I have about craft chocolate — some of it just isn’t very good.It’s certainly on consumers’ minds. It’s not fun to pay $10 for a bar of chocolate and have it not be any good. And it’s a big concern in the industry; there’s a fear that if someone pays $10 for a bad bar of chocolate and is disappointed, maybe they’ll never do it again. For the book I spoke to Michael Laiskonis, who does workshops on chocolate making. As he puts it, “It’s easy to make chocolate. It’s hard to make good chocolate.”It’s a tricky question. There are a lot of makers who are making really fantastic delicious stuff. Then there are others who are still figuring it out. But as the industry matures and more knowledge becomes accessible, I think it’s only going to get better.There’s a great spread in the book, a map of the world showing chocolate-producing regions with a cheat-sheet legend of how chocolates from those places taste. That’s an incredible resource for those of us who are excited about chocolate and want to learn more, but of course there’s variation within those regions too. How’d you approach putting that together?Obviously when you look at each country or region, it’s going to get a lot more complicated very quickly. So as you say, it’s a cheat sheet, more of a jumping-off point for people than a definitive guide. Venezuelan chocolate will have many different profiles. Or look at Brazil. It’s a huge country! It’s impossible to say chocolate from there only tastes one way.But when I was getting started in chocolate, I had no idea how to hold all the data I was getting about regions and profiles in my head. I wished I had a cheat sheet like this. So it was really a selfish thing to put it in there.Sometimes when people obsessively hone in on terroir, they forget how much the manufacturing process matters.Chocolate makers and farmers make 100 decisions about how they’re going to manipulate their product. On the farm level, how you ferment and dry your beans is hugely important. For a long time, most people in the industry weren’t paying much attention to how the beans were fermented at their origins, but now it’s a big deal for a lot of producers.As for the making side, take Madagascar, which is a very fruity bean and sometimes can taste like red fruit, but it can also have a lemon-lime citrus aspect. It can be so acidic that makers have to tame that flavor, burning off different acids in roasting, grinding, and refining to get it to taste good. There are so many ways to alter it.Everyone has a Madagascar bar, and they all taste so different. But the crazy thing is most people are literally using the same beans from Akesson’s plantation. You’re just tasting the differences in how makers choose to roast, grind and refine the beans.Wow, is that happening in other regions?More and more. In some ways it’s really cool because, companies like Maya Mountain [now Uncommon Cacao] are doing great work growing and getting recognition. In another way it’s kind of odd that you have maybe you know, 10 to 15 plantations / co-ops / companies that are now supplying beans to so many makers.That’s a complication for the mythos some craft chocolate companies write, of swashbucklers hunting through the forest for perfect beans no one else can find.What this all comes down to, and what hasn’t really been defined yet, is direct trade. Some makers really are spending time with farmers and working with them directly, and in some cases a few are making great efforts to work with communities. Take Askinosie’s work in Tanzania. They started with a community living in extreme poverty without running water, so they went and built a well. They also started a school program for the kids. Soon Shawn [Askinosie] noticed many of the girls were dropping out, and when he asked why, people told him they were selling themselves to get food for their families, just one meal for the day. So he started a lunch program too, to help keep them in school.This kind of justice work is an anomaly, and Shawn and his family are especially motivated by their faith, but on a broader level, people are also paying more for beans than they used to. Art Pollard of Amano Chocolate will spend a lot of time in chocolate regions and pay farmers three to five dollars a pound for beans. The market price used to be 80 cents.Does the consolidation of growers help farmers negotiate better prices?Absolutely. Maya Mountain is a great example of this. It’s a private company that started in Belize and is now also in Guatemala that buys wet beans from farmers and dries and ferments them for chocolate makers. They ensure the beans are dried and fermented properly, which means they can charge higher prices.They’re not a co-op, but they use some profit-sharing models and have some other social justice goals. Before they started, you’d have coyotes showing up at farms, pointing guns at people, and saying, “I’ll give you this much for your beans.” Scary stuff.Are there any ways for consumers to tell who’s doing legit work and who’s just calling themselves direct trade for show? Are there any conversations in the industry about labeling or certifications to define what the term means?As far as I know now, not yet. The craft chocolate industry is still so young that I think it’ll be a while before we see anything like that. There’s still some basic education they’re focusing on, like educating people about the difference between chocolate makers, who actually turn beans into chocolate, and chocolatiers, who make confections out of finished chocolate.Right now, if someone writes on their packaging or website about their work with specific farms and how they source, I usually trust them. But as the industry grows — and you can take the coffee business as an example — makers will need to figure this out. I remember this one coffee company had two bags of beans, and one said “directly sourced,” and the other something like “sourced from the farmer,” and when I asked the difference, they couldn’t tell me.Narratively, we’re at a familiar point in bean-to-bar chocolate for a lot of specialty food industries. Everyone has all these single-origin bars, and we see photos of rugged chocolate farmers and read about how makers are all paying more attention to the minute variables of how chocolate is made. So where does it go from here?Well, keep in mind that for thousands of years up until the mid-1800s, chocolate was primarily a drink. Historically speaking, the idea of eating chocolate in smooth, solid bar form is a relatively recent one, and people learning how to perfect the specific flavors of chocolate is pretty new. People right now are making the best bars of chocolate anyone has ever tasted.But I know what you mean about that wall. Some makers hit it and don’t know where to go, while others are experimenting more. This’ll sound a little cheesy, but each bean has so many different ways it wants to be expressed.We’re seeing interesting work done with inclusions, and playing with alternative sugars. But what I keep winding up discussing with makers is how to build a sharing culture around chocolate, which is much easier to bake into coffee or beer. Maybe you bring some chocolate bars to a party to share, but as of now you don't go out with your friends on Saturday night to eat chocolate bars.In Montreal, strangely, they have this huge culture of drinking chocolate, and all these places offer it. I don't mean hot chocolate. I mean literally a melted bar that you drink from a snifter, and you can add a little bit of hot water, milk, or whatever to it to get the right texture for you. Crazy, right? You walk into some of these places and they’ll be as crowded as a pub some nights. They use decently good chocolate. But I can’t help imagining how great it’d be if they used the insanely good stuff we can get today.Images excerpted from Bean-to-Bar Chocolate © by Megan Giller.

28,POLITICS,Why Arts Organizations In Atlanta Must Engage Their Local Representatives,"Lara Smith, ContributorManaging Director, Dad's Garage Theatre",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-arts-organizations-in-atlanta-must-engage-their-local-representatives_us_59c2be26e4b063b253178270,"We contribute to the local economy, we employ industry professionals and artists and we help drive sales at local service industry businesses.",2017-09-21,People attending a comedy show at Dad's Garage in Atlanta Georgia.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2cbb81c00003a0079f7ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What is the impact of the arts in our community? The intangible, social benefits of the arts are primarily what we think of when we consider the benefits of the arts. In this way, the arts serve to lift us up, record our histories and spark social change. But how do you quantify these benefits? When political officials ask arts leaders to prove their impact, it’s vital that we can be data-driven to show how vital we are to the community. The arts have an economic impact on a community, which provides a tangible and data-driven way of showing how crucial the arts are to a thriving city. Arts organizations should continue to document the intangible, social benefits of their work but also measure the economic impact they have. As managing director for Dad’s Garage, an Atlanta theater specializing in improv and scripted comedy, I understand how our organization has both a social and economic impact on our community. The intangible social benefits include: providing an affordable and fun night out that can lift spirits, fostering a community of artists dedicated to making work in Atlanta and using our art form to create positive social change. We document these benefits by doing interviews (one patron said the joy and laughter of attending shows at Dad’s Garage helped him get through chemotherapy), charting our community involvement and measuring the number of audiences we reach. Beyond these intangible benefits, we recognize that our organization provides many quantifiable benefits to our community. We contribute to the local economy, we employ industry professionals and artists, and we help drive sales at local service industry businesses.The advocacy organization Americans for the Arts recently published the ”Arts and Economic Prosperity V” report (AEP-V), and partnered with Atlanta Regional Commission to measure fiscal impact of the arts in metro Atlanta. This study found that, “The nonprofit arts and culture sector is a $719.8 million industry in Metro Atlanta — one that supports 23,514 full-time equivalent jobs and generates $64.5 million in local and state government revenue.” As a medium-sized arts organization with a budget of around $1.5 million that employs 45 FTE individuals, Dad’s Garage contributes to this vital sector of our local economy.Arts organizations, like any business, contribute to their economy through spending locally. My organization, like most theaters, builds several sets a year for our plays. When we spend $100 on a drum of paint, part of that $100 goes to pay the sales clerk who ran the transaction. That sales clerk spends that money on groceries at her neighborhood store. The grocery store takes that money and pays their employees, who then pay rent. All along the way, taxes are being taken out to fund local infrastructure and government. According to AEP-V, “Spending by nonprofit arts and cultural organizations totaled $434.8 million in Metro Atlanta during fiscal year 2015.” This money moves through our local economy and supports a variety of businesses and government initiatives.When people come to see a show at Dad’s Garage, they often make a night of it. They have pre-show dinner down the street at one of our local restaurants like Bell Street Burritos or Ammazza Pizzeria, and after they leave the theater they go to a neighborhood bar such as Sister Louisa’s for a drink. In this way, the economic impact of seeing a live theater show is amplified and pumps more money into our local economy. “Event-related spending by these attendees totaled $285 million in Metro Atlanta during fiscal year 2015, excluding the cost of event admission,” reports AEP-V.As Dad's Garage moves into the future, we plan on measuring the economic impact of our organization. For us, this will mean using formulas provided by AEP-V to calculate our economic impact and showing how much we spend locally on goods and services. We will measure these economic metrics as we continue to document the intangible social benefits of our organization. We hope other arts organizations will use the AEP-V to measure their economic impact and share this information with their elected officials. By arming our representatives with this data, they can better advocate for the arts in their community. Atlanta is at a crucial turning point as a city – we are electing not only a new mayor, but also many new city council members. We have been leveraging the data provided through AEP-V to arm candidates with information now before they become elected. When more arts organizations engage their local representatives with this vital data, the more we can grow and prosper as artists and as a community. "

The children of Gordon Hirabayashi, Fred Korematsu and Minoru Yasui ― three activists who took legal action against the government for its treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II ― filed an amicus brief on Monday opposing the ban, which affects refugees and others from six Muslim-majority countries.Previously, the Trump administration defended its executive order, calling it a “national security directive” and arguing that other government powers shouldn’t question the president on such matters. “Federal courts may not second-guess the political branches’ decisions to exclude aliens abroad,” the administration asserted.But the descendents of Hirabayashi, Korematsu and Yasui warn that if the Supreme Court sides with the administration’s view, justices run the risk of repeating history. “In 1943 and 1944, the high court failed to closely scrutinize the government’s case that the treatment of Japanese-Americans was based on “military necessity” – which was a smokescreen for racist anti-Japanese policies,” Holly Yasui, Minoru’s daughter, wrote to HuffPost. She is joined in the brief by Jay Hirabayashi and Karen Korematsu.“We want the court to review closely the current government’s claims of ‘national security’ – which I believe is being used as a justification for anti-Muslim policy,” Yasui wrote.Donald K. Tamaki, an attorney working on behalf of the children of Hirabayashi, Korematsu and Yasui, told HuffPost that the current administration’s defense harks back to the government’s attitude toward Japanese-Americans decades ago. The amicus brief describes the events surrounding then-President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order No. 9066, which essentially enforced a wartime curfew that applied only to Japanese-Americans and ultimately enabled their imprisonment during World War II.Hirabayashi, Korematsu and Yasui all defied the military-enforced orders, and their cases reached the Supreme Court. But in all three cases, the court failed to scrutinize the executive branch’s decision. In the Korematsu case, the court ruled that the wartime incarceration was a “military necessity.” With the court’s “near complete deference” to the executive branch, it “abdicated its critical role in safeguarding fundamental freedoms,” the brief says. “The administration is asking the court again to stand down ... in the name in national security,” Tamaki said in regards to the travel ban. “What we’re worried about is if the court becomes a rubber stamp in this instance, what happens next?”Several Asian-American and civil rights organizations, including Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Japanese American Citizens League-Honolulu Chapter also joined the amicus brief. The participants are not only looking to right the wrongs of the past, but also make sure that discrimination based on ethnicity never happens again.Given Asian-Americans’ history in the country, Tamaki stresses that the descendants of Hirabayashi, Korematsu and Yasui, as well as members of the greater Asian-American community, are specially positioned to speak up against Trump’s travel ban.

The pretty blonde from Delaware first found fame in ‘80s favorites like The Karate Kid, Adventures in Babysitting and Cocktail. It was her wrenching role as a prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, though, that cemented her as a dramatic powerhouse.“People don’t realize how rare it is to be in movies you really care about and you’re proud to be in,” Shue told Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl, reminiscing on the part which garnered a “Best Actress” nod at the 1996 Academy Awards. “Obviously Leaving Las Vegas is one of those for me,” she said amid discussion of new film Battle of the Sexes, which opens in select theatres Sept. 22. “This is another one; I’m grateful I got to be in another film that means as much to me.”Rolling out nationwide Sept. 29, Battle of the Sexes is a biographical dramedy recounting one of the biggest matches in professional tennis history. In an epic 1973 confrontation, the world’s top female player Billie Jean King met self-professed “male chauvinist pig” Bobby Riggs at the sold-out Houston Astrodome, gender-equality hanging in the balance.Emma Stone, fresh from her Oscar-winning turn in La La Land, gives life to King’s struggle not only for pay equality in the sport but acceptance of her own budding identity as a lesbian. As Riggs, Steve Carell makes the former great – whose star is fading even faster than his marriage to Shue’s Priscilla crumbles – both charming and infuriating.While necessarily addressing King’s emerging sexuality, Shue says Battle of the Sexes does not fit neatly into an LGBTQ “pigeonhole” – one which might cause many to dismiss it as “a movie about gay people.” At its core, she insists, is female empowerment. “It’s a movie about women,” Shue declared emphatically during our near 20-minute conversation.“It’s about sexuality,” she admitted, “But it is also about power — and taking back your power ― accepting yourself for who you are, being brave, all these qualities women really struggle to have in our society.”By shining a light on one woman’s historic battle for equality in a male-dominated world, it reminds viewers that – though progress has been made – the Battle of the Sexes is far from over. Its story rings as true today, Shue declared, as it did more than 40 years ago.“I wake up almost every day and hear something about women struggling against sexual harassment or equal pay or self-respect,” the actress told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ Podcast. “It’s an ongoing struggle; it really is.”Shue is optimistic Wonder Woman started a trend in female-led movies earlier this year. Buoyed by particularly strong female viewing demographics, it not only became summer’s biggest blockbuster but also the highest grossing film of all-time directed by a woman. She hopes Battle of the Sexes can strike a similar cord with moviegoers, inspiring ladies to buy tickets to “take a stand.”“There’s a power in films that are good films that show women who are brave and give young women an example of somebody who is willing to put their life on the line for something larger than themselves,” she said.“That’s really important, I think, in our culture,” Shue concluded. “That sends huge signals to the rest of society that women are just as strong as ever.”“Like” Party Foul Radio on Facebook.LISTEN: Elisabeth Shue Discusses Battle of the Sexes, Ross Mathews Talks RuPaul’s Drag Race on Party Foul Radio."

35,WORLD NEWS,France's Far-Right Fractures As Le Pen's Right-Hand Man Ousted,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/france-far-right-le-pen_us_59c40fc2e4b063b25318c7d6,Florian Philippot has quit the National Front amid a split in the party.,2017-09-21,French far-right National Front (FN) vice-president Florian Philippot.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c410701900002500565098.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARIS, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The right-hand man of French National Front chief Marine Le Pen quit the party on Thursday, a split that opens the way for policy changes in the far-right party and shows the depth of internal feuding after Le Pen’s presidential election defeat.The departure of Florian Philippot, for years Le Pen’s closest aide and a key architect of efforts to detoxify the party’s image while campaigning against the euro, had looked increasingly inevitable as the party bickered over who was to blame for a damaging electoral cycle.His exit is expected to allow Le Pen to refocus on core policies around immigration and French national identity, while perhaps softening her anti-euro tone, which many say contributed to Le Pen’s resounding defeat in the presidential election run-off.While Philippot’s departure is likely to increase turmoil in the party at first and others have already said they would follow him out the door, the FN has survived similar crises in the past and analysts expect it to do the same this time. Philippot is seen as too divisive within the far-right to create a party that would be a serious threat.Le Pen, who has shown a sometimes ruthless determination to hold on to power in the National Front, having already pushed out her father Jean-Marie, the founder of the party, withdrew Philippot’s responsibilities within the movement late on Wednesday, leaving him with little choice about his future.“I’m not into being ridiculed, I’m not into having nothing to do. And so yes, of course, I’m quitting the National Front,” Philippot, 35 and a graduate of France’s elite administrative school ENA, toldFrance 2 television.Le Pen, who just last year spoke of having an “intellectual crush” on Philippot, responded tersely that the FN would have no problems of getting over his departure.“One should stop trying to bury the National Front,” she told LCP television. “Every time people have tried to do it, it came out better-structured, stronger and more powerful.”The National Front, which has made major inroads in local, regional and European elections over the past decade without winning any major constituency, will hold a congress in March where internal differences since its defeat to Emmanuel Macron and his new party will come to a head.The far-right party has tried to portray itself as the main voice of opposition against Macron. But that mantle has so far been assumed by Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of the far-left FranceInsoumise (France Unbowed), who is calling for mass demonstrations against the president’s economic reforms.FAR-LEFT THRILLEDAppearing on France’s RTL Radio on Thursday, Melenchon reveled in the turmoil on the far-right.“Excellent, that’s their business. It’s perfect,” he said in reaction to Philippot’s departure. “It’s a party that counts for nothing. Those that were angry but aren’t fascists, I urge them to turn their back (on the FN) and come and join us.”Jérôme Fourquet, an expert on the far-right at polling group Ifop, said Philippot’s exit would deprive the party of experienced policy writers. But he said any exodus was likely to be limited and short of those who quit when Bruno Megret left the party in 1988, when it was led by Jean-Marie Le Pen. Megret created his own party but it never attracted many votes.“Those who leave the FN or are pushed out all end up being marginalized,” Fourquet said.Philippot joined the party in 2011 and rose quickly to become Le Pen’s chief adviser. He was instrumental in crafting her policies and her 2012 and 2017 election manifestos.Sophie Montel, one of Philippot’s closest aides and an FN member for over 30 years, said on Twitter she was quitting the party. So did several other Philippot allies.But other more high profile figures rejoiced, including Le Pen’s partner Louis Aliot.“The FN will finally have some peace of mind away from a sectarian, arrogant, vain extremist who was trying to muzzle our freedom to debate,” Aliot said on Twitter.“He thinks he’s right about everything and... for me he’s an extremist,” he said later, speaking to RMC. “When you show him a poll that says 75 percent of the French people don’t want to leave the euro, his reply is ‘we don’t give a damn, that’s where we are going.’”Robert Menard, an FN ally and a mayor in southern France, was even blunter, saying: “We need to stop with the anti-Europeanism and the Melenchon-type (economic) policies.”Le Pen said the party would continue to fight the EU and wanted a return to monetary sovereignty. But after many flip-flops on the issue, she did not spell out precisely what that would entail.

Even if the AfD underperforms in the election, it’s still likely to pass the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the Bundestag, which would make it the first far-right party to do so since World War II.This marks a major shift in Germany, where the legacy of Nazism still looms and far-right parties have been shunned for decades. But since the AfD’s founding in 2013, it has gained in popularity even as it has increasingly espoused radical ideology.Much like other European right-wing populist parties, such as France’s National Front, the AfD has managed to enter the mainstream in part by packaging its extreme views in ways that make them more publicly acceptable. Rather than offering overt racist statements, the party couches many of its anti-Islam and anti-immigrant claims as appeals to preserving national identity.″[The AfD] is very careful in its interviews and its advertising to try and present its attack on multicultural Germany or the Islamization of Germany not in terms of racism or Aryanism, but in terms of culture,” said Roger Griffin, an expert on fascism and modern history at Oxford Brookes University. “It wants Germany for the Germans,” Griffin told HuffPost, “and the subtext of that is it wants a liberal democratic Germany for ethnic Germans.”The AfD’s message can appear benign to more moderate voters while serving as a dog whistle to those further to the right. For instance, the party’s candidates often talk about a need to reclaim national identity and argue that Germans need no longer atone for the past, but they have not explicitly defended Nazism. One of the AfD’s lead candidates, Alexander Gauland, said last week that Germany has a right to be proud of its soldiers’ achievements in both world wars. When later pressed on his statement, Gauland insisted he was referring to the individual efforts of common soldiers that had nothing to do with the crimes of leadership. “There are two ways to reading all the messaging of the AfD. One is a populist way of reading them, but one is a New Right/neo-Nazi way of reading them,” said Griffin.The ambivalence in AfD statements has allowed its backers to see in the party what they want to see, Griffin argues. Unlike other German far-right parties that have been rejected by voters or even banned for their obvious ties to anti-Semitism and extremism, the AfD has managed to attract a spectrum of supporters ranging from conservative euroskeptics to outright neo-Nazis.The language of the AfD is similar to that of other growing right-wing parties in Europe, which have long been trying to shift public perception that they are too extreme to enter governments. Many such parties left behind naked racism and anything that would evoke the trauma of fascism following World War II. In its place, they began speaking more in euphemisms and veiled ethno-nationalism. “What they’ve done is create this extraordinary newspeak where all of their positions are justified in terms of liberal arguments about right to an identity, right to a separate culture ― arguments about how far a Western culture can absorb a non-Western culture,” Griffin said.“You get racists upholding difference and attacking multiculturalism in the name of the right to have a culture,” he said. “It’s a very careful hijacking of liberal discourse.” The AfD was founded in 2013 as a conservative anti-eurozone party. Within a few years, it underwent a change in leadership and began to focus on opposition to immigration and Islam amid the political turmoil of Europe’s refugee crisis.The party is running two lead candidates in this year’s election, allowing it to rather literally present one face that appeals to more moderate supporters and another that stirs up the nationalist base. (A lead candidate is essentially the person the party would nominate for chancellor if it were to form a government. In the case of the smaller parties, that designation may be largely symbolic.)One of those lead candidates is Alice Weidel, a 38-year-old openly gay economist who calls herself a “classic liberal” and has opposed some of the extreme nationalist sentiments within the AfD. The other, Gauland, is a 76-year-old former member of the ruling Christian Democratic Union who has become a frequent voice for nationalist, anti-Islam and anti-immigration views.In recent weeks, however, both candidates have pushed the limits of the party’s far-right views and faced backlash for their comments. Gauland suggested that Germany’s integration minister, Aydan Özoğuz, should be “dumped in Anatolia” ― meaning Turkey, from where Özoğuz’s parents came to Germany in the 1950s. Merkel called the comment racist in a rare direct rebuke of the AfD.Weidel has also engaged in extremist criticism of immigration and Islam during the campaign. She claimed that the perpetrators of attacks against gay people in Germany were “always” Muslims or individuals of Arab descent, and joined Gauland in a press conference contending that Islam is a political ideology, not a religion. German newspaper Die Zeit reported that in a leaked email from 2013, Weidel called the ruling government a puppet of the nations that won World War II and said the country was “overrun” by Arabs and other minorities.Sunday’s election is a chance for German citizens to indicate how they feel about the extremist discourse that has entered their politics, and polls suggest the vast majority of voters will reject the AfD. But its radical right views have become popular enough that the party will likely gain dozens of seats in parliament and bring the far-right back from the fringe."

When later pressed on his statement, Gauland insisted he was referring to the individual efforts of common soldiers that had nothing to do with the crimes of leadership. “There are two ways to reading all the messaging of the AfD. One is a populist way of reading them, but one is a New Right/neo-Nazi way of reading them,” said Griffin.The ambivalence in AfD statements has allowed its backers to see in the party what they want to see, Griffin argues. Unlike other German far-right parties that have been rejected by voters or even banned for their obvious ties to anti-Semitism and extremism, the AfD has managed to attract a spectrum of supporters ranging from conservative euroskeptics to outright neo-Nazis.The language of the AfD is similar to that of other growing right-wing parties in Europe, which have long been trying to shift public perception that they are too extreme to enter governments. Many such parties left behind naked racism and anything that would evoke the trauma of fascism following World War II. In its place, they began speaking more in euphemisms and veiled ethno-nationalism. “What they’ve done is create this extraordinary newspeak where all of their positions are justified in terms of liberal arguments about right to an identity, right to a separate culture ― arguments about how far a Western culture can absorb a non-Western culture,” Griffin said.“You get racists upholding difference and attacking multiculturalism in the name of the right to have a culture,” he said. “It’s a very careful hijacking of liberal discourse.” The AfD was founded in 2013 as a conservative anti-eurozone party. Within a few years, it underwent a change in leadership and began to focus on opposition to immigration and Islam amid the political turmoil of Europe’s refugee crisis.The party is running two lead candidates in this year’s election, allowing it to rather literally present one face that appeals to more moderate supporters and another that stirs up the nationalist base. (A lead candidate is essentially the person the party would nominate for chancellor if it were to form a government. In the case of the smaller parties, that designation may be largely symbolic.)One of those lead candidates is Alice Weidel, a 38-year-old openly gay economist who calls herself a “classic liberal” and has opposed some of the extreme nationalist sentiments within the AfD. The other, Gauland, is a 76-year-old former member of the ruling Christian Democratic Union who has become a frequent voice for nationalist, anti-Islam and anti-immigration views.In recent weeks, however, both candidates have pushed the limits of the party’s far-right views and faced backlash for their comments. Gauland suggested that Germany’s integration minister, Aydan Özoğuz, should be “dumped in Anatolia” ― meaning Turkey, from where Özoğuz’s parents came to Germany in the 1950s. Merkel called the comment racist in a rare direct rebuke of the AfD.Weidel has also engaged in extremist criticism of immigration and Islam during the campaign. She claimed that the perpetrators of attacks against gay people in Germany were “always” Muslims or individuals of Arab descent, and joined Gauland in a press conference contending that Islam is a political ideology, not a religion. German newspaper Die Zeit reported that in a leaked email from 2013, Weidel called the ruling government a puppet of the nations that won World War II and said the country was “overrun” by Arabs and other minorities.Sunday’s election is a chance for German citizens to indicate how they feel about the extremist discourse that has entered their politics, and polls suggest the vast majority of voters will reject the AfD. But its radical right views have become popular enough that the party will likely gain dozens of seats in parliament and bring the far-right back from the fringe."
38,ENTERTAINMENT,The Night Two Trumpers Befriended Me And The One Thing They Did I Will Never Forget,"Michael Golden , ContributorAuthor of Unlock Congress and cofounder of One Million Degrees",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-night-two-trumpers-befriended-me-the-one-thing_us_59c347e1e4b0be1b32c1972c,Making a couple new pals at a rock show doesn’t put a dent into the politically polarized United States of 2016. But it sure was a refreshing exhale.,2017-09-21,<p>Former U.S. Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) speaks to ASU students in a class on: The Congress. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c3527b1900001600564e5f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My day had already seen a heartening display of nonpartisan engagement. In the afternoon, a staunchly conservative former U.S. Senator, Jon Kyl (R-AZ), joined my class of mostly progressive undergraduate students. For about an hour, Kyl took everyone's questions without a single flinch. When I thanked him for the visit, students gave the Senator a rousing ovation. And after he left, they had only one question for me: ""Are we gonna do this again?!"" So my day was already made. But at the last minute, I’d bought a resale ticket to go see the U2 concert at Phoenix Stadium. Solo. Just me and whomever I might meet at the show. Last time I did that was Sinatra in ’95. Aisle seat then. Aisle seat again. As it turned out, the couple seated next to me started mocking me as soon as they saw me squinting to find my row. We were laughing and talking during the break between Beck and Bono. We quickly learned we had very little in common in terms of our background. We’d both lived in one of the valleys in California for a stretch. We were fans of U2. We were white. Richard and Lisa were truckers, now mostly retired and living in Maricopa, Arizona. And after Richard found out I was a university adjunct teaching politics ― that’s when it got interesting. When Richard said that the president is “just like you and me!” my head nearly exploded. “Richard, that clown ain’t anything like me. Of this, I can assure you ― bulllieve me!” With each verbal punch and “counterpunch” about Hustler Don, we laughed even harder. And when it came to a couple of Richard’s political ideas (within a discussion that HE had engaged me in), we actually agreed. I bought Richard and Lisa a couple of beers. U2 hit the stage and crushed it, as usual. Bono talked about the “Dreamers,” made a little light-hearted fun of Don the Con, and included plenty of the band’s usual, kumbaya visual-messaging in the background. He rocked it. Everyone did. Never have I experienced a U2 concert that didn’t “go to 11.”Toward the end of the show, when you could feel it was coming to a close, I was getting ready to make my dodge-the-traffic, pre-encore exit (this neurotic maneuver runs deep in my family). As they came back from a bathroom break. Richard (his nickname by now was “Martin Mull”), dropped his sweatshirt over my head as they entered the aisle. I laughed, pulled it off and shoved it toward Lisa. She said, “No, it’s yours! Richard said we had to do it.” These virtual strangers had gone and purchased me a Joshua Tree Tour sweatshirt at the concession. They took time out of the performance to buy a gift for some smart-ass professor with opposing political views ― and it cost plenty more than an overpriced beer.I try not to generalize about Trump voters. This can be challenging, especially at times when I feel myself viscerally reacting to the president’s words and actions. But I try as best I can to consider their motivations and understand how they could forgive all of this man’s disgusting transgressions ― even if they also buy into the rest of what I see as a transparently B.S. routine. We didn’t fully get into all of that before the music started shaking Cards stadium. I do remember Richard saying that “Trump is not a politician like the rest of ’em” ― and my replying that he’s a bigger politician than all of them (save for the part that with Trump, none of the desire comes from a place of public service).Yet none of that really mattered. Sure, it was a concert. Sure we’d had a few pops before we met. So what. Ya gotta start somewhere with people. And meeting them where they are is often the best approach. Sometimes, it’s the only approach. It’s odd to say this about a random couple who supported someone for president whom I believe is a verifiable jackass, but I was completely touched by their generous gesture. I don’t generally wear concert gear. But I’ll definitely slide this handsome hoodie on once in a while. Richard and Lisa invited me to Maricopa to hang out. I don’t generally get over to Maricopa much. But now I just might. Making a couple new pals at a rock show doesn’t put a dent into the politically polarized United States of 2016. We’re a country of 330 million people, and the divisions run deep. But it sure was a refreshing exhale from all of the tribal acrimony I’ve been witnessing and, yes, participating in since Nov. 8.The ideas we believe in and the people we vote for are without question important reflections of who we are. But it’s not all that we are. What I took away from this thoroughly fun night may have been a small thing, but it was real: It was nice to meet two nice people ― regardless of their politics. Full stop. Thank you, guys. "

That one idea — a corset in 2017 — triggered a Baader-Meinhof scenario; for the rest of that week I saw them everywhere, from my browser to my backyard, at a streetwear launch party in my hometown of Cape Town, South Africa. They were dressed up, styled down, and worn over everything from men’s banker shirts to sweater dresses, all while being touted as the next evolution of underwear as outerwear.Suddenly, corsets were back in magazines too: On Emma Watson’s Elle UK cover, on Maria Borges for Grazia Australia, on Natalia Vodianova for Porter, and on Madonna for Vogue Italia. They showed up on celebrities like Rihanna — on-tour via Adam Selman, on the runway via Fenty x Puma — Kylie Jenner, and Gigi Hadid. Of all the throwback trends that could take up space in one’s closets these days, I was surprised the corset — once a symbol of women’s oppression — is the one my generation of empowered, active women would choose to unearth. We’ve replaced our push-ups with bralettes and our stilettos with sneakers, and yet, the corset has returned.Its comeback began on the spring 2015 runways: A satin bodice at Jean Paul Gaultier and a gilded sacred heart bustier at Dolce & Gabbana were unsurprising, but my eyebrows shot up at the sight of the “French bodies” at Givenchy, reportedly inspired by traditional folk clothes from northern Italy. Then came an explosion in the fall 2016 collections: Alexander McQueen showed decadently embroidered gowns held up by a skeleton corset of sheer fabric and boning, while now ubiquitous “real-girl” canvas, leather, and denim versions at popped up at Prada, Isabel Marant, and Loewe. The options kept on coming from Balenciaga, Louis Vuitton, and Balmaintoo. Even this season at New York Fashion Week, designers from Tibi and Prabal Gurung to Helmut Lang and Alexander Wang all showed variations of the contraption.But the alarm in my head continued to ring — not just because corsets are back in a big way, but because I, surprisingly, love the way they look, especially in the fresh and often weird way they’re styled, wrapping and shaping our waists in a way I never thought we could. While I found the prospect of wiggling into this latest wardrobe game-changer exciting, I also felt uncomfortable. These centuries-old instruments of everyday torture were used to mold women into a fantasy silhouette that was rarely achieved without pain or genuine damage to their health. We retired them. We banished them. We relegated them to fashion history. Now here they are in all their contemporary glory. And I want to buy one, or a few... But can a feminist wear a corset without being a hypocrite?We’ve living in a time of intersectional feminism, body positivity, and genderless, smart, and adaptive fashion. We’re (gradually) gaining ground for women’s rights around the world, and we’ve mounted an aggressive attack on the gender wage gap. An archaic body-modification device with a controversial history seems a little out of place in our progressive wardrobes. But here I am, trying to decide if I should get one in leather or denim or both.Of course, the contemporary corset I want is definitely not the corset of the 16th century. For form, we’ve gone with modern plastic and polyester instead of steel and whalebone, and barring the waist-trainer-faithful, wearing one today is primarily an exercise in accessorizing, not modification. Modern options don’t bear much of a resemblance to their ancestors either, with soft bralette and belt versions being favored over full-torso designs. Instead of a constrictive undergarment, these are cool and beautiful pieces in materials like light cotton voile and hand-molded leather. But all things considered, these are still corsets, designed to exaggerate the female form — and I still feel a little shook.Fashion’s cyclical nature means there isn’t just the possibility of a comeback — there's the inevitability of one. But the corset always felt like an exception to that rule. When fashion experienced a major silhouette reform in the early 20th century (starting from the pioneering corset-free designers like Paul Poiret and Gabrielle Chanel), women didn’t just push corsets to the backs of their closets — they condemned them. After all, they had seen and experienced everything from the industrial revolution to the sexual revolution of the jazz age to the battle for the women's vote. Meeting an unrealistic standard simply for the pleasure of the male gaze wasn't a high enough aspiration for the people they had become; they could be so much more — and they wanted to be.But the return of the corset represents yet another shift in our state of mind: Is it, again, about stature and empowerment? We’re now wearing them over our clothes, a choice that says almost as much as the choice to bring them back in the first place: If we’re going to wear a corset, it’s going to be on our terms, loose and layered and as unconventionally sutured as possible.We’ve always used fashion to express opinions, align with a cause, or put our personalities on display. In that way, the ability to choose what we wear every day has power, so it makes sense to put that power to use, be it through a feminist Dior T-shirt, a Hillary Clinton-style pant suit, or, in this case, by reclaiming the corset and subverting its oppressive roots. Of course, part of what makes that possible is that today’s version of the corset isn’t just about being perceived as sexy and alluring — the 2017 version is built for modern life, for weekday subway rides, brunch marathons, and probably your Instagram account, too.It’s in the intersection between the corset and its past and present cultural context that brings it full circle. In a world where our choices mattered less, where our voices were stifled, and our roles imposed on us, any opportunity to rebel was significant. Today, despite gender bias and its fallout, women have more space and freedom than ever before to shape our lives as we see fit — not just our waists. That doesn’t make the trend any less disconcerting if you’d written them off entirely like I had. But, we can embrace the fact that living in 2017 means that even though rejecting the corset was a big deal, reintroducing it doesn’t necessarily have to be.We get to choose it for ourselves now, and in doing so, we get to choose what it means. For me, that means adding another layer to my outfit. I’m thinking my new striped pant suit would look great with one, so I’m going to get over my reservations (and silence the voice in my head telling me I don’t have the body for it) and buy one. Not Kim’s Givenchy corset — I’m not best friends with Riccardo Tisci just yet — but something a little like it.By: Modupe Oloruntoba"

For example, cups need to be concave; cutlery needs to be sturdy enough to grip; pot handles need to be positioned opposite one another. Even as new styles come in and out of fashion, these basic principles of utility must be followed.But Athens-based architect Katerina Kamprani has something else in mind. With her project, “The Uncomfortable,” she has devised a series of household objects that are just that. All visually exquisite, upon closer inspection each one has an obvious failing.

My husband and I, along with our four kids and a Labradoodle, love the swimming, the grilling out, the fireworks and the time with friends and family.Last year, however, a cloud of worry hung over the holiday. I mostly kept it to myself, but my intuition as a mother told me that something was not right with one of my identical twins, Griffin.Griffin was a bright-eyed, full-of-life 6-year-old at the time; still enthusiastically playing in his baseball games, still racing his twin brother in the pool at swimming lessons, still wanting to play and wrestle and do all the things kids love to do.Yet something was different. Griffin’s legs had bruises all over them, and not your typical bruises. These were dark red with big knots underneath, and Griffin was unable to account for where he got the bruises.As I watched him swim and play, I knew the next day a trip to our pediatrician would be warranted.The next day we heard what no parent ever wants to hear. “It looks like Griffin has leukemia,” she said.Those words are forever etched in my mind and heart. Our happy world came crashing down in a matter of minutes with one little blood test. Griffin’s blood counts hit rock bottom. He needed medical attention quickly in the form of blood and platelet transfusions.Thankfully, there is St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. It is the most amazing place you never want to be. St. Jude gave our family hope, along with impeccable medical care and genuine love and concern.Griffin was diagnosed with a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).Thanks to research and new treatments, this type of leukemia is now considered one of the most curable. APL is an adult leukemia and extremely rare in children; it only accounts for 1 percent of all childhood leukemias.Griffin underwent eight months of chemotherapy, five days a week, along with multiple transfusions, procedures and surgeries.St. Jude was quite literally our second home, and the wonderful employees became our second family. We made forever friends. We could not have made it through those eight long months without their love and support for Griffin and our family.St. Jude saved our son’s life. Blessing us even further, is the fact that no family ever pays for treatment, travel, housing or food at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.As a stay-at-home mom facing my child’s cancer diagnosis, that news was such a bright light during a very dark time.I was able to be right by Griffin’s side for every single needle stick, chemo infusion, surgery, appointment, and the list goes on and on, thanks to St. Jude providing him with free, lifesaving medical care.Griffin is now cancer-free and enjoying life in remission, life as a normal little boy again.I believe one day in his future he will also be considered cured, thanks to the mission of hope at St. Jude.As Griffin’s mom, I am forever grateful to St. Jude for what they gave to me, and for as long as I live, I will do anything I can to support and help the beautifully unique hospital.Authored by Shannon GooldShannon Goold is the mother of St. Jude patient Griffin. Her family will be participating in the St. Jude Walk/Run to End Childhood Cancer this Saturday, Sept. 23, to raise awareness and support for the hospital.Let’s end childhood cancer.

He had previously only been there for a few morning sessions, and Mallett could tell he was nervous. To ease his worry, she told him about a so-called button they could use to communicate during the day.“He had told me on his first half session he cried because he missed me, so I told him I had a magical power as his mummy and I could share it with him,” Mallett told HuffPost. “His little face was a picture of excitement and wonder as I explained to him that if I put a heart on his hand and mine, if he was feeling sad and needed a hug he could press it and I would feel it and press mine back and he’d get a big hug.”Mallett even drew an extra heart on Max’s arm that day in case the other one rubbed off. The hug button, which is similar to the concept of the children’s book The Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn, soon cured all of his sadness. “At the end of the day I asked him if he got my hugs and he excitedly said, ‘Yep! I pressed mine really hard but I didn’t cry,’” Mallett told HuffPost. “And I told him how I had felt a really big squeeze and sent one straight back to him.”Alison McGarragh-Murphy, editor of The Motherload, told HuffPost that since Mallett shared her idea on the site’s Facebook page, many other moms have written in to say they have tried out the creative idea with their children.“Lots of mums in our lovely supportive community tried hug buttons, too, and found that they also helped their child cope better with going to school for the first time,” she said. “It’s such a sweet, simple way to help your child feel happier and more settled. All you need is a pen, two hands and a lot of love.”Mallett told HuffPost her other kids, who are older than Max, “politely declined” using the hug button, but Max continues to use it. One day, she gave him four buttons, just in case. The mom of three said she was “absolutely in shock” to see her idea resonate with so many mothers.“I simply wrote it as a ‘look at the length us mums go to’ post, and it just spiraled,” she said. “Reading the comments left has been so emotional, hearing stories where my posting this has then helped another child and parent has been so humbling, and I’ve also had some lovely comments about the little things other mums have done to help their little ones.”She said she might write about the hug button in a children’s book so more parents can help their kids handle the sometimes inevitable nerves that come with the beginning of school.“It’s lovely that by doing this it’s brought so many mums together in a wave of emotion as the school year has started and hopefully has made the whole experience better,” she said.This story has been updated to acknowledge similarities between Mallett’s idea and a children’s book.

46,BUSINESS,KB Home Cuts CEO's Annual Incentive Payment In Response To Vulgar Rant (UPDATE),Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kb-home-jeff-mezger-bonus-kathy-griffin_us_59c3cdc2e4b06f93538cfa72,CEO Jeffrey Mezger's mouth is going to cost him money.,2017-09-21,"KB Home CEO Jeffrey Mezger was last awarded a bonus in 2014, and it constituted just over 1 percent of his total compensation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c3df021a00007100f07db3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KB Home’s board of directors pledged Thursday to cut CEO Jeffrey Mezger’s bonus payment by 25 percent this year after he was recorded shouting insults at his neighbor Kathy Griffin.Mezger’s non-equity incentive plan compensation has ranged from $3 million to $4 million in recent years, meaning the penalty for his obscenity-laden tirade could be in the neighborhood of $1 million.KB Home’s first Securities and Exchange Commission filing on the subject said the company would cut Mezger’s “bonus” ― a penalty that would essentially be meaningless, since the CEO isn’t regularly paid a bonus ― and when he is, it’s a pittance compared with his annual compensation.But in a second SEC filing after markets closed on Thursday, the company clarified that by “bonus payment” it meant “non-equity incentive plan compensation payment.” That would deliver a much stronger blow to Mezger. According to its 2016 shareholder report, KB Home last paid Mezger a bonus in 2014. That year, in addition to his total compensation package of $10,349,483, he was awarded a bonus of $125,000:A hypothetical 25 percent penalty on the $125,000 sum would amount to a deduction of $31,250, or just 0.3 percent of Mezger’s total compensation.KB Home didn’t respond to a request from HuffPost detailing the actual dollar amount of the penalty. Earlier this week, HuffPost obtained and published an audio recording of Mezger shouting vulgarities at Griffin after she and her boyfriend reported an hourslong noise disturbance at Mezger’s house to the Los Angeles Police Department on Saturday.In the explicit recording below, Mezger calls Griffin a “bald dyke” and a “cunt,” among other things.“Mr. Mezger regrets losing his temper over a supposed noise complaint involving his three young grandchildren in his swimming pool around 8 p.m. on Saturday, while they were being supervised by their mother and grandmother,” KB Home told HuffPost in a statement regarding the audio recording. “He apologizes for the language he used, as it does not reflect who he is or what he believes.”In its filing with the SEC Thursday, KB Home called Mezger’s behavior “unacceptable and a negative reflection on KB Home.” Mezger has served as the company CEO since 2006.This article has been updated to reflect KB Home’s second SEC filing, which clarified the company’s definition of “bonus.”"

If you haven’t already heard, he hit #28 on the Billboard Club Chart with the first ever male-bisexual pop anthem, ‘Boys & Sometimes Girls.’ He’s also toured with— sigh—Britney Spears and was discovered by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. His songs will make you want to hit the repeat button.Enjoy this dish— Ricky Rebel à la Mode!Me: You have a crazy interesting past in the spotlight. Tell us a little bit about life before you dropped the ‘G’ and became ‘Rebel.’Ricky: In the beginning of my career I was a lead singer in a pop group called No Authority, that was discovered by Michael Jackson and signed to his label MJJ Records (Sony). We made a record with producer Rodney Jerkins and toured Europe twice. The album release party was at Neverland Ranch! Later the group was signed to Madonna’s label Maverick Records and we made another record. The single, “Can I Get Your Number,” was a hit and eventually we opened for Britney Spears.What’s your favorite ‘touring with Britney’ story? Did you have a lot in common?... Like a common love of fabulous shoes?I remember when I first met Britney backstage and we had a chat about our favorite book “Conversations With God.” We also used to trip on how similar we were because we were born on the same day, DEC 2nd. She loves astrology.What made you decide to move on from No Authority? It was an exciting time in my life, but I also was not being artistically fulfilled. I wanted to be a solo artist. And what an amazing solo artist you are. When you and I first met, we instantly became friends. I just had to have you MC some of the live shows I did with my own girl group— In fact, you're the first and only man to have ever graced our stage. And I've danced in your set as well! Tell me about some other artists you’ve clicked with right off the bat!I clicked with you because you had this amazing sensuality. I usually connect with people who have natural charisma. The artists in my Rebel Mafia are people that I had that instant creative connection with. My dancers, Mallory Butcher and Rhon Cameron, for instance, are ‘do or die’ types. I recently met a great artist named Tobias in Philly. He and I instantly connected—We’re in talks to start our own label, Rebel Mafia Records.Great! Sign me up!... So we decided together, ahead of time, that we would talk a little politics in this interview. I think it’s brave that you opted not to omit the topic. As I always say, “open dialogue is key.” I was very much team Hillary. You were team Trump. Did anyone give you a hard time, especially as a bisexual man, who famously and fabulously doesn't conform to stereotypical 'gender norms’?Are you kidding me! It’s like being in the closet all over again. My politically ‘out’ friends, like Joy Villa and Kaya Jones, have had death threats—Some of their youtube videos have been demonetized or taken down. Free speech for conservative points of view have been silenced by Hollywood and left leaning monopolies, like Google. I personally have lost many close friends. It’s been rough, but at least now I know who my true friends are. True friends let you have differing opinions.This was an emotional election. Most of my closest friends and family were for Hillary. But many of them were for Bernie, and some were for Trump— I gave them a really hard time. But at the end of the day, they are my people. I may not always agree with them, but I love them.I still haven’t “come out” officially to my fans. I think a lot of them are going to be upset by this interview, but I know that if they realize that I am still the same person as before, they will get over it. I just have a different perspective.If friends don’t engage in conversations, and at least try to see where the other is coming from, we never really get anywhere. What made you want to get on board the Trump train? I voted for Trump, but that doesn’t mean that I agree with everything that he says and does. There isn’t anyone on the planet that I agree with 100%. Sexually and politically speaking, I go both ways. I consider myself to be a centrist. I lean to the left on most social issues dealing with human rights and equality, and to the center-right on other issues, like national security and job creation. I am not a typical “conservative” in a lot of ways... I mean, look at me! I wear ‘gender-bending’ clothing and I love makeup. I wrote the first male-bisexual pop anthem, ‘Boys & Sometimes Girls.’ My live shows are not ‘conservative’ by any means.If someone really cares about the gays and the well being of women, then the last thing they should want in our country are radical terrorists who despise us; whose cultures and religious beliefs demand that they throw us off of buildings, or do horrible things to women like stone them to death, or destroy their faces with acid. Events like 9/11, the children blown to pieces at Ariana Grande’s concert, the attack at Pulse Nightclub where 49 people were massacred by a homophobic radical... these things shattered my heart and pissed me off. Yes, there’s evil that exists in all different types of people, but the monstrous violence, the murdering of gays and the heinous oppression of women that’s taught in some cultures, are undeniably more apparent in certain parts of the world. A lot of Americans can ignore these realities, but I refuse.The thing about ‘echo-chambers’ is that they prevent progress. I want to hear what different people have to say, and to do this, I can’t be too easily offended. The important thing for me, as an Arab-American, having lived in a war zone, is that we all communicate our different perspectives. I’ve seen bombs falling outside my window and I think it’s important to share those realities and experiences. I can't imagine what that must’ve been like. That's why I think that's it's important that we stay intellectually honest about the dark side of reality. I’m also not one to be easily offended. I get angry or sad, but rarely get offended. People use “I’m offended” to get their way, to shutdown what someone else is saying. I don’t follow ideologies that I am ‘supposed’ to think. I’ve never been a conformist. I’ve always been big on listening to different perspectives and finding common ground as a starting point... After the election, I lost that part of myself for a minute. But when you look at the bigger picture, that can be kind of dangerous.Absolutely. We need to balance things out and come together. Globalists and the so-called elite, seek to separate us into tribes so that they can divide and conquer us. True patriots will never let that happen.Speaking of patriotic, you rocked an American flag jumpsuit that caught the attention of CNN... You don’t conform when it comes to your style either— I love that. Your audience seems entranced every time you step on stage, and I know you adore them as much as they adore you. Who are some of your favorite fans?I do adore my fans. I have fans that message me everyday. They just want to know how I’m feeling. They share their lives with me and it is nice to connect. It’s always been a challenge for me to be vulnerable with people, but having this instant connection with them and feeling their support, and giving my support right back, has had a positive impact on how I deal with people in my day to day life. My fave fans are the ones that have stayed with me from the start. Rachel Strauss comes to mind. She was going through a really difficult time in her life and she told me that my music helped her to heal. I value her friendship. I make some of my more deep tracks with the thought that maybe someone out there, like Rachel, is going through some dark times and finding consolation through my music.You put out the first ever male-bisexual pop anthem. People needed that representation. You “like the boys, boys, boys, boys, boys... and sometimes girls.” What should your fans be looking forward to now?October 31st, I am unleashing my album, ‘The New Alpha,’ and doing a tour to promote the record and the first single, “If You Were My Baby.”Can’t wait! My wife and I were bopping around to “If You Were My Baby” last night. Anything else we should know?October 7th I’m performing at the ‘Las Vegas Coming Out Party’ with Diana Ross. October 8th I’ll be attending the Cinemoi International Film Fashion Awards and performing at the VIP after party. October 14th I’ll be headlining ‘OctoberFest’ in Phoenix. October 21st, the Rebel Mafia and I are going to be rocking ‘Las Vegas Pride.’ Finally, November 18th, I’m performing at the ‘American Influencer Awards’ at Novo DTLA. I’m going to be one busy sequined Rebel!Yes, please!"

It does.”Last year, Greg Rucka, a “Wonder Woman” comic writer confirmed that Diana was bisexual. The admission wasn’t much of a surprise, however, considering that the character’s origin story takes place on the female-only island of Themyscira. Rucka told Comicosity:“It’s supposed to be paradise. You’re supposed to be able to live happily. You’re supposed to be able — in a context where one can live happily, and part of what an individual needs for that happiness is to have a partner — to have a fulfilling, romantic and sexual relationship. And the only options are women.”He continued: “Now, are we saying Diana has been in love and had relationships with other women? The answer is obviously yes.”Collier-Pitts sites Rucka’s comments in her petition and asks: “Why is it so hard to translate this for the silver screen?”She describes the struggle of coming to terms with her own sexuality when there was a lack of positive representation of in pop culture. “We are oversexualized and underrepresented,” she wrote. “We are called greedy, dishonest, and confused.”She added: “Making Wonder Woman canonically bisexual on the big screen would make her the first openly LGBTQ superhero of any gender from either DC or Marvel’s cinematic universes, and would solidify her place as a true role model for women of all ages and identities.”"

Foreseeing",2017-09-21,<p>CEOC volunteers feed South Miamians after Hurricane Irma.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c3f3b81c00003b0079fa81.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Thomas KennedyIn the last couple of weeks, Floridians have struggled with Hurricane Irma and its aftermath. Foreseeing the impact that this storm would have on low-income communities, a coalition of various community organizations came together to form the Community Emergency Operations Center (CEOC).The CEOC helped people directly impacted by Hurricane Irma not only in South Florida but also in other Florida Counties, with staging areas in the Florida Keys, Naples and Tampa. In Miami alone, the CEOC was in 12 different neighborhoods distributing food and supplies to more than 12,000 residents. The organization says it has provided more than 20,000 meals in Florida.I personally helped these efforts in Miami-Dade County, and while on the field, I saw things in my community that unsettled me deeply. Whole apartment buildings, like the Buena Vista Complex in Little Haiti or the Joe Moretti senior center in Little Havana were without power. People across the county were dealing with extreme heat, little access to food or water, no cell phone service, debris filled streets and of course, no electricity.What was apparent was that the official response from Miami-Dade County towards those living in the poorest and most marginalized neighborhoods was inadequate. Most places we went, folks told us that they had no contact with officials and were struggling to find basic things such as ice to cool themselves down.The most vulnerable end up paying the steepest price. In Hollywood, eight seniors died at a nursing home, even though a hospital was located across the street. The nursing home staff said they did all they could to protect the patients and called a hotline established by Florida Governor Rick Scott, but received no answer. On Wednesday, the state closed down the nursing home saying the staff lied in the medical records of the patients.In the South Dade Center, a subsidized housing project for the farm-worker community in Homestead, residents said they felt abandoned after the center flooded and lost power during the storm. “This community seems like it’s been forgotten,” Salma Jaramillo told the Miami New Times. Her grandfather lives in the center. “There’s still a lot of trash here. It’s really, really hot. The houses are made from cement blocks, so they heat up really fast.” Jaramillo said she saw fallen trees still wrapped around power lines, as well as children, not work crews, removing debris from the street.After days without power resulted in extreme heat and forced residents to sleep outside, activists from immigrant rights groups such as the Florida Immigrant Coalition and WeCount blasted the City of Homestead with social media posts and calls. These efforts resulted in cleanup crews showing up hours later and power being restored the next day.What is perhaps most unnerving of all is that Miami did not even suffer a direct hit by Hurricane Irma. It is clear that Miami-Dade County and our energy utility Florida Power & Light (FPL), are not properly prepared to handle a crisis should a category 5 hurricane actually hit the city. Furthermore, when Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez was criticized during a budget hearing over his response performance, he chose to smear the very same organizations providing relief rather than take constructive criticism. ""I’ve never heard of these people,"" said Gimenez during a break in the hearing. ""So, their claim of feeding people, etc., etc., I don’t even know if it’s true. I know the county response was very good. In the street, we get complimented all the time.""An equitable emergency response plan must be developed and properly funded to address the needs of low income communities in Miami-Dade County, and policies to protect vulnerable immigrant communities must be implemented to make sure that there is trust between the public and law enforcement in these times of emergency. We need our elected officials to stop making excuses and start taking responsibility for the wellbeing of all their constituents.Thomas Kennedy is a communication fellow for the Center for Community Change."

According to a statement put out by the church in 2012, prohibited items are “alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and ‘hot drinks’ ― taught by church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.”Still, there is a lingering stigma against caffeinated drinks among some Mormons, especially the older generation. At BYU, the “honor code” requires that students do not partake in “alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and substance abuse.”Rachel Densley, 22, said she was super jazzed about the change, and didn’t expect to see much opposition from students. “Within our generation, I’ve never met anyone who is morally opposed to caffeinated sodas, so I think any backlash will fade over time,” she said.At one table, Grant Casper, 19, a marketing student, and Andrew Kiser, 22, who is undecided on his major, sat and slowly enjoyed their sodas before class.Casper called the soda a godsend.“It’s nice to have a kick to start the day,” he said.“It’s a big day,” Kiser said. “It’s the first day that Coke has come to BYU, so you have to partake.”Ashley Lee at The Daily Universe contributed reporting."

She marched in anti-abortion rallies, stood outside clinics with signs, and volunteered at crisis pregnancy centers. Now, looking back at age 29, Annie wishes her parents hadn’t pushed her so hard to actively participate in a cause she didn’t quite understand at the time. “I know, somewhere,” she told HuffPost, “there’s a picture of me holding a sign as a kid that read, ‘Would You Kill Me, Too?’”“[Being forced to protest at such a young age] made me yell slogans for an issue I did not comprehend, and I deeply regret the hurt I probably caused as a child,” said Annie. “I remember women walking past me into a clinic, crying when they saw me.”Annie’s experiences as a young child in the anti-abortion movement (if not her feelings about those experiences) are far from unique. Across the U.S., kids of all ages are woken up early on Saturday mornings and brought to local abortion clinics to protest with their parents. They pray, sing, pass out fliers, decorate sidewalks with chalk, or hold signs and posters.While passing down religious and political beliefs is a natural part of parenting, and certainly not a bad thing, many patients, companions, clinic escorts and abortion providers that HuffPost spoke to question the role children are pushed to play in the anti-abortion movement. While anti-abortion leaders see children as an integral part of their protesting strategies, abortion rights advocates see young people being used as pawns to harass women making private health care decisions.The anti-abortion movement has long used images of children in their marketing materials and posters. Protesters might carry posters featuring a baby or a young child’s face, with words like, “Would you kill me, too?” overlaying the photo. Many volunteers at Crisis Pregnancy Centers pass out pamphlets and fliers outside abortion clinics that include photos of happy-looking families or smiling children. But the role children play extends outside of appearing on posters.Kids are also leading prayers or engaging in group prayers led by religious leaders, speaking anti-abortion rhetoric into megaphones or microphones, and passing out literature from crisis pregnancy centers.There is perhaps no better manifestation of the movement’s use of children than last Saturday morning’s Youth For Life march in Charlotte, North Carolina, outside of A Preferred Women’s Health Center (APWHC), one of the biggest abortion providers in the south. Love Life Charlotte, a conglomeration of churches in the Charlotte area who have come together to protest abortion access, was granted a parade permit by the city for Saturday morning for their Youth For Life march. According to Love Life Charlotte, about 40 churches bused in children of all ages to march outside the clinic. Justin Reeder, the founder of Love Life Charlotte, told HuffPost that the event was an opportunity for youth members to “see how being pro-life is not just being against abortion but also offering love and life to those who feel abortion is their only option.”“As our nation continues to become more pro-life (Editor’s note: a recent Gallup poll showed that 49 percent of Americans currently identify as “pro-choice” while 46 percent identify as “pro-life”) it’s important for young people to see how much love and life the Church can bring to those who feel abortion is their only option,” Reeder said. “The youth are not engaging people, but rather praying that God ushers in a culture of love and life to a place where mothers feel so alone and afraid.” The youth march drew close to 1,000 participants on Saturday, according to Love Life Charlotte. The patients and patient companions that HuffPost heard from said that the sheer number of people marching outside the clinic coupled with the noise that they were making ensured an overwhelming and distressing experience for anyone moving in and out of APWHC. Two volunteer clinic escorts were so upset by the number of children participating in the demonstration that they left in tears. Though Reeder said that the aim of the march was not to “engage” with the clinic’s patients, the protest very much affected the appointments of APWHC’S patients. Although the participants never touched any of the patients, they did address them, often directly. At one point, a 17-year-old member of Love Life Charlotte wept into a microphone, begging women who she called “Mom,” not to murder their babies. A small group of kids performed live music into microphones so that their songs could be heard from inside the clinic.A Preferred Women’s Health Center is located at the bottom of Latrobe Drive, home to various local businesses on a wide two-lane road. Because Love Life Charlotte had been granted a parade permit, they were able to block off one of those lanes, thus disrupting the usual flow of traffic. Members of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department were present to direct traffic and make sure members of all parties ― Love Life Charlotte, other anti-abortion groups, and Pro Choice Charlotte counter-protesters ― were abiding by all of the rules. Calla Hales, clinic administrator at APWHC, has been skeptical of the police presence at these protests for a long time ― especially after an incident this summer in which members of CMPD were seen entertaining young kids from Love Life Charlotte while their parents prayed and protested outside APWHC.(HuffPost reached out to CMPD for comment about this incident and did not hear back in time for publication.)On Saturday morning, in preparation for the youth march, Hales had her staff pass out confidential questionnaires for patients to fill out once they’d made their way into the clinic. Just entering the clinic on Saturday meant passing not just the parade of children praying and singing at them, but also the usual gamut of aggressive protesters, and the three mobile crisis pregnancy centers and their nurses who often try to divert traffic away from the clinic. Of the 22 patients or patient companions who filled out the questionnaires, which were obtained by HuffPost, 12 of them said that the number of people on the street made them consider leaving their already-hard-to-get appointments. One woman wrote, “I was scared to death of all those protesters.” Another person, who was a patient’s companion, commented, “I should not have to watch my friend be shamed and emotionally attacked for one of the hardest personal choices she has ever made.” “They yelled into my car and embarrassed and upset my friend,” a second patient companion wrote on their feedback form. “Music ridiculously loud, able to hear inside the clinic. Very disturbing.” And one woman, who had brought her daughter to the clinic, complained in her feedback form that on her way down Latrobe Drive to get to the clinic, she had been told by anti-abortion protesters to park “way way away from where I was supposed to be ― I am also handicapped.” While Love Life Charlotte’s youth march was an extreme example of child-based anti-abortion demonstrating, children all over the country are party to anti-abortion protests at the behest of their parents and their parents’ religious groups. According to patients and clinic staffers that spoke to HuffPost, this participation sometimes crosses the line from simply attending a protest to engaging in harassment. One volunteer clinic escort based in Atlanta, Karen, told HuffPost that at the clinic she volunteers at, she’s seen an increase in this kind of harassment since the 2016 election. “Since the election, we have a group from Abolish Human Abortion (AHA) and they often bring at least one little girl to participate in holding giant signs and speaking into the wireless-amplified megaphone,” Karen said. “The little girl will read from the Bible or from an AHA script. It’s clear [these girls] have no real understanding of what they are reading.”Karen recalled an incident in which one of these young girls looked at her and called her “evil.”“With direct eye-contact she asked me, ‘Why are you doing this? Why do you want to make money off of murdering babies? Do you know you are evil? Do you know you will burn in hell?’” Karen told HuffPost. “It’s chilling to see young children used this way ... I’ve seen babies being carried as props, and toddlers tagging along as props with the AHA group.” In Michigan at Northland Family Planning, one anti-abortion protester, Elvis Kesto, regularly brings his son, a toddler, to stand outside and protest with a sign that says, “Babies Are Murdered Here.” Kesto regularly posts photos of this onto his Facebook page.Jessica James, a clinic escort at Northland Family Planning, argues that forcing children to engage in the abortion debate outside clinics is akin to “religious and emotional abuse.”“My issue is with the long-term effects of what I consider to be religious and emotional abuse on a child that doesn’t have a choice in the matter,” Gird, who is training to be a social worker, told HuffPost. Steven Meyers, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at Roosevelt University in Chicago, told HuffPost children that young “have limited perspective taking abilities, so they will have difficulty understanding what others experience.” “Their emerging cognitive abilities mean that they don’t understand the complexity of issues and are more likely to perceive events in black-and-white terms,” he said. “Their stage in moral development involves mainly pleasing their parents and avoiding punishment rather than having the ability at this point to grapple with abstract or complicated decisions.”In other words, anti-abortion protesters’ kids will follow the lead of their parents, regardless of the emotional consequences it will have on patients, because of their innate want to do right by their mother and father. Of course, parents across the political spectrum encourage their kids to engage in political discourse. There were many children at the Women’s March on Washington the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and many of their photos and posters went viral. Meyers sees a clear difference between the Women’s March ― or any other peaceful march in a neutral space ― and anti-abortion protests, which often involve targeting individuals outside of clinics.“The main difference between [the Women’s March and anti-abortion protests] is the amount of conflict and negative emotion that children are exposed to at these events,” he said. “Peaceful and orderly marches have the advantage of allowing parents to share their values with their children in ways that are more likely to be constructive teaching experiences. High conflict demonstrations can become more volatile and potentially distressing to young children.” Annie, whose political views have changed since she held signs outside her area abortion clinic, agrees with this assessment. “I remember first hearing about the concept of abortion when I was 6, I believe, when Bill Clinton got elected,” Annie told HuffPost. “My parents said it was a crime, for he wanted to kill babies.”She also said that she’s had a hard time engaging in political demonstrations, because it brings back uncomfortable memories. “I tried to attend an anti-Trump [protest] recently, and almost had a panic attack at the yelling, because it reminded me of the hurt I probably caused as a kid,” she said. “Whenever I see kids in any sort of political protest now, I just want to hug them and hide them away, even if I fundamentally agree with the idea they’re protesting.” By 11am on Saturday, after the Youth For Life rally and over an hour of marching and praying in the humid North Carolina end-of-summer heat, two young girls from Love Life Charlotte fainted. The two young teenagers were too faint to stand up. They were both ultimately fine, but the rest of Love Life Charlotte, including Reeder, carried on up the hill to finish their parade, while only a handful of youths and a couple of adults waited with the girls. As all of this was happening, a member of another anti-choice group, Cities4Life, yelled prayers into a microphone, and begged women to come out of the clinic. “Abortion is child abuse,” he said. *Names have been changed "

It’s clear [these girls] have no real understanding of what they are reading.”Karen recalled an incident in which one of these young girls looked at her and called her “evil.”“With direct eye-contact she asked me, ‘Why are you doing this? Why do you want to make money off of murdering babies? Do you know you are evil? Do you know you will burn in hell?’” Karen told HuffPost. “It’s chilling to see young children used this way ... I’ve seen babies being carried as props, and toddlers tagging along as props with the AHA group.” In Michigan at Northland Family Planning, one anti-abortion protester, Elvis Kesto, regularly brings his son, a toddler, to stand outside and protest with a sign that says, “Babies Are Murdered Here.” Kesto regularly posts photos of this onto his Facebook page.Jessica James, a clinic escort at Northland Family Planning, argues that forcing children to engage in the abortion debate outside clinics is akin to “religious and emotional abuse.”“My issue is with the long-term effects of what I consider to be religious and emotional abuse on a child that doesn’t have a choice in the matter,” Gird, who is training to be a social worker, told HuffPost. Steven Meyers, clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at Roosevelt University in Chicago, told HuffPost children that young “have limited perspective taking abilities, so they will have difficulty understanding what others experience.” “Their emerging cognitive abilities mean that they don’t understand the complexity of issues and are more likely to perceive events in black-and-white terms,” he said. “Their stage in moral development involves mainly pleasing their parents and avoiding punishment rather than having the ability at this point to grapple with abstract or complicated decisions.”In other words, anti-abortion protesters’ kids will follow the lead of their parents, regardless of the emotional consequences it will have on patients, because of their innate want to do right by their mother and father. Of course, parents across the political spectrum encourage their kids to engage in political discourse. There were many children at the Women’s March on Washington the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and many of their photos and posters went viral. Meyers sees a clear difference between the Women’s March ― or any other peaceful march in a neutral space ― and anti-abortion protests, which often involve targeting individuals outside of clinics.“The main difference between [the Women’s March and anti-abortion protests] is the amount of conflict and negative emotion that children are exposed to at these events,” he said. “Peaceful and orderly marches have the advantage of allowing parents to share their values with their children in ways that are more likely to be constructive teaching experiences. High conflict demonstrations can become more volatile and potentially distressing to young children.” Annie, whose political views have changed since she held signs outside her area abortion clinic, agrees with this assessment. “I remember first hearing about the concept of abortion when I was 6, I believe, when Bill Clinton got elected,” Annie told HuffPost. “My parents said it was a crime, for he wanted to kill babies.”She also said that she’s had a hard time engaging in political demonstrations, because it brings back uncomfortable memories. “I tried to attend an anti-Trump [protest] recently, and almost had a panic attack at the yelling, because it reminded me of the hurt I probably caused as a kid,” she said. “Whenever I see kids in any sort of political protest now, I just want to hug them and hide them away, even if I fundamentally agree with the idea they’re protesting.” By 11am on Saturday, after the Youth For Life rally and over an hour of marching and praying in the humid North Carolina end-of-summer heat, two young girls from Love Life Charlotte fainted. The two young teenagers were too faint to stand up. They were both ultimately fine, but the rest of Love Life Charlotte, including Reeder, carried on up the hill to finish their parade, while only a handful of youths and a couple of adults waited with the girls. As all of this was happening, a member of another anti-choice group, Cities4Life, yelled prayers into a microphone, and begged women to come out of the clinic. “Abortion is child abuse,” he said. *Names have been changed "
57,WOMEN,When The Person Shaming You For Your Abortion Is A Child,Jenavieve Hatch,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-the-person-shaming-you-for-your-abortion-is-a-child_us_59b85545e4b0edff97175c96,How the anti-abortion movement uses children to legitimize its message.,2017-09-21,A page from a Human Life (crisis pregnancy center and anti-abortion organization) pamphlet. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2a6091c00003a0079f73c.png?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Annie* was just 8 years old when her Southern Baptist parents started taking her to protest outside abortion clinics in Southern California. She marched in anti-abortion rallies, stood outside clinics with signs, and volunteered at crisis pregnancy centers. Now, looking back at age 29, Annie wishes her parents hadn’t pushed her so hard to actively participate in a cause she didn’t quite understand at the time. “I know, somewhere,” she told HuffPost, “there’s a picture of me holding a sign as a kid that read, ‘Would You Kill Me, Too?’”“[Being forced to protest at such a young age] made me yell slogans for an issue I did not comprehend, and I deeply regret the hurt I probably caused as a child,” said Annie. “I remember women walking past me into a clinic, crying when they saw me.”Annie’s experiences as a young child in the anti-abortion movement (if not her feelings about those experiences) are far from unique. Across the U.S., kids of all ages are woken up early on Saturday mornings and brought to local abortion clinics to protest with their parents. They pray, sing, pass out fliers, decorate sidewalks with chalk, or hold signs and posters.While passing down religious and political beliefs is a natural part of parenting, and certainly not a bad thing, many patients, companions, clinic escorts and abortion providers that HuffPost spoke to question the role children are pushed to play in the anti-abortion movement. While anti-abortion leaders see children as an integral part of their protesting strategies, abortion rights advocates see young people being used as pawns to harass women making private health care decisions.The anti-abortion movement has long used images of children in their marketing materials and posters. Protesters might carry posters featuring a baby or a young child’s face, with words like, “Would you kill me, too?” overlaying the photo. Many volunteers at Crisis Pregnancy Centers pass out pamphlets and fliers outside abortion clinics that include photos of happy-looking families or smiling children. But the role children play extends outside of appearing on posters.Kids are also leading prayers or engaging in group prayers led by religious leaders, speaking anti-abortion rhetoric into megaphones or microphones, and passing out literature from crisis pregnancy centers.There is perhaps no better manifestation of the movement’s use of children than last Saturday morning’s Youth For Life march in Charlotte, North Carolina, outside of A Preferred Women’s Health Center (APWHC), one of the biggest abortion providers in the south. Love Life Charlotte, a conglomeration of churches in the Charlotte area who have come together to protest abortion access, was granted a parade permit by the city for Saturday morning for their Youth For Life march. According to Love Life Charlotte, about 40 churches bused in children of all ages to march outside the clinic. Justin Reeder, the founder of Love Life Charlotte, told HuffPost that the event was an opportunity for youth members to “see how being pro-life is not just being against abortion but also offering love and life to those who feel abortion is their only option.”“As our nation continues to become more pro-life (Editor’s note: a recent Gallup poll showed that 49 percent of Americans currently identify as “pro-choice” while 46 percent identify as “pro-life”) it’s important for young people to see how much love and life the Church can bring to those who feel abortion is their only option,” Reeder said. “The youth are not engaging people, but rather praying that God ushers in a culture of love and life to a place where mothers feel so alone and afraid.” The youth march drew close to 1,000 participants on Saturday, according to Love Life Charlotte. The patients and patient companions that HuffPost heard from said that the sheer number of people marching outside the clinic coupled with the noise that they were making ensured an overwhelming and distressing experience for anyone moving in and out of APWHC. Two volunteer clinic escorts were so upset by the number of children participating in the demonstration that they left in tears. Though Reeder said that the aim of the march was not to “engage” with the clinic’s patients, the protest very much affected the appointments of APWHC’S patients. Although the participants never touched any of the patients, they did address them, often directly. At one point, a 17-year-old member of Love Life Charlotte wept into a microphone, begging women who she called “Mom,” not to murder their babies. A small group of kids performed live music into microphones so that their songs could be heard from inside the clinic.A Preferred Women’s Health Center is located at the bottom of Latrobe Drive, home to various local businesses on a wide two-lane road. Because Love Life Charlotte had been granted a parade permit, they were able to block off one of those lanes, thus disrupting the usual flow of traffic. Members of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department were present to direct traffic and make sure members of all parties ― Love Life Charlotte, other anti-abortion groups, and Pro Choice Charlotte counter-protesters ― were abiding by all of the rules. Calla Hales, clinic administrator at APWHC, has been skeptical of the police presence at these protests for a long time ― especially after an incident this summer in which members of CMPD were seen entertaining young kids from Love Life Charlotte while their parents prayed and protested outside APWHC.(HuffPost reached out to CMPD for comment about this incident and did not hear back in time for publication.)On Saturday morning, in preparation for the youth march, Hales had her staff pass out confidential questionnaires for patients to fill out once they’d made their way into the clinic. Just entering the clinic on Saturday meant passing not just the parade of children praying and singing at them, but also the usual gamut of aggressive protesters, and the three mobile crisis pregnancy centers and their nurses who often try to divert traffic away from the clinic. Of the 22 patients or patient companions who filled out the questionnaires, which were obtained by HuffPost, 12 of them said that the number of people on the street made them consider leaving their already-hard-to-get appointments. One woman wrote, “I was scared to death of all those protesters.” Another person, who was a patient’s companion, commented, “I should not have to watch my friend be shamed and emotionally attacked for one of the hardest personal choices she has ever made.” “They yelled into my car and embarrassed and upset my friend,” a second patient companion wrote on their feedback form. “Music ridiculously loud, able to hear inside the clinic. Very disturbing.” And one woman, who had brought her daughter to the clinic, complained in her feedback form that on her way down Latrobe Drive to get to the clinic, she had been told by anti-abortion protesters to park “way way away from where I was supposed to be ― I am also handicapped.” While Love Life Charlotte’s youth march was an extreme example of child-based anti-abortion demonstrating, children all over the country are party to anti-abortion protests at the behest of their parents and their parents’ religious groups. According to patients and clinic staffers that spoke to HuffPost, this participation sometimes crosses the line from simply attending a protest to engaging in harassment. One volunteer clinic escort based in Atlanta, Karen, told HuffPost that at the clinic she volunteers at, she’s seen an increase in this kind of harassment since the 2016 election. “Since the election, we have a group from Abolish Human Abortion (AHA) and they often bring at least one little girl to participate in holding giant signs and speaking into the wireless-amplified megaphone,” Karen said. “The little girl will read from the Bible or from an AHA script.

58,POLITICS,Alabama Senate Front-Runner: Evolution Is Fake And Homosexuality Should Be Illegal,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-religion_us_59c2bd8be4b063b2531781a2,"Former judge Roy Moore says ""God's law"" should trump man's.",2017-09-21,"Then-Alabama chief justice Roy Moore speaks outside the state judicial building in Montgomery on Aug. 25, 2003.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c415441a00002400f07eca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore has approached his work over the decades as he once approached mastering kickboxing and building a house with own hands: with laser focus and a fervent belief that he has God on his side.Moore, 70, is vying to become the next U.S. senator for Alabama, and his chances are looking good. A poll released Monday by Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling found that the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court holds an 8-point lead in the Republican primary run-off over his opponent, U.S. Sen. Luther Strange, who was appointed by Alabama’s governor in February to temporarily fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Whoever wins will face Democrat Doug Jones, whose odds are low in the overwhelmingly red state.Both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and President Donald Trump back Strange. But Moore’s unabashed religious views and apparent disregard for the legal establishment have won hearts in the overwhelmingly Christian state.In February, several months after being suspended from court for defying federal orders on same-sex marriage, Moore appeared on the radio show of a pastor who has claimed the Bible calls for the death penalty for gay people.He’d appeared on pastor Kevin Swanson’s program several times over the years, and there was a clear affinity between the men who believe they are two lone crusaders for Christ. Moore lamented to Swanson: “Our problem today is we’re denying that there is even a God or that he has sovereignty over our country.”When the pastor asked him: “What does one do when God’s laws conflict with man’s laws?” Moore responded, “God’s laws are always superior to man’s laws.”It’s an extreme view that would put an elected judge far outside the bounds of the legal mainstream: The U.S. government relies on its judicial branch to maintain checks and balances and uphold the law of the land. But, for Moore, there’s no contradiction. The Vietnam veteran and lifelong Christian holds the view that the U.S. Constitution is a kind of extension of the Bible, and that the Founding Fathers intended their America to be a Christian nation.In 2014, he went so far as to suggest that the First Amendment applies only to Christians. Speaking at an anti-abortion luncheon, Moore said: “Everybody, to include the U.S. Supreme Court, has been deceived as to one little word in the First Amendment called ‘religion.’”He claimed that the country’s leaders don’t want to acknowledge “the duties we owe to the creator and the manner of discharging it,” paraphrasing from the Virginia Declaration of Rights.“They don’t want to do that, because that acknowledges a creator God,” Moore argued. “Buddha didn’t create us. Mohammed didn’t create us. It’s the God of the Holy Scriptures. They didn’t bring a Quran over on the pilgrim ship, Mayflower. Let’s get real. Let’s go back and learn our history.”Moore, who counts former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and “Duck Dynasty” star Phil Robertson among his supporters, has a long history of flouting U.S. law in favor of his own religious beliefs.In 1997, Moore defied a federal court order to halt Christian prayers before sessions and remove a homemade plaque of the Ten Commandments he kept in his courtroom. He counter-sued the ACLU for allegedly infringing upon his freedom of speech and declared that the Constitution is “founded upon a fundamental belief in God.”Four years later, he erected a massive granite monument to the Ten Commandments in the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery. When a federal judge ordered Moore to remove the monument, he refused. As a result, Alabama’s judicial ethics panel removed Moore from office ― his first tenure as chief justice.The trial seemed to further convince him of his divine charge. After the verdict was read out in court, Moore told reporters: “I have absolutely no regrets. We fought a good fight. We kept the faith. But the battle is not over. The battle to acknowledge God is about to rage across the country.”Over the ensuing years, Moore twice sought the Republican nomination for Alabama governor ― in 2006 and 2010. And in 2012, he launched a campaign to reclaim his old post as the state’s chief justice. Moore toured anti-abortion rallies during his campaign, telling crowds: “This is not just about religion, this is about law; the organic law of our country.” For Moore, issues like abortion and same-sex relationships are part of this “organic law” and are as clearly defined as the law of gravity.“Sodomy is against the laws of nature,” he told The Washington Post in a recent interview. “Let’s say the court decides to get rid of the law of gravity and says you can jump off the Empire State Building. Can they do that? No, they certainly can’t do that.”In a 2002 child custody case during his first term as Alabama chief justice, Moore called being gay “an inherent evil” and “abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature and a violation of the laws of nature and of nature’s God.”Moore has said he believes “homosexual conduct should be illegal” and that same-sex relations are akin to bestiality. After the U.S. Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states, Moore, who’d been reelected as chief justice of Alabama, instructed state judges to flout the order. In September 2016, he was once again removed from court for the remainder of his term.But he wasn’t deterred. Moore announced his run for U.S. Senate several months later and continues to share his extreme views on the campaign trail. “There is no such thing as evolution,” he recently told a Washington Post reporter. “That we came from a snake? No, I don’t believe that.”Equally ludicrous to Moore is the idea that non-Christian faiths have the same religious legitimacy as his own. During a campaign stop this summer the candidate called Islam a “false religion” that’s “completely opposite with what our First Amendment stands for.”Moore has also suggested that the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks happened because the U.S. has “distanced” itself from God. He claimed God was angry at Americans who “legitimize sodomy” and “legitimize abortion.”He used the same logic in August to say that “shootings” are also a result of rulings against prayer in public schools and council meetings. “We’ve asked for it,” Moore said at an event on defending religious liberties. “We’ve taken God out of everything.”The former judge views everything from child abuse to rape to the high murder rate in Chicago as symptoms of America’s moral decline. And he continues to use apocalyptic religiosity in his campaign, recently telling worshippers at a church in Decatur, Alabama: “You think that God’s not angry that this land is a moral slum? How much longer will it be before his judgment comes?”Moore’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of the former judge’s comments."

She became a fierce critic of American-led wars, a vocal advocate for radical transparency and a prime target for U.S. intelligence services, which subpoenaed her private Twitter messages. At home, she helped jail crooked bankers whose dealings prior to 2008 sent the Icelandic economy into a tailspin, pushed for constitutional reform and passed a law to make her tiny island nation of less than 335,000 people a haven for press freedom. But now she’s taking her fight to the sidelines. Iceland’s ruling coalition collapsed last week amid uproar over Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson’s failure to disclose his father’s role in helping to expunge the record of a convicted child rapist, forcing the embattled leader to call a snap election for Oct. 28. Jónsdóttir, 59, will not run, she told HuffPost in her first interview with U.S. media since making her decision last weekend.“I feel like it’s time pull back, recharge my batteries and focus on how I can be of service,” she said moments after plopping down on a couch in a windowless meeting room of Iceland’s Parliament building. She didn’t remove her black scarf or long black coat, stitched with Gustav Klimt-like designs. “I’ve been working so much, and it’s been so intense.”She sighed. It had been a long weekend. One day after reconvening following a summer break, the conservative government fell apart Friday when one of the three parties in the coalition pulled out, eliminating its narrow one-seat majority. The head of Parliament canceled a budget debate and refused to schedule any sessions after that. Jónsdóttir spent the weekend lobbying party leaders to hold at least one more session before the Parliament disbanded for good after the snap election.Her goals were threefold. For one, she wants to push through reforms that would make it easier for Iceland to amend its constitution. Under the current law, amendments need to be adopted by the Parliament, then approved again by the next set of lawmakers following another parliamentary election. The new proposal would allow Parliament to put changes to a national referendum vote. But once she leaves office next month, she fears it could be years before lawmakers take the issue up again. “We’re trying to push for this change before the Parliament is dissolved or we will not be able to do anything for the next four or eight years,” she said. “We’re really stuck.”For another, with parliamentary unable to convene, Jónsdóttir worries Benediktsson ― whom she called the “crime minister” ― would use his remaining weeks in office to make new appointments or change budgets for state-run enterprises.“There’s a lot of maneuvers they can still do,” she said, referring to his cabinet officials. “It’s very difficult to have the oversight over these things happening when you don’t have the tools of the Parliament.”Lastly, Jónsdóttir wants to go down fighting. She expected to stay in office much longer. When she first entered electoral politics, she vowed she wouldn’t run for more than two terms. But after the Icelandic government collapsed last year amid a scandal over then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s secret offshore investments were revealed in the Panama Papers leak, she ran for a third time to secure herself a full term. But she won’t break that pledge twice.“She made the promise and she has to keep it,” Bogi Ágústsson, a political expert and journalist at the Icelandic broadcaster RUV, told HuffPost. “But she has not quit politics, definitely not.” The populist Pirate Party stands to gain in the next election. The party tripled its support last year, in what Bloomberg called the “most internationally watched election in Iceland’s history,” and now has more experience in actual government. Jónsdóttir is likely to remain an influential voice shaping its platform. “She’s far too much of a political animal to leave politics,” Ágústsson said. He noted that the Pirate Party eschews traditional hierarchy, but that, as its co-founder and best-known member internationally, Jónsdóttir isn’t likely to disappear in the rank and file. “They’re supposed to be all equal,” he added. “But, as in George Orwell’s book Animal Farm, some animals are definitely more equal than others. She will definitely be more equal than other animals, even as a private citizen.” Still, he said, he wouldn’t be surprised to see her run for office again in a few years. For now, Jónsdóttir, who became a published poet at 22, said she plans to return to writing. She hopes to chronicle what she’s learned as a legislator and possibly set up a think tank to dig into issues of government transparency and digital rights. “Oh, my God, I feel free,” she told HuffPost in an earlier interview on Sunday. “I don’t have to think about what I’m saying in regard to being part of a sort of hive. I’m free.”  "

Jónsdóttir, 59, will not run, she told HuffPost in her first interview with U.S. media since making her decision last weekend.“I feel like it’s time pull back, recharge my batteries and focus on how I can be of service,” she said moments after plopping down on a couch in a windowless meeting room of Iceland’s Parliament building. She didn’t remove her black scarf or long black coat, stitched with Gustav Klimt-like designs. “I’ve been working so much, and it’s been so intense.”She sighed. It had been a long weekend. One day after reconvening following a summer break, the conservative government fell apart Friday when one of the three parties in the coalition pulled out, eliminating its narrow one-seat majority. The head of Parliament canceled a budget debate and refused to schedule any sessions after that. Jónsdóttir spent the weekend lobbying party leaders to hold at least one more session before the Parliament disbanded for good after the snap election.Her goals were threefold. For one, she wants to push through reforms that would make it easier for Iceland to amend its constitution. Under the current law, amendments need to be adopted by the Parliament, then approved again by the next set of lawmakers following another parliamentary election. The new proposal would allow Parliament to put changes to a national referendum vote. But once she leaves office next month, she fears it could be years before lawmakers take the issue up again. “We’re trying to push for this change before the Parliament is dissolved or we will not be able to do anything for the next four or eight years,” she said. “We’re really stuck.”For another, with parliamentary unable to convene, Jónsdóttir worries Benediktsson ― whom she called the “crime minister” ― would use his remaining weeks in office to make new appointments or change budgets for state-run enterprises.“There’s a lot of maneuvers they can still do,” she said, referring to his cabinet officials. “It’s very difficult to have the oversight over these things happening when you don’t have the tools of the Parliament.”Lastly, Jónsdóttir wants to go down fighting. She expected to stay in office much longer. When she first entered electoral politics, she vowed she wouldn’t run for more than two terms. But after the Icelandic government collapsed last year amid a scandal over then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson’s secret offshore investments were revealed in the Panama Papers leak, she ran for a third time to secure herself a full term. But she won’t break that pledge twice.“She made the promise and she has to keep it,” Bogi Ágústsson, a political expert and journalist at the Icelandic broadcaster RUV, told HuffPost. “But she has not quit politics, definitely not.” The populist Pirate Party stands to gain in the next election. The party tripled its support last year, in what Bloomberg called the “most internationally watched election in Iceland’s history,” and now has more experience in actual government. Jónsdóttir is likely to remain an influential voice shaping its platform. “She’s far too much of a political animal to leave politics,” Ágústsson said. He noted that the Pirate Party eschews traditional hierarchy, but that, as its co-founder and best-known member internationally, Jónsdóttir isn’t likely to disappear in the rank and file. “They’re supposed to be all equal,” he added. “But, as in George Orwell’s book Animal Farm, some animals are definitely more equal than others. She will definitely be more equal than other animals, even as a private citizen.” Still, he said, he wouldn’t be surprised to see her run for office again in a few years. For now, Jónsdóttir, who became a published poet at 22, said she plans to return to writing. She hopes to chronicle what she’s learned as a legislator and possibly set up a think tank to dig into issues of government transparency and digital rights. “Oh, my God, I feel free,” she told HuffPost in an earlier interview on Sunday. “I don’t have to think about what I’m saying in regard to being part of a sort of hive. I’m free.”  "

LOUIS ― Not far from the courthouse where a white former police officer was acquitted Friday in the shooting death of a black man, a federal judge said in a hearing that officials in the suburb of Ferguson had made “good progress” since 2014.Barricades and yellow police tape surrounded the building Tuesday, evidence of the protests that have been going on since Jason Stockley was found not guilty in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith. But the mood was more hopeful inside the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry, who is overseeing the federal consent decree struck last year between Ferguson and the Justice Department. At issue in the decree are the unconstitutional policing practices that came to light in 2014 after a white police officer shot and killed an 18-year-old black man named Michael Brown. In the hearing, Jude Volek of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division told Perry that the DOJ was committed to seeing reforms through in Ferguson. Volek said the city had made “good faith” efforts to meet the demands of the consent decree, which came about after federal investigators issued a damning report finding that the city, among other abuses, had treated residents as sources of revenue rather than as citizens to be protected.The sunny progress report on Ferguson came against the backdrop of the demonstrations in St. Louis. While there had been some vandalism in the later evening hours, Monday’s protest did not result in any property damage. The police response had been aggressive at times, with St. Louis Metropolitan Police officers chanting “Whose streets? Our streets!” after arresting citizens en masse (at least one journalist among them) on Sunday evening.Despite the concerns of St. Louis residents about policing in their city, it’s a safe bet that the city won’t be forced to implement reform the same way Ferguson was. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made it clear that the Trump administration won’t be pursuing “pattern and practice” investigations that examine the conduct of police departments systemically rather than focusing on individual incidents. And last week, on the day Stockley was found not guilty, the DOJ announced that it was backing away from “collaborative reform,” a more gentle way of implementing changes to police conduct through the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), a process that had been underway in the St. Louis County Police Department.Volek told the court that the city had rescinded ordinances, made “really incredible progress” on its use-of-force policies thanks to Ferguson Police Commander Frank McCall, boosted assistance and support for officers in dealing with the stress of their jobs, taken “really proactive steps” on officer pay, and put in place a new judge who brought a “fresh approach” to the municipal court. There’s still plenty of work to be done, Volek said, citing the backlog of “thousands of cases” in the municipal court system predating Brown’s 2014 death.Apollo Carey, an attorney for Ferguson, admitted to the court that the city had a large backlog of cases. He said the city needed to prioritize its work on the backlogged boxes of files to determine whether there is “good cause” to continue prosecuting the cases when outstanding arrest warrants could carry significant repercussions for citizens accused of minor violations.Carey said the city has 42 officers and wants to bring it up to 50. Hiring is taking time, he said, because the city wants to properly vet candidates and “not just be putting bodies in uniforms and sending them out on the street.”Natashia Tidwell, the court-appointed monitor overseeing the implementation of the consent decree, agreed that Ferguson had made progress on municipal court reform, calling the new municipal judge a “breath of fresh air” who obviously had “empathy” for the individuals appearing before him. But she said that thousands of people still had warrants out and “could be living in constant fear” that they’ll be arrested. She pointed to a case mentioned in the Justice Department’s report on Ferguson involving Fred Watson, a Navy veteran who lost his high-paying job after being arrested under questionable circumstances by an officer with a history of allegations of excessive force. Watson is suing the city of Ferguson, and prosecutors finally dropped the five-year-old case against him last week following extensive media attention.But a municipal court case shouldn’t have to “appear in The New York Times,” Tidwell said, for a Ferguson prosecutor to take a second look at it. At the end of the hearing, Perry said progress is being made even if it’s not happening as quickly as some people would like. She thanked the Justice Department for sticking with the case.Ferguson City Manager De’Carlon Seewood told HuffPost that changes have certainly been made in the city. He cited a recent incident in which a man was standing in front of his home with a gun asking for police to shoot him. Officers were able to talk to him and calm him down without using deadly force.“You don’t hear that, especially not in St. Louis,” Seewood said. “The officers that have come to Ferguson now are the ones who are dedicated to the community, they’re excited to be in the community and they actually want to see positive things occur.”Ferguson Police Chief Delrish Moss, appointed in May 2016 after a career in the Miami Police Department, told HuffPost that the process has been slow and methodical, and perhaps not the quick turnaround that some might have expected. Hiring has been difficult, he said, but not because of the consent decree. Moss has hired eight police officers but lost five. Some went to other agencies; some decided to pursue other careers. But in a couple of cases, he said, people were “invited to leave, for lack of a better way of putting that.” He wanted to be “very careful” about who the city hired to patrol the streets and said it took 60 to 65 applications to get one officer.“You can train the hand, but you’ve got to hire the heart,” Moss said. “If you hire people with good character and respect for the community, I think you can give them the skills to be a police officer, and part of that process is painstakingly going through backgrounds and social media footprints, all those things to make sure you get the right people.”“Under the circumstances and the different steps we have to go through, I think we’re doing pretty well,” said McCall, the Ferguson police commander, who is charged with implementing the terms of the consent decree.Moss said the Ferguson Police Department is in a much better place than it was before the unrest. He cited both the new hires and the officers who stuck around throughout all the changes.“Think about the ones who stayed on. They’ve gone through something that most police departments never experience, and yet they’re still here day in and day out showing their commitment. I think they are really committed to this process, and I think it’s a compliment to them,” Moss said. “The police department’s outlook and view is vastly different than it used to be. We’re working with the community. We are enjoying that relationship. As a young police officer, when you see progress being made in relationships, it’s infectious.”"

Lynne DiSanto, the Republican whip in the state’s House of Representatives, wrote: “I think this is a movement we can all support.” The tasteless post, which was later deleted, cost DiSanto her job as a real estate agent. “Due to recent events, Lynne Disanto is no longer associated with Keller Williams Realty Black Hills,” the company wrote on Facebook. However, House Majority Leader Lee Qualm told the Argus Leader newspaper that DiSanto was not in danger of losing her whip position.“Obviously I think she wishes she had not put it out there, but she was quick to pull it down and it seems like one of those things you do without putting much thought into it,” Qualm told the newspaper. The Sept. 7 post came less than a month after Heather Heyer was killed. She was run over on Aug. 12 while protesting against white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. DiSanto also apologized, but only to people who took offense to her post. She defended the image itself as a cautionary lesson. “I am sorry if people took offense to it and perceived my message in any way insinuating support or condoning people being hit by cars,” DiSanto told the Rapid City Journal. “I perceived it differently. I perceived it as encouraging people to stay out of the street.”Others disagreed with that interpretation. “To put up a meme that pretty much encourages violence and possibly murder, that’s inappropriate,” Lori Miller, a spokeswoman for the group Indivisible Rapid City, told the Argus Leader. “She’s a community leader and an elected official.” “The right to peaceably assemble is fundamental to our democracy ― so fundamental, in fact, it is included in the First Amendment to our Constitution,” South Dakota Democratic Party Executive Director Sam Parkinson said in a news release.He described the image as “offensive and beneath the dignity of the office Rep. DiSanto holds.”Last week, a sheriff’s department in Washington was forced to apologize after sharing the same meme. "

That would be absurd, right? If anyone’s for peace, they’re against ethnic cleansing... right?You’d think so. Unfortunately, Aung San Suu Kyi hasn’t lived up to her Nobel Peace Prize. After worldwide outrage over Suu Kyi’s silence over the ongoing Rohingya exodus, she finally mentioned the crisis this Tuesday — only to deliver a misleading address worthy of a dictator or coward rather than a peace-prize winner.As Suu Kyi spoke, more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims had already fled a military ”operation” that’s been called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Countless others have died, and many of the 400,000 who’ve escaped to Bangladesh are stateless, homeless, and without medical aid. Although Suu Kyi claimed that there haven’t been further “clearing operations” since September 5, satellite images of burning villages flatly contradict that claim. (Human Rights Watch estimates that up to 62 villages were torched between August 25 and September 14.)Anti-Muslim sentiment is nothing new in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. Indeed, the country’s government has long denied citizenship to Rohingya, ahistorically arguing that they are illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. The current crisis began when such anti-Muslim sentiment turned murderous after an August 25 attack by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which killed twelve security officers in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state.While Suu Kyi — now “state counselor” and Myanmar’s de facto leader — condemned ARSA during her speech, she downplayed the military’s own atrocities. In addition to her false claim that “clearing operations” stopped on September 5, she asserted that Muslims have similar access to government resources as non-Muslims, even though several reports have found that Muslims are disproportionately being denied access to healthcare and other lifesaving services.Everyone acknowledges that Suu Kyi is in a tricky position. She may be Myanmar’s top government official, but she holds a civilian post in a country that was only recently freed of military dictatorship. In addition to the risk of angering generals, Suu Kyi likely fears the perception of the democratic masses. Neither reason is a good excuse for silence in the face of ethnic cleansing.In 1990, before her political ascendance, Suu Kyi pronounced that “[f]ear of losing power corrupts those who wield it.” Time will tell whether power has corrupted State Counselor Suu Kyi."

The campaign features compelling stories from people across the United States who have been affected by mental illness, including Luanna’s story below.By Luanna D.I met the man who would become my husband in a psychiatric hospital—he was a psychologist, and I was a psychiatric worker, my first job after college. For more than 25 years, we shared intertwining personal and professional lives, but then came financial reversals, an affair, and the marriage dissolved.As a result of the loss of that relationship, I became severely depressed, but now I feel much more compassion for my patients because I understand on a deeper level what it is like to feel helpless and hopeless about the future.I had previous personal experience with mental illness. My younger brother, Jonas, had been diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 17, and I saw how the stigma of his illness led to shame and further isolation in my family.My extended family didn’t understand my brother’s problems and would make excuses—like he had a skiing accident—as to why he wasn’t able to participate in family functions.My brother died of lung cancer in 2008, and my marriage fell apart a short time later. I lost weight and withdrew from the world. It wasn’t until I was placed on an antidepressant that I felt strong enough to follow my own psychotherapist’s advice—to actively seek out the support of others. I relocated my residence and practice to my hometown, where I reconnected with friends from high school and college, and joined several groups, where I made new connections.It provided emotional support for me. I also worked hard in my own psychotherapy and focused on rebuilding my personal life and professional practice.I enjoy working with young people in particular, because I know that a little nudge in the right direction can have a big impact on someone’s life. I am astonished at comments from patients who say that some of their friends and family members assume that if they are going for counseling, they must be messed up.Going to therapy doesn’t mean that you are messed up; it means that you want to be connected to your own life. Those individuals who are in psychotherapy are among the healthiest and strongest people I know.Luanna is a 62-year-old psychologist from Massachusetts.

68,POLITICS,How St. Louis’ Only City Synagogue Became A Safe Haven For Protesters,Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/st-louis-church-synagogue-protesters_us_59c2844be4b087fdf5098e70,Along with a Unitarian church across the street.,2017-09-20,Rev. Gary James speaks to police in St. Louis Friday night.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2881b1a00002400f07a6d.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The evening of Sept. 15 was a quiet Friday night for Rabbi Randy Fleisher, a leader of the Central Reform Congregation, the only synagogue within St. Louis city limits. Shabbat services were winding down, and two congregants were celebrating the one-year anniversary of their religious conversion with cake, hummus, cheese and crackers. But Central Reform was planning to stay open unusually late. And across the street, the lights of the First Unitarian Church of St. Louis stayed on too. Earlier that day, a judge had handed down a controversial verdict acquitting Jason Stockley, a white former police officer, of murder. In 2011, Stockley fatally shot Anthony Lamar Smith, a black driver. Police reform activists had promised demonstrations if Stockley was acquitted, and Central Reform and First Unitarian were prepared to welcome anyone peacefully seeking sanctuary. As people ate, someone noticed a large march going past. Congregants went outside to wave at hundreds of protesters sweeping past the synagogue. A few activists stepped inside to say hello or get a glass of water. The march was peaceful. But not long after, someone damaged the nearby home of St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson (D). “Everyone kind of dispersed wildly, realizing that this was not the same demonstration they wanted to be a part of,” said Shira Berkowitz, who participated in the protest and serves as the director of advocacy and communications at the synagogue. Riot police arrested protesters and used tear gas to dispel crowds. Soon, dozens of demonstrators poured through the synagogue’s door, seeking refuge.In 2014, the synagogue opened its doors all night to protesters after a grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, the white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. But Ferguson, where those demonstrations took place, is miles away from St. Louis proper, and few protesters actually came to the synagogue that year. Friday was different: This time, a couple hundred activists spent time in the synagogue, Fleisher said. Fleisher said he spoke to an officer who told him police weren’t going to go after people in the building. Some time later, an officer came to the door and noted that anybody who was in the synagogue could stay there ― but any protester who left would do so at their own risk. “Because the order to disperse was already given, anyone who exited the space was subject to arrest if they chose not to disperse from the streets,” Schron Jackson, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis police department, told HuffPost in an email. “The [Central Reform Congregation] was aware of this.” Across the street, other protesters took refuge in the First Unitarian Church. On church property outside, police threatened to arrest or pepper-spray people who didn’t go inside the building, said Lynn Hunt, a religious educator with the church. Police never attempted to go inside, she said. She and Rev. Gary James said they saw one arrest on church property. James told an officer that the police did not have the authority to make arrests of people gathered peacefully there. “I’m not sure if arrests were made on the Church/Congregation property, as we have multiple arrests at that intersection,” said Jackson, the police spokeswoman. In the U.S., people can’t legally avoid arrest by entering a place of worship. But the relationship between the state and religious sanctuaries is complicated and has been for many centuries. The ancient Greeks and Romans allowed people accused of crimes to seek asylum in sanctuary zones, and Christian sanctuaries subsequently spread in Europe. In England, “civil authorities would cut off food supplies to the church, storm it or set it on fire to force the issue,” according to a 2012 Washington City Paper column on a religious sanctuary. (In England, the church’s right to grant sanctuary was abolished around 1624.) U.S. churches served as safe havens on the Underground Railroad and later played an important role for protesters during the civil rights movement. The Ku Klux Klan beat parishioners at Mount Zion AME Church in Mississippi in 1964, looking for civil rights activist Michael Schwerner, then burned down the church. In the 1980s, the mother of Tawana Brawley — a teenager who, a grand jury concluded, made false rape allegations — took sanctuary in Baptist churches to avoid testifying. At the time, Rev. Al Sharpton dared authorities to arrest Brawley’s mother. “Show the nation the moral beast you are and come through these doors,” he said. Today, hundreds of churches have declared themselves sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants. There is no law requiring the federal government to respect those declarations ― but it generally does so. “As a purely legal matter... the immigration agency can if it wants to, come into a church to arrest someone,” said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University. But with some exceptions, its Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s policy not to focus on “sensitive locations” like “places of worship” in order to “enhance the public understanding and trust,” according to ICE’s website. (There is a concern, however, that the Trump administration is testing the boundaries of this policy.)“In my experience, it would be an individual policy by the department, and they would have to figure out based on local custom and wishes how they dealt with that,” said Dick Odenthal, a retired captain from the Los Angeles Sheriff Department who has experience in more than 100 riots. In his own career in L.A. County, Odenthal said, the question “never came up.” The St. Louis police department does not have a policy on arrests in places of worship, Jackson said. From a practical standpoint, “if the police just wanted to break up what they viewed as a riot, sheltering in the church accomplishes that,” said Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on religious liberty. “They are no longer rioting.” Charges could always be filed later, Odenthal pointed out. In St. Louis, congregants had to stay in the synagogue on Friday until around midnight, when police cleared the area. But people in both the church and the synagogue described the atmosphere as peaceful. People went into the sanctuary space and “laid on the floor, sat in chairs, just hung out or ate a lot of food,” said Berkowitz, who participated in the protest. Later, there were reports that white nationalists had started an anti-Semitic hashtag, #GasTheSynagogue, in response to the incident. Fleisher said it was his understanding that the hashtag only appeared in a handful of tweets. A Twitter spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.“To serve as a shelter of peace often means [doing so] in times of distress in the city,” Berkowitz said. “So we are trying to open our doors any opportunity that we have, to be that kind of protection to people who need it.” "

The controversial brand’s online shop is currently selling $30 “Psychic Vampire Repellent” from Paper Crane Apothecary. Goop also carries two other products from the retailer, including “Chill Child” kid-calming mist and a “Clean Slate” mist so you can start fresh. The vampire repellent’s name is troll-worthy, but the description of the spray is actually quite fun. “Is there a person in your life who seems to drain the life right out of you, yet you just can’t seem to get them out of your mind?” the explanation reads. “You, my friend, are dealing with a Psychic Vampire! Spray this mist around your aura to evict them from your head and create a shield that they will not be able to penetrate.” We’ve all had some negative people in our lives we need to banish, but it’s unclear how an expensive spray will help ward those people off. Especially a product that says it’s made of love (love is listed first in the ingredients), reiki (an energy healing technique), sonically tuned reverse osmosis water and charged crystal chips.The psychic spray also includes special elixirs of “ruby, black tourmaline, aqua aura, pyrite, fluorite, ametrine, garnet, bloodstone, tiger’s eye, labradorite, nuummite and clear quartz” if you’re into gems and “deeply aromatic therapeutic oils, reported to banish bad vibes.”Though the effects of gem and crystal healing are controversial and widely regarded as pseudoscience by medical professionals, certain essential oils, like lavender, are thought to help reduce anxiety and stress. Luckily, it seems Goop is in on the psychic vampire repellent joke. Business Insider reached out to the company about the product and a spokesperson told them it was “meant to be a tongue-in-cheek product.” “We carried another product from the line and we received feedback from customers that they wanted us to carry more products from Paper Crane Apothecary, which is a small, independent purveyor,” the spokesperson told BI. Bad vibes, begone! "
70,POLITICS,Trump's Approval Rating Ticks Up Slightly From His Record Low,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-approval-rating-ticks-up_us_59c2a855e4b063b253175e82,"The president's numbers are up since August, although still in the red.",2017-09-20,"President Donald Trump arrives to address the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York on Sept. 19, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2bfc51a00007100f07b52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s job approval rating, after taking a dip over the summer, appears to be experiencing a modest uptick.About 40 percent of Americans approve of Trump, while about 53 percent disapprove, yielding a net approval score of -13, according to HuffPost’s aggregate of public polling as of Wednesday afternoon. It’s by no means a sterling number, especially so early in Trump’s presidency ― at this point in their tenure, most of his recent predecessors were pulling positive ratings. Nor is it a recovery to the ― again, notably low― ratings that Trump scored when he was first sworn into office.It does, however, mark an improvement from the -19 Trump saw at the beginning of August.One possible reason for the change: After months of news cycles dominated by White House turmoil and the GOP health care bill’s failure in Congress, recent weeks have focused much more on the spate of hurricanes, keeping Trump out of the headlines more than usual. Trump’s response to those storms, meanwhile, has garnered some of his best ratings to date as president. Polls found that a majority of Americans approved of his handling of the hurricane response following Harvey and Irma, even if that didn’t translate to support for the president more broadly.The president also scored relatively positive ratings for his handling of the economy. And a slim majority of Americans approved of Trump’s decision to make a deal with Democratic leaders on government funding.That being said, Democrats have hardly changed their minds about Trump’s record overall: On average, barely over 10 percent approve of his performance.Instead, HuffPost’s average shows that Trump’s rating among Republicans improved from a net +62 at the beginning of August to a net +67 now, a figure that rose among independents from a net -22 to a net -16 in the same period.Gallup’s tracking poll also shows Trump gaining with independents, among several other groups:The intensity of Trump voters’ support for the president has also rebounded modestly. More than half once again “strongly,” rather than “somewhat,” approve of the president, according to Economist/YouGov polling ― down from two-thirds when he first took office, but up from a low of 43 percent at the beginning of August.What remains to be seen is whether Trump’s ratings will remain above the 40 percent mark, or whether, with hurricane season drawing to a close, and a Obamacare repeal effort back on the table, they’ll again face the gradual erosion that characterized Trump’s earlier days in office. Given that the Republican Party’s performance in the polls has so far tracked closely with Trump’s numbers, the answer could make a difference heading into next year’s midterm elections."
71,POLITICS,Anti-Trump Anger Energizes Rhode Island To Pass Paid Sick Leave,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rhode-island-paid-sick-leave_us_59c29538e4b0186c22076647,"States are helping workers, even as the Trump administration tries to roll back protections.",2017-09-20,"The Rhode Island State House in Providence, Rhode Island.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2ac631c00003a0079f748.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rhode Island is about to become the eighth state in the country to give workers paid sick leave ― and activists are partly crediting the anti-Trump movement for their victory.On Tuesday, the state’s legislature passed a bill requiring employers to offer three paid days off per year to sick workers beginning in July 2018, with the number increasing to five days in 2020 and beyond. According to the legislation, employees could also use that time to care for sick loved ones or for “safe time” to deal with domestic violence or sexual assault issues.Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat who supports paid sick leave, is expected to sign the bill into law.The United States is the only developed country without any kind of paid sick leave law, but in recent years, states and cities have taken matters into their own hands.Since 2008, 39 cities, counties or states have passed paid sick day laws. In 2011, Connecticut became the first state to make the move, followed by California, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. Arizona voters approved a paid sick leave law in November.The legislation is another sign that states have been making progress when it comes to workers’ rights, even as the Trump administration attempts to roll back a variety of labor protections ― from rules on discrimination to regulations that would have given workers more opportunities to earn overtime pay and be protected from exposure to deadly chemicals.Backers of the Rhode Island law say that energized opposition to Trump gave the legislation added momentum.“We’ve been doing a lot of work with new activists in the resistance to Trump,” said Georgia Hollister Isman, director of the Rhode Island branch of the Working Families Party. Isman also said she credits momentum from local elections in 2016, in which six progressive candidates won seats in the state legislature.Groups including Planned Parenthood, local unions, women’s groups and even the AARP joined the Working Families Party in supporting paid leave.Ultimately, about 100,000 of nearly 170,000 workers in Rhode Island without access to paid sick leave will now have access to it. Seasonal workers are exempt from the law, as are companies with fewer than 18 employees. But under the law, those workers will still be protected from retaliation at work if they take unpaid time off.The new laws are making a real difference to millions of people around the country. Sixty-eight percent of employees in the private sector now get paid sick days ― nearly 79 million people ― an increase of 7 percentage points from 2015, according to data released by the Labor Department over the summer. Last year, 64 percent of workers in the private sector had paid sick days.Rhode Island is the first jurisdiction to pass paid sick leave since the November elections. The law comes at a perilous time for U.S. workers, as the Senate again contemplates repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and leaving millions of Americans without health insurance.The lack of a law on federal paid sick leave has far-reaching consequences ― and not simply for workers who don’t get the time off.Lacking paid sick leave, employees often wind up coming in for work and spreading disease both to their colleagues and their customers ― since many people without paid sick leave work in the service industry. Flu rates in the U.S. could decline by at least 5 percent if the country implemented paid sick leave nationwide, according to a paper from two economists published in 2015. A study released this fall also found that not having access to paid sick leave can have dire mental health consequences.Opponents of Rhode Island’s law argued that giving workers paid sick leave would be too costly for businesses. “If this bill is going to hurt me financially in a way I cannot overcome, I will hire fewer people and start eliminating vacation days,” said Republican state Rep. Michael Chippendale, according to the Providence Journal.But a number of studies show that offering employees paid time off is actually good for business. The overwhelming majority of employers in the city of San Francisco and the state of Connecticut, which both have paid sick day laws, did not see a negative effect on profits. "

Maria “will essentially devastate most of the island,” Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló said earlier this week. He described the federal emergency response ahead of the storm as “phenomenal,” adding that he hoped the rest of the U.S. would stand up for the island after the storm.“After Irma, the people of Puerto Rico stood up and helped others,” he said, according to USA Today. “We’ve done our part. But it’s likely we’re going to need a lot of help, a lot of collaboration, after this storm.”Fewer than half of Americans, however, even realize that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.According to a March Suffolk poll, just 47 percent of Americans knew that a person born in Puerto Rico to Puerto Rican parents would be an American citizen, while 30 percent said they’d be a Puerto Rican citizen. The remaining respondents either offered another answer or said they were unsure.An Economist/YouGov poll in May 2016 also found significant confusion about the island’s status, with only 43 percent saying people born in Puerto Rico to Puerto Rican parents would be American citizens. Forty-one percent said they would be Puerto Rican citizens, and the rest said they were uncertain. Puerto Ricans gained U.S. citizenship 100 years ago under President Woodrow Wilson. They can travel freely to the mainland U.S. and send delegates to party conventions, although those on the island can’t vote in the presidential general elections."
73,POLITICS,Virginia Republican Flip-Flops Almost Immediately On Opposing GOP Health Care Bill,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ed-gillespie-flip-flops-graham-cassidy_us_59c2c92be4b0c90504fb2e41,The Graham-Cassidy bill is causing problems for Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie.,2017-09-20,"Republican Ed Gillespie initially said he opposed the Graham-Cassidy bill, but walked it back shortly after the debate on Tuesday night.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2ca961a00002400f07b78.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ed Gillespie, Republican candidate for governor of Virginia, walked back comments opposing the congressional Republican health care bill mere minutes after he made them Tuesday night.In a televised debate with his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D), Gillespie said he did not support the Graham-Cassidy bill, which is the latest attempt by congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.“Virginia cannot be punished in any legislation for not being an expansion state and for being fiscally prudent with our Medicaid dollars,” Gillespie said. “And in my view, Graham-Cassidy falls short of that.”Northam pressed him on the matter, asking him to align himself with the many Republican governors who have publicly objected to the legislation.“I would ask you tonight to join the two Republican governors that have said that this would be a bad idea. I think it would be a great idea ―” Northam said.“I just said we can’t punish Virginia,” Gillespie shot back, implying his remarks had been tantamount to an agreement with those GOP governors.But shortly after the debate, Gillespie appeared to change his tune, claiming he did not have a position on Graham-Cassidy per se, but that he merely opposed any provision that penalized Virginia financially for not using ACA funds to expand Medicaid.“There is a process under way right now. And I want to make sure Virginia is protected from that kind of punishment but I’m not endorsing or opposing any specific legislation,” Gillespie told a reporter after the debate.The Gillespie campaign did not respond to multiple requests to clarify his position.The Graham-Cassidy bill, introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), is a last-gasp attempt by Senate Republicans to cobble together legislation to repeal the ACA, commonly known as Obamacare.The senators are casting the legislation as a compromise that is sufficiently moderate to secure 50 Republican votes in the Senate.But the bill would gut federal funding of the Obamacare exchanges and Medicaid expansion, as well as curtail Medicaid spending altogether by instituting a per-person cap that would fail to keep pace with currently projected health care cost growth. It also would penalize more liberal states by redistributing federal funding from states that currently spend more on Medicaid due to the ACA expansion and other policies to overwhelmingly Republican states that spend less. And the bill would allow states to exempt insurance plans from ACA regulations barring insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more.It is not clear what Gillespie meant when he said the bill would “punish” Virginia, since Virginia is not a Medicaid expansion state. Through 2026, the state actually stands to gain $268 million in federal funding under Graham-Cassidy, according to a state-by-state analysis of the bill conducted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. (Afterwards, Virginia, like all states, would lose money because much of the funding in Graham-Cassidy expires then.)Gillespie’s vacillation on Graham-Cassidy speaks to the conundrum he faces as he tries to pick up both moderate swing voters and turn out the Republican base, which remains supportive of President Donald Trump and his effort to repeal Obamacare. Gillespie defeated Trump acolyte Corey Stewart in the primary by just 1.2 percentage points. The close margin was a shock to political observers and the state’s Republican establishment. In a bid to shore up his bona fides with the conservative base, Gillespie has responded by attacking Northam’s immigration record, fundraising off of his opposition to the removal of Virginia’s Confederate monuments and hiring a top Stewart supporter to join his campaign.Northam, a pediatric neurologist who supports the use of ACA funding to expand Medicaid in Virginia, was eager to exploit Gillespie’s reluctance to take a consistent stance on the health care bill. In a call with reporters on Wednesday in which Northam was joined by his primary opponent, former Rep. Tom Perriello, Northam noted Gillespie “seemed to get a bit confused on where he stands on the latest version of Trumpcare.”“Ed Gillespie has been Donald Trump’s top lobbyist for taking health care away from over 800,000 Virginians,” Northam said. “Mr. Gillespie owes it to the Commonwealth to come clean that taking health care away from Virginians is his priority.”Both Northam and Perriello speculated that a phone call from Trump after the debate may have changed Gillespie’s mind on the matter. “As a Virginian, I really am concerned about someone running for governor who seems more concerned about upsetting Donald Trump than upsetting 840,000 Virginians who might lose their health care,” Perriello said.Gillespie’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry about whether Gillespie heard from Trump or another Republican after the debate. He admitted during the debate, however, that he would welcome Trump to hold a rally in support of his candidacy.“I’ll take help from anybody, anywhere,” Gillespie said.The figure Northam and Perriello cited refers to the number of Virginians who would lose their coverage under Graham-Cassidy, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank. The bill would result in the loss of coverage for 32 million Americans, including 839,000 people in Virginia, the report states.Northam, a 58-year-old Army veteran, has sought to portray Gillespie, 56, as an out-of-touch Washington “corporate lobbyist.” Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has indeed consulted for large corporations like Bank of America that have laid off workers in the state.In a new 30-second video ad, entitled “Enron Ed,” Northam connects his attacks on Gillespie’s lobbying work with his criticism of Gillespie’s support for Trump’s policies.“Enron Ed is lobbying for Donald Trump’s agenda, like cuts to Virginia school funding and taking away health care from thousands of Virginians,” the ad says."

This grant would theoretically help them buy ads promoting an educational website with a new resource hub technology providing information to individuals and families to help them navigate addiction health service options in their community.But when they tried to use the grant, Greg Williams, co-founder of Facing Addiction, working in conjunction with SEO and pay-per-click advertising expert, Greg Troche, found out quickly they were immediately priced out of the marketplace. As a nonprofit they couldn’t compete. “The bid prices for (search) words related to addiction had gotten so expensive that our group couldn’t pay as much as the for-profit treatment providers,” said Williams. “What’s worse, some of those treatment providers were not only misleading people, but they were doing the people searching for help more harm than good.” So they did a lot of research and collected news articles about what was happening and sent it to Google. And Google listened. And now Google is cracking down on dubious rehab ads.To understand how remarkable these events were you must understand Google AdWords. It’s a system that, according to Google, enables you to “be seen by customers at the very moment that they’re searching on Google for the things you offer. And only pay when they click to visit your website or call.” One journalist, Cat Ferguson, wrote an investigative journalism piece for The Verge that dug deep into the underbelly of these online marketing schemes. Using Adwords for addiction treatment advertising, for example, the “customer,” usually a desperate person with substance use disorder, or a friend or family member, enters a search word for “drug rehabs near me,” or “alcohol detox,” expecting to get listings of the services offered by providers near them. And hopefully they get a phone number that connects them to a human being associated with a rehab, someone who explains what kind of treatment is offered, the price, whether they take their insurance or not, the length of the program, the credentials of the staff, and what kind of services are offered.But instead they would often end up in the middle of what has become one of the Internet’s most despicable, ubiquitous, and lucrative scams. The first ad they would see (and several hits thereafter) would typically lead to a toll-free number that wasn’t a rehab at all. And when they called that number, they’d be talking to a “representative” who, using high-pressure telemarketing techniques, might, at best, provide unreliable information and direct you to a far away rehab whose number and information had been “hijacked.”At worst, they’d promise things that don’t seem possible, like “a free bed in a top-notch rehab with the finest professional staff in the country, with follow-up treatment in a sober living and outpatient treatment for 90 days.” If you had no insurance, they might offer to hook you up with an insurance provider who would handle all expenses. The offers, to the naive or desperate, are too good to pass up, and the person with alcohol or substance use disorder might very well, in a day or two, find that they are on their way to a distant city, with their plane fare paid by the representative’s company. They would then often find themselves in a strange town in a dingy room, sometimes an abandoned motel, with other desperate people with addiction problems. Treatment was hardly top-notch, or even adequate. Once placed in the facility, the facility then scams the insurance company for exorbitant fees for their stay, for counseling or psychotherapy, and even three-times a week urinalyses that were charged back to the insurance companies at up to $3000 a pop. The hapless victim becomes a “cash cow.” The practice is akin to human trafficking, but the industry expression is “heads in beds.” And the marketers with the most money were able to “buy” the most heads.Google is not to blame for these unethical practices of the addiction treatment industry, but many of the companies that engage in them are dependent on Google, and until recently Google seemed to be turning a blind eye. These companies spend exorbitant sums of money with Google. For example, according to Ferguson’s research, Aid in Recovery, one of the companies that exploits Google AdWords and people with substance use disorders, spends over a million dollars a month on Google search ads for websites they own.But now, thanks to Facing Addiction’s advocacy and powerful journalism, these practices may be getting phased out now that Google is turning down the money to protect the safety of their users. Google did its own investigation and agreed to stop selling those dubious ads until they could figure out a way to stop the fraud and the abuse. “We found a number of misleading experiences among rehabilitation treatment centers that led to our decision,” says Google spokeswoman Elisa Greene. Ryan Hampton, a California recovery activist whose input was indispensable in the writing of this story, remarks, “This is the organic outcome of good journalism and activism. When we speak up and speak out, we get results.” “This is a bold move by one of the world’s biggest companies, saying people’s lives are more important than profit,” adds Greg Williams. “Now we hope that Google will not just remain reactive to the issue, but they and many other major corporations become proactive helping to support sustainable life-saving solutions for what is now the leading cause of death in America for those under 50.”"

It must have been decades since one heard a speech like that in the UN General Assembly.”Rocket ManOn North Korea, some delegates gasped when the president threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea if the United States is forced to defend itself or its allies.” He said Washington was “ready, willing and able” but “hopefully this will not be necessary.”“Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime,” Trump said of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, using labels often reserved for his political opponents.While all speakers condemned North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, most hoped for negotiations, not war, and there were few signs Trump was seriously considering this.Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, immediately typed out a tweet: “Threats vs N Korea, ridiculing its leader more likely to persuade NK to increase its nuclear weapons & missiles than limit them/give them up.”The delegation from the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea’s official name) sat in the front row, but left the hall when Trump began to speak.Iran Deal Is EmbarrassingThe president also could not resist trying to wipe his cerebral predecessor off the map. Without mentioning former President Barak Obama by name, Trump said that since his November election the American economy had flourished. He also pounced on the deal to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions as well as relations with Cuba.“The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it ― believe me.Trump will meet the signatories to the agreement on Wednesday evening but there is no hope that the months of negotiations would be unraveled.“The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy,” he said. “It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people.”Trump’s sole supporter was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, especially on Iraq. “Fix it or nix it,” he told the General Assembly. “Change it or cancel it.”On Venezuela, Trump said the corrupt socialist dictatorship of President Nicholas Maduro had brought the nation to the brink of collapse. He also called Cuba corrupt and said sanctions would not be lifted until it undertook reforms.Don’t Sleepwalk Into WarBut some of the harshest criticism of Trump’s views came from UN Secretary-General António Guterres and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. Both men were making their maiden speeches.Guterres, who appeared before Trump, and speaks in fluent paragraphs in at least four languages, said the crisis in North Korea must be solved through a political process.“This is the time for statesmanship,” he said. “We must not sleepwalk our way into war.”Guterres, a former prime minister of Portugal and the former head of the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said he was “pained to see the way refugees and migrants have been stereotyped and scapegoated - and to see political figures stoke resentment in search of electoral gain.”Shortly after taking office, Trump moved to put a 120-day halt on the U.S. refugee program, bar Syrian refugees indefinitely and impose a 90-day suspension on people from six predominantly Muslim countries.Without naming any country, Guterres said that, “instead of closed doors and open hostility, we need to reestablish the integrity of the refugee protection regime and the simple decency of human compassion.”“I myself am a migrant, as many of you are. But no-one expected me to risk my life on a leaky boat or cross a desert in the back of a truck to find employment outside my country of birth,” he said. “Safe migration cannot be limited to the global elite.”Macron: No Renegotiation On Climate DealMacron in his speech and his press conference was careful not to criticize Trump, who did not mention climate change but has vowed to withdraw from Paris agreement. For Macron, the deal could be enriched but was “not up for renegotiation.”With the U.S. the world’s second largest polluter, Trump has appointed officials who rely on charlatan scientists. They have abolished Obama’s regulations on fossil fuels, automobiles, workers and scientific studies.Macron said the planet “is taking its revenge on the madness of man.”On Iran, he said the nuclear deal “was essential for peace and France would “not close any door to dialogue” with North Korea.Countering a unilateral view, he said “We need multilateralism” to work on global warming, war, terrorism and other issues. “We can only address those challenges thought multilateralism “not through survival of the fittest.”"

In a series of tweets stemming from an odd conversation about Kid Rock, the co-host of ESPN’s “SC6” called President Donald Trump a “white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.”“Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime,” she wrote. “His rise is the direct result of white supremacy. Period.” She added that Trump’s presidency had empowered other white supremacists and that his bid for the White House wouldn’t have been successful if he weren’t white.Backlash to the tweets, helped along by people like former ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and Fox Sports Radio’s Clay Travis ― who frequently says racist things ― led ESPN to release a statement saying Hill’s views “do not represent the position” of the network. This made things worse. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, called Hill’s tweets a “fireable offense.” That same day, ESPN tried to prevent Hill from co-hosting “SC6” with Michael Smith. In a tweet, Hill said her “regret” was that her comments “painted ESPN in an unfair light.” ESPN’s public editor, Jim Brady, said Hill ― and the media at large ― should “let the reporting do its work, and resist more incendiary labels.” None of what Hill said in her initial volley of tweets was inaccurate. Trump voters were driven by racism, and white supremacists openly support him. His campaign rhetoric was a dog whistle for white supremacists. His attorney general has praised the Immigration Act of 1924, a law crafted by eugenicists and championed by people hoping to preserve a “distinct American type.” After a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump attributed the violence to “both sides,” even though none of the counter-protesters killed anyone. That Trump is a white supremacist is a straightforward conclusion that can be drawn from an abundance of available evidence. But not all straightforward conclusions are admissible in mainstream American media, particularly on the subject of race, particularly when stated by a black woman. To get a sense of the straitjackets placed on black media figures working in a predominantly white industry, where “white supremacy” is usually seen as a slur applicable only to Klansmen and Nazis, I convened three prominent black journalists: Greg Howard, a Metro reporter at The New York Times who previously wrote for The New York Times Magazine and for Deadspin; Elena Bergeron, former staff writer at ESPN The Magazine and current editor-in-chief of SB Nation; and a current ESPN employee who, for obvious reasons, wanted to remain anonymous. The conversation took place over Slack, a group messaging service. With the participants’ agreement, a transcript of that discussion appears below. It’s been edited for clarity and length.Greg Howard: I guess I’m mostly frustrated by how disingenuous the entire conversation around it is. None of the events around it are actually real. ESPN Employee: Yes. It’s not about name-calling.Elena Bergeron: It really highlights for the public how easy it is to attack and pile on women and POC in the media. There’s a thing in all of this about the policing of her opinions and the level of authority other people (trolls, etc.) feel like they have over her voice ― and that those criticisms should be acted upon.Greg: It’s even more cynical than that for me? Clay Travis and Britt McHenry are viruses! Their only goal is self-promotion. Their goal is to increase their star power. We can talk about whether they really believed that Jemele should be fired. But Clay’s endgame was to say boobs on national TV.Julia: I keep looping back to how this wouldn’t have happened to a white person. Hell, Miss Texas came at Trump over white supremacy and she was praised. Groundbreaking criticism. *rolls eyes*ESPN Employee: There’s a really troubling double standard and I think media companies are struggling to recognize it and it shows. This administration targets black female critics in particular. Julia: Could you expand on that?ESPN Employee: So, CNN.com ran a conversation that Chris Cillizza had about this and tried to frame this as tit-for-tat schoolyard politics. I think that’s completely misguided. So much of the way this situation has been discussed elides the role that race plays in this, which is weird. It elides that correctly identifying threats from racism and white supremacy are not optional for black people. It is part and parcel of our survival in this country because we cannot rely on protection from the state. Julia: Greg, tell me more about Clay Travis.Greg: He’s a troll. I don’t really think he has any sophisticated political view or anything. He’s not a journalist or anything. His whole, entire game is self-promotion. He’s sexist and racist, and his best trait is that he recognizes there are others like him out there ― which is why he largely attacks black people and women in an effort to self-promote. ESPN Employee: Greg are you talking about Clay Travis or the president?Greg: Both, because no one who’s invested in it would deny that Donald Trump is a white supremacist ― not people of color, not white supremacists, not regular-shmegular racists like Clay Travis and Britt McHenry. ESPN Employee: Right. We saw that after Charlottesville. The white nationalists and neo-Nazis there believe Trump is on their side. All you have to do is look at Reddit and 4chan. The evidence is staring us in the face ― and we have to stop behaving as though what happens on the internet doesn’t have real world implications. Elena: It’s a good reminder for me that: 1) women and POC who are in the media get a disproportionate amount of harassment and criticism from all sides; 2) when Jemele and anybody who has a front-facing job within a company get attacked, their options for responding publicly are really, really limited. ESPN Employee: Yes, that is really scary. I mean, journalists are ostensibly front-facing employees, right?Elena: As someone who has to manage writers and social staff that deals with trolling all the time, I think a lot about how to support them publicly without dulling their voice, or mitigating frustrations or (accurate) facts they’re bringing up.The most important thing out of all of this is who stood up for Jemele. ESPN Employee: Elena, can you say more about that? How did you develop a strategy for supporting your writers? What guided you?Elena: That’s a thing that evolves every single day, to be honest. But we’re having a lot of conversations about it because you cannot hire people and have them lean into showcasing their personalities and then get mad/not stand by them when they showcase their personality!ESPN Employee: I think Margaret Sullivan said something very similar in her column this week. Elena: What Jemele expressed was based on her identity and her experience as a black woman in this country, and that perspective can’t only be valuable when it makes everyone comfortable. It’s got to be valuable when it makes some folks uncomfortable too. Julia: Going off what Elena said earlier, let me ask y’all about this push to get Jemele off the air. According to the ThinkProgress scoop, Michael Smith, Michael Eaves and Elle Duncan all said no to taking her SC6 spot.Elena: 🙌🏾ESPN Employee: Thank GodJulia: Elena pointed out how all the black employees involved stepped up and protected her. So how do the black folks at your outlets protect one another? I’m really interested in this idea of there being “two newsrooms” — one where white folks are, well, there and one where black people and other POC are having all these behind-the-scenes convos about what goes down. At HuffPost, we have a black Slack and all the black people talk to each other about EVERYTHING.Greg: We have a Slack for minorities, too, but it’s mostly buttoned up. Julia: We created this Slack after an intense union email thread on diversity where a few of us rightfully felt like we weren’t being heard. So we wanted to pop shit about it in private. What goes down at y’all’s outlets?Elena: There are a couple Vox media Slack rooms plus some employee resource groups — all optional but there for people to talk candidly, share info, just generally support. Greg: Honestly, our minority Slack can get lit at times. But there’s definitely hesitation to speak candidly. I definitely don’t, and I think I speak more than most. ESPN Employee: I was surprised to see the number of people commenting on ESPN’s internal message board, which I think got leaked to Deadspin. Greg: God bless ’em. ESPN Employee: HahaGreg: Yeah that was wild to see, though. Peak white shit haha. ESPN Employee: Yoooooo. Like, wow, OK, so NOBODY gets it. We have such a huge problem on our hands. Greg: I mean, her own coworkers were calling for her head and trying to connect what she said about Trump to Curt Schilling and Linda Cohn ― in public! I was aghast. ESPN Employee: Clearly there are folks in Bristol [Connecticut] who think calling white people racist is as bad as actually being racist, which ... they gotta fix that. Greg: It was fascinating, because you saw that some of ESPN’s own employees were the same sort of people trying to police Jemele on Twitter.ESPN Employee: Do you think there’s some job envy there? Like, “I should have that SC seat, not her”?Greg: Envy might be part of it, but I think it’s more just that many people don’t think a black woman should have that job. That underlined so much of the rage against Jemele, and that was there from the day she started. And so there’s this idea that her placement there is probationary, and that viewers are allowing her to be there. And if she steps out of line by offending them, they can call for her head. ESPN Employee: OK, I’m glad you said that. I think it points to a bigger problem overall, which is that there are a lot of well-meaning white people who don’t understand just how racist our society is ― and they don’t have very good tools for it. Because the way we define racism is EXTREMELY limited. Elena: Oooooh, church. Greg: Tommy Craggs said it, but Jemele’s sin wasn’t offending the president or lying about the president or even telling the truth. It was being uppity and talking out of turn. That’s where the rage came from. ESPN Employee: Yeah. They hate that. Hell, April Ryan didn’t even have to open her mouth. She just shook her head. Greg: The subtext to the whole thing was, “Who said this black woman can mouth off?”Julia: Jemele said that herself in The Ringer piece. Also, she didn’t lie. Her tweets are factually accurate.Greg: I’m still looking for her lie!ESPN Employee: What sucks is that she’s out there alone, in terms of the higher-ups. Greg: Yeah, I would’ve expected Rob King or someone else to have her back if John Skipper wasn’t going to. It was just peers. ESPN Employee: Skipper is from North Carolina, but I don’t think he sees it that way. And he clearly sees himself as an ally to people of color at the company. Greg: Which is a scary thing working in big organizations like this. ESPN Employee: It’s extremely scary. Julia: So has ESPN always been this way? Do they always leave black reporters on their own? Or is this just an industry issue? ESPN Employee: I’m not sure. I mean, we’ve never seen it on this scale before because we’ve never had a president who was so obviously contemptuous of anyone not white and male and who poses such a threat to democratic norms. OK, you could argue that things shifted after Jayson Blair. We were always “other” in the newsroom. Janet Cooke and Jayson Blair basically gave white bosses an excuse to be extra cautious.Greg: I think there are a few things. ESPN’s management will never be a friend to its employees, right? Management isn’t your friend, but that’s even more accurate at ESPN because they’re not just a newsgathering organization. To ESPN’s credit, they have so, so, so many black reporters and personalities. Like, it’s hard to come up with a long list of names of black sportswriters who aren’t at ESPN. ESPN Employee: And that caution was informed by some underlying racial prejudice, even though they’ll never admit it because black journalists are still treated as a group while whites are seen as individuals. Greg: ESPN has given Jemele and many others a platform to express themselves in front of the world, but that comes with a responsibility to back your black talent. ESPN Employee: ESPN is also unique because it employs so many journalists and there’s no union. Julia: Oh wow. I didn’t know they weren’t unionized.Greg: That’s a great point I didn’t think of. That’s why she didn’t have natural institutional support and it had to come from other black talent taking it upon themselves to smack down ESPN management when they tried to pull her from SportsCenter. ESPN Employee: The lack of a union makes everybody scared. Management has all the power. Elena: Well, I think it goes back to “embrace debate″ and some of the public sentiment that they’ve become “too liberal.”Greg: I think that’s 1,000 percent bullshit. I really do. I think “too liberal” is just “women and people of color on TV.” The whole debate around ESPN being too liberal is complete bullshit. No one is turning off ESPN because it’s too liberal.ESPN Employee: I was about to say, if they replaced Jemele with Sage Steele would we see the same whining about ESPN’s politics? The whole political backlash narrative is bullshit. Elena: Agree with it being a red herring, but it’s one that comes from coded language about being mad. Greg: I hate the debate around ESPN being too liberal and sports needing to be an escape from the real word. You want marginalized people to shut the fuck up. ESPN Employee: This is about the cable bundle and the fact that millennials and younger people don’t buy it. Maybe because they’re in jobs where they’re not making any money, IDK. Julia: Fun fact: John Skipper and I are from the same town in N.C., which kinda brings me to Jason Whitlock.Greg: My dude!Julia: So Skipper first tapped Whitlock for The Undefeated. What does that say about what kind of outspoken black people he finds acceptable? Greg: Hoo. ESPN Employee: Oh dear. Elena: Woooo. Julia: 🤗Greg: I think they’re unrelated. I’m choosing to believe they’re unrelated haha. ESPN Employee: Greg, you’re kind of the expert on this. Greg: Well, nah, they’re loosely connected. Dammit. ESPN Employee: Do you think Skipper knew how reviled Whitlock was by most black people?Greg: There’s no way he did. If he asked a small group of black people in his company, he would’ve scratched the idea in a few minutes. I also think Skipper thought that because Whitlock was black, putting him in charge of a prestige site was subversive and progressive in itself. ESPN Employee: Which again, points to just how far we have to go with “good white people.”Greg: Right. I think with Jemele, it’s a little different. Like, I almost threw my laptop through the wall when I read ESPN’s first statement ― which was basically, “Don’t worry, she knows what she did, she’s being punished.”ESPN Employee: It was gross. One, because it was so infantilizing!Greg: Yes, and it was clearly to try to appease the people who terrorize her every single day. ESPN Employee: Right! And there is no appeasing those people. They’re not going to be happy until we’re all gone, with the exception of Ben Carson, maybe. Greg: I have a friend who said these disingenuous policies do buy you reprieve. It’s just chum in the water. It was such a naked appeal to all these disgusting false narratives. Elena: I read it more as they were saying what she actually did was offend her colleagues, which is weird because it’s OK for colleagues to have different opinions about conservatism or who they vote for, etc. Calling out white supremacy isn’t a thing that should be offensive to anyone on a staff, though. People have to separate the argument about conservatism (political, fiscal, social) from confrontations about racism. Greg: Will Cain is on ESPN and offends his colleagues nearly every day. It’s about who’s allowed to offend their colleagues. ESPN Employee: Clearly, we have a problem in the difference of understanding what white supremacy is. They think it’s white hoods and burning crosses. We think it’s the foundation of the whole damn country. Elena: Any attack on white supremacy, because the general population lacks the language to differentiate, seems like an attack on conservatives. It shouldn’t be. But if people believe in the inherent superiority of white people and they act on that belief … that’s white supremacy, white hoods or not.ESPN Employee: White liberals benefit from white supremacy too. And it makes them uncomfortable. Remember when Kevin Drum tried to label it as a “fad”? Greg: Never forget. ESPN Employee: To a lot of white people, this is a right vs. left issue. And for black people, we’re like, naw, ya’ll still don’t get it. Greg: You see people who benefit from white supremacy trying to talk about decorum. ESPN Employee: Tone policing. “Not the appropriate time.” “Not the right venue.” “Be patient.”Greg: “Not the place.”It’s dismissive. To say Jemele Hill shouldn’t say our white supremacist president is a white supremacist because it was rude or mean is dismissive of the fact that she is less safe and has fewer rights than men or white people ― and even fewer now since Trump has been elected. Julia: Elena, did you ever feel like you could write about race when you were at ESPN?Elena: That’s tough to respond to because I was writing for The Mag and, culturally, I always found that it was a little bit more open than the rest of ESPN. I felt like I could write in my voice, and I felt like I could make Young Jeezy references in copy and not have to explain it.I also profiled Louis Farrakhan’s grandson, who at the time was a big basketball prospect who went on to play for Virginia. Race definitely factored into his recruitment and no one on that staff pushed me away from that story. I wrote it, I’m proud of it.Greg: Oooh gonna read that today. Elena had to leave after that question. Julia: Does print — and this is for everybody — get more room to discuss race? Because we have Race/Related at NYT. There’s The Undefeated. And even at HuffPost we care about race. But on TV, I just don’t see it as much — at least not as blatantly or bluntly.Greg: I definitely had more room when I was at NYT Mag than at the paper itself. ESPN Employee: Somewhat. You have to be careful. Sometimes it’s like, you have to have an extra layer of receipts that easily adds another 500 words to a story that could go without it. Or, in places that are REALLY white, they’ll defer to the only black person because they know they don’t know ― which is also bad, because then you have no one to trade ideas with. Greg: I think it’s mostly about who’s in charge. I felt most empowered to speak about race when I was at Deadspin, because the two top editors and, like, three of the top four editors at the site were people of color. At NYT Mag, I had a black editor and black writers around me. You could tell the top editors, although they were white, were truly invested in the magazine’s black talent grappling with race and stuff. You don’t get that as much at the paper. Julia: HuffPost always cared about race, shoutout to Black + Latinx Voices, but when Lydia Polgreen took over we REALLY started caring about it.Greg: NYT Mag operates almost autonomously, and they have Wesley Morris, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Jenna Wortham, Jay Kang, Rachel Kaadzi Gansah and others. “Talking about race” isn’t an option, really. The paper is less diverse. There are fewer people of color in positions of power. There’s not as much institutional support. And you have fewer people who can improve and sharpen your thoughts and ideas. So you become more hesitant as well. ESPN Employee: Here is my overarching frustration: Race gets consigned to a beat but it’s not a beat, not really. It should be part of EVERYONE’S beat because it is such a big part of the way life is experienced here. You can’t really section it off. Julia: YES. That’s been my biggest frustration. I see some stories that we publish and they don’t include race and it’s mind-boggling. I say to myself, “I would have covered this completely differently than you.” Greg: The only way that changes is by hiring editors of color who understand that. And that’s not really happening all that quickly anywhere. ESPN Employee: Journalism is still struggling to adapt to the fact that the white experience is not universal with gradations according to class, geography, etc. Greg: I don’t think they’re trying to adapt at all. ESPN Employee: Well, there’s that. Julia: Welp. Greg: At Gawker Media and at The New York Times, there were pockets of minorities who made the argument that the white experience isn’t the default or universal, and to have a more diverse newsroom is to have a better one. And the response was disheartening in both places. It’s disheartening everywhere. And that’s why Jemele’s situation is so frustrating. It really appeared like a bunch of people at ESPN agree broadly with a lot of her trolls. That you can and should excise race from conversations, even if you’re a person of color. ESPN Employee: Obviously, that’s the whole point of a diverse newsroom and those numbers haven’t budged. But also, if you are white, and you go home, and everyone in the houses around you is white, and most of your kids classmates are white, too ... you’re going to be resistant. Julia: Meanwhile, I’m inundated by whiteness at every turn and I’m also really over it. ESPN Employee: Right. So even the smart people we know who are responsible for telling the rest of the country wassup are living in a bubble. They think it’s a class bubble, an ideological bubble. No, issa race bubble. Julia: I went on a Twitter rant about this. About how, for me, it’s not just class. It’s race, too. I grew up poor and now I feel weird in these journalism bubbles because I’m black and I grew up poor. ESPN Employee: Right, it comes back to what Greg said earlier, which is basically that this is about white discomfort and an expectation that everyone else moderate their actions around it. Julia, you realize when this gets published, you’re going to get comments saying “that ESPN employee is racist against white people.”Julia: Yep. And I can’t wait to tell them to fuck off. But, my last question is this: Should Jemele apologize?Greg: Lol for what? "
77,BLACK VOICES,What Are Black Sports Journalists Allowed To Say About Trump And Race?,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-journalists-jemele-hill-race_us_59c2cc51e4b06f93538c204b,ESPN host Jemele Hill is being roasted for calling Donald Trump a white supremacist.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2ceda1900002500564d2d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Jemele Hill said what she said. In a series of tweets stemming from an odd conversation about Kid Rock, the co-host of ESPN’s “SC6” called President Donald Trump a “white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.”“Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime,” she wrote. “His rise is the direct result of white supremacy. Period.” She added that Trump’s presidency had empowered other white supremacists and that his bid for the White House wouldn’t have been successful if he weren’t white.Backlash to the tweets, helped along by people like former ESPN reporter Britt McHenry and Fox Sports Radio’s Clay Travis ― who frequently says racist things ― led ESPN to release a statement saying Hill’s views “do not represent the position” of the network.

Management isn’t your friend, but that’s even more accurate at ESPN because they’re not just a newsgathering organization. To ESPN’s credit, they have so, so, so many black reporters and personalities. Like, it’s hard to come up with a long list of names of black sportswriters who aren’t at ESPN. ESPN Employee: And that caution was informed by some underlying racial prejudice, even though they’ll never admit it because black journalists are still treated as a group while whites are seen as individuals. Greg: ESPN has given Jemele and many others a platform to express themselves in front of the world, but that comes with a responsibility to back your black talent. ESPN Employee: ESPN is also unique because it employs so many journalists and there’s no union. Julia: Oh wow. I didn’t know they weren’t unionized.Greg: That’s a great point I didn’t think of. That’s why she didn’t have natural institutional support and it had to come from other black talent taking it upon themselves to smack down ESPN management when they tried to pull her from SportsCenter. ESPN Employee: The lack of a union makes everybody scared. Management has all the power. Elena: Well, I think it goes back to “embrace debate″ and some of the public sentiment that they’ve become “too liberal.”Greg: I think that’s 1,000 percent bullshit. I really do. I think “too liberal” is just “women and people of color on TV.” The whole debate around ESPN being too liberal is complete bullshit. No one is turning off ESPN because it’s too liberal.ESPN Employee: I was about to say, if they replaced Jemele with Sage Steele would we see the same whining about ESPN’s politics? The whole political backlash narrative is bullshit. Elena: Agree with it being a red herring, but it’s one that comes from coded language about being mad. Greg: I hate the debate around ESPN being too liberal and sports needing to be an escape from the real word. You want marginalized people to shut the fuck up. ESPN Employee: This is about the cable bundle and the fact that millennials and younger people don’t buy it. Maybe because they’re in jobs where they’re not making any money, IDK. Julia: Fun fact: John Skipper and I are from the same town in N.C., which kinda brings me to Jason Whitlock.Greg: My dude!Julia: So Skipper first tapped Whitlock for The Undefeated. What does that say about what kind of outspoken black people he finds acceptable? Greg: Hoo. ESPN Employee: Oh dear. Elena: Woooo. Julia: 🤗Greg: I think they’re unrelated. I’m choosing to believe they’re unrelated haha. ESPN Employee: Greg, you’re kind of the expert on this. Greg: Well, nah, they’re loosely connected. Dammit. ESPN Employee: Do you think Skipper knew how reviled Whitlock was by most black people?Greg: There’s no way he did. If he asked a small group of black people in his company, he would’ve scratched the idea in a few minutes. I also think Skipper thought that because Whitlock was black, putting him in charge of a prestige site was subversive and progressive in itself. ESPN Employee: Which again, points to just how far we have to go with “good white people.”Greg: Right. I think with Jemele, it’s a little different. Like, I almost threw my laptop through the wall when I read ESPN’s first statement ― which was basically, “Don’t worry, she knows what she did, she’s being punished.”ESPN Employee: It was gross. One, because it was so infantilizing!Greg: Yes, and it was clearly to try to appease the people who terrorize her every single day. ESPN Employee: Right! And there is no appeasing those people. They’re not going to be happy until we’re all gone, with the exception of Ben Carson, maybe. Greg: I have a friend who said these disingenuous policies do buy you reprieve. It’s just chum in the water. It was such a naked appeal to all these disgusting false narratives. Elena: I read it more as they were saying what she actually did was offend her colleagues, which is weird because it’s OK for colleagues to have different opinions about conservatism or who they vote for, etc. Calling out white supremacy isn’t a thing that should be offensive to anyone on a staff, though. People have to separate the argument about conservatism (political, fiscal, social) from confrontations about racism. Greg: Will Cain is on ESPN and offends his colleagues nearly every day. It’s about who’s allowed to offend their colleagues. ESPN Employee: Clearly, we have a problem in the difference of understanding what white supremacy is. They think it’s white hoods and burning crosses. We think it’s the foundation of the whole damn country. Elena: Any attack on white supremacy, because the general population lacks the language to differentiate, seems like an attack on conservatives. It shouldn’t be. But if people believe in the inherent superiority of white people and they act on that belief … that’s white supremacy, white hoods or not.ESPN Employee: White liberals benefit from white supremacy too. And it makes them uncomfortable. Remember when Kevin Drum tried to label it as a “fad”? Greg: Never forget. ESPN Employee: To a lot of white people, this is a right vs. left issue. And for black people, we’re like, naw, ya’ll still don’t get it. Greg: You see people who benefit from white supremacy trying to talk about decorum. ESPN Employee: Tone policing. “Not the appropriate time.” “Not the right venue.” “Be patient.”Greg: “Not the place.”It’s dismissive. To say Jemele Hill shouldn’t say our white supremacist president is a white supremacist because it was rude or mean is dismissive of the fact that she is less safe and has fewer rights than men or white people ― and even fewer now since Trump has been elected. Julia: Elena, did you ever feel like you could write about race when you were at ESPN?Elena: That’s tough to respond to because I was writing for The Mag and, culturally, I always found that it was a little bit more open than the rest of ESPN. I felt like I could write in my voice, and I felt like I could make Young Jeezy references in copy and not have to explain it.I also profiled Louis Farrakhan’s grandson, who at the time was a big basketball prospect who went on to play for Virginia. Race definitely factored into his recruitment and no one on that staff pushed me away from that story. I wrote it, I’m proud of it.Greg: Oooh gonna read that today. Elena had to leave after that question. Julia: Does print — and this is for everybody — get more room to discuss race? Because we have Race/Related at NYT. There’s The Undefeated. And even at HuffPost we care about race. But on TV, I just don’t see it as much — at least not as blatantly or bluntly.Greg: I definitely had more room when I was at NYT Mag than at the paper itself. ESPN Employee: Somewhat. You have to be careful. Sometimes it’s like, you have to have an extra layer of receipts that easily adds another 500 words to a story that could go without it. Or, in places that are REALLY white, they’ll defer to the only black person because they know they don’t know ― which is also bad, because then you have no one to trade ideas with. Greg: I think it’s mostly about who’s in charge. I felt most empowered to speak about race when I was at Deadspin, because the two top editors and, like, three of the top four editors at the site were people of color. At NYT Mag, I had a black editor and black writers around me. You could tell the top editors, although they were white, were truly invested in the magazine’s black talent grappling with race and stuff. You don’t get that as much at the paper. Julia: HuffPost always cared about race, shoutout to Black + Latinx Voices, but when Lydia Polgreen took over we REALLY started caring about it.Greg: NYT Mag operates almost autonomously, and they have Wesley Morris, Nikole Hannah-Jones, Jenna Wortham, Jay Kang, Rachel Kaadzi Gansah and others. “Talking about race” isn’t an option, really. The paper is less diverse. There are fewer people of color in positions of power. There’s not as much institutional support. And you have fewer people who can improve and sharpen your thoughts and ideas. So you become more hesitant as well. ESPN Employee: Here is my overarching frustration: Race gets consigned to a beat but it’s not a beat, not really. It should be part of EVERYONE’S beat because it is such a big part of the way life is experienced here. You can’t really section it off. Julia: YES. That’s been my biggest frustration. I see some stories that we publish and they don’t include race and it’s mind-boggling. I say to myself, “I would have covered this completely differently than you.” Greg: The only way that changes is by hiring editors of color who understand that. And that’s not really happening all that quickly anywhere. ESPN Employee: Journalism is still struggling to adapt to the fact that the white experience is not universal with gradations according to class, geography, etc. Greg: I don’t think they’re trying to adapt at all. ESPN Employee: Well, there’s that. Julia: Welp. Greg: At Gawker Media and at The New York Times, there were pockets of minorities who made the argument that the white experience isn’t the default or universal, and to have a more diverse newsroom is to have a better one. And the response was disheartening in both places. It’s disheartening everywhere. And that’s why Jemele’s situation is so frustrating. It really appeared like a bunch of people at ESPN agree broadly with a lot of her trolls. That you can and should excise race from conversations, even if you’re a person of color. ESPN Employee: Obviously, that’s the whole point of a diverse newsroom and those numbers haven’t budged. But also, if you are white, and you go home, and everyone in the houses around you is white, and most of your kids classmates are white, too ... you’re going to be resistant. Julia: Meanwhile, I’m inundated by whiteness at every turn and I’m also really over it. ESPN Employee: Right. So even the smart people we know who are responsible for telling the rest of the country wassup are living in a bubble. They think it’s a class bubble, an ideological bubble. No, issa race bubble. Julia: I went on a Twitter rant about this. About how, for me, it’s not just class. It’s race, too. I grew up poor and now I feel weird in these journalism bubbles because I’m black and I grew up poor. ESPN Employee: Right, it comes back to what Greg said earlier, which is basically that this is about white discomfort and an expectation that everyone else moderate their actions around it. Julia, you realize when this gets published, you’re going to get comments saying “that ESPN employee is racist against white people.”Julia: Yep. And I can’t wait to tell them to fuck off. But, my last question is this: Should Jemele apologize?Greg: Lol for what? "

Original robot bad guy Arnold Schwarzenegger is also set to return to the story, which THR says is planned out as a trilogy.“There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys, but there isn’t an example of that for women,” Cameron said at the event.Seeing Hamilton, 60, carry an action franchise would be pretty badass, but Cameron said that the new “Terminator” crew is also “starting a search for an 18-something woman to be the new centerpiece of the new story.”“We still fold time,” he said. “We will have characters from the future and the present. There will be mostly new characters, but we’ll have Arnold and Linda’s characters to anchor it.”Cameron is right about the dearth of cool roles available to older women compared to their male counterparts — 65-year-old Liam Neeson practically has to beg not to be cast in another “Taken” — but the comments feel somewhat flat after the “Titanic” director’s recent controversial assessment of the female-directed “Wonder Woman” as “self-congratulatory.”“She’s an objectified icon, and it’s just male Hollywood doing the same old thing!” he told The Guardian in an interview. “I’m not saying I didn’t like the movie but, to me, it’s a step backwards.”“Sarah Connor was not a beauty icon,” Cameron added. “She was strong, she was troubled, she was a terrible mother, and she earned the respect of the audience through pure grit.”“Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins was quick to hit back on Twitter: “James Cameron’s inability to understand what Wonder Woman is, or stands for, to women all over the world is unsurprising,” she wrote.The box-office success of the Gal Gadot–led superhero film showed industry giants there was a hunger for — and money to be made from — women-centered stories outside of the typical rom-com or family film sphere. Let’s hope Cameron takes this momentum to a bold new place instead of, well, the same old Hollywood thing."
79,POLITICS,"Amid Rising Anti-Semitism, Jewish Groups Focus On Security For High Holidays",Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jewish-high-holidays-security_us_59c0575ee4b0186c22053f00,The post-Charlottesville climate has left many Jewish organizations feeling on edge.,2017-09-20,"Neo-Nazis and white supremacists chanted ""Jews will not replace us!"" as they marched through the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville last month.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59c2d4a11c00003a0079f822.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As white supremacist rallies overtook Charlottesville, Va. on a Saturday last month, congregants of the local Congregation Beth Israel made their way to Shabbat services in an atmosphere of tension.The temple’s leaders had removed the Torah scrolls from the premises in case of an attack. Over the course of morning services, the synagogue’s president recounted, armed men dressed in fatigues stood menacingly across the street from the temple. Parades of neo-Nazis passed by the building, waving flags emblazoned with swastikas and shouting, “There’s the synagogue!” A man in a white polo shirt ― a similar uniform as the one worn by James Alex Fields Jr. and other white supremacists ― walked by the synagogue several times, arousing the suspicion of temple security. Synagogue president Alan Zimmerman wondered if he was being “paranoid,” but he wasn’t taking any chances.“When services ended, my heart broke as I advised congregants that it would be safer to leave the temple through the back entrance rather than through the front, and to please go in groups,” Zimmerman wrote in an article about the experience.“This is 2017 in the United States of America.”It’s been just over a month since the violence in Charlottesville, and it’s still fresh in the awareness of Jewish organizations and synagogues as they gear up for the high holidays.The holidays kick off with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, on Wednesday evening, followed up by Yom Kippur, Sukkot, Shemini Atzeret and finally Simchat Torah on Oct. 13. These are some of the biggest holidays in the Jewish year and tend to draw large numbers of congregants to synagogues around the country.The Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights group, conducts security trainings for synagogues and law enforcement year-round. But the need for such training, said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, felt particularly urgent this year as the holidays approached.“Anxiety levels are high,” Greenblatt told HuffPost. “We’re seeing an increase in anti-Semitic incidents over the past year, and in light of the anti-Semitism at full display in Charlottesville, this public display of hate is fresh in the minds of Jewish groups.”Some institutions are implementing additional security measures this year in light of the post-Charlottesville climate. The Lubavitch Chabad Jewish Student & Community Center in Gainesville, Fla., which expects roughly 1,000 students to show up for holiday observations, will have an armed police officer present during the week. Temple Israel in Alameda, Calif., which was vandalized in August, increased its security camera surveillance, hired a private security firm to be onsite during the week and reached out to the local police department to request increased patrol over the holidays.Last week, ADL partnered with the Secure Community Network, a security initiative of several major Jewish organizations, to provide a briefing for Jewish community institutions ahead of the high holidays. Greenblatt said more than 500 representatives of Jewish institutions across the country participated in the call.There’s reason for concern.The neo-Nazi marches in Charlottesville were just one manifestation of larger trends the country has witnessed in recent months. Data collected by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, and provided exclusively to HuffPost, revealed roughly a 5 percent rise in all hate crimes from 2015 to 2016. Hate crimes against Jews were among the highest in several parts of the country and surpassed incidents targeting other groups in places like New York City and Montgomery County, Md. The ADL also tallied anti-Semitic attacks, including both criminal and non-criminal incidents, and discovered a 34 percent increase nationally from 2015 to 2016. Nearly 30 percent of all incidents ADL recorded last year occurred in the last two months, around the time of the election. ADL also found that in the first quarter of 2017, anti-Semitic incidents spiked 86 percent nationally over the same period last year.“Our security briefings are constantly updated by our Center on Extremism, which tracks threats and ensures that our briefings reflect real time developments,” Greenblatt said.Earlier this year, ADL partnered with the FBI to expand its security trainings in the wake of a series of bomb threats targeting dozens of Jewish community centers. “People are very concerned about bomb threats, whether coming in through email or phone,” Greenblatt noted. “And people continue to be very concerned about mass shootings.”These threats aren’t a new phenomenon. In 2014, the year marked by a fatal shooting targeting three Jewish community buildings in Kansas, ADL recorded a 21 percent increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Vandalism, harassment and bomb threats are security risks many synagogues have to regularly manage.“The main thing to keep in mind is that we are always monitoring the climate and always mindful,” said a representative from the Los Angeles Wilshire Boulevard Temple, which received several bomb threats over the summer. “This is true today, and it was true several years ago. We as an organization are always vigilant.”Greenblatt emphasized that security should be a priority for Jewish groups year-round and referenced ADL’s security manual as a helpful resource. He also urged institutions to connect with law enforcement to ensure that their congregants and buildings are kept safe from harm. “Extremists continue to feel emboldened, and it’s very problematic,” Greenblatt said. “I’m optimistic there won’t be any problems, but we need to be sure we’re prepared.”"
