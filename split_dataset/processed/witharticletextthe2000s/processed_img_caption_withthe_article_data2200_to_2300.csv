Moments after announcing to a home-state newspaper that he would not seek reelection in 2018, Flake issued a blistering condemnation of Trump’s behavior since taking office.“We must never adjust to the present coarseness of our national dialogue with the tone set up at the top,” Flake said. “We must never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals, we must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country. The personal attacks, the threats against principles, freedoms and institution, the flagrant disregard for truth and decency.” A sitting senator attacking a sitting president from the same party, in such sweeping terms and in the formal setting of a floor speech — it was hard to think of anything remotely like it in recent memory. But Flake was not done. Having called out the president, he proceeded to call out his fellow Republicans for failing to speak out more forcefully, all but calling them enablers. “It’s time for our complicity and accommodation to the unacceptable to end,” Flake said. “Were the shoe on the other foot, would we Republicans meekly accept such behavior? Of course we wouldn’t.”Literally minutes after Flake was done, over at the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders took the podium for her semi-regular briefing with reporters. Right away she got questions about the criticisms of Trump, which had come not just from Flake but also from Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has also criticized Trump since announcing he won’t be seeking reelection.Relative to Flake, Corker has focused less on Trump’s civility and more on his basic fitness for office, wondering aloud whether the president will start World War III and calling the White House an adult day care center. Like Flake, Corker has attacked Trump as a serial liar. “The president has great difficulty with the truth,” Corker deadpanned this morning.Sanders responded, though she didn’t bother to refute the two senior and well-respected senators directly. She didn’t claim that the president was actually more honest, less crass or better qualified to be president than Corker or Flake had suggested. Instead, Sanders pointed out several times that Corker and Flake had terrible poll numbers, suggesting they had lost the faith of their own supporters.“I think that the people both in Tennessee and Arizona supported this president,” Sanders said. “And I don’t think that the numbers are in the favor of either of those two senators in their states.”It was “probably a good move” that Flake decided not to run again, Sanders said at another point, offering only a slightly nicer version of what Trump had tweeted about Corker earlier in the day, when the president said Corker “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.”This is pretty much how the past year has gone. In Trumpland, political might makes right.Over and over again, Trump has told blatant, easily refutable lies about everything from health care policy to his ties with Russia. He has mused openly about nuclear first strikes, attacked Gold Star families and shown a shocking contempt for democratic norms ― attacking the media, the FBI and the courts. He did it during the campaign, in the period before his inauguration and since then during his presidency.And Trump has never stopped, because the consequences for his indiscretions have never been severe enough. Trump’s behavior didn’t cost him the presidential election and, at least so far, it hasn’t cost him the loyalty of his party in Congress, either. Plenty of Republicans say privately what Corker and Flake say publicly. But GOP members of Congress continue to support him almost without exception. More importantly, they continue to take actions that help him politically ― whether it’s by burying investigations of his potential misconduct or voting in ways that advance his priorities.At this point, the most predictable part of any outrageous act or statement by Trump is the ensuing press conference by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), in which the speaker will dismiss whatever Trump has said or done with a joke ― or by pretending not to have heard about it ― and then shift the conversation to the importance of some legislative priority. In fact, it happened that way on Tuesday, after Trump’s latest Twitter attack on Corker. “I know Bob, who supported the budget, wants to get tax reform,” Ryan said, “and I know the president wants to get tax reform.”That may be the explanation for GOP behavior right there: that Republicans are so committed to their agenda that they will tolerate a potentially unstable and dangerous president in order to enact it. Or Republicans may simply fear the wrath of Trump, figuring they are one errant tweet away from facing primary challengers who, with the help of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, will end their political careers.That’s undoubtedly a big part of the story with both Corker and Flake. Both were looking at serious primary challenges from the Breitbart wing of the Republican Party. And both stood a good chance of losing, according to the polls, just as Huckabee Sanders said. If their prospects of reelection were stronger, they might not be committing such heresies now (although Flake, to his credit, has been speaking out for a while).Still, Republicans in Congress have the power to make a difference if they choose to. It’s happened before, most memorably on repeal of “Obamacare,” when three Republican senators voted against a bill Trump desperately wanted to pass.There will be more such opportunities in the future. Dissident Republicans could vote against the Republican tax cut, which will almost certainly violate repeated GOP pledges not to raise the deficit. They could insist upon disclosure of Trump’s tax returns or more aggressive investigations of Trump’s Russia connections. And in the Senate, where the GOP has only a 52-seat majority, a handful could even form an independent block that would remain committed to their conservative principles but operate as a check on Trump’s power. It would take only three to make a difference, though it’s easy to think of a half-dozen who would be obvious candidates to join.The possibility of an independent GOP caucus hasn’t gotten serious attention, but Republicans truly worried about Trump would be foolish not to think about it. Trump isn’t going to change his behavior until somebody makes him. And at least for now, that somebody would have to be the Republicans in Congress.Tuesday’s statements by Corker and Flake are a meaningful start, regardless of what steps they have or haven’t taken before. But to really have an impact, they will have to do more than give speeches. They will have to cast votes that live up to their rhetoric. And they will need some of their colleagues to do the same."

2,POLITICS,The Arizona Senate Race Is About To Be Bonkers,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-senate-race-2018_us_59ef9697e4b0bf1f883672a0,The first openly bisexual member of Congress could end up facing off against a Republican whose own party has called her a conspiracy theorist.,2017-10-24,"Veterans listen as Kelli Ward speaks during a campaign stop at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 720 in Phoenix on Aug. 11, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59efaf7f180000360ddfc134.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Now that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) is no longer seeking re-election in 2018, the Arizona Senate race is about to get very interesting. When the primaries wrap up next August, we could see the first openly bisexual member of Congress facing off against a woman who has been called an unhinged conspiracy theorist by members of her own party.Flake’s exit means former state Sen. Kelli Ward, the anointed candidate of the anti-establishment right, is now the most high-profile Republican in the race. Breitbart chairman and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has endorsed her, as have conservative commentators Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.Bannon recently referred to Ward as a “whirlwind” at a campaign rally he hosted, but that is not her most well-known nickname. The Senate Leadership Fund, a GOP-aligned super PAC, released a campaign ad earlier this year that reprised an attack branding her as “chemtrail Kelli Ward.” The spot was referencing a town hall Ward hosted in 2014, during which she fielded a number of questions about a conspiracy theory saying government- or corporate-controlled aircraft regularly disperse mind-controlling pollutants into the atmosphere.Ward has denied directly supporting those theories, however, and fact-checks say the ad took the town hall event out of context. Still, Ward clearly isn’t shy around conspiracy theorists. When she went on Alex Jones’ nationally syndicated radio show last year, she appeared to suggest that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) may be trying to kill her. Ward lost to McCain in the 2016 GOP Senate primary. In July, Ward also attracted criticism for suggesting McCain would die in office after being diagnosed with cancer. In a radio interview, she urged McCain to resign, laying the groundwork for her to be appointed to his Senate seat. Ward has aligned her campaign with President Donald Trump, expressing support for the president’s plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, pull up Obamacare “by the roots” and “drain the swamp” in Washington. But establishment Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) fear she’s too similar to the unsuccessful class of tea party-affiliated candidates who lost a string of elections in 2010 and 2012. Still, recent surveys had shown Ward polling ahead of Flake by a substantial margin.On the Democratic side, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) has emerged as the clear front-runner. Sinema made history in 2012 when she became the first openly bisexual person elected to Congress. Months later, she broke ground again by becoming the first member of Congress to describe her religion as “none.” Sinema identifies as religiously “unaffiliated,” and has said she prefers a “secular approach” and is a “student of all cultures in her community.”In a video announcing her candidacy last month, Sinema called herself “a little bit different than most people in politics.” She recounted being homeless for years while growing up, and described using a combination of hard work and public assistance to change her circumstances.The divergent profiles of Sinema and Ward would make for a fascinating contrast ― and, perhaps more likely, some disgusting mud-slinging. But who knows? Another challenger could shake up the race before next summer.There are already other upstart candidates in the race, including Deedra Abboud, a Muslim American attorney from Phoenix who is running as a Democrat and has faced Islamophobic attacks.Craig Brittain, a “free speech activist” who’s best known for launching a now-defunct revenge porn website, has also said he intends to run in the GOP primary. Although he may seem like a natural fit for a party increasingly associated with proud misogynists and internet trolls, Brittain faces an uphill climb to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot."

5,WOMEN,Matt McGorry: 'Good Men' Need To Step Up In Light Of Weinstein Allegations,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-mcgorry-good-men-need-to-step-up-in-light-of-weinstein-allegations_us_59ef43c6e4b07cf8380c6f33,The actor opened up about toxic masculinity in a Medium post.,2017-10-24,"Matt McGorry attends the Hollywood Reporter and SAG AFRA 2017 Emmy Nominees Night party on September 14, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ef44ee180000051bdfbf16.jpeg?cache=lpaAZ3oIac&ops=crop_0_93_2506_1430%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Matt McGorry is calling on good men to step up in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein.The 31-year-old actor published an essay on Medium on Monday detailing the different ways toxic masculinity and rape culture allow for predators like Weinstein to stay hidden for so long. Weinstein has been accused by over 40 women of sexual harassment, sexual abuse and/or rape. “As men, we constantly receive explicit and implicit messages from our culture about what it means to be a man. We must be dominant; our value is measured by our ability to have power over others ― especially women,” McGorry wrote. ”... By consciously or unconsciously believing that sexual conquests are evidence of our ‘manliness’ and heterosexuality, we reinforce the ignorant notion that women exist on this earth for our pleasure... and we undoubtedly feel cheated when they resist being perceived and treated as such.”The “Orange Is The New Black” and “How To Get Away With Murder” actor has been an outspoken social justice advocate since he first hit stardom in 2013. He regularly calls out sexism and racism in Hollywood. McGorry wrote that when he was younger he would always hear people throw out sexual violence statistics such as 1 in 5 women will be raped in their lifetimes. The actor, however, had a hard time believing that that could be true because he didn’t know any women who had been raped. “I did not realize that women who have been subjected to these acts of violence would often not discuss these experiences with anyone, and especially not with a man,” he added.The reality, McGorry wrote, is that men ― even those who believe they are “good” ― have been socialized to be “unsafe listeners” for women. “Questions and comments that consciously or unconsciously place blame on the survivor can amplify the emotional trauma of the violence, and can, in some cases, magnify the trauma of the rape exponentially,” he wrote. “With the stakes so high, why should women entrust men with these highly personal accounts, stories that ― in most cases ― are connected to tremendous shame, self-blame, and trauma?”McGorry added that men need to take responsibility for the role they play in rape culture, and that the best way to do that is to educate themselves. “As men who want to perceive ourselves as ‘good,’ we have a responsibility to challenge our preconceived notions surrounding violence against women, to educate ourselves, and to take a proactive, strong, and visible stance,” he wrote. “Most importantly, we need to have these conversations with other men. We need to not only speak out against abuse, but also to demonstrate how our culture perpetuates and normalizes this violence through sexist jokes, ‘locker room talk,’ slut shaming, and talking about women in dehumanizing ways.”Head over to Medium to read McGorry’s full essay.

Jeff Flake said he feels out of step with today's GOP.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ef8c1f180000051bdfc050.jpeg?cache=5in6vwM9Er&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) won’t run for re-election in 2018, The Arizona Republic first reported.Flake spoke about his decision on the Senate floor Tuesday, railing against the “appalling features of our current politics” and arguing that lawmakers should “never regard as normal the regular and casual undermining of our democratic norms and ideals.”“It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end,” he said.In a stunning takedown of President Donald Trump, Flake pleaded with his colleagues to “respect each other again in an atmosphere of shared facts and shared values” and called the president’s behavior “outrageous” and “dangerous to democracy.”“I will not be complicit or silent,” Flake said. “When the next generation asks us, ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up?’ What are we going to say?” Flake, who said he would serve the remainder of his term, told The Arizona Republic that he feels out of step with today’s GOP.“Here’s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I’m not willing to take, and that I can’t in good conscience take,” Flake told the publication. “It would require me to believe in positions I don’t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone.”“There may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican Party,” he said. Flake was critical of Trump during the 2016 election, although he didn’t outright condemn or campaign against the business mogul. Flake said in August 2016 that he had “little faith” Trump would change his ways and dismissed Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as “a joke.”Flake and Trump have been more explicitly at odds in recent months. The senator published a book this year called Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle, in which he takes on the president and the GOP, arguing that “conservatism is indeed in crisis.”In August, Trump attacked Flake in his home state and tweeted praise for the senator’s would-be 2018 challenger, Kelli Ward. Flake alluded to the fiery back-and-forth in his speech on the Senate floor, saying “undignified behavior” has become interchangeable with “telling it like it is.”Ward celebrated Flake’s announcement, tweeting that Arizona voters “are the big winner.”Flake’s decision puts an additional layer of stress on the Republican Party for the 2018 midterm elections. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who has also feuded with the president, already announced he will not seek re-election next year.Upon hearing of Flake’s decision, Corker praised the Arizona senator’s work.“He’s kinda quiet, but he stands for all the things that make our nation great and is willing to continue to say that even though we have demagogues and others who end up trying to take us in other directions,” he said.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who said on the Senate floor that it’s been “one of the honors” of his life to serve alongside Flake, told reporters he was “sorry” to hear of Flake’s decision.“I’m very sorry it’s happened,” McCain said. “He’s one of the most honorable men I’ve ever known.”Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) told HuffPost that Flake was making “a personal decision.”“I’ve got a lot of respect for Jeff, and I haven’t had a chance to talk to him about what his reason is,” Kennedy said. This story has been updated."

As of Tuesday, at least a quarter of the U.S. territory had no access to drinking water and nearly 76 percent of the island lacked power. Only 49 hospitals are currently running off the power grid, while many others are relying on generators. Last week, clinical epidemiologist David Capó told HuffPost that poor conditions meant Puerto Rico was at risk for outbreaks of leptospirosis, influenza and dengue if aggressive preventive measures weren’t immediately taken. “The potential for outbreak is imminent,” he said. Deseda echoed that concern on Tuesday.“Well, there is a fear,” she told HuffPost. “We’re concerned that it may happen, and that’s why we have to let the people know that they have to take things into their own hands and [take] action to prevent this from happening. Because we have the possible factors that can contribute to the development of outbreaks to those diseases if no precautions to decrease the risk are taken.”While some local doctors have said that little has been done in terms of preventive public health campaigns across the island, Deseda said educational campaigns are happening and information is being passed on via radio, Twitter and phone. But she also warned citizens from wading or swimming in bodies of water ― big or small ― which could be contaminated with the urine of diseased animals.Deseda detailed other remaining medical risks for Puerto Rico, including a potential for an increase in cases of conjunctivitis and gastroenteritis, also known as the stomach flu.“Gastroenteritis is one of the conditions that we have to follow very closely and monitor, especially for people that don’t have access to emergency rooms or hospitals,” she said. “We need to make sure that they have access to medical facilities so they can be hydrated to prevent further complications.” With the confirmations of the fatal leptospirosis cases, the death toll on the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria is now 51. But when HuffPost spoke to doctors about the disease, some expressed concern that cases were underreported or misdiagnosed."

One tells a scary story about the wage gap. A younger scout is so terrified he wets his vestment.RELATED: Why Do the Boy Scouts Want to Include Girls?The scout is hoisted on high and roundly celebrated for his ability to be moved by injustice.I could go on — and would love to — but the point is, as the meme goes: This is the future liberals want.Is it? The intense criticism of last week’s announcement that Boy Scouts of America will expand to include some girls suggested a slippery slope to social control by a cabal of anti-gender liberal power brokers. As someone who earned the rank of Eagle Scout — an honor I included on college applications and probably benefitted from in various ways over the years — I wanted to understand the objections to opening the opportunity to everyone.RELATED: What the Girl Scouts Can Learn From Women’s CollegesAnd why would some of the same people who objected to gay Boy Scouts also object to boys spending more time with girls?The most common argument I came across involved citing the name of the organization. There was emphasis on the word boy. As in, for example, North Carolina resident Kevin Stewart told Fox 8, “It’s called Boy Scouts for a reason.” And Troy Meekhof, a film student, wrote on Twitter, “It’s called ‘Boy’ Scouts for a reason.”The naming of the “Boy Scouts of America” came in 1910, when women could not vote, on the heels of Robert Baden-Powell’s 1908 book Scouting for Boys. Baden-Powell, a British army officer, sought to impart a lifestyle that would “combat brooding and selfishness.” Though in his text he also praised “women scouts of the nation” like Grace Darling and Florence Nightingale. And Baden-Powell is quoted by the Boy Scouts as having said, “It’s the spirit within, not the veneer without, that makes a man.”RELATED: From Girl Scout to Girl Scouts’ CEOThe boys of 2017 will go on to relate to women in ways different from the boys of 1910 — who would know women as wives and family, but had little expectation of working together as peers. Vice President Mike Pence opts against working lunches alone with women, but elsewhere expectations of professional relationships without regard to gender are common. And they have proven extremely difficult or impossible again and again and again for men raised in a previous era.The essence of the debate was well captured by commentator Tomi Lahren, who noted: “All this BS about girls invited to join Boy Scouts. Ever heard of GIRL Scouts? It’s okay for girls to be girls and boys to be boys!!”People have heard of Girl Scouts, in my experience. They sell cookies that are vastly better than Boy Scout popcorn. What’s interesting here is the language of acceptance: It’s okay to be a certain way, a phrase typically used to empower a marginalized group. Here it’s used to defend a rigid understanding of the way the world should be divided — one perceived to be under attack.Others echoed this appeal to antiquity: This is the way things have been for more than 100 years, and so it is self-evident that they should not change. As commentator Liz Wheeler put it, “Only boys should be Boy Scouts. Only girls should be Girl Scouts. Because girls and boys are different. Why is that so hard for liberals?!”Assuming that’s a genuine question, I may have an answer. A constant tension among human-rights advocacy is whether to focus on protection or freedom. Nowhere is the debate more heated than on questions of gender and sexuality. There are times when it is necessary to highlight differences among groups of people, and there are times when it’s beneficial to downplay differences. When calling out discrimination and injustice predicated on such a difference, it needs to be discussed frankly. When the difference is being named to excuse injustice, it’s better to emphasize what everyone has in common.The separate-but-equal approach casts women as a group to be respected and protected but understood as deeply other. It also reinforces the idea of two monolithic genders that interact in a particular way.This is the heart of the issue, and it was most clear to me in the objections invoking sex and rape. Some expressed concern that the boys will engage in violence against the girls. A columnist at The Blaze wrote a very popular tweet: “Liberals: ‘Men are dangerous rapists.’ Also liberals: ‘Men should go in girl locker rooms and girls should go camping with Boy Scouts.’”But these so-called liberal claims are not contradictory. The idea is that the solution to sexual violence is not to separate men and women, but for people not to commit sexual violence. That will involve cultural change that begins with small policies.During past years’ debates over banning openly gay and trans Boy Scouts and leaders, detractors cited the potential for sexual activity among males in the woods. Some of the same detractors now expressed concern about boys being with girls. The fundamental element there is really not the preservation of heterosexuality, but the preservation of status. The objection is to anything that threatens the exclusive nature of what it means to be a man as it refers to a code of identity that commands power.The darkest side of this code recurs in story after story after story. Earlier this month, producer Harvey Weinstein invoked it in his defense that he had come from “a different generation.” And it’s possible to acknowledge the relevance of that admission without absolving him of guilt. His alleged and admitted behavior suggests that he fundamentally did not see women as peers — or even as autonomous beings with the right not to be abused. At age 65, it’s unlikely that even the most intensive therapies would undo or reverse this way of seeing the world once it’s so deeply etched into a person’s consciousness.The learning might have happened, though, through constant exposure to a world in which boys and girls, men and women, interact with each other in quotidian ways — ways not sexual or objective or predicated on differences. A world in which variously gendered people can operate in the same vicinity and there is no need for teaching anyone about other groups being “equal” at all.This is far from what’s on the table at the moment with the Boy Scouts’ announcement. But it does seem to represent a step toward what is a very clear takeaway from last week — or maybe year, or ever — that boys need to learn how to interact with girls.This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Death at a Penn State Fraternity, Google X and the Science of Radical Creativity"

As an affiliate of the Partnership for Working Families (PWF), LAANE believes in the power of cities to create changes at the local level that can be replicated throughout the country. We have seen several instances of cities setting the stage for broader statewide and national change, including the recent minimum wage increase. Policies addressing climate change should follow the same path, and given the regressive policies coming out of DC, cities are more important than ever in creating change.Immediately following this administration’s astonishing decision to remove ourselves from the Paris Climate Accord, mayors across the country, including Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, pledged their commitment to upholding the spirit of the agreement. Rather than simply denouncing this backwards stance on climate, Los Angeles is creating a replicable blueprint that other cities can use to take action and protect our environment. Here in Los Angeles, LAANE’s work with the Don’t Waste LA Coalition, which includes environmental partners like the NRDC, Earthjustice, Sierra Club, LA Food Policy Council, small businesses, food recovery groups, and Teamsters Local 396, has transformed LA’s commercial waste industry. LA’s new exclusive franchise system for businesses and apartments — known as recycLA — will result in major environmental and worker safety benefits in the coming years. LA will see the removal of two million tons of GHG emissions from the atmosphere, the city will divert 90% of waste from landfills by 2025, clean fuel truck fleets will be used instead of dirty diesel trucks, traffic will be reduced, we will invest $200 million in new infrastructure, and additional and improved sanitation jobs will be created for thousands of waste workers.The implementation of recycLA earlier this summer makes LA a national leader in modern and sustainable waste collection. This is a key example of how cities are fighting back to resist climate change and taking the high-road approach to worker safety and benefits.It took a great deal of research, coalition building, and advocacy to get us to this point. After dozens of stakeholder meetings and a full Program Environmental Impact Report (PEIR), independent industry experts, city staff, and elected officials concluded that an exclusive franchise system like recycLA is the only way for the city to meet all of its stated goals. This type of system allows LA to hold an important public service to high standards, such as contractually obligating haulers to divert 90% of waste from landfills each year. Haulers that don’t meet the city’s requirements can be fined, or even lose their contract. Non-exclusive systems lack this accountability, making it difficult to get to zero waste. While implementing a city-wide system change of this magnitude has produced some bumps in the road, it’s important to underscore that recycLA is designed to financially incentivize zero waste. LA has transitioned from using a waste system that made it difficult to do the right thing for the environment by offering expensive recycling, to one that rewards it, since recycLA now provides free recycling to all customers. A major incentive is for customers to produce less waste to save money, helping us move toward our goal of zero waste. Up to two-thirds of what the commercial sector throws away in LA could be recycled or composted, and the more customers recycle, the more they can potentially save. Currently, waste haulers are deploying dozens of zero waste specialists to go door-to-door in neighborhoods throughout LA to conduct waste assessments for customers. These assessments teach landlords and commercial property owners how to reduce the size of their existing waste bin or their current number of weekly pickups by recycling more, donating edible food, and doing more efficient front-end purchasing. A great example of a waste assessment consultation is the experience of Vintage King Audio in Echo Park. This business consulted with a waste assessor to better understand its needs, then increased its recycling rate to 90% and its trash bill was cut in half. With a successful implementation that includes stakeholder participation and education for Angelenos on zero waste, LA has become a national model in leading the resistance against climate change. Other cities are taking notice, and our PWF affiliate in New York City, ALIGN, is spearheading a process that will drastically reduce NYC’s carbon footprint. As LA leads the way, we look forward to other cities embracing actionable resistance at the local level, and paving the way for a national environmental justice platform."

The finding contradicts conventional wisdom that urban areas have a lock on innovation.By Bryce Oates and Tim MaremaLarge manufacturing firms in rural America are at least as likely as similar urban firms to use innovative methods that can contribute to job creation and increased earnings, a new report says.Though preliminary, the study may indicate that there are exceptions to the oft-repeated rule that economic innovation is the nearly exclusive purview of urban-based businesses.“The findings in this report regarding the prevalence of rural innovation challenge the conventional wisdom that rural nonfarm innovation is relatively rare and idiosyncratic,” the report says. While large rural manufacturers had an innovation edge, that finding did not hold true for small and medium-sized rural manufacturers, the study shows. (See bar chart below.)The study by the USDA’s Economic Research Service looked at non-farm rural economic sectors like manufacturing and services, which have not received as much attention from rural economists as agriculture-related activities. The research looked at the years 2010-2014, which correspond with the period of economic recovery following the Great Recession.The researchers found that a majority of rural manufacturers with 100 or more employees were “substantive innovators.” That means those firms did things like reform their business practices based on customer feedback, create new products or significantly modify old ones, analyze data to evaluate progress and efficiency, and use trade-secret protections like non-disclosure agreements or non-compete clauses.About 53 percent of large rural manufacturers met the criteria to be considered “substantive innovators.” Only about 49 percent of large urban manufacturers met those criteria.The approximate difference of 4 percentage points between rural and urban innovation rates fell within the study’s margin of error, however. That means the numbers represent a kind of statistical tie.Even with a statistical dead heat, the finding is remarkable because of assumptions that urban areas have a big innovation advantage from factors such as larger skilled-labor pools and better information and supply networks, said report co-author Tim Wojan in an email. Timothy Parker co-authored the study.“This preliminary analysis supports the hypothesis that continuous improvement programs, data-driven decision making, and more far-ranging innovation activities were associated with faster recovery from the Great Recession,” the study said.Wojan and Parker found that the bulk of innovative rural manufacturers were in the sectors of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computers, plastics, and textiles. Some examples of innovations are the use of robotics to produce textiles, smart-phone based transportation services, and higher-speed internet communications systems.The study also showed that job growth was faster in innovation-intensive rural industries, compared to non-innovative ones. Innovative enterprises added 153,736 jobs during the recovery from the Great Recession. That’s a growth rate of 8.4 percent. Non-innovative firms added 130,345 jobs, a 5.4 growth rate.Despite this growth from 2010 to 2014, the number of jobs in rural America is still lower today than it was in 2008 before the recession. In comparison, metropolitan America regained all its lost jobs by 2013 and had about 5 percent more employment at the end of 2016 than it did before the recession.The strongest employment growth in the rural innovation sector during the economic recovery period came from transportation equipment, beverages and tobacco, machinery manufacturing, scenic/sightseeing transportation, fabricated metals, and data processing. For the non-innovation sector, the strongest growth was seen in mining support activities, water transportation, oil and gas, and pipeline activities. Significant decreases were found in the rural communications sector, including publishing, broadcasting, printing, and telecommunications.The researchers used the 2014 Economic Research Service Rural Establishment Innovation Survey (REIS). REIS is the first nationally representative sample of self-reported innovation in rural communities, designed to “examine the impetus, outcomes, and prevalence of rural innovation.”"

They’re halting steps to stay one foot ahead of government regulation, which Zuckerberg and company fears the most.Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the “Honest Ads Act.” If passed, it would require online political ads to conform to the same rules as political ads bought in traditional media.Facebook has hired at least two lobbying firms with the stated goals of addressing “issues ... related to online advertising... and transparency efforts” and the ongoing Russia investigation. It’s safe to assume they weren’t hired to help facilitate passage of the Honest Ads Act."

Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was friends with Wieseltier ― which makes her withdrawal all the more notable. Wieseltier helped Jobs and her organization, Emerson Collective, become more interested in investing in journalistic publications. She also recently struck a deal for a majority stake in The Atlantic. “It was a friend of many of us here, Leon Wieseltier, who first put me onto the possibility that Laurene might come to love The Atlantic as I have,” Atlantic Media Chairman David Bradley wrote in a memo to staff in July. “For its part, Emerson Collective had begun to invest in serious journalism for its own sake.

13,POLITICS,Appeals Court: Teen Immigrant Can Get Abortion Over Trump Administration Objections,Ryan J. Reilly and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teen-immigrant-abortion-trump_us_59ef81c0e4b0b7e632655cdb,The ruling tosses out a decision by a panel of federal appeals court judges.,2017-10-24,The Planned Parenthood Federation of America and coalition partners protest last week for Jane Doe's right to get an abortion.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ef820a150000482e7472a0.jpeg?cache=hCBnG2r14Y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with an undocumented pregnant teenager in a nationally watched case on Tuesday, ordering that she could obtain an abortion. The decision, by the full court of appeals, overrules a divided ruling issued last week by a panel of three federal appeals court judges sitting on the court.By majority rule, the federal appeals court judges said that a lower appeals court should reissue an order that allowed the undocumented teen to obtain an abortion. The majority ruling said the district court was “best suited to promptly determine in the first instance the appropriate dates for compliance with the injunction” and that the court would retain “full discretion to conduct proceedings and make any factual findings deemed necessary and appropriate to the district court’s exercise of its equitable judgment.”The case involves “Jane Doe,” a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant from a country where abortion is outlawed. Doe, who is now about 16 weeks pregnant, received permission from a state judge to receive an abortion back on Sept. 25, and her abortion has now been delayed for a month as she has moved into her second trimester. Delaying the abortion longer would increase health risks to the 17-year-old and threaten her ability to get an abortion at all. In Texas, where she is in government custody, abortion is illegal after 20 weeks.In a dissent, U.S. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a George W. Bush appointee who was on Trump’s shortlist for the Supreme Court, said the majority ruling amounted to allowing “unlawful immigrant minors to have an immediate abortion on demand.” He wrote that the case was “novel and highly fraught” and that he thought the panel of three judges made the right decision.“The majority seems to think that the United States has no good reason to want to transfer an unlawful immigrant minor to an immigration sponsor before the minor has an abortion. But consider the circumstances here. The minor is alone and without family or friends. She is in a U.S. Government detention facility in a country that, for her, is foreign. She is 17 years old. She is pregnant and has to make a major life decision,” he wrote. “Is it really absurd for the United States to think that the minor should be transferred to her immigration sponsor ― ordinarily a family member, relative, or friend ― before she makes that decision?”The teen has been in U.S. government custody for nearly two months and two people have been ruled out as potential sponsors. Attorneys said they are unsure whether anyone else is available in the near future.The Trump administration has refused to allow her to leave government custody to get an abortion, instead sending her to a “crisis pregnancy center” where she was urged not to terminate the pregnancy. A government attorney said officials are not blocking her access to abortion ― she could leave the country to get one, even though it would take her out of immigration proceedings and the procedure is illegal in her native country. The attorney also said she could find a U.S. sponsor, which is out of her hands and controlled by the government.Judge Patricia Millett, who dissented from the prior ruling by the panel, said the decision by the full court “rights a grave constitutional wrong” by the government.“Remember, we are talking about a child here. A child who is alone in a foreign land. A child who, after her arrival here in a search for safety and after the government took her into custody, learned that she is pregnant. [Jane Doe] then made a considered decision, presumably in light of her dire circumstances, to terminate that pregnancy. Her capacity to make the decision about what is in her best interests by herself was approved by a Texas court consistent with state law. She did everything that Texas law requires to obtain an abortion. That has been undisputed in this case,” Millett wrote.Millett said the Trump administration had “bulldozed over constitutional lines” by contending that Jane Doe should be forced to leave the country if she wanted an abortion.“Surely the mere act of entry into the United States without documentation does not mean that an immigrant’s body is no longer her or his own. Nor can the sanction for unlawful entry be forcing a child to have a baby,” Millett wrote. “The bedrock protections of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause cannot be that shallow.”The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Jane Doe, argued the government was violating her constitutional right to an abortion.Last Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan sided with them and ordered the government to allow Jane Doe to obtain an abortion “promptly and without delay.”The next day, however, the appeals court again delayed her abortion so it could hear the case. The panel then ruled that the government could continue to block the teen from getting an abortion until at least Oct. 31, so long as it searched for a sponsor in the U.S. to take her in.Blocking Jane Doe’s abortion is part of a larger pattern from the Trump administration.The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border and finds sponsors to take them in, has created new anti-abortion policies under President Donald Trump. Since at least March, the office has disallowed shelters from taking minors to terminate their pregnancies without the approval of its anti-abortion director, E. Scott Lloyd.Under the previous administration, ORR directors were only involved in decision-making with regard to the use of federal funds for abortions for victims of rape and incest, or if the life of the mother was at risk.The Office of Refugee Resettlement has taken other measures to deter abortion as well. The agency sent Jane Doe to a “crisis pregnancy center” where she was urged to reconsider her decision, and barred her from recreational activities, according to her attorneys. Other minors have received direct pressure from ORR officials ― including Lloyd himself ― not to get abortions.Read the court order below:"
14,BLACK VOICES,How Campus Racism Could Affect Black Students' College Enrollment,"The Atlantic, ContributorExploring the American idea since 1857",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-campus-racism-could-affect-black-students-college_us_59ef6e5fe4b00a4ce5a221d4,"At risk are colleges’ and universities’ reputations as champions of diversity, as well as black students’ academic success.",2017-10-24,<p>Students walks past a quote in chalk credited to Nelson Mandela at the University of Virginia a week after a white nationalist rally took place on campus.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ef6f7d1800004506dfbfd1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Melinda D. AndersonAt American University, a private university in Washington, D.C., the commitment to cultural diversity is an integral part of its marketing and outreach to prospective students. And for Janelle Gray, a black freshman from Northern Virginia, such advertising worked. Information sessions and campus visits emphasized that AU valued racial and ethnic diversity, a feature that Gray said drew her to the school.In the spring of 2017, two days after accepting AU’s admission offer, Gray learned that bananas hung on rope fashioned into nooses — a symbol of racial terror and intimidation against black Americans — were found in several spots on AU’s campus. The incident coincided with the university’s first black woman student-government president taking office. Gray never reconsidered her decision to attend AU because she was equally drawn to its international-relations program. But she admits she arrived on campus last summer with a lot of uncertainty and fear. Then last month, it happened again: Ten confederate-flag posters with cotton stalks were pinned to AU’s campus bulletin boards. This time Gray was devastated. “I went to sleep that night, feeling like this situation is just so surreal,” she said. “We come here to learn, and we shouldn’t have to deal with things like this.”Gray’s experience, and the racist acts on her campus, is neither rare nor random. The episodes correspond with what the Anti-Defamation League identifies as an unprecedented increase in white supremacist activity on college grounds that began in fall 2016. Since the start of this academic year, black college students have been targeted in a rash of attacks — at an Ivy League university in New York, at a public college in Illinois, at a Catholic college in Pennsylvania, and at a flagship state university in Michigan. With another college-application season starting and a new crop of black students finalizing their selections, an overarching question persists: To what degree will racist incidents on college campuses — and colleges’ response to those incidents — affect black-student enrollment? At risk are colleges’ and universities’ reputations as champions of diversity, as well as black students’ academic success.RELATED: UVA’s Troubling PastAccording to data provided by American University, the percentage of black freshmen accepting AU’s offers of admission increased from 33 percent last year to 38 percent this year, continuing an upward trend for the third consecutive enrollment cycle. Notably, the banana and noose incident occurred in May after many high-school seniors, like Gray, had finalized which college to attend. To date, AU reports applications from black students for the fall 2018 semester are up 6.5 percent from that for the current semester. However, the full impact of last month’s event on black students’ decision to enroll has yet to crystallize.In a prepared statement, Teresa Flannery, AU’s vice president of communication, said the university sought to address last spring’s racist episode “directly and promptly” with current and prospective students. Among the actions taken were a schoolwide community meeting and a webinar the first week of May for new students and families to address their worries. AU similarly held a town hall meeting after the confederate posters appeared in late September. “Though we have not found the effects of these events to be reflected in enrollment and retention, that does not mean we believe there were no negative effects,” Flannery wrote. “Certainly, we are concerned about the effects on students’ sense of belonging … and on their sense of safety and wellness.” While it’s hard to say whether AU has, compared to other universities, witnessed unusually high rates of racism on campus, the fact that it’s experienced particularly high-profile incidents makes it a case study worth analyzing.In Gray’s observation, AU’s challenge is in translating the concern for black students into substantive action. “The administration did a really good job [at September’s town hall] … acting empathetic towards our situation,” Gray noted. But for her, too little has changed in the days since: “All I’ve seen are I give you my condolences, I feel bad for you, but what I want to see is … [visible change on] these issues of racism on campus.”RELATED: What Ole Miss Can Teach Universities About Grappling With Their PastsOthers share her frustration. Sarah Pascarella, a Boston-based writer and editor who graduated from AU in 2000, points to racism at AU dating back two decades. During the 1996-97 school year, the school’s student newspaper was accused of racism against a black student-government candidate after it cited a “fear” that she would only cater to certain students in its endorsement of her opponent. When the young woman protested, her letter-to-the-editor was published above a comic containing monkeys. Pascarella, like Gray, was a freshman at the time. “As an alumna, I’m appalled at what black students are experiencing at American University,” said Pascarella, who’s white. “Same as in the late ’90s, the university has much work to do to ensure these incidents are not tolerated, and that all students feel safe and welcome.”Still, the degree to which racist acts adversely affect student enrollment remains an open question. A historic look at dramatic, high-profile events on and near college campuses offers an interesting point of comparison. The May 1970 Kent State University shootings — in which members of the Ohio National Guard fired into a crowd killing students protesting the Vietnam War — caused a “tremendous blow to the reputation of the school,” according to an article on a student-news website, and that fall’s enrollment declined.But more recent examples suggest that at in-demand schools such as American, enrollment rates are quite tenacious. At NYU, the terrorist attacks on 9/11 struck just south of its sprawling Manhattan campus, yet the school’s enrollment held firm. Fall enrollment following the April 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech — where a student killed 32 classmates and faculty members before taking his own life — remained steady. And there were no signs of an enrollment freefall at University of California, Davis, after a campus police officer doused student protesters with pepper spray in November 2011, which was captured on video and sparked national outrage.RELATED: The Cost of Balancing Academia and RacismIt’s unclear, though, how targeted acts directed at a small, underrepresented group — rather than random, unpredictable violence — translates to college choices. The University of Virginia in Charlottesville is the state’s premier institution of higher education — and a campus where black students demonstrated in 2015 to call attention to racism and the challenges of black student life. Most recently, the school’s president and other administrators were harshly criticized for letting torch-wielding neo-Nazis and white supremacists march onto its campus the night of August 11, 2017. The next day a white nationalist rally in the city of Charlottesville turned violent as the governor issued a state of emergency and UVA students sheltered in place.Marcus Martin, UVA’s vice president and chief officer for diversity, in a written statement highlighted the “significant progress” the university has made in the areas of black-student recruitment, enrollment, and graduation, citing a 43 percent increase in first-year black-student enrollment in the past five years. What’s striking, though, are black-student data from UVA’s “diversity dashboard” listing the offers rate (the percentage of applicants who were offered admission) and the yield rate (the percentage of students who accepted the offers of admission and enrolled.)From 2012 to 2014, as the offers to black students gradually climbed from 30.4 percent to 34.8 percent, the yield rate gradually fell from 37 percent to 34.2 percent. The number of black students accepting UVA’s offer saw a brief jump in 2015 (36.1 percent) before falling back to 34.6 percent in 2016. More simply: 320 black students rejected UVA’s offer of admission in 2012, 350 in 2013, 455 in 2014, 432 in 2015, and 504 in 2016.An admissions officer at UVA was unavailable for comment. But Tom Green, who oversees strategic enrollment management at the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, warned against concluding that the dwindling yield rates mean black-student interest in UVA is declining. The data don’t reveal how many of the admitted students come from areas where there’s less demand for the university, for example.Yet Lecia Brooks, the outreach director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil-rights nonprofit based in Montgomery, Alabama, predicted that black-student enrollment will begin to take a hit if college administrators allow racist threats and attacks to go unchecked. While some universities have continued to see incremental growth in their black-student populations, Brooks said the outlook could change as parents and students weigh their options, and the racial climate on campuses begins to factor into their decision-making.“Students are paying attention to how administrators are responding to these incidents, and kind of watching to see [if] they really stand for these lofty initiatives around diversity and inclusion like they say they do,” she explained. Additionally, the Clery Act — a federal law that requires colleges and universities to collect and publish information about crimes on and around their campuses — mandates that crimes motivated by hate or bias be included in annual reports. Brooks said parents armed with these statistics will have “a real eye-opener … schools would be hard-pressed to act like [racism on campus] never touched them.”Clery Act data show that the number of reported incidents of intimidation — the most common type of hate crime in 2014, the most recent year for which figures are available—increased from 260 in 2010 to 343 in 2014. The hate crimes were most frequently associated with racism and anti-LGBT bias. (The number of reported incidents of destruction, damage, and vandalism, however, decreased between 2010 and 2014.)To address doubts that arise for black students and families, Brooks advised that universities require constant professional development with faculty and staff, and make combatting racial injustice on their campuses a genuine part of their programming and recruitment efforts. “But more than that,” she said, administrators have “a moral obligation to take a strong stand against the incursion of white supremacy on college campuses and ensure that every individual in that campus community feels safe.”A tougher stance is vitally important for new students — and for black students who choose to stay and matriculate at schools with well-publicized racist incidents. Lauren Mims, of Fairfax, Virginia, earned her bachelor’s at UVA in 2012 and is currently pursuing a doctorate in educational psychology. Mims credits UVA for incredible relationships and opportunities — “I feel like I grew up at the University of Virginia” — but has always felt like race relations at UVA could be better. “I would hear a lot of microaggressions in the classroom. There was an incident with Yik Yak where there were racial slurs calling black students monkeys. There have been racist posters put up [on campus],” she said.Still, Mims has never considered leaving UVA, nor has she heard black classmates talk of transferring. Following the white supremacist rally, she and other black alumni gathered with current UVA students to address fears and offer support. Many students cited the prestige of the university and being first-generation college-goers for their pride in being at UVA. They also spoke of making painful compromises for a quality education — factors that can’t be measured on enrollment and retention graphs. “Many students talked about how it is really hard being here as a black student,” Mims said. “It’s a university where I can get my degree, where I’m working towards my future career. All of that is just as important to me now as it was before August 11 and 12, even if it makes being a student here harder.”This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: Death at a Penn State Fraternity, Google X and the Science of Radical Creativity"

Kevin Perlich told CBS11. Police didn’t elaborate.Mathews was charged with injury to a child, a first-degree felony punishable by up to life in prison, according to police. Bail was set at $1 million.On Sunday morning, police said they found the body of a child in a culvert near the Mathews’ home. Perlich told HuffPost the body is “most likely” Sherin’s. The medical examiner will determine identification and a cause of death. Mathews was charged with abandoning or endangering a child on Oct. 7 after his adopted daughter, Sherin Mathews, who police said had development issues and limited verbal communication skills, went missing.He told police at the time that he’d ordered the 3-year-old to stand near a tree near an alley outside their house at 3 a.m. as punishment for refusing to drink her milk. He also told police that coyotes had previously been spotted lurking around the alley.Mathews said he went outside to check on the toddler about 15 minutes later, but found her missing. He waited five hours before calling the police, according to authorities.Matthews’ wife, Sini Mathews, Sherin’s adoptive mother, was cooperating with police to identify the body, her attorney told Dallas Morning News. The mother, who said she was asleep when Sherin went missing, has not been charged with a crime.Authorities placed the couple’s 4-year-old biological daughter in foster care as the investigation continues. A judge postponed a custody hearing for the child on Monday and said she would remain in foster care for three more weeks, reported the Morning News.Sherin was adopted by the couple from an orphanage in the Indian state of Bihar in June, according to Indian news outlets. Indian officials expressed alarm over her disappearance. In a tweet last week, Sushma Swaraj, India’s minister of external affairs, said she was “deeply concerned about the missing child.”"

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/taxes-child-credit_us_59efad1ce4b04917c593ffee,"Unless the $1,000-per-child tax credit is doubled, most lower- and middle-income families will barely see a cut, if at all.",2017-10-24,"Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, says the GOP tax cut package is moving quickly: “This is a much faster thing than anyone expected.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59efadce140000610d8c97fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Republican tax cut package appears to be on a fast track to approval but with one key detail unresolved: how much, or even if, middle- and lower-income families will benefit at all.With the House prepared to vote on the Senate’s version of a budget framework on Thursday, GOP leaders could start moving actual legislation slashing taxes and adding trillions of dollars to the national debt before the end of this month.“This is a much faster thing than anyone expected,” said Grover Norquist, a longtime anti-tax activist who runs the powerful Americans for Tax Reform.He added that even the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose members have complained about increasing the national debt, are ready to a vote for the Senate budget, which permits a $1.5 trillion increase in the debt for the sake of tax cuts. “What used to be the ‘shutting down the government caucus’ is now the ‘let’s pass this thing’ caucus,” Norquist said.Yet even Norquist did not know what GOP lawmakers would agree upon when it comes to the one piece of the package that will determine whether most American families will see any tax relief at all: the child tax credit.It currently stands at up to $1,000 per child, and while the White House and Republican congressional leaders in Congress have promised to increase it, they have not stated what that the new level would be.“It’s not the size Ivanka wanted,” Norquist said, adding that he believed President Donald Trump’s daughter had been lobbying for an increase to $3,000.If the new amount is only $1,500, that would give middle-income families barely a tax cut at all ― a few hundred dollars per household for the bottom three-fifths of income earners, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, which used the $1,500 figure in its assumptions.If the credit remains at $1,000, it would mean a tax increase for most households with even one child, because the new plan eliminates the current $4,050-per-person tax deduction while increasing the “standard deduction” by $11,300.Even more important to lower-income families is whether the larger child tax credit is made fully “refundable,” which it currently is not. Making that change would benefit the poorest families, to whom it would make the biggest difference, because their incomes are often too low for them to owe any income tax.Norquist said this issue as well as some other “pay-fors” ― elimination of existing tax breaks to make up for revenue lost by rate reductions ― are still being hammered out but that the central pieces of the deal are set.Among the agreed-to elements: lowering the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent; lowering the top rate on so-called “pass-through” small businesses from 39.5 percent to 25 percent; and cutting the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.“I’m reasonably pleased,” Norquist said.Norquist said he has also won commitments from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Vice President Mike Pence in recent meetings to move tax cut bills every year, not just this year. He said the promise of another bill next year will make it easier to win support from interest groups whose particular issue is not included in this year’s legislation.“If there’s only one plane out of Casablanca, everyone’s got pretty sharp elbows,” Norquist said.The Tax Policy Center analysis estimated that the tax cuts would add $2.4 trillion to the debt over a decade, with half of the total benefit flowing to the richest 1 percent of Americans."

Pruitt surely must be aware that fossil fuels have been feasting at the government trough for at least 100 years. Renewables, by comparison, have received support only since the mid-1990s and, until recently, have had to subsist on scraps. Perhaps a review of the facts can set Administrator Pruitt straight. There’s a strong case to be made that Congress should terminate subsidies for fossil fuels and extend them for renewables, not the other way around.A Century (or Two) of SubsidiesTo promote domestic energy production, the federal government has been serving the oil and gas industry a smorgasbord of subsidies since the early days of the 20th Century. Companies can deduct the cost of drilling wells, for example, as well as the cost of exploring for and developing oil shale deposits. They even get a domestic manufacturing deduction, which is intended to keep U.S. industries from moving abroad, even though — by the very nature of their business — they can’t move overseas. All told, from 1918 through 2009, the industry’s tax breaks and other subsidies amounted to an average of $4.86 billion annually (in 2010 dollars), according to a 2011 study by DBL Investors, a venture capital firm. Accounting for inflation, that would be $5.53 billion a year today. The DBL study didn’t include coal due to the lack of data for subsidies going back to the early 1800s, but the federal government has lavished considerably more on the coal industry than on renewables. In 2008 alone, coal received between $3.2 billion and $5.4 billion in subsidies, according to a 2011 Harvard Medical School study in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. Meanwhile, wind and other renewable energy technologies, DBL found, averaged only $370 million a year in subsidies between 1994 and 2009, the equivalent of $421 million a year today. The 2009 economic stimulus package did provide $21 billion for renewables, but that support barely began to level the playing field that has tilted in favor of oil and gas for 100 years and coal for more than 200. A 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute looked at U.S. energy subsidies since the turn of this century. It found that between 2002 and 2008, the federal government gave fossil fuels six times more than what it gave solar, wind and other renewables. Coal, natural gas and oil benefited from $72.5 billion in subsidies (in 2007 dollars) over that seven-year period, while “traditional” renewable energy sources — mainly wind and solar — received only $12.2 billion. A pie chart from the report shows that 71 percent of federal subsidies went to coal, natural gas and oil, 17 percent — $16.8 billion — went to corn ethanol, and the remaining 12 percent went to traditional renewables. A new study by Oil Change International brings us up to date. Published earlier this month, it found that federal subsidies in 2015 and 2016 averaged $10.9 billion a year for the oil and gas industry and $3.8 billion for the coal industry. By contrast, the wind industry’s so-called production tax credit, renewed by Congress in December 2015, amounted to $3.3 billion last year, according to a Congress Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate. Unlike the fossil fuel industry’s permanent subsidies, Congress has allowed the wind tax credit to expire six times in the last 20 years, and it is now set to decline incrementally until ending in 2020. Similarly, Congress fixed the solar industry’s investment tax credit at 30 percent of a project’s cost through 2019, but reduced it to 10 percent for commercial projects and zeroed it out for residences by the end of 2021. The JCT estimates that the solar credit amounted to a $2.4-billion tax break last year. Totaling it up, fossil fuels — at $14.7 billion — still received two-and-a-half times more in federal support than solar and wind in 2016. The Costs of PollutionSubsidy numbers tell only part of the story. Besides a century or two of support, the federal government has allowed fossil fuel companies and electric utilities to “externalize” their costs of production and foist them on the public. Although coal now only generates 30 percent of U.S. electricity, down from 50 percent in 2008, it is still responsible for two-thirds of the electric utility sector’s carbon emissions and is a leading source of toxic pollutants linked to cancer; cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological diseases; and premature death. The 2011 Harvard Medical School study cited above estimated coal’s “life cycle” cost to the country — including its impact on miners, public health, the environment and the climate — at $345 billion a year.In July 2016, the federal government finally began regulating the more than 1,400 coal ash ponds across the country containing billions of gallons of heavy metals and other byproducts from burning coal. Coal ash, which has been leaching and spilling into local groundwater, wetlands, creeks and rivers, can cause cancer, heart and lung disease, birth defects and neurological damage in humans, and can devastate bird, fish and frog populations. But that was last year. Since taking office, the Trump administration has been working overtime to bolster coal, which can no longer compete economically with natural gas or renewables. Earlier this year, it rescinded a rule that would have protected waterways from mining waste, and a few months ago it filed a repeal of another Obama-era measure that would have increased mineral royalties on federal lands. More recently, Energy Secretary Rick Perry asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure that coal plants can recover all of their costs, whether those plants are needed or not. Natural gas burns more cleanly than coal, but its drilling sites, processing plants and pipelines leak methane, and its production technique — hydraulic fracturing — can contaminate water supplies and trigger earthquakes. Currently the fuel is responsible for nearly a third of the electric utility sector’s carbon emissions. Meanwhile, the U.S. transportation sector — whose oil-powered engine exhaust exacerbates asthma and likely causes other respiratory problems and heart disease — is now the nation’s largest carbon polluter, edging out the electric utility sector last year for the first time since the late 1970s. Like the coal industry, the oil and gas industry has friends in high places. Thanks to friendly lawmakers and administrations, natural gas developers are exempt from key provisions of seven major environmental laws that protect air and water from toxic chemicals. Permitting them to flout these critical safeguards forces taxpayers to shoulder the cost of monitoring, remediation and cleanup — if they happen at all. The Benefits of Clean EnergyUnlike fossil fuels, wind and solar energy do not emit toxic pollutants or greenhouse gases. They also are not subject to price volatility: wind gusts and solar rays are free, so more renewables would help stabilize energy prices. And they are becoming less expensive, more productive, and more reliable every year. According to a recent Department of Energy (DOE) report, power from new wind farms last year cost a third of wind’s price in 2010 and was cheaper than electricity from natural gas plants. Perhaps the biggest bonus of transitioning to a clean energy system, however, is the fact that the benefits of improved air quality and climate change mitigation far outweigh the cost of implementation, according to a January 2016 DOE study. Conducted by researchers at the DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the study assessed the impact of standards in 29 states and the District of Columbia that require utilities to increase their use of renewables by a certain percentage by a specific year. Called renewable electricity (or portfolio) standards, they range from California and New York’s ambitious goals of 50 percent by 2030 to Wisconsin’s modest target of 10 percent by 2015. It turns out that it cost utilities nationwide approximately $1 billion a year between 2010 and 2013 — generally the equivalent of less than 2 percent of average statewide retail electricity rates — to comply with the state standards. On the benefit side of the equation, however, standards-spawned renewable technologies in 2013 alone generated $7.4 billion in public health and other societal benefits by reducing carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. They also saved consumers as much as $1.2 billion by lowering wholesale electricity prices and as much as $3.7 billion by reducing natural gas prices, because more renewable energy on the grid cuts demand — and lowers the price — of natural gas and other power sources that have higher operating costs. Take Fossil Fuels Off the Dole If the initial rationale for subsidizing fossil fuels was to encourage their growth, that time has long since passed. The Center for American Progress (CAP), a liberal think tank, published a fact sheet in May 2016 identifying nine unnecessary oil and gas tax breaks that should be terminated. Repealing the subsidies, according to CAP, would save the U.S. Treasury a minimum of $37.7 billion over the next 10 years. An August 2016 report for the Council on Foreign Relations by Gilbert Metcalf, an economics professor at Tufts University, concluded that eliminating the three major federal tax incentives for oil and gas production would have a relatively small impact on production and consumption. The three provisions — deductions for “intangible” drilling costs, deductions for oil and gas deposit depletion, and deductions for domestic manufacturing — account for 90 percent of the cost of the subsidies. Ending these tax breaks, Metcalf says, would save the Treasury roughly $4 billion a year and would not appreciably raise oil and gas prices. At the same time, the relatively new, burgeoning clean energy sector deserves federal support as it gains a foothold in the marketplace. Steve Clemmer, energy research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, made the case in testimony before a House subcommittee last March that Congress should preserve wind and solar tax incentives beyond 2020. “Until we can transition to national policies that provide more stable, long-term support for clean, low-carbon energy,” he said, “Congress should extend federal tax credits by at least five more years to maintain the sustained orderly growth of the industry and provide more parity and predictability for renewables in the tax code.” Clemmer also recommended new tax credits for investments in low- and zero-carbon technologies and energy storage technologies. Despite the steady barrage of through-the-looking-glass statements by Trump administration officials, scientific and economic facts still matter. Administrator Pruitt would do well to examine them. Congress should, too, when it considers its tax overhaul bill, which is now being drafted behind closed doors. If they did, perhaps they would recognize that — economically and environmentally — it would be far better for the future of the planet to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and provide more incentives for clean energy.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) and his wife Cheryl Flake leave the U.S. Capitol after he announced he will not be seeking reelection.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59efc7ef1500009b1574740d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It was supposed to be a day of unity, one where President Donald Trump and Republicans could circle the wagons and kick off their push for tax reform over lunch in the Senate. Their day careened off the rails shortly after it began, however, as two GOP senators dealt successive blows to the president within hours of each other, sowing further uncertainty about the future of the Senate majority and the Republican Party at large. Retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) fired the first shot in the early hours of the morning. Giving several cable news interviews, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman lamented that Trump would be remembered for the “debasement of our nation.” The senator further stated that he did not think Trump was a role model to children, and that he regretted supporting him during the 2016 presidential election.Trump quickly fired back in a series of tweets, falsely accusing the Tennessee Republican of supporting the Iran nuclear deal and mocking him for retiring and that he “couldn’t get elected dog catcher.”Awkwardness at being in the same room aside, the two men did not speak at lunch, which took place shortly after noon. The discussion mostly centered on taxes and was positive, Corker told reporters afterward.“There were no fireworks,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said before jumping into an elevator.The explosions came an hour later, however, after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) walked onto the Senate floor and announced that he, too, would not be seeking reelection next year.In a stunning takedown of Trump, Flake railed about the tone of politics in America and called the president’s behavior “outrageous” and “dangerous to democracy.” He again urged his many fellow Republicans to speak out against demagoguery and incivility in the Trump era.“I will not be complicit or silent,” Flake said. “When the next generation asks us, ‘Why didn’t you do something? Why didn’t you speak up?’ What are we going to say?”Speaking to reporters after delivering his remarks, Flake insisted he still wanted to work with Trump on several issues, like tax reform and passing a legislative fix to protect young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. (Hours after criticizing Trump, Flake also joined 49 of his colleagues to overturn a Barack Obama-regulation that would have allowed class-action lawsuits against big banks and credit card companies.) Still, Flake acknowledged that a weight was lifted off his shoulders on Tuesday.“I certainly think that being unencumbered by a race coming up [makes] it easier to speak out,” he told HuffPost after his speech.Although Flake has been more outspoken about Trump than Corker ― the Arizona Republican wrote a book earlier this year declaring conservatism in a “crisis” ― both of their departures will likely make it even more difficult for Republicans to maintain unity after failing to come together to repeal Obamacare.Flake’s newfound freedom only adds to the pile of problems for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who controls a thin, two-seat majority. In addition to his feud with Trump, for example, Corker has sounded alarm bells by expressing his concern that the GOP tax plan could balloon the deficit.Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who is battling brain cancer, has similarly ratcheted up his rhetoric about Trump. In another sharply worded speech last week, the Arizona Republican warned about the rise of nationalism. A pending special Senate election in Alabama to replace the former seat of Attorney General Jeff Sessions could also deliver disappointing results. The favorite in the race, GOP nominee Roy Moore, is a controversial judge who has railed against “swamp king” McConnell and his allies in Washington. Moore has so far only picked up endorsements from the anti-establishment GOP wing in the Senate: Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), indicating he may vote as they do if he wins the seat.Flake’s decision to retire also signals a broader, coarser shift within the Republican Party. If that wasn’t evident after Trump’s election, it certainly was on Tuesday, when one of the GOP’s most amiable and well-liked senators decided he had had enough.“If I could run the kind of race I’d like to run, and believe I could win a Republican primary, I might move forward. There’s a very narrow path now as a Republican.”“Resentment is not a governing philosophy,” he added. “At some point, you’ve got to have actual policies and not just rile up the base.”This post was updated to reflect that Flake joined his colleagues to overturn a regulation that would have allowed class-action lawsuits against big banks and credit card companies.

With the discovery of oil in West Texas in 1926, the city made a drastic change that focused on all things petroleum.The new oil fields needed equipment and support services. Odessa was the closest city by rail and soon became the hub for oil service, transportation, supply and manufacturing. Today, we have diversified significantly, but we’re still considered one of the major oil field technology centers in the world.Odessa is a vibrant, growing community with a population that becomes more culturally diverse every day. Life in Odessa is not just about business. It is about a community that welcomes its citizens with open arms ― not just in the business community but in our everyday lives.Odessa is home to the largest bi-annual International Oil Show in the world, welcoming more than 20,000 visitors from across the world for the week-long event. While the price of oil continues to linger close to the $50-a-barrel mark, Odessa has plenty of business activities related to the oil service industry and bolsters a low 4 percent unemployment rate.Voted one of the fastest growing cities in America, Odessa is home to a variety of attractions that are available nowhere else, such the JBS Leadership Library and Presidential Archives, which includes artifacts from each president elected to the United States. This is a one-of-a-kind museum that is dedicated to the office of the presidency, with political paraphernalia dating back to the original office holder. The grounds of the museum also feature the boyhood home of President George W. Bush, which is set up in exact replica as it was on Christmas morning back in the early 1950s. Just across the parking lot, one can visit the Smithsonian-affiliated Ellen Noel Art Museum, featuring traveling exhibits of the highest quality, including the current 9/11 exhibit, featuring artifacts from the tragedy that hit New York City on that fateful day. Another must see is our native son Chris Kyle’s memorial ― the “American Sniper” Navy Seal whose birthplace was Odessa.Our own campus at the University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB) is home to an exact replica of Stonehenge, made with stones from a West Texas quarry. Visitors can take a step back in time inside old homes, which show life as it was in the early years of West Texas. The lives of West Texas pioneers are featured at the Parker House Museum as well as the White Pool House Museum, both of which feature life as it was when Ector County and Odessa was in its early years during the 20th century. These are just a few of the attractions that Odessa is known for. Whether its spending time in our sparse ranch land or seeing the grounds where meteor craters landed, Odessa has plenty of options for filing up a visitor’s schedule. And once they have their fill of the West Texas lifestyle, they can take a short three-hour drive west toward the Big Bend for a hike in the national park. So whether you are looking for snow skiing, hiking or water recreation, Odessa offers an array of day trips in all directions. Odessa is home to Odessa College, a nationally-recognized institution, which was recently conferred the Aspen Award, a top-rated award for community colleges. Part of the University of Texas system, UTPB is a growing four-year university that not only produces some of the top graduates in the fields of education, engineering and nursing but also offers some of the best Division II athletic teams in the Lone Star Conference, including basketball, soccer, golf, volleyball and football.Rounding out the higher education realm, Odessa is home to the Permian Basin campus of the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, where medical students and residents hone in on their medical skills. Most recently, Odessa community leaders are undertaking a major initiative to increase the importance of K-12 education. Community emphasis is being put on the importance to improving our graduation rates, along with continuance of either higher education or job skill certifications. West Texans know the importance of “growing our own,” and future initiatives will focus on improving the culture of continued education for Odessa students. Downtown Odessa is undergoing a major revitalization effort. Due to open in spring of 2019, the Odessa Marriott will be a luxury 240-room hotel with all the finest amenities. It will be connected to the Downtown Convention Center, which will be a major development for our city, allowing Odessa to play host to an unlimited number of events. A renovated Ector Theatre will also provide an additional site for live performances, with a seating capacity of roughly 350. This $80 million addition to the downtown area is the cornerstone for future retail, restaurants and entertainment establishments for the heart of the city. Odessa is a bright spot on the horizon of West Texas. One can see for literally miles in our parts. Catching the beauty of a sunrise or sunset is breathtaking and is matched only with the good heartedness of our people.Whether you are making a quick stop off in town, coming for a few days stay or even looking to bring your business to West Texas, you won’t be disappointed!"

As part of HuffPost’s Listen To America tour, we’re exploring how people’s lived experiences overlap and diverge depending on their zip codes. What is the “American experience”? It depends where you look. ***Senghor (Michigan): I learned what I wanted to be as a father based on some of the things I didn’t have as a child growing up, which is great communication. I think it’s really important for fathers to really listen to their children to be available to them. The thing that I learned from my parents, more specifically from my father, is emotional availability and how important that is for young boys growing up ... my father [has] never been afraid to express how he felt. And I think it’s important for young boys to see the full range of emotions that men experience. Senghor (Michigan): I think I’m less rigid than my parents. I don’t believe in corporal punishment. I believe that I’m a lot more patient than my parents. My parents were also raising multiple children. But I just think that the things I learned from me and my siblings’ experience, the hurt we endured at the hands of our parents ... I feel like what I do different is I have real conversations with my son. I don’t talk at him. I respect his humanity the way that I would want mine respected. His opinions are valid. I think the more ownership of their opinions and views and thoughts that they have the more empowered they are as children and the more empowered they’ll be as adults.Senghor (Michigan): I think [one] of the most harmful stigmas is this whole idea that black fathers are not present. And just recently, CDC put out a report saying that black fathers are more engaged than any other fathers in this country. We don’t hear that reality. And then it’s other ideas that fathers’ only role is the disciplinarian and the provider. I think that’s bullshit and I say that because fathers are nurturers as well. We are educators, we are spiritual leaders and so this whole idea that we’re one-dimensional or absent is a crock of nonsense.  Senghor (Michigan): He’s very conscious of it. ... Sometimes he and I have what we call our nighttime talk. And after I do his affirmation, read him a book, sometimes we’ll just lay in the bed and we’ll just talk until he’s sleepy and he asks questions like, “Dad, tell me about our ancestors,” or he’ll be like, “Why did white people enslave people from Africa?” So we dig into the whole labor issues and how people exploit people and I try to give him something he can relate to. Henry (California): I think you have to initiate it or if you hear it being talked about, navigate the conversation. Everybody’s kids are gonna say something about race one day. You have to attack it head on. I see this in most people of Anglo-Saxon descent, in their families, they don’t really discuss these things. I know this because I have a huge community, I have a lot of different friends and a lot of them are white. They’ll say, “Yo, I would’ve never talked to my kid about this had he not seen this video. Thank you.” I think it’s really important that we discuss these things because stereotypes and all types of judgmental innuendos get in the way of knowing who a person really is. It’s about doing life with people who don’t look like you so that you can break whatever mental things you have in your head about that person. Senghor (Michigan): I don’t. I don’t have any fears. I believe that my only fear would be raising an ignorant black boy in America. I believe when you raise a conscious, thought-evolved, mostly evolved child, I believe at that point you have to just let their destiny be what it’s gonna be. And I refuse to live in fear so I can’t raise a child with fear hanging over my head. I really think it’s important to raise them with confidence and a sense of ownership in a world that we live in. I don’t wanna raise him as if he’s just some type of subject in the world as opposed to somebody who’s fully engaged in the world and who deserves anything that comes with being a human being.Henry (California): The challenge is finishing the race. Anybody can be a good parent when your kid’s cute or 6 months, it’s easy. The kid is adorable. But when that same child is 18 and they steal your car or go joyriding and get into an accident, that’s a whole different level of love. But you’re the same parent and that’s the same kid. So finishing the race I feel like is gonna be the hardest part. Being there, turning from a coach into a cheerleader. These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity. "

And I’ve started, but not with a dish that was on my to-cook list. Rather it was a variation on a richly delicious pasta dish: Gramigna con salsiccia, a fresh extruded (not rolled) vermiform egg pasta served with sausage ragù. I had all the ingredients in the house - apart from the gramigna itself, so I substituted a similarly worm-shaped thin dried macaroni.I often make an appealing sausage ragù that owes more to Naples than to Modena: it uses plenty of tomatoes, herbs and aromatics, and a little garlic too. For me, it’s a shortcut, because the Italian-style sausages are already seasoned and flavor develops quickly. The sausage ragù of Emilia Romagna (we ate ours at Trattoria Pomposa in central Modena) is both richer and simpler, which sounds paradoxical; you’ll see what I mean when I describe the cooking, which is based on a recipe in Alessandro Molinari Pradelli’s La cucina dell’Emilia Romagna (Newton & Compton, 1998).To make enough ragù for two or three main-course portions, I finely chopped a medium onion (it weighed 3 ounces – 85 grams) and cooked it, sprinkled with salt, in a generous amount of olive oil and butter (the mixture is for flavor, not because of any belief that the oil prevents the butter from burning, which it doesn’t) over medium-low heat until it had softened and just begun to turn golden, maybe five or six minutes. Meanwhile, I slit the casings of about half a pound (225 g) of coarsely ground “sweet” – i.e., not chili-hot – Italian sausages, removed the meat and broke it up with my hand. When the onions were done, I added the sausage meat to the pan, slightly raised the heat and fried it for six or seven minutes until it had browned but not dried out, continuing to break it up with a spoon as I stirred it. Then, I added 1/3 cup (80 ml) of white wine and reduced it by half, or until it stopped smelling like raw wine. Next, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of whole milk and a tablespoon of tomato paste out of a tube – it’s the milk that makes this such a lush sauce, along with the sausage juices. For this sauce, I don’t recommend using tomato sauce or chopped fresh tomatoes instead of the tomato paste: that would alter the character and intensity of the dish for the worse. I lowered the heat to a slow simmer and cooked it, loosely covered, for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally and making sure there was enough liquid in the pan. About half-way through, I felt it needed moistening. I had some chicken stock, so added 1/4 cup (60 ml) of that (which I think is what an Emilian cook would do); water would have done the job too but not quite as well.The result was a creamy, richly delicious sauce with lots of chunky sausage meat. It tasted far more complicated than it was.For two slightly too-big portions, I cooked 200 grams (7 oz) of those skinny little macaroni until they were nearly done, then added them to the ragù over low heat, along with a good handful of grated parmesan and a generous grinding of black pepper. I stirred for 20 seconds or so to amalgamate everything. I checked for salt, but it needed none. What it did need was a splash of the pasta-cooking water to loosen it up.Resist the impulse to add parsley or any other herb. You can succumb to the temptation to add extra grated parmesan, but do not do so until you’ve tasted the dish. Anyway, once you’ve tasted it, you’ll lack a free hand with which to reach for the cheese bowl: you won’t be able to stop spooning it up with one hand, and the other will be best occupied with a glass of wine.

I had all the ingredients in the house - apart from the gramigna itself, so I substituted a similarly worm-shaped thin dried macaroni.I often make an appealing sausage ragù that owes more to Naples than to Modena: it uses plenty of tomatoes, herbs and aromatics, and a little garlic too. For me, it’s a shortcut, because the Italian-style sausages are already seasoned and flavor develops quickly. The sausage ragù of Emilia Romagna (we ate ours at Trattoria Pomposa in central Modena) is both richer and simpler, which sounds paradoxical; you’ll see what I mean when I describe the cooking, which is based on a recipe in Alessandro Molinari Pradelli’s La cucina dell’Emilia Romagna (Newton & Compton, 1998).To make enough ragù for two or three main-course portions, I finely chopped a medium onion (it weighed 3 ounces – 85 grams) and cooked it, sprinkled with salt, in a generous amount of olive oil and butter (the mixture is for flavor, not because of any belief that the oil prevents the butter from burning, which it doesn’t) over medium-low heat until it had softened and just begun to turn golden, maybe five or six minutes. Meanwhile, I slit the casings of about half a pound (225 g) of coarsely ground “sweet” – i.e., not chili-hot – Italian sausages, removed the meat and broke it up with my hand. When the onions were done, I added the sausage meat to the pan, slightly raised the heat and fried it for six or seven minutes until it had browned but not dried out, continuing to break it up with a spoon as I stirred it. Then, I added 1/3 cup (80 ml) of white wine and reduced it by half, or until it stopped smelling like raw wine. Next, 1/2 cup (120 ml) of whole milk and a tablespoon of tomato paste out of a tube – it’s the milk that makes this such a lush sauce, along with the sausage juices. For this sauce, I don’t recommend using tomato sauce or chopped fresh tomatoes instead of the tomato paste: that would alter the character and intensity of the dish for the worse. I lowered the heat to a slow simmer and cooked it, loosely covered, for 25 minutes, stirring occasionally and making sure there was enough liquid in the pan. About half-way through, I felt it needed moistening. I had some chicken stock, so added 1/4 cup (60 ml) of that (which I think is what an Emilian cook would do); water would have done the job too but not quite as well.The result was a creamy, richly delicious sauce with lots of chunky sausage meat. It tasted far more complicated than it was.For two slightly too-big portions, I cooked 200 grams (7 oz) of those skinny little macaroni until they were nearly done, then added them to the ragù over low heat, along with a good handful of grated parmesan and a generous grinding of black pepper. I stirred for 20 seconds or so to amalgamate everything. I checked for salt, but it needed none. What it did need was a splash of the pasta-cooking water to loosen it up.Resist the impulse to add parsley or any other herb. You can succumb to the temptation to add extra grated parmesan, but do not do so until you’ve tasted the dish. Anyway, once you’ve tasted it, you’ll lack a free hand with which to reach for the cheese bowl: you won’t be able to stop spooning it up with one hand, and the other will be best occupied with a glass of wine. I shall make this with egg pasta some time and will report back, at least on Twitter. "

It was nothing like the dramatic, sensationalized images that The New Yorker chose. Opioid users are often depicted as doomed, sick, and dying. We’re described as “clean” when we stop using, and “addicts” if we start. The New Yorker, and every other major news outlet, would have you believe that Montgomery County, Ohio, is nothing but a boneyard. A place where there is no hope. Four days in Dayton proved that they’re wrong — and they’re completely missing the real story.The truth is, there’s a lot of hope in Dayton. And it’s winning the fight against overdose related deaths. My best friend Garrett Hade and I traveled to Dayton last week to meet with some of the incredible people who are working on the front lines of the drug epidemic. I fell in love with Dayton on my first day. It was beautiful. The white picket fences, friendly neighbors, and community gardens were a strong counterpoint to the health crisis happening right below the surface. When I met the leaders of Dayton’s recovery initiatives, I was sold. Dayton is powerful. Dayton is inspiring. And Dayton is rising.The people of Dayton are finding real, tangible, powerful solutions to the crisis. Yet, their hard work and dedication is overshadowed by the media’s pornographic obsession with depicting addiction as nothing more than needles, spoons and dead bodies. This is irresponsible, and it undermines the efforts of organizations like Miracle Makers and the Dayton Public Health Department.Social entrepreneur Lauren White of Indigo Life experienced this negativity first hand. But she decided to do something about it. “My older brother has struggled with addiction for nearly 15 years, so when Dayton started to get national attention, it hit home. Many of our friends in the film industry also had their own experiences with addiction. We wanted to do something, so we chose to use our storytelling skills as the most immediate thing we could offer. The media’s negativity left us frustrated and ready to balance the energy with stories of recovery to break the silence and change the way we talk about addiction.”Lauren has committed to producing 26 videos as part of a solution-based media campaign this year. She’s doing this work pro bono: because she believes that we can face addiction, and that recovery speaks more loudly than the disease of substance use disorder. She’s not alone. She is one of dozens of leaders in Dayton who are giving their time, energy, and talent to finding a way to save lives.East End Community Services has taken a stand, too, by advocating for families and children affected by addiction. Every year, they connect over 1,000 people to services that help support their growth and stability: helping families, after all, is the best way to heal a community. Its flagship program Miracle Makers creates a safe, positive, nurturing environment for kids. It’s become a haven for children whose parents and families are coping with the effects of substance use. The program’s goal is to help children dream again, and become successful. When I walked in to meet some of the kids and the support staff that work with them daily, I saw a group of happy, laughing kids gathering around to practice mindfulness and meditation. I saw healthy snacks and bright, colorful places to play. I saw success. Why aren’t those smiling faces on the front page of the New York Times? Now, I’m not denying that overdose rates are tragically high in Montgomery County. According to their coroner’s report, 365 people died of drug overdoses between January and May of 2017. That’s almost double the number of lives lost last year. But focusing on the problem is just the tip of the iceberg. Finally, the addiction health crisis is in the public eye — but if it’s shown as an unsolvable problem, we’ll never get the support, help, and funding we need to defeat it. President Trump is expected to announce a national emergency this Thursday, which means programs like these could finally get funding. We must help grassroots efforts and community supports. They are our best hope for solving the addiction crisis, but without funding, they risk losing traction. And there are many, many people who need their help.The strength, heart, and humanity I witnessed in Dayton gives me so much hope for our nation. We can end this crisis. We do recover. However, it’s crucial that we tell the stories of people, towns, and groups that dedicate their time and love to turning the tide. We don’t need more reminders of the tragedy. That’s old news. Instead, we must honor those losses by reaching out and building solutions in every community, across America.Lauren said it best: “These are people’s lives. There is no time to sit back. So many people are affected by addiction and it is going to take all of us coming together to get through this. The more we can highlight all the positive efforts and strides being made, the more people can gain awareness and get on board with a movement that will literally save lives. The least we can do is contribute our God-given talents to make a difference.”Amen to that, Lauren. Thank God for you, and thank God for the people of Dayton.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues? In the U.S., call 800-662-HELP (4357) for the SAMHSA National Helpline."

33,POLITICS,Trump Voter Fraud Commissioner Says Panel Should Be More Transparent Or Disband,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-voter-fraud-probe-alan-king_us_59ef8424e4b0b7e632655fb5,Democratic commissioner Alan King was unsparing in his criticism.,2017-10-24,Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach with President Donald Trump. Democrats have harshly criticized Trump's voter fraud probe for not being transparent about what it's working on.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ef8c301500009b157472d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Democratic member of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud probe said it should urgently disclose what it’s been working on and its future plans, or else disband entirely. Alan King, a probate judge in Jefferson County, Alabama, is one of four Democrats on the 11-member Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. He told HuffPost on Tuesday that he was disappointed in how the commission had conducted business and wouldn’t be surprised if other members of the panel had already drafted a recommendation to the president.“Based on what I’ve read and accounts, it wouldn’t surprise me,” King said. “It wouldn’t surprise me if this whole commission was set up and they had an end result in mind when this commission was first originated.”Both King and Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap (D) say they’ve had no communication with other members of the commission since the group met in New Hampshire on Sept. 12.“If you’re gonna start a commission like this, then it either needs to be pursued and pursued in a vigorous manner to gather data, to line up witnesses, to keep commissioners informed every step of the way,” King said. “Or they just need to push away from the table and say, ‘No, this isn’t going to work ... and now we’re not gonna have any more meetings.’” King said he joined the commission with an open mind, planning to weigh the facts on both sides, as he would in court. Those claiming there is widespread voter fraud had failed to prove their case, he said.While he added that it was possible “that there are maybe some pockets of folks on both sides of the aisle who perhaps haven’t followed the rules,” he continued, “it’s a huge leap to go from that type of scenario to then go to to this massive plot, conspiracy of almost election mafia standards, to think that there are massive, widespread voting fraud in the United States.” He also said he’d outlined his concerns in a letter to Andrew Kossack, the commission’s designated federal officer, on Friday. (Kossack is charged with the administration of the commission and is responsible for communicating schedules and logistics.) King declined to share the letter ― saying he was unsure if he was allowed to ― but said he’d asked questions about when the commission’s next meeting would be, who would choose the next witnesses, the names of commission staff members, how many states had responded to its request for voter data, whether the commission received any private funding and what the commission was supposed to accomplish over the next few months.Kossack did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, but told The Washington Post in a statement on Monday that the panel was continuing to review information and would update commissioners “should further meetings be scheduled.”Dunlap, another Democrat on the commission, says the panel’s Republican vice chair, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, and other Republicans are wielding absolute control over the group’s direction. Like King, Dunlap recently wrote a letter asking questions about the commission’s work. Other Democratic commissioners, including New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner, have declined to voice similar concerns. As some Democrats on the commission have begun openly questioning their fellow commissioners’ activities, Democrats in Congress have asked the Government Accountability Office to review whether the panel is complying with transparency requirements. Several federal lawsuits have also sought to block the commission from operating, alleging it is not complying with federal transparency and privacy requirements.Critics of the panel characterize it as an effort to weaken confidence in American elections, saying it aims to lay the groundwork for more restrictive voting laws and substantiate Trump’s claim that millions voted illegally last year (several studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem). Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, the commission’s chair, have pledged that the panel would be bipartisan and neutral.Recent disclosures have weakened that claim of neutrality. An email made public in separate litigation showed that Kobach, in a meeting with Trump last year, recommended amending a key federal voting law to allow states to impose a proof of citizenship requirement on people when they register to vote. Voting advocates say such a move is designed to suppress voting by minorities, the poor and the elderly.Another email made public in September showed Hans von Spakovsky, another commission member, objecting to Democrats and “mainstream” Republicans serving on the panel because he claimed they would impede its work.King criticized Republican commissioners von Spakovsky and J. Christian Adams, both former Justice Department officials who have pushed claims of widespread voter fraud. “I’m concerned that, quite frankly, they aren’t more people like me who are election officials who know everything about elections from the ground up ... The fact that someone may have worked in the Justice Department, perhaps, at one time, in my opinion, that doesn’t really qualify someone to be on a commission such as this,” King said.Von Spakovsky defended his role on the commission, citing his work on local election boards in Georgia and Virginia and federal agencies dealing with voting. “You might want to ask him if he knows about any of that experience,” he wrote.After seeing a transcript of King’s quote, Logan Churchwell, a spokesman for Adams, wrote, “Mr. Adams has endeavored to engage the other Commissioners in serious discussion and constructive ideas. Your characterizations of his comments seem beyond anything Alan King would say, considering the Commissioners have exhibited the utmost courtesy to each other and would have never questioned the qualifications of a Commissioner without knowing what they were.”"

The average annual costs of the damage caused estimated at around KHS 125 billion/US$1.25 billion – with each drought reducing the country’s Gross Domestic Product by an average of 3.3 per cent.Even further out of view is the longer-term effect of the drought episodes on women and children, especially when the rains come and humanitarian efforts cease to make headlines.Consider this. 2.6 million people in Kenya are severely food insecure. 370,000 children and 37,000 pregnant and lactating women are severely malnourished. The health consequences of this will be catastrophic if not urgently dealt with.UNICEF, WFP, FAO and a range of United Nations(UN) and humanitarian partners launched a revised Flash Appeal in September 2017, seeking US 106 million to respond to the current drought emergency. While this will enable the UN and partners to work with the Government of Kenya, to save lives in the immediate term, longer-term strategies must be put in place.Since the onset of the current drought in late 2016, over 3.4 million people in 23 counties are suffering from the impacts of this drawn out crisis. Pastoralists and farmers make up almost 20 per cent of those affected, and over 1.6 million children are today struggling to survive on less than one meal per day.As expected, populations in arid areas are disproportionately affected. In Turkana alone, one in every three children suffers from acute malnutrition and is at increased risk of death. The situation in Marsabit and Baringo is equally dire.The impact of three consecutive poor rainy seasons is now being felt across the country – including in Nairobi. Poor rains severely affect livestock quality, decrease milk availability, and reduce cereal production. As a result, prices of local cereals have increased by 30-50% in parts hitting the poorest households the most. Milk is no longer available as the key source of nutrition for young children in many families.Beyond threatening human life and survival of children, the drought is also impacting Kenya’s long-term development of Kenya. Many children are not attending school in the drought-affected areas of the country, typically because their family has been displaced in search of food and water. As of July, close to 176,000 school aged children were not in school.With today’s technology advances that can predict most drought episodes before they happen, what comes into sharp focus is the need to reduce the causes of vulnerability that make communities precarious to changes in the weather.This means long-term investments in services such as clean water and hygiene. The recent cholera outbreaks reported in 18 counties, equaling 2,996 reported cases and 55 deaths, underlines the urgency for increasing access to safe water and basic sanitation.In partnership with the government, the UN family and development partners in Kenya are committed to assist with the response to the drought. This cycle of short term emergency response must end. We have to shore up our efforts to build resilience and ensure not a single child in Kenya suffers from hunger and malnutrition.UNICEF for instance has worked with partners to repair strategic water points and has treated more than 50,547 children for severe acute malnutrition. The Government has dedicated Sh. 2.5 billion/ US$ 25 million in the form of cash transfers and food, to respond to the emergency. Cash transfers have been scaled up by initiatives such as Cash Transfers for Orphans and Vulnerable Children, Cash for Assets and the Hunger / Safety net Programme.As a partner of the government and people of Kenya, we as the UN family have joined forces to save lives by providing the most basic life-saving services and support Kenya to prevent future crises. We must neither allow the poorest in Kenya to bear the cost nor let this crises stifle Kenya’s human development.Early action saves lives, reduces suffering and, like preventative healthcare, is more cost-effective than responding after a crisis has happened.Kenya is doing its part to battle the drought, and so should we.Dr Werner Schultink is UNICEF’s Representative to Kenya. Siddharth Chatterjee is the UN Resident Coordinator to Kenya."

36,POLITICS,Man Who Turned His Guns In After Las Vegas Should Be A National Story,"Mike Weisser, ContributorMike the Gun Guy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/man-who-turned-his-guns-in-after-las-vegas-should-be-a-household-name_us_59ee61f1e4b003385ac169b1,The fact that he's not is part of the problem.,2017-10-23,"Semi-automatic rifles are seen for sale in a gun shop in Las Vegas, Nevada on October 4, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ee63f4180000051bdfbdd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What is it about guns that brings out the absolute worst, most debased forms of human behavior? On the one hand, we have gun owners who decide to check into a hotel, take a room on the 32nd floor and then fire hundreds of rounds into a concert-going crowd to see how many people they can kill. On the other hand, when the word gets around on social media that someone voluntarily got rid of his guns because of what happened in Vegas on October 1, that individual is subject to a barrage of the most vile, disgusting and stupid online attacks that could be imagined, up to and including threats on his life.I’m not making this up. Last week a resident of Phoenix, Jonathan Pring, turned in a pistol and a rifle to the Phoenix PD and then made the mistake of putting up a post on Facebook in which he stuck a video of the guns being given to the cops along with a statement that he was taking this step because of the shooting at the Mandalay Bay. Within hours, he began receiving countless insults, profanities and even threats to his business and his life, with such comments as “someone needs to go shoot this idiot and make him wish he could have defended himself,” being not all that crazy compared to others he received. And this particular comment came from a self-described three-percenter who, of course, makes a point of telling everyone how patriotic she is on her own Facebook page.What I find interesting about these online outbursts, and I am a target of such attacks all the time, is that such activity often reflects the degree to which much of the chatter on social media is nothing more than the attempt by childish minds (regardless of the age of the body in which this mind is contained) to outdo one another in terms of who can say something more offensive than what the previous post actually said. And frequently these unreconstructed idiots belong to social media groups that basically exist to allow all the members to engage in this one-upmanship behavior by identifying and targeting individuals who express a contrary point of view.On the other hand, what really bothered me about the reaction to Pring’s principled and selfless decision to turn his guns in after the Las Vegas rampage was not the fact that his online video attracted some gun-rights crazies to crawl out from under their rocks. Much more disturbing was the fact that his actions were basically ignored by the gun violence prevention (GVP) community who should have been spreading the news of his decision as far and as wide as they could.If only I had a nickel for every time that some GVP advocate or influencer complains about the “power” of the NRA without mentioning the degree to which opposition to the NRA on social media is so tepid and weak. When some deputy sheriff from Podunk makes a statement about how he supports concealed-carry, the NRA shouts out the message from here to kingdom come. But here’s a guy who made a remarkable statement about the risk of legal gun ownership and the GVP community responds to his message with a big yawn. Shouldn’t the Brady Campaign invite Jonathan Pring to come to DC and accept an award? Shouldn’t Gabby and Mark fly out to meet with him? God knows they go everywhere else.If GVP is ever going to reverse the continued growth of support for gun “rights,” even among people who don’t own guns, their activists must become much more aggressive about using social media to promote their point of view. The video posted by Jonathan Pring showing him giving his guns to the cops should have been the featured post on every GVP Facebook site. And that’s the way you reach out to a wider audience rather than continuing to talk only to folks who already agree with what you say."

There were also 9,200 registered lobbyists, or about 800 fewer than the previous three-month period.Third-quarter lobbying is typically the slowest quarter in Washington as legislators leave for August recess, but the decline in both spending and registered lobbyists was dramatic even for the slow months.Despite the third-quarter dip, however, 2017 spending is on pace to pass 2016 totals due to an influx of spending during the first six months of the year. Overall, the lobbying world has spent about $2.43 billion this year compared to $2.38 billion at the same point in 2016.More than 8,500 companies, municipalities, trade associations and other organizations have reported federal lobbying this year – from less than $5,000 by the city of Murfreesboro, Tennessee to $58 million by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the perennial top spender.So far this year, the top 20 lobbying groups have spent about $310 million of the $2.43 billion total.The Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Realtors, Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and the American Medical Association were the top spenders in the third-quarter as well as 2017 overall so far.While overall spending declined, a few companies dipped deeper in their pocketbooks during the third quarter. New Shipper Bond Petitioners Coalition, for example, spent $550,000 last quarter after $340,000 in the first half of 2017 for lobbying activity related to “enforcement of antidumping duty orders and collection of duties secured by ‘new shipper’ customs bonds.”Less spending on lobbying means less work to go around for professional lobbyists. However, despite the sluggish third-quarter, the top lobbying firms continued to get plenty of work.Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld was the top lobbying firm in the third quarter with $9.2 million in billings, bringing its total to $28.5 million reported in 2017 so far. Other notable firms include Roberti Global, which reported taking in $1.6 million in the third quarter after reporting about $2 million in the first six months. That was the largest quarterly increase by any firm.Among industries, pharmaceuticals and health products spent $62.2 million, the most by any industry. The insurance ($38.1 million) and electronics manufacturing and equipment ($35.5 million) industries were the second and third highest spenders.Turning from industries to broader economic sectors, third-quarter spending in 2017 compared to 2016 varied widely. The communications and electronics sector increased its spending more than $6 million over last year’s third quarter, while the financial, insurance and real estate sector cut spending by more than $10 million."

So, when it comes to screening for that cancer, there are a number of options to consider.Dr. Karthik Ghosh, director of the Mayo Clinic Breast Diagnostic Clinic, says mammogram is still the best test to screen the breast for women an average risk of breast cancer.""It has really been one of the long-standing tests, with a lot of research showing that there is a decrease in mortality.""Dr. Ghosh says the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women 40 to 49 consider screening after discussion with their health care provider. For women 50 to 75, mammograms should be performed every other year. Dr. Ghosh adds there can be downsides to a mammogram, which include callbacks for further testing, false positives and the anxiety related to those events.Overdiagnosis is another part of the screening discussion, according to Dr. Ghosh. ""The whole idea of overdiagnosis is that, if you go through yearly screening mammography, more cancers would be diagnosed too early."" She says there could be a very slow growing cancer that may not cause harm for several years. ""I think that’s where the challenge really lies,"" says Dr. Ghosh. ""How do I tell a patient, well, don’t worry, because the cancer we find now won’t cause you harm until five years from now.""Dr. Ghosh also says the ability of the mammogram to pick up cancers is limited, because there could be areas of a tumor hiding within dense breast tissue. ""For women who have dense breasts, it is important to understand there are additional tests. We call it supplemental screening, and these are tests done in addition to mammogram that help us pick out those potentially small cancers or even invasive cancers.""Dr. Ghosh says a 3-D mammogram, which is also called tomosynthesis, can be another option for screening. Molecular breast imaging is also helpful for women with dense breasts. ""For molecular breast imaging, you get an IV injection, and that is actually a radioisotope, very low-dose radiation there that gets injected,"" says Dr. Ghosh. ""You have an image of the breast, and it basically highlights areas that are metabolically active in the breast, and that does help us pick out areas that may potentially be malignant or cancerous.""Women who are gene mutation carriers — people with BRCA1 or BRCA2 — are considered very high risk. They carry it, or they have a first-degree relative who carries one of the genes. Dr. Ghosh says those patients are candidate for an MRI of the breast.""MRI of the breast is very specialized, which means you get an IV injection of gadolinium that’s excreted by the kidneys, but it highlights breast tissue very well,"" says Dr. Ghosh. ""The downside of MRI is that, because it’s highly sensitive, it is able to pick up even the smallest cancer and false positives are quite high. It requires a lot of effort and time read results, and it’s an expensive tool.""Women with a lifetime risk of 20 percent or higher also qualify to have yearly screening MRI, in addition to mammography. Dr. Ghosh says, ""There are women who perhaps had Hodgkins disease and chest radiation when they were younger, and they are considered at higher risk.""""It’s really picking and choosing which is best for the patient. I think having an informed decision with your provider to say, 'What are my risks?,' assessing the risks, and then saying this is potentially my best choice for screening. It's very much a patient-driven decision.""Dr. Ghosh says some of the newest areas of research include an abbreviated MRI. ""It's a shorter kind of test, and there are preliminary studies showing it may work very well."" Dr. Ghosh adds, ""There are also new studies on reducing unnecessary treatment, because we're always looking for ways to tailor the treatment to what patient needs.""For instance, it used to be that all lymph nodes were removed during mastectomies. But, now, Dr. Ghosh says, ""We’ve tailored it to taking out just the diseased tissue."" She continues, ""There’s also partial breast radiation and proton beam options, which can narrow down the amount of exposure for the tissues.""Dr. Ghosh says she encourages women to participate in research trials. ""Participation in research helps the patient as well as future generations."" She adds, ""There is hope. No matter where we are in the cancer spectrum, I think this is a very promising time that treatments are available. And even if something isn’t working, there are opportunities to change and try something different.""Finally, Dr. Ghosh says, ""For all women at this time, screening is important in terms of ensuring that we are careful about our health, and it is a promising time in that there are newer techniques available to screen for breast cancer and a promising time also that, even if we do get diagnosed with breast cancer, there are many options available to us that will help us live healthy, fulfilling lives."""

Felgenhauer was in serious, but not life-threatening condition on Monday. The attacker, identified as 48-year-old Boris Grits, was apprehended. His motivation was unclear. He told investigators he had “telepathic contact” with Felgenhauer and had a personal grudge against her. The radio station is one of few Russian media outlets that have been critical of the Russian government, reports The New York Times. The station has been repeatedly criticized by state-owned media, and its journalists have been attacked and threatened with death before. Another Ekho Moskvy host, Yulia Latynina, left Russia this year after an attempted arson attack on her car, The Guardian reports. “The amount of aggression directed towards liberal journalists in this country from state media and elsewhere is overwhelming and non-stop,” Evgenia Albats, a magazine editor who hosts a weekly show on Ekho Moskvy, told The Guardian. “Nobody is going to defend us; we’re the enemies of everyone.”Russia was ranked 148 out of 180 countries on press freedom this year by the group Reporters Without Borders. “The pressure on independent media has grown steadily since Vladimir Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012,” Reporters Without Borders says on its website. “Leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence.”"

As Wendell Potter told his story, we listened — and what we heard was sickening: a story of corruption in the health insurance industry that not only raised the cost of coverage to consumers but put lives at risk.Potter had seen it up close, as head of corporate public relations pulling down a six-figure salary for one of the country’s biggest insurers. He had watched in disbelief as he saw how Wall Street’s hunger to force up quarterly profits gave insurers every incentive to deny coverage, as every dollar not paid out to a claim added to profits and to the soaring paychecks and bonuses of CEOs. Under these conditions, Potter told us, you don’t think about individuals, “you think about the numbers, and whether or not you’re going to meet Wall Street’s expectations.”One day, back home in Tennessee, where he had begun his career as a journalist, Potter happened upon a makeshift health clinic set up at a rural fairgrounds for people who couldn’t afford to visit a doctor, fill a prescription or go to a hospital. He told us, “When I walked through the fairground gates, I saw hundreds of people lined up, in the rain, waiting to get care in animal stalls. Animal stalls!”Potter blew the whistle, becoming management’s “worst nightmare,” revealing how public opinion was manipulated with deceitful corporate propaganda. His testimony before Congress rocked the industry. His revelations during our hour-long interview — his first on television — reverberated far and wide. He expected to be vilified and was. The first requirement for a whistleblower is credibility; the second is courage; the third, a thick hide. Potter never flinched. The journalist-turned-executive-turned-whistleblower has became a reformer, working with reporters and activists to track the abuses of an industry with extraordinary power over our lives, our economy and our politics.Now Wendell Potter returns to journalism. Today, he launches a new organization for investigative reporting called Tarbell — a watchdog we’ll wager can bite as well as bark. He’s named it for — well, that’s what you will find out from this conversation between Potter and Michael Winship.Michael Winship: Wendell, welcome. To begin, why have you decided to call your website Tarbell?Wendell Potter: I think a lot of people don’t recognize the name, but Ida Tarbell was one of America’s most important journalists. She was a journalist in the early part of the 20th century, the early 1900s, and her muckraking really led to some very important legislation, antitrust and campaign finance laws during the Teddy Roosevelt administration, largely as a report of her dogged reporting and investigating of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company, which was a huge monopoly and conglomerate. Over a series of six reports that were published in McClure’s Magazine, she really exposed what the consequences of that monopoly were on American society.So she is our guiding spirit. We hope to shine a light on corporations and other special interests that have really rigged the system against regular folks.MW: Why did you decide to start a website?WP: You know, it was largely because of what I learned when I was in corporate America. I headed corporate communications for two big health insurance companies at different times, Humana and Cigna, and toward the end of my career, I saw that there were fewer and fewer reporters who were interested or able to really take a close look at how corporations do business and what the consequences of their practices are. And that’s why I testified before Congress after I left my old job and tried to pull the curtain back so people could understand more how corporations and special interests manipulate public opinion.I wrote a book called Deadly Spin after that. More recently, I also wrote, with Nick Penniman, a book called Nation on the Take: How Big Money Corrupted Democracy and What We Can Do About It, and that focused on how those special interests, those moneyed interests, spend money to manipulate public policy, influence elections and what the consequences are to the rest of us.Not enough people read books or hear congressional testimony, so I decided to go the extra step and try to reach a much broader audience. I think few people are really aware of just how much our system of government has shifted from the democratic republic envisioned by our founders to one that is largely an oligarchy and I want to expose that.Our journalists will take that on and over a period of time make the case that we need to really get involved to change the system and how it can be changed. So we’re also going to be focusing on solutions, not just investigating the problem, but what can we do about it? How can we, for example, improve the health care system in ways that we haven’t seen our policymakers attempt yet? And what can we do to enact meaningful reforms that clean up the corruption that is so prevalent in governments at all levels?MW: You’ve said that Tarbell’s mission is to report stories essential to our democracy and our lives. Besides health care, what would be some examples of that?WP: The financial services industry, the chemical industry, the fossil fuel industry. We have a situation obviously in which the planet is warming and we’ve got to take action but there are big fossil fuel companies that are able to call the shots in Washington and state capitals around the country that prevent the action we need to make sure that we’re not continuing on this path toward an uninhabitable planet.Another is why is higher education so expensive? Why are our young people now saddled with so much student debt that many of them will probably never pay it off? Why are so few chemicals that are in everyday products not regulated and not even tested?MW: Is the overarching story then money in politics?WP: Money in politics is a very, very big part of it because money has become so much a part of our political system that members of Congress don’t spend nearly as much time in their offices on the people’s business, they have to constantly be raising money for re-election. They spend on average half of their day dialing for dollars. They leave their offices and go to Democratic and Republican offices to be telemarketers trying to raise money for re-election. And then in the evenings they go to fundraisers that are hosted by lobbyists.So we’ve got a situation that really has facilitated this shift from a democratic republic to an oligarchy. The rich and powerful really call the shots and we want to address that. It is pervasive. In addition, we want to show just how some business practices, even if they’re not influencing public policy, affect our lives in ways that we need to know about.There are a lot of different areas that we want to take on but we also want to have our readers help us determine some of the topics that we cover. This is going to be participatory journalism in a very real sense. We want to get story ideas from our readers, we want to have them suggest not just topics but to engage in online conversations with our journalists as they’re working on stories.MW: So you think that that kind of interactivity is what will set Tarbell apart from some of the other investigative journalism sites?WP: It’s essential for citizens to be involved and I see no reason why they shouldn’t be involved in journalism. And I think we would even publish some pieces that are submitted by readers. We want to build a community of readers. We’re nonprofit, so we’re going to be relying on donations but we will not have a paywall. We want everyone to be able to see the work that we produce.We also want to help people understand how they can actually become part of the solution, what some of the tools and information are that they need to be more involved. The solutions journalism part of what we’re doing will help them understand what some of the options are to improve our government and society and will give them information on how they can affiliate with groups that are engaged in an issue.MW: There’s been such a drumbeat from Donald Trump and the White House about fake news. How do you see Tarbell combatting that accusation?WP: Donald Trump has kind of defined fake news in his own terms. Originally, it was a term that was applied to information that was not true, that was being disseminated by people who were trying to influence the elections by spreading false information. He usurped the term and uses it to try to delegitimize the media, which I think is something he’s doing quite effectively with some segments of the population.But that said, to a certain extent I think that Americans have lost trust in the fourth estate. One reason is that there are far fewer reporters doing the investigative work that we hope to do. And so much of what you see in the media these days — the talking head, political TV shows; people shouting at each other or the he said/she said kind of stuff — that is about all we get. We want to go more in depth. We want to help people understand an issue more deeply — not just what politicians are saying about an issue, [but] how they’re affected and what they can do about it. So one of our objectives is to try to bring back public confidence in the media.MW: How hard is it to begin a startup these days? What surprised you along the way that you didn’t expect?WP: It surprised me that it takes longer than I would like it to have and it takes money. We would like to have been publishing six months ago but it takes a while to do all that needs to be done from being designated a nonprofit organization, which we have, we got our determination letter from the IRS that we are a 501(c)(3).The name of the nonprofit that will publish Tarbell is “To Be Fair,” and that name has some significance. We wanted to signify that whatever we do will be fair, fair reporting, but also aim to help achieve a more just and fair society through journalism. I think that journalism has shown itself over decades and centuries to be essential to democracy and to help drive important change. We want to be a part of that, to make sure that the watchdog role of the press continues.We’re tenacious and determined and so grateful that we are at this point and can soon start publishing the journalism that we’ve been telling people we plan to do.MW: How have you staffed this?WP: I’ve got a small team of people who are helping us to build this, journalists and tech experts. We’ve got a terrific board of directors and board of advisers.We’ve had so many emails and calls from reporters around the country who are interested and would like to work for us. Ultimately, what we want to do is to build a paid staff of 10 to 12 people. We also will work with freelance reporters around the country. Hopefully, we will have an ample freelance budget.We really want to have news and information from all across the country. We will not be based in Washington or New York. We want to be away from those media centers for various reasons. We’re going to be based in Philadelphia, where our country began. Our core staff will be based there but even some of the paid staff will be working virtually from wherever they might be.MW: We mentioned that the scope of your interests is vast but your focus for a long time was the health care insurance industry, as an executive within it and then as an advocate for reform, and we know that health care constitutes a sixth of the American economy. How much of Tarbell’s focus will be on it?WP: A significant amount of our emphasis will be on health care, certainly to start. It’s one of the most topical issues clearly and our health care system once again is under threat. What the president is doing now despite what he says is really undermining the Affordable Care Act, trying to make it collapse if he possibly can. And whether or not he goes forward or is able to achieve what he’s trying to achieve, we need to do much more than what we have done even with the Affordable Care Act.I said during that debate that the Affordable Care Act did good things but it was just the end of the beginning of reform. There are a lot of things that we need to do to improve our health care system. The Affordable Care Act brought a lot of people into coverage but there are still 30 million of us who don’t have it and health care costs continue to go up.As part of solutions journalism, we want to help people understand what Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All legislation is all about and other proposals as well. And we want to help people to get the truth about how other systems around the world operate, on how the Canadian health care system operates and is different from ours and how other systems around the world have been able to achieve universal coverage and much better cost control than we have and while doing all that have much better outcomes.It can be done. We won’t be advocating for the adoption of any particular system but we want people to really understand what the possibilities are. One of my jobs in my old career was to scare people away from any kind of system that wasn’t like the one we have now because it benefits the insurance industry and the other influential special interests — they make a lot of money off of this system. And to a certain extent, I’m making amends for the deception, the misleading information that I was part of disseminating for many years in my old job.MW: You mentioned the president and health care, what are your thoughts on these most recent developments, the executive actions to undercut the ACA and his declaration on Monday that Obamacare is dead? And what do you make of the attempt by Sens. Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander to come up with a temporary bipartisan compromise?WP: If his executive orders do go forward, there’s no doubt that what we had referred to or known as Obamacare is no more. In fact, I think it probably is time to start calling what we have Trumpcare.The executive orders would really be such a disadvantage to people who really need insurance. A lot of people will be once again priced out of the market and won’t be able to afford coverage. One of the executive orders creates what’s referred to as association health plans that will enable small employers in particular to circumvent state law and even federal law so that they can sell skimpy insurance, junk insurance if you will, to people, which will undoubtedly attract a lot of young and healthy people because the premiums will be cheaper but the value of what they’re buying is so much less, to the point that many of those policies will indeed be junk insurance. So it’s tragic what would happen if that executive order goes forward.Now he’s directed the Department of Health and Human Services and other departments to write the regulations for the implementation of this order. That will take time and there has to be a period of public comment. So it’s not going to happen tomorrow. It may be months down the road but it could happen. And it will be devastating. And even during that time it creates more uncertainty in the health insurance marketplace. And that undoubtedly will also lead to more health insurers leaving the Obamacare exchanges or if they stay increasing their premiums because of the uncertainty of knowing whether or not there will be any money to help cover the out of pocket expenses for example of the people enrolled in those plans.Another part of the executive order is to cut off the payments that have gone to or through insurance companies to help people afford to get the care that they need, to help offset their out of pocket expenses, which is so important for a lot of low and middle income people. So it could be really quite devastating.That’s why I’m delighted Sens. Alexander and Murray were able to land on a bipartisan short-term proposal to preserve the subsidies many low- and middle-income Americans are getting to help them cover those out of pocket medical expenses. Without the subsidies, a lot of folks wouldn’t be able to pay for the care they need. What’s not good is letting states permit the sale of policies that are nowhere close to adequate. Many people who enroll in those so-called catastrophic plans find out when it’s too late that they have to pay far more than they’re able to pay for expensive medical care. It would lead to more people filing for bankruptcy because of medical debt.Senate Democrats seem to be on board with what Alexander and Murray have come up with, but 60 votes will be needed for it to pass the Senate. And in the House, the odds are even slimmer. Paul Ryan has already said he’s against anything that doesn’t repeal and replace Obamacare. And it’s anybody’s guess where the president will land. One minute he likes it, the next minute he hates it. I wouldn’t give it much chance of going anywhere.MW: Also, with the new ACA enrollment period about to start, all these efforts to cut back on promoting new enrollments and then just the very fact of his declaring Obamacare dead would seem to be either a conscious or unconscious way to quash enrollments.WP: There’s no doubt that’s true. For a lot of people, in many cases, perception is reality. It’s the news that they get. And without advertising and other means of spreading the word about open enrollment, then we probably will see a lot of people not enrolling for coverage beginning next month for 2018. More than likely we will see a drop-off in people who sign up and premiums will be higher for a lot of people.Once again, because of the uncertainty, the insurance companies that are still in the Obamacare exchanges didn’t know what the president or Congress might do. Some of them suspected that some of the payments that have been going through them to help low and middle income people might be cut off and so consequently they’ve raised premiums in many places. So people will find it in some cases more expensive to get coverage than it has been in the past.MW: They’re projecting 20–25 percent increases in premiums over the next couple of years.WP: That’s correct in many places, not in every place but that absolutely could happen and be more the average. It even could be higher than that. And it’s not just premiums that we’re talking about. It’s important to pay attention to where the premiums are, but it’s just as important and sometimes more important to know what your out of pocket obligations are.One of the things that led me to leave my job was the industry strategy of moving more and more of us, all of us eventually, into high deductible plans. And I knew that those plans were not good for a lot of people who have a lot of medical expenses because of health status or pre-existing conditions and income. So that strategy has continued and what the president’s executive orders would do is make it even more challenging for people who really need insurance and need care.MW: Wendell, as someone who’s been both a journalist and a corporate executive, what do you think you’re going to bring to this Tarbell endeavor that will make it different?WP: First of all, I’m so grateful to be able to return to journalism. I realized during my corporate career — and it was a long corporate career — that I am really a journalist at heart. I sometimes joke that I spent 20 years inside the health insurance industry undercover. So what I can do is offer and provide some insights and help journalists understand where to go look for a story and how to get information and how to cover big business in a way that is not being done much anymore.I’ve seen it from the inside, I know the tricks. I know how they go about doing what they do to manipulate public opinion and elections and public policy. And what I bring to this is an emphasis on bringing the watchdog press back with scrutiny on business and business practices and the way that big businesses and other moneyed interests like trade associations. We want to help people understand how they do what they do and how we are often so disadvantaged. They do what they do to enhance profits, to enhance shareholder value, to protect a profitable status quo. And we at Tarbell will explain how it is they go about doing this and why it’s important. We’ll be connecting the dots for people so that they can understand why they should care to the point of getting involved to help move us to solutions.MW: Wendell, thank you and best of luck with Tarbell."

The actress was honored at the GLSEN Respect Awards on Friday night in Beverly Hills, where she accepted the GLSEN Inspiration Award in front of the community of LGBTQ youth leaders and champions.She used her moment on the podium to call out Trump and his policies of division. “Sometimes I feel as if we are living through a horrific dream,” she said. “It is a communal nightmare. The flames of terror and exclusion are being ignited by some of our most powerful ‘leaders.’ These people who have been entrusted with the protection of our rights ― the rights of all of us, of we the people ― have chosen instead to traffic in hate.”“We’ve gone from a White House lit in all the colors of pride to a White House that literally preaches division and discrimination,” she continued. “And so sometimes I worry because the stakes are high and fear is rampant.”Washington, a Hillary Clinton supporter and mom to son Caleb and daughter Isabelle, does have hope, however. And that hope lies in the young people who have the power to change the world. “Children are not born to be molded and perfected by their parents,” she said. “Children are born to us because we need to grow and be made more perfect than them. Basically what I’m saying to the young people here tonight is ― don’t get it twisted ― we don’t raise you, you raise us ... You are inspiring that change. In your work, you are collectively helping our country to become a more perfect union, and not just for some of us, but for all of us. All of ‘we the people.’”GLSEN, otherwise known as the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, is a group founded in 1990 to promote inclusivity for LGBTQ students. "

I have a human growing inside of me. What?!”Johnson’s husband had filmed his reaction to the news as well. His wife told him about her pregnancy by having him open a package that contained a pair of his favorite Converse sneakers for babies. East was shocked and overjoyed.Things quickly took a turn, however. Johnson started having “really bad stomach pains and a lot of bleeding” the next day. She and East went to a doctor’s office for blood work and an ultrasound. “It’s been an emotional roller coaster,” she said. “You go from shock to ‘holy crap’ to ‘I can’t do this’ to ‘let’s do this.’ And now it’s like ‘pray to God I can do this.’”East offered his support and noted, “Shawn is very brave to share all this stuff, so let’s respect that and give her props.”During the appointment, Johnson learned she was six weeks pregnant and had had a miscarriage. The doctor made sure to emphasize that it was not her fault and that miscarriage is incredibly common. Indeed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Mayo Clinic estimate that at least 10 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. “We just back got back from the doctor, and I’m no longer pregnant. Somehow I lost the pregnancy already, it sucks. It’s definitely no fun,” Johnson told viewers, later adding, “I was ready to buy baby clothes, pick out names.”The video has been viewed more than 1.5 million times. At the end, Johnson and East encouraged viewers to share their own stories.The comments section is filled with supportive messages and similar stories from people who’ve experienced miscarriage. In the video caption, Johnson concluded on a happy note. “The past 48 hours have been some of the happiest, scariest, and saddest times of my life,” she wrote. “My husband Andrew and I found out that we were unexpectedly pregnant, only to find out hours later some tragic news. I have been crying more than I ever have, but am still optimistic for what is next.”"

But he often volunteered for oddball pranks. In one well-known stunt, he worked a shift at a Taco Bell in suburban New Jersey, taking pickup orders.In another sketch, Letterman was dunked in water while covered in Alka Seltzer tablets.Receiving the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center, the national showcase for arts, Letterman, 70, was praised for his imagination, comic daring and heart.Many younger comedians, including current late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, have described Letterman as a major influence.Before Kimmel’s on-stage tribute to Letterman, the entertainer recalled one of his favorite, offbeat moments.“Dave brought this doorknob out. And he put it on a table. And he said ‘It’s just plain big.’ That was it.”Letterman hosted more than 6,000 episodes of his original “Late Night with David Letterman” on NBC and its successor on CBS, “Late Show with David Letterman,” which ended its run in May 2015.He won multiple Emmy Awards, television’s highest honor, for his work as a writer, performer and producer.The Indiana native made his first of 22 appearances on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” in 1978. After hosting “Late Night” for 11 years, he moved to CBS in 1993 after losing out to longtime rival Jay Leno to succeed Carson at “The Tonight Show.”On Sunday, comic friends teased Letterman about his late-night wars with Leno and retirement but the honoree struck a poignant note in his acceptance speech.“Mark Twain’s definition of patriotism is this: Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.”In 2012, Letterman was recognized for his contributions to the arts and American culture at the Kennedy Center Honors, a lifetime achievement awards for performing artists.The Letterman tribute will be aired on public television stations on Nov. 20."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59d6667f2d00009717308d49.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In 1985, Cuban-born, Mexico-based artist Marta María Pérez held a knife to her naked, pregnant stomach and took a picture. The resulting black-and-white photo shows the knife-wielding mother-to-be, her face cropped out, her individuality erased. It’s a jarring representation of motherhood, a far cry from the sunny, idealized images that flood social media and lifestyle magazines. Images that suggest mothers are ― and should be ― docile, domestic, faultless and, more often, white. “I immediately thought of the movie ‘Psycho’ when I saw this photo,” writer NeKelia Henderson wrote in 2010 of Pérez’s work. “Well, the maternity version anyway.”Pérez’s photo is part of “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985,” an expansive survey of work by Latinx women now on view at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. Together, the women paint a picture that diverges from the endorsed model of motherhood, blissful and devoid of complications or conflict. Instead, their moms are political, angry, salacious, outspoken, spiritual and experimental. Their images of motherhood welcome pain as well as love, truth as well as fantasy, horror as well as tranquility. As Hammer guest curator Andrea Giunta, who organized the exhibition along with Cecilia Fajardo-Hill, put it: “They propose more realistic maternities, crossed by different cultural, social and political registers.” Pérez’s menacing nude photo is called “Do not kill animals or watch them be killed.” The title, the artist explained to HuffPost, refers to the Afro-Cuban superstition that a pregnant woman who either kills an animal or witnesses a killing will give birth to a child with violent or criminal instincts. The myth echoes the 17th- and 18th-century conviction, upheld by some male philosophers and medical professionals of the time, that a pregnant woman’s unknown imagination could affect ― and potentially infect ― the unborn child forming inside her. If a mother experienced shock, hunger or lust, her child might arrive with physical deformities, leading experts thought. So when children were born with disabilities or afflictions, the mother’s “monstrous imagination” was up for blame. According to Princeton professor Marie-Hélène Huet, male scientists and philosophers would respond to a childbirth gone somehow awry by asking: “What woeful maternal fancy produced such a monster?”A version of this misogynistic anxiety lingers today thanks to a variety of persistent spiritual beliefs and superstitions, including those belonging to the Santeria religion Pérez ascribes to and interrogates. Her “Do not kill” image, in particular, is part of a larger series called “The Conceived,” for which she documented her experience carrying twins. She processed her pregnancy through the lens of her religion and its superstitions and taboos. The photos are “omens,” Marcela Guerrero writes in a catalogue essay, offering “an unromanticized view of maternity that transgresses Western notions of motherhood.”The series’ titles are inspired by anthropologist Lydia Cabrera’s El Monte, an in-depth description of the major Afro-Cuban religions, which include Santeria, Yoruba and Palo Monte. Another of Pérez’s photos, titled “Born to you strangled by the cord,” depicts the artist topless, from just below her lips to just above her nipples, wearing only pearls. The title nods to the unsubstantiated belief that wearing a necklace while pregnant can result in a child being strangled by his or her umbilical cord.Over the years, as medical technologies have evolved, the scientific community has debunked many of these beliefs, relegating them to the domain of spiritual superstition. However, a laundry list of still-potentially dangerous activities for mothers-to-be has taken their place: no smoking, no drinking, no caffeine, no high heels, deli meat or soft cheese. The list goes on. From policing thoughts to policing actions, the cultural desire to regulate and control pregnant mothers continues. Women are still expected to be impeccable parents ― even before their child arrives.Ultimately, it can be difficult to draw a line between responsibly protecting a child and unnecessarily policing a mother. As Lynn M. Paltrow, author of When Becoming Pregnant Is a Crime, wrote: “Recognizing ‘fetal abuse’ moves us toward criminalizing pregnancy itself because no woman can provide the perfect womb.”Pérez isn’t the only artist at the Hammer to skewer conventional representations of “baby bumps.” Johanna Hamann’s plaster-cast “Bellies” ― representations of pregnant stomachs that dangle from metal hooks, their contents spilling down like diaphanous fabric or human entrails ― recall both dresses lined up in a closet and carcasses dangling in a butcher’s display. As curator Giunta put it, “They refer to the relationship between maternity and trauma in at least two senses: a subjective one, visualizing aspects of motherhood that social stereotypes eliminate, and, on the other hand, referring to violence in Peruvian society of those years, to which the police and military forces of the state were linked.”Idealized images of pregnancy might suggest that miraculous transformations into motherhood occur in a vacuum, but in reality, some women approach this phase of their life under a variety of external pressures, including political oppression and social unrest. In 1979, the year Hamann began work on “Bellies,” Peru was transitioning from military to civilian rule under President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. Her mother-shaped casts pay tribute to the pain inside a woman’s body, as well as the world beyond it. While Hamann and Pérez visualize pregnancy, another artist, Louise Grobet, explores what happens post-birth. In her 1981 photograph “La Briosa,” a woman in a lucha libre mask feeds a bottle to an infant. As Giunta explained, mothers and homemakers in Mexico serve as both spectators and players of the carnivalesque and sometimes brutal sport of amateur, freestyle wrestling. In her photo, Grobet collapses the distinction between gentle mother and campy fighter. Both test the body’s limits and urge a woman to perform a designated role that has deep-rooted history in pre-Hispanic culture. “In this sense,” Giunta added, “maternity is linked to a form of festive and symbolic violence.” Violence is also palpable in Chilean artist Gloria Camiruaga’s 1984 film “Popsicles.” In it, her daughters eat popsicles with little plastic soldiers in them, chanting “Hail Mary” in between licks as the residue of their sweets stains their lips and teeth. Camiruaga described the work as a “rosary of alarm, eternal and circular.” Her daughters engage in outwardly innocent childhood activities ― making devotions, eating sweets ― all the while cognizant of the threat of violence beneath the surface; the toy soldier is meant as a reference to dictator Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an authoritarian military government between 1973 and 1990. “With this performance she refers to the dictatorship of Pinochet, but also puts in a critical place her own motherhood, using her own daughters.” Giunta said, “We have to think that dictatorships, and social and police violence in general, generate violence that specifically targets the female body [...] even caesareans practiced without anesthesia on women in prisons.”The physical experiences of pregnancy, birth and motherhood are far from the pristine, ethereal events that some mainstream representations would suggest. In the United States, the maternal mortality rate is rising, with 28 maternal deaths occurring per 100,000 births in 2013. Non-fatal injuries are far more prevalent. According to Mother Jones, between 50 to 80 percent of women who give birth experience tearing of the pelvic skin and muscles, and around half experience urinary incontinence. Three quarters report residual back pain. For women of color and women in marginalized communities, pregnancy invites additional hurdles. In 2008, a large-scale federal immigration raid in Iowa led to the arrest of 389 predominately Hispanic workers at a meat-processing plant. Babies born 37 weeks after the raid had a 24 percent higher risk of lower birth weight than those born the year before, a study at University of Michigan showed. Mothers also had an increased risk of preterm birth following the raid. For many Latinx women in America right now, particularly undocumented immigrants threatened by the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration, a euphoric pregnancy is not an option. The artists of “Radical Women” unflinchingly confront the realities of birth and motherhood, no matter how painful, ugly, confusing or taboo. Western culture asks women to prescribe to the myth of motherhood as something immaculate and miraculous ― with any deviation from the norm perceived as weakness or insubordination on the part of the mother. Artists like Pérez, Hamann, Grobet and Camiruaga refute these expectations, complicating the idea of motherhood and illuminating the work, trauma and alarm that go into creating and raising a child. “Radical Women” runs at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles until Dec. 31, 2017.

As Hammer guest curator Andrea Giunta, who organized the exhibition along with Cecilia Fajardo-Hill, put it: “They propose more realistic maternities, crossed by different cultural, social and political registers.” Pérez’s menacing nude photo is called “Do not kill animals or watch them be killed.” The title, the artist explained to HuffPost, refers to the Afro-Cuban superstition that a pregnant woman who either kills an animal or witnesses a killing will give birth to a child with violent or criminal instincts. The myth echoes the 17th- and 18th-century conviction, upheld by some male philosophers and medical professionals of the time, that a pregnant woman’s unknown imagination could affect ― and potentially infect ― the unborn child forming inside her. If a mother experienced shock, hunger or lust, her child might arrive with physical deformities, leading experts thought. So when children were born with disabilities or afflictions, the mother’s “monstrous imagination” was up for blame. According to Princeton professor Marie-Hélène Huet, male scientists and philosophers would respond to a childbirth gone somehow awry by asking: “What woeful maternal fancy produced such a monster?”A version of this misogynistic anxiety lingers today thanks to a variety of persistent spiritual beliefs and superstitions, including those belonging to the Santeria religion Pérez ascribes to and interrogates. Her “Do not kill” image, in particular, is part of a larger series called “The Conceived,” for which she documented her experience carrying twins. She processed her pregnancy through the lens of her religion and its superstitions and taboos. The photos are “omens,” Marcela Guerrero writes in a catalogue essay, offering “an unromanticized view of maternity that transgresses Western notions of motherhood.”The series’ titles are inspired by anthropologist Lydia Cabrera’s El Monte, an in-depth description of the major Afro-Cuban religions, which include Santeria, Yoruba and Palo Monte. Another of Pérez’s photos, titled “Born to you strangled by the cord,” depicts the artist topless, from just below her lips to just above her nipples, wearing only pearls. The title nods to the unsubstantiated belief that wearing a necklace while pregnant can result in a child being strangled by his or her umbilical cord.Over the years, as medical technologies have evolved, the scientific community has debunked many of these beliefs, relegating them to the domain of spiritual superstition. However, a laundry list of still-potentially dangerous activities for mothers-to-be has taken their place: no smoking, no drinking, no caffeine, no high heels, deli meat or soft cheese. The list goes on. From policing thoughts to policing actions, the cultural desire to regulate and control pregnant mothers continues. Women are still expected to be impeccable parents ― even before their child arrives.Ultimately, it can be difficult to draw a line between responsibly protecting a child and unnecessarily policing a mother. As Lynn M. Paltrow, author of When Becoming Pregnant Is a Crime, wrote: “Recognizing ‘fetal abuse’ moves us toward criminalizing pregnancy itself because no woman can provide the perfect womb.”Pérez isn’t the only artist at the Hammer to skewer conventional representations of “baby bumps.” Johanna Hamann’s plaster-cast “Bellies” ― representations of pregnant stomachs that dangle from metal hooks, their contents spilling down like diaphanous fabric or human entrails ― recall both dresses lined up in a closet and carcasses dangling in a butcher’s display. As curator Giunta put it, “They refer to the relationship between maternity and trauma in at least two senses: a subjective one, visualizing aspects of motherhood that social stereotypes eliminate, and, on the other hand, referring to violence in Peruvian society of those years, to which the police and military forces of the state were linked.”Idealized images of pregnancy might suggest that miraculous transformations into motherhood occur in a vacuum, but in reality, some women approach this phase of their life under a variety of external pressures, including political oppression and social unrest. In 1979, the year Hamann began work on “Bellies,” Peru was transitioning from military to civilian rule under President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. Her mother-shaped casts pay tribute to the pain inside a woman’s body, as well as the world beyond it. While Hamann and Pérez visualize pregnancy, another artist, Louise Grobet, explores what happens post-birth. In her 1981 photograph “La Briosa,” a woman in a lucha libre mask feeds a bottle to an infant. As Giunta explained, mothers and homemakers in Mexico serve as both spectators and players of the carnivalesque and sometimes brutal sport of amateur, freestyle wrestling. In her photo, Grobet collapses the distinction between gentle mother and campy fighter. Both test the body’s limits and urge a woman to perform a designated role that has deep-rooted history in pre-Hispanic culture. “In this sense,” Giunta added, “maternity is linked to a form of festive and symbolic violence.” Violence is also palpable in Chilean artist Gloria Camiruaga’s 1984 film “Popsicles.” In it, her daughters eat popsicles with little plastic soldiers in them, chanting “Hail Mary” in between licks as the residue of their sweets stains their lips and teeth. Camiruaga described the work as a “rosary of alarm, eternal and circular.” Her daughters engage in outwardly innocent childhood activities ― making devotions, eating sweets ― all the while cognizant of the threat of violence beneath the surface; the toy soldier is meant as a reference to dictator Augusto Pinochet, who ruled Chile with an authoritarian military government between 1973 and 1990. “With this performance she refers to the dictatorship of Pinochet, but also puts in a critical place her own motherhood, using her own daughters.” Giunta said, “We have to think that dictatorships, and social and police violence in general, generate violence that specifically targets the female body [...] even caesareans practiced without anesthesia on women in prisons.”The physical experiences of pregnancy, birth and motherhood are far from the pristine, ethereal events that some mainstream representations would suggest. In the United States, the maternal mortality rate is rising, with 28 maternal deaths occurring per 100,000 births in 2013. Non-fatal injuries are far more prevalent. According to Mother Jones, between 50 to 80 percent of women who give birth experience tearing of the pelvic skin and muscles, and around half experience urinary incontinence. Three quarters report residual back pain. For women of color and women in marginalized communities, pregnancy invites additional hurdles. In 2008, a large-scale federal immigration raid in Iowa led to the arrest of 389 predominately Hispanic workers at a meat-processing plant. Babies born 37 weeks after the raid had a 24 percent higher risk of lower birth weight than those born the year before, a study at University of Michigan showed. Mothers also had an increased risk of preterm birth following the raid. For many Latinx women in America right now, particularly undocumented immigrants threatened by the policies of President Donald Trump’s administration, a euphoric pregnancy is not an option. The artists of “Radical Women” unflinchingly confront the realities of birth and motherhood, no matter how painful, ugly, confusing or taboo. Western culture asks women to prescribe to the myth of motherhood as something immaculate and miraculous ― with any deviation from the norm perceived as weakness or insubordination on the part of the mother. Artists like Pérez, Hamann, Grobet and Camiruaga refute these expectations, complicating the idea of motherhood and illuminating the work, trauma and alarm that go into creating and raising a child. “Radical Women” runs at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles until Dec. 31, 2017.

In the interview, published in Lenny Letter on Friday, Dunham asked Union about constantly being confronted with both gender discrimination and discrimination based on her race ― or, the combination of oppressive forces also known as “misogynoir.” In response, Union mentioned fellow actress Jennifer Lawrence, whose October 2015 Lenny Letter essay about the issue of gender pay discrimination in Hollywood sparked a national conversation about women’s equality. Lawrence’s essay, Union noted, failed to mention the important aspect of race in the conversation of pay equality. "

The researchers were booked to appear Monday in Providence at the State of the Narragansett Bay and Watershed workshop, an event highlighting the health of New England’s largest estuary, where temperatures have risen 3 degrees Fahrenheit and water has risen up to seven inches over the past century.  The New York Times first reported the news on Sunday. EPA spokesman John Konkus, a former Trump campaign operative in Florida, provided an emailed statement to The Washington Post and The Hill confirming the cancellations: “EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting, it is not an EPA conference.” Konkus did not respond to an email and text message from HuffPost on Sunday evening. The move comes days after the EPA scrubbed dozens of links from its website to materials that helped local governments deal with the effects of climate change. Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he does not believe greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause climate change, and has scrapped or proposed eliminating numerous regulations to reduce emissions. Two weeks ago, he proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan, the federal government’s primary policy for slashing utilities’ output of planet-warming gases. The sudden cancellations on Sunday inflame concerns that the agency is muzzling scientists to further the White House’s political interests.The nonprofit Narragansett Bay Estuary Program, which receives funding from the EPA, is set to release a 400-page report co-authored by the scientists now barred from giving presentations.Tom Borden, the program director for the confab, told the Times he received a call on Friday from Wayne Munns, director of the Atlantic ecology division of the EPA’s Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, who said the scientists would not be allowed to speak. All three of the scientists planned to discuss climate change. Autumn Oczkowski, a research ecologist at the EPA’s National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division in Rhode Island, planned to include the effects of climate change on the estuary in her keynote address, according to the Times. Rose Martin, a fellow at the same EPA laboratory, and Emily Shumchenia, a consultant at the EPA, were slated to speak on the second panel of the workshop, entitled “The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate Change.” By Sunday night, their names were removed from the agenda on the event’s website. None of the scientists responded on Sunday to emails requesting comment, but Shumchenia retweeted links to the Times story. "

Global press freedom plummeted to a 13-year low in 2016, ThinkProgress noted, citing the think tank Freedom House.Czech journalist Michal Kubal shared a photo of Zeman with the replica gun on Twitter: A closer look shows that Zeman’s fake weapon — which he’d recently been gifted during a visit to the Czech region of Plzeň — had a bottle of Czech liqueur in place of a magazine. Zeman told the reporters that he did not “want to provoke” by showing off the novelty gun. “Do not be afraid,” he said, according to local news outlet Echo24, “the [magazine] is a bottle of Becherovka.”This has prompted some observers to speculate that Zeman was merely joking and not making a serious threat.Still, ThinkProgress pointed out that Zeman’s stunt was in particularly poor taste because of its timing. Less than a week ago, investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in Malta. “Not funny,” wrote Andrew Stroehlein, Europe media director for Human Rights Watch, on Twitter, commenting on Zeman’s recent antics. Zeman has shown distaste for the press on multiple occasions. According to The New York Times, he’s previously referred to reporters as “manure” and “hyenas.” In May, cameras captured him telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that there were “too many journalists” and that there was a need to “liquidate” them.Facing a public outcry after his comments to Putin, Zeman later claimed he’d only been joking. “Journalists never understand bon mots,” said Zeman’s spokesman at the time."

The victims have no known connections to each other and were all bus riders who were killed within a 1-mile radius of each other in central Tampa’s Seminole Heights neighborhood.“When you look at the time frame, the proximity, that there is no apparent motive, that they are alone ― the victims are a lot of the time ― it’s clear to me that they’re all linked,” interim Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan said at a Friday press conference.The victims have been identified as Benjamin Mitchell, 22; Monica Hoffa, 32; and Anthony Naiboa, 20.Mitchell, the first victim, was shot and killed on Oct. 9, while waiting at a bus stop near the intersection of North 15th Street and East Frierson Avenue.On Oct. 13, Hoffa’s body was found in a field near the intersection of East New Orleans Avenue and North 10th Street. Police said she may have been shot one or two days before.Naiboa, the latest victim, was killed Thursday night. Authorities said the man, who is autistic, had accidentally taken the wrong bus when returning home from work. His body was found on North 15th Street, roughly 200 yards from where he’d exited the bus.“This is very frustrating,” Dugan said. “We have someone terrorizing the neighborhood [and] it’s just difficult to see this happening.”Authorities have declined to reveal whether the same weapon or ammunition has been used in each of the killings.Investigators have released surveillance video, which shows a possible person of interest walking in the area on the night of Hoffa’s shooting.“We need somebody to tell us who that person is, or we need that person to come forward so we can eliminate them as a suspect,” said Dugan.Asked by a reporter if the individual responsible for the slayings is a serial killer, the police chief replied, “We can call it what we want. If that brings attention to it, that’s fine.”The FBI used to define a serial killer as someone who killed three or more individuals, with a “cooling off period” of more than a month between each slaying. However, the FBI in recent years redefined the criteria. A serial killer is now defined as the “unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events.”Under the new definition, the individual responsible for the Tampa slayings would be considered a serial killer.Dugan is urging people who live in the area of the shootings to turn on lights in their neighborhoods and report suspicious activity.“We’re not going to be held hostage by whoever is doing this,” Dugan said. “We need everyone to come out of their homes at night, turn on their porch lights and just not tolerate this type of terrorism.”Crime Stoppers of Tampa is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. Anyone with information is asked to contact Tampa police at 813-6130 or Crime Stoppers at 800-873-TIPS. Tips? Feedback?

La David Johnson, “knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways. And it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone in his voice and how he said it.”The president’s call made her “very upset and hurt,” she said. “It made me cry even worse.”Trump quickly shot back on Twitter, saying that his conversation with Johnson was “very respectful” and that he did say the fallen soldier’s name.Johnson’s death has been front and center in a controversy Trump himself created when he drew attention to the fact that he hadn’t phoned the immediate families of all service members who had been killed during his presidency and made the erroneous claim that his predecessors didn’t make such calls. Trump did phone Johnson last week. Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), who was in the car with Johnson when Trump made the condolence call on Tuesday, was the first to speak out about the conversation:“Sarcastically he said: ‘But you know he must have known what he signed up for,’” Wilson told NBC6. “How could you say that to a grieving widow? I couldn’t believe ... and he said it more than once. I said this man has no feelings for anyone. This is a young woman with child who is grieved to her soul.”Johnson’s aunt, who was also in the car, backed Wilson up last week. (The aunt, who raised Johnson, was identified earlier as Johnson’s mother.) Trump on Wednesday accused Wilson of fabricating what he said, claiming he had proof.“Whatever Ms. Wilson said was not fabricated,” Johnson’s widow, who is pregnant, confirmed on Monday. “What she said was 100-percent correct. The phone was on speakerphone. Why would we fabricate something like that?”She said she has nothing further to say to Trump.Johnson was killed during an ambush in Niger on Oct. 4, along with three other Special Forces troops. It took authorities two days to find his body, leading to questions about what occurred during the attack and whether the U.S. and Niger soldiers with him on the mission left him behind or tried to come back to rescue him.Johnson’s widow said she’s still desperately seeking answers to what happened.“When they came to my house they just told me that it was a massive gunfire and my husband as of Oct. 4 was missing,” she said. “They didn’t know his whereabouts, they didn’t know where he was. And a couple of days later they told me he went from missing to killed in action. I don’t know how he got killed, where he got killed, anything.”She said she still hasn’t been able to see her husband’s body. “They told he was in a severe wrap and I wouldn’t be able to see him. I know my husband’s body from head to toe and they won’t let me see anything. I don’t know what’s in that box, it could be empty from head to toe.”Approximately 1,000 people attended Johnson’s funeral on Saturday.The administration is reportedly rush-delivering condolence letters to families of slain soldiers amid the controversy. Three Gold Star families told The Atlantic that they hadn’t received correspondence from Trump until last week.In fact, the White House apparently had to scramble to find contact information for Gold Star families who lost a service member since January in order to determine who Trump hadn’t yet contacted, according to an internal Defense Department email obtained by political news site Roll Call."

The U.S., Russia, China and Japan decreased their CO2 output from 2015 to 2016, while the EU stayed flat and India’s emissions continued to increase. But emissions of methane and nitrous oxide have been increasing.Methane molecules trap roughly 30 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a century, and the gas comes from agriculture, coal and gas production, and landfills. Nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, trap about 300 times more heat than carbon dioxide; it’s emitted by soil fertilizers and chemical production. Agricultural statistics are not updated as frequently as energy and industry-related numbers, so the report did not include complete data for those gases. But a preliminary assessment showed an upward trend in the U.S., China, Japan, India, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Italy and Spain. Nitrous oxide emissions could get much worse as a result of global warming. Arctic permafrost contains roughly 67 billion tons of the gas, and, as that ice layer thaws, up to one-fourth of the region could become a net emitter, according to a study published in July.Other studies indicate that methane in particular has surged over the past decade, increasing by 10 or more parts per billion annually in 2014 and 2015, up from 0.5 parts per billion on average in the early 2000s, according to a study published in December in the journal Environmental Research Letters.“The leveling off we’ve seen in the last three years for carbon dioxide emissions is strikingly different from the recent rapid increase in methane,” Robert Jackson, a co-author of the paper and a professor of earth system science at Stanford University, told Phys.org. The results for methane “are worrisome but provide an immediate opportunity for mitigation that complements efforts for carbon dioxide.”The study may not paint a full picture of total methane emissions. A paper published last month found that emissions from agriculture could be much larger than previously reported, due to reliance on out-of-data data on livestock. The U.S. could be responsible for up to 60 percent of the global spike in human-caused atmospheric methane emissions since 2002, a Harvard University study found last year. The researchers said there was too little data to identify specific sources, but the increase tracked the boom in shale oil and gas production across the country, which leaks large amounts of methane from wells and pipelines. In June, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt defended President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, a deal to slash carbon emissions. He insisted the country had nothing to apologize for, and suggested the U.S. could help other nations reduce their CO2 output with its natural gas technology, namely hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. “If nations around the globe want to seek to learn from us on what we’re doing to reduce our CO2 footprint, we’re going to share that with them,” he said at a press conference, “and that’s something that should occur and will occur in the future.”Pruitt, like the president, has said he doesn’t believe humans are the main cause of climate change."

Some have resorted to drinking from wells at hazardous Superfund sites. Others have been drinking water from creeks that sick animals have urinated in ― and have died as a result.President Donald Trump has given no indication that he is concerned. “I give ourselves a 10” out of 10, he said last week, when asked how he’d rate his response to the humanitarian crisis on the U.S. island. That’s led a group of unions and nonprofits to take matters into their own hands with Operation Agua, a new program to fund and deliver water filtration devices directly to people’s houses, schools and relief centers around the island.“We’re talking about getting 100,000 of these water purifiers into the homes of Puerto Ricans so they can filter their water so it’s safe for drinking, bathing and cooking,” Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, told HuffPost on Monday.AFT and other groups leading the effort, including Operation Blessing and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, have begun raising money to provide at least 100,000 individual water filtration systems and 50 large-capacity clean water devices for schools and community centers. They’ve already figured out how to deal with the fact that 80 percent of the island has no power: the Kohler Clarity filter, which uses gravity, not electricity, to remove more than 99 percent of bacteria in water.Weingarten said one of these filters can purify up to 10.5 gallons of water per day, which is the amount of drinking water needed by a typical family.“Hopefully, the concerts and other groups that have gotten big donations will contribute to this effort,” she said. “But now, with a $30 contribution, someone can get a family one of these water purifiers.”FEMA and military personnel have been on the island for weeks, and they have helped to get bottled water to some communities. But Trump has come under fire for his sluggish response to the disaster, and there have been numerous reports of distribution problems. Some volunteer nurses on the ground told HuffPost earlier this month that government officials have been hoarding bottled water at a central location and requiring people to come pick it up, versus sending workers into communities to deliver it. That has prevented some older and less mobile residents from getting any food or water, they said.“These people are going to have an epidemic. These people are going to die,” said Alicia Schwartz, one of those nurses. “The help is not really there for them.”Weingarten, who has helped with past disaster relief responses for 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, was in Puerto Rico earlier this month. She said she drove around the island for 10 hours at a time, between towns hit hard by the hurricane, and was shocked by the “grossly inadequate” government presence.“I did not see a FEMA truck. I saw one military truck. I saw four electrical crews. That’s it,” Weingarten said. “For the president to say they have gotten everything they needed and it’s the municipalities that are failing is completely wrong.

Some have resorted to drinking from wells at hazardous Superfund sites. Others have been drinking water from creeks that sick animals have urinated in ― and have died as a result.President Donald Trump has given no indication that he is concerned. “I give ourselves a 10” out of 10, he said last week, when asked how he’d rate his response to the humanitarian crisis on the U.S. island. That’s led a group of unions and nonprofits to take matters into their own hands with Operation Agua, a new program to fund and deliver water filtration devices directly to people’s houses, schools and relief centers around the island.“We’re talking about getting 100,000 of these water purifiers into the homes of Puerto Ricans so they can filter their water so it’s safe for drinking, bathing and cooking,” Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, told HuffPost on Monday.AFT and other groups leading the effort, including Operation Blessing and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, have begun raising money to provide at least 100,000 individual water filtration systems and 50 large-capacity clean water devices for schools and community centers. They’ve already figured out how to deal with the fact that 80 percent of the island has no power: the Kohler Clarity filter, which uses gravity, not electricity, to remove more than 99 percent of bacteria in water.Weingarten said one of these filters can purify up to 10.5 gallons of water per day, which is the amount of drinking water needed by a typical family.“Hopefully, the concerts and other groups that have gotten big donations will contribute to this effort,” she said. “But now, with a $30 contribution, someone can get a family one of these water purifiers.”FEMA and military personnel have been on the island for weeks, and they have helped to get bottled water to some communities. But Trump has come under fire for his sluggish response to the disaster, and there have been numerous reports of distribution problems. Some volunteer nurses on the ground told HuffPost earlier this month that government officials have been hoarding bottled water at a central location and requiring people to come pick it up, versus sending workers into communities to deliver it. That has prevented some older and less mobile residents from getting any food or water, they said.“These people are going to have an epidemic. These people are going to die,” said Alicia Schwartz, one of those nurses. “The help is not really there for them.”Weingarten, who has helped with past disaster relief responses for 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, was in Puerto Rico earlier this month. She said she drove around the island for 10 hours at a time, between towns hit hard by the hurricane, and was shocked by the “grossly inadequate” government presence.“I did not see a FEMA truck. I saw one military truck. I saw four electrical crews. That’s it,” Weingarten said. “For the president to say they have gotten everything they needed and it’s the municipalities that are failing is completely wrong. What is unusual is the dearth of a federal response and the enormous vacuum that not-for-profits have to fill. That’s just wrong.”Want to chip in some money to help a fellow American have drinking water? You can donate to Operation Agua here."

Damon, who distanced himself from Weinstein earlier this month, said he had heard about the disturbing encounter around the time he and Paltrow were filming 1999′s “The Talented Mr. Ripley.”“I knew the story about Gwyneth [Paltrow] from Ben [Affleck], because he was with her after Brad [Pitt], so I knew that story,” Damon said. “But I was working with Gwyneth with Harvey on ‘Ripley.’ I never talked to Gwyneth about it. Ben told me.”“I knew that they had come to whatever agreement or understanding that they had come to,” the actor continued. “She had handled it and she was the first lady of Miramax. He treated her incredibly respectfully. Always.” Paltrow is one of dozens of actresses who’ve come forward in recent weeks with stories of sexual misconduct involving Weinstein. The actress and entrepreneur accused him of making advances when she was 22 years old and set to star in the film “Emma,” allegedly “placing his hands on her” and suggesting she give him a massage in a private hotel room. “He didn’t do it out in the open,” Damon told “GMA.” “If there was ever an event where there was something I was at with Harvey in public and he was doing this thing and I missed it, and there’s some woman who was somehow assaulted and was at the Golden Globes or something and I somehow missed it, then I’m sorry.”Damon and Affleck have both come under fire for their close ties to Weinstein in the fallout of the scandal. Reports claimed that the “Bourne Ultimatum” actor killed an incriminating story about Weinstein back in 2004, while actress Rose McGowan, who accused the producer of rape, maintains that Affleck had prior knowledge about his behavior.Damon has denied defending Weinstein in any capacity, while Affleck has yet to address the claims after apologizing for his own harassment scandal involving actress Hilarie Burton. Apart from Paltrow’s experience, Damon said he never heard about Weinstein’s “darkness,” as the producer allegedly preyed on women in private. However, he concedes that he was more than aware of Weinstein’s infamous reputation.  “You had to spend about five minutes with him to know that he was a bully and he was intimidating. That was his legend. That whole kind of M.O,” Damon said. “When people say ‘everybody knew,’ yeah, I knew. I knew he was an a**hole. He was proud of that. That’s how he carried himself. I knew he was a womanizer. I wouldn’t want to be married to the guy, but it’s not my business really, but this level of criminal sexual predation was not something I ever thought was going on.”Damon broke his silence on Weinstein’s alleged behavior earlier this month, condemning the producer’s actions and expressing his support for the alleged victims. “This would have been a difficult past couple of days even if my name hadn’t been dragged into it. I am not the story here,” he said. “The story is these women and what happened to them. So if I’m experiencing this discomfort, it hardly bears mention. There are some real victims here and they are being incredibly brave. Hopefully, them going through this experience right now will help them heal. They are who we all should be thinking about.” Watch clips from the interview below. "

He’s written poems lamenting legal abortion. He wants to make gay sex illegal and overturn marriage equality. The former judge says he places “God’s law” above the Constitution, describes Islam as a “false religion” and has repeatedly defied federal orders to remove religious ornaments from his courtroom. He doesn’t believe in evolution, compares preschool to Nazi-style indoctrination and once said the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were divine punishment for the United States’ godlessness. But Moore has remained uncharacteristically subtle when it comes to climate change and environmental issues. His campaign site calls for energy independence and stakes out the vague position: “Coal mining and oil drilling should be encouraged, subject only to reasonable regulations.” In July, he was the only candidate to refuse to answer questions about climate change for a Montgomery Advertiser story. Katie Frost, his spokeswoman, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Foundation for Moral Law, the Alabama-based legal nonprofit Moore founded, has never taken a stance on climate change, a representative told HuffPost. And Alabama environmental law experts say he ruled on few, if any, cases related to environmental or fossil fuel regulations as a judge, leaving his thinking somewhat of a mystery. “For Moore, climate and the environment have always taken a backseat to issues like religious expression,” Tammy Monistere Herington, executive director of Conservation Alabama, told HuffPost. Moore, in a 2009 op-ed for the right-wing site WorldNetDaily, did refute the 97 percent of peer-reviewed scientists who say greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, industrialized farming and deforestation are warming the planet and changing the climate. Moore argued against the Obama administration’s support for a bill that would have created a national cap-and-trade program to limit carbon emissions.“Not only is there no constitutional authority for Congress to regulate carbon emissions, but the premise of ‘global warming’ and ‘climate change’ upon which such environmental theories are based does not have the support of a scientific consensus,” Moore wrote.“Not only do scientists disagree on ‘global warming,’ but there is little hard evidence that carbon emissions cause changes to the global climate. But it appears that Obama and his liberal administration are not really interested in what the Constitution or the scientific community have to say when it interferes with their radical agenda.”In fact, 97 percent of peer-reviewed scientists have found that climate change is a serious threat and is at least exacerbated by humans. And there are serious flaws in the studies published by the 3 percent of scientists whose research suggests otherwise. A research review published last November found errors in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by in those studies that, when fixed, put the findings in line with mainstream climate scientists. That consensus is so strong that in 2005 one of the standard-bearers of the evangelical Christian politics in which Moore enshrouds himself planned to take a stance affirming the science. That year, the National Association of Evangelicals proposed adopting a new platform called “For the Health of a Nation.” The position paper called for protecting God’s creation and embracing the government’s help in doing so. But after receiving unanimous support by the board, the 30-million-member organization voted down the proposal, kickstarting a campaign by fossil fuel interests to transform the doubt over global warming into what Splinter, in a lengthy report published in August, succinctly described as “the word of God.”White evangelical Christians, more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in last November’s election, are the least likely of any U.S. religious group to believe climate change is occurring, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believe the planet is warming primarily due to human activity, compared with 56 percent of black Protestants and 41 percent of white mainline Protestants. Roughly 37 percent of white evangelicals don’t believe the climate is changing at all.This is a demographic Moore, who attends the Gallant First Baptist Church near his home, seems likely to tap. Alabama has the highest percentage of Baptists after Tennessee, with 31 percent of residents in the state, according to Pew’s 2014 Religious Landscape study. In December, The Baptist Press, the official media arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, published an open letter of support for Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt’s nomination amid fierce backlash over the former Oklahoma attorney general’s rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change.“We believe that Attorney General Pruitt has been misrepresented as denying ‘settled science,’ when he has actually called for a continuing debate,” the letter wrote.On one side of that debate is a theological argument that’s gained prominence in some corners of evangelical Christianity over the past decade. According to that interpretation, God provided fossil fuels for humans to exploit, and Christian environmentalists who believed in shifting to renewable energy were deceived by the “false doctrine” of the so-called “Green Dragon,” a demonic force that fooled people into putting the needs of the planet ahead of those of the poor.“As a Christian, I have a responsibility to try my best to be as wealthy as possible,” James Wanliss, an associate professor of physics at Presbyterian College in South Carolina and the author of The Green Dragon: Is Global Warming a Religion?, told HuffPost. “If you’re grindingly poor, you’re just going to care about your next meal, and too bad if trees get in your way.”He noted that industrial projects of the former Soviet Union and Communist China “resulted in massive, massive environmental destruction and death.”“I see that some of the anthropogenic global warming rhetoric has been picked up by people who are really excited about trying to experiment with those types of systems in the West as a solution to those problems,” Wanliss said. “As a Christian, that’s a problem to me, because, well, aside from the philosophy behind those systems, it’s just, again, empirically been disastrous.” Seeking the divine providence to burn fossil fuels is certainly part of where Moore comes from. In 2014, Alabama public officials invoked God in the fight for fossil fuels, asking constituents to pray for the future of coal-fired plants. Public Service Commission President Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh earlier that week had kicked off a public meeting with a prayer for God to intervene against same-sex marriage and reproductive rights.“Roy Moore, he’s part of that culture,” Michael Hansen, executive director of the Birmingham-based environmental group Gasp and a former candidate in the Democratic primary for Senate, told HuffPost. “Something that I hear quite a bit from the right wing in Alabama is that God gave us fossil fuels for a reason. I wouldn’t be surprised if Roy Moore said that at some point during his campaign.” Alabama emerged in June from more than a year of “the worst drought in memory,” affecting 98 percent of the state. The state braced twice in the past month for damage from the devastating series of hurricanes that struck neighboring states, but it was spared the destruction after the winds weakened. Yet nearly 37 percent of Alabamians don’t believe global warming is happening, 7 percentage points below the national average, according to survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Moore said in 2009 that policies to address climate change risked jobs, yet the opposite appears to be true in Alabama. The state had just 530 jobs in the solar industry last year, compared to 3,624 in Georgia and 8,260 in Florida, data from the Solar Foundation show. “We lag behind terribly in terms of renewables, even compared to other Southern states,” Hansen said. “They’re outpacing us in solar jobs. We’re dragging our feet, per usual.” "

The “Joanne” singer made things official with boyfriend and agent Christian Carino on social media Sunday by taking a page out of “The Notebook.”The couple posed for a stunning picture with Carino holding a bikini-clad Gaga in his arms. The two gaze lovingly into each other’s eyes as a sun sets behind them in the picturesque Snapchat.All that’s missing is a torrential downpour and years of unreturned love letters. Gaga also shared the same photo on her Instagram Stories with the “Sunday Funday” filter, writing “Night night” at the top of the photo. She later posted a Boomerang video on Instagram that showed her blowing the camera kiss. After ending her engagement with actor Taylor Kinney in July 2016, Gaga has stayed mum on her private life, focusing instead on her new album, which marked its one-year anniversary this month.Gaga and Carino, however, first sparked relationship rumors when they were spotted kissing and taking photos with each other on the field before her Super Bowl halftime show in February. Carino, who previously dated actress Lauren Cohan of “The Walking Dead,” represents Gaga at the Creative Artists Agency, as well as a host of major celebrities like Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Lopez.They’ve stayed by each other’s side since then, with Carino joining the singer on her “Joanne” tour around the country. During a downpour at Gaga’s New York City stop, he was waiting in the wings to check in on the pop star. “When I went backstage, Christian was by the stairs making sure I was okay,” Gaga said, according to Page Six. “The best part about being in love with someone is having them there to catch you if you fall.”After all the pain and heartbreak she’s experienced this year, it’s about time Gaga got her happy ending.

72,IMPACT,New York City Might Do Something Crazy To Ease Maddening Rush-Hour Traffic,Marisa Taylor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-congestion-pricing-rush-hour_us_59ea683fe4b0958c468217ea,Brace yourself: It involves tolls.,2017-10-23,"Traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, one of the currently free bridges that would get a new toll under the proposed Move NY plan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59eddd52140000371b8c9261.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Driving in New York City is a nightmare, and public transportation can be unpleasant on a good day. But there are plans afoot to ease congestion in certain parts of Manhattan and inject much-needed new funds into the ailing mass transit network.  A group of transportation experts over the summer proposed a controversial scheme to charge people for driving cars into Midtown and Lower Manhattan, which see the city’s worst traffic. The congestion pricing plan, called Move NY, would focus on peak traffic times ― like the weekday rush-hour periods ― in the area south of 60th Street. It would charge a cashless toll of $5.54 for drivers crossing this street in either direction. It would impose the same toll on bridges that span the East River ― the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queensboro, and Williamsburg bridges ― which currently allow drivers to enter and exit the city’s central business district for free. The plan would reduce existing tolls on bridges that link other parts of the city. The Move NY group, helmed by former New York City traffic commissioner Sam Schwartz, says the plan would cut the number of cars in Manhattan’s business district and would direct around $1.1 billion annually to the city’s subways and buses, as well as to bridges and streets. Congestion pricing is already in effect in central areas of London, Singapore, Oslo, Stockholm, and a few other cities around the world ― and it’s been mostly successful. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration proposed a similar plan back in 2007, but it was ultimately shot down by the state assembly.Now, almost a decade later, the idea is being revisited. “Congestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told The New York Times in mid-August. Though he has not said whether he supports Move NY specifically and didn’t comment for this story, Cuomo has assembled a panel to advise him on a policy to ease street traffic and direct new funds to subways and buses. The Move NY group has been circulating a Change.org petition urging Albany to take up its plan in the 2018-2019 state budget, but it’s attracted few signatures.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio doesn’t support congestion pricing, and said in August he thinks it’s “inconceivable” that such a measure would pass. There’s no guarantee such a plan would succeed in New York, though studies have shown that congestion pricing can work if implemented properly. Experts we spoke to favored it as a way of easing crowded streets. Plus, something’s got to give in the Big Apple. While problems with traffic seem to be getting worse, bus ridership is on the decline. Underground, the century-old subway network is straining to carry more rush-hour commuters than ever, and service has become increasingly unreliable.Between 2010 and 2015, the city gained 370,000 new residents and 10 million tourists. Though the number of cars entering Manhattan’s business district dropped by 6 percent during that time, the speed of traffic below 60th Street slowed by 12 percent, according to a report from the city’s Department of Transportation. The subways handle a staggering 5.65 million passengers each weekday. Ridership increased by 159 million people from 2010 to 2015, yet maddening subway delays have become routine. City buses saw 46 million fewer passengers in the same period, with average speeds south of 60th Street plummeting by 20 percent. The number of for-hire vehicle registrations ― including Uber and Lyft cars, as well as taxis ― has exploded since 2010.

Traffic volumes shrank by 13 percent to 30 percent in Singapore, where a policy has been in place since 1975; in Stockholm, where congestion pricing was enacted after a six-month trial in 2006; and in London, where congestion pricing was rolled out in 2003. Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 15 percent to 20 percent, according to a 2010 report from the International Council on Clean Transportation.In London, traffic has actually increased recently in the area where there’s congestion pricing. The city may roll out a tougher plan in the coming years. On Monday, London began a new rule that levies an additional fee on drivers of older, more polluting cars in the congestion zone area during peak hours.In the U.S., congestion pricing as as concept has been unpopular, because drivers perceive roads as free, said Robert Krol, an economics professor at California State University, Northridge, and senior affiliated scholar at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.Krol points to a middle way, of sorts, in the form of variable tolls, which are higher during peak traffic times, or tolled express lanes, so drivers can choose to pay if they’re in a hurry. Both techniques have been successful in the U.S. and accepted by drivers, he said. Congestion pricing “is the most effective way of reducing congestion and speeding up travel times,” said Krol.And despite de Blasio’s dismissal of congestion pricing, Orcutt said he thinks it’s probably coming eventually. “For New York, I think it is a no-brainer,” he said.

73,IMPACT,New York City Might Do Something Crazy To Ease Maddening Rush-Hour Traffic,Marisa Taylor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nyc-congestion-pricing-rush-hour_us_59ea683fe4b0958c468217ea,Brace yourself: It involves tolls.,2017-10-23,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo favors congestion pricing as a concept, but hasn't said whether he would support Move NY.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59eddd8e1500007a26746e6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Driving in New York City is a nightmare, and public transportation can be unpleasant on a good day. But there are plans afoot to ease congestion in certain parts of Manhattan and inject much-needed new funds into the ailing mass transit network.  A group of transportation experts over the summer proposed a controversial scheme to charge people for driving cars into Midtown and Lower Manhattan, which see the city’s worst traffic. The congestion pricing plan, called Move NY, would focus on peak traffic times ― like the weekday rush-hour periods ― in the area south of 60th Street. It would charge a cashless toll of $5.54 for drivers crossing this street in either direction. It would impose the same toll on bridges that span the East River ― the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queensboro, and Williamsburg bridges ― which currently allow drivers to enter and exit the city’s central business district for free. The plan would reduce existing tolls on bridges that link other parts of the city. The Move NY group, helmed by former New York City traffic commissioner Sam Schwartz, says the plan would cut the number of cars in Manhattan’s business district and would direct around $1.1 billion annually to the city’s subways and buses, as well as to bridges and streets. Congestion pricing is already in effect in central areas of London, Singapore, Oslo, Stockholm, and a few other cities around the world ― and it’s been mostly successful. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s administration proposed a similar plan back in 2007, but it was ultimately shot down by the state assembly.Now, almost a decade later, the idea is being revisited. “Congestion pricing is an idea whose time has come,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told The New York Times in mid-August. Though he has not said whether he supports Move NY specifically and didn’t comment for this story, Cuomo has assembled a panel to advise him on a policy to ease street traffic and direct new funds to subways and buses. The Move NY group has been circulating a Change.org petition urging Albany to take up its plan in the 2018-2019 state budget, but it’s attracted few signatures.New York Mayor Bill de Blasio doesn’t support congestion pricing, and said in August he thinks it’s “inconceivable” that such a measure would pass. There’s no guarantee such a plan would succeed in New York, though studies have shown that congestion pricing can work if implemented properly. Experts we spoke to favored it as a way of easing crowded streets. Plus, something’s got to give in the Big Apple. While problems with traffic seem to be getting worse, bus ridership is on the decline. Underground, the century-old subway network is straining to carry more rush-hour commuters than ever, and service has become increasingly unreliable.Between 2010 and 2015, the city gained 370,000 new residents and 10 million tourists. Though the number of cars entering Manhattan’s business district dropped by 6 percent during that time, the speed of traffic below 60th Street slowed by 12 percent, according to a report from the city’s Department of Transportation. The subways handle a staggering 5.65 million passengers each weekday. Ridership increased by 159 million people from 2010 to 2015, yet maddening subway delays have become routine. City buses saw 46 million fewer passengers in the same period, with average speeds south of 60th Street plummeting by 20 percent.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59ecb16b180000051bdfba9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"TOKYO, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s ruling bloc was headed for a big win in Sunday’s election, bolstering his chance of becoming the nation’s longest serving premier and reenergising his push to revise the pacifist constitution.Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party-led (LDP) coalition was set to win 311 seats, keeping its two-thirds “super majority” in the 465-member lower house, an exit poll by TBS television showed. Public broadcaster NHK also said the ruling bloc was closing in on a two-thirds majority, although some other broadcasters had the ruling bloc slightly below the two-thirds mark.A hefty win raises the likelihood that Abe, who took office in December 2012, will have a third three-year term as LDP leader next September and go on to become Japan’s longest-serving premier. It also means his “Abenomics” growth strategy centred on the hyper-easy monetary policy will likely continue.Final official results from the election, which coincided with an approaching typhoon, are expected early on Monday.The U.S.-drafted constitution’s Article 9, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of armed forces. But Japanese governments have interpreted it to allow a military exclusively for self-defence.Backers of Abe’s proposal to clarify the military’s ambiguous status say it would codify the status quo. Critics fear it would allow an expanded role overseas for the military.Abe said he would not stick to a target he had floated of making the changes by 2020. “First, I want to deepen debate and have as many people as possible agree,” he told a TV broadcaster. “We should put priority on that.”The LDP’s junior partner, the Komeito, is cautious about changing the constitution, drawn up after Japan’s loss in World War Two. Several opposition parties favour changes, but don’t necessarily agree on details.REFERENDUMS RISKYAmendments must be approved by two-thirds of each chamber of parliament and then by a majority in a public referendum.“Now that pro-constitutional change parties occupy more than two-thirds of the parliament, the constitution will be the most important political issue next year,” said Hidenori Suezawa, a financial market and fiscal analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.“And as we saw in the U.K. ..., a referendum could be tricky. So while Abe is likely to be prime minister for the time being, it is too early to say whether he can stay in power until 2021.” Abe declined to say if he’d run for a third term.Abe had said he needed a new mandate to tackle a “national crisis” from North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats and a fast-aging population, and to approve his idea of diverting revenue from a planned sales tax hike to education and child care from public debt repayment. [http://reut.rs/2yC0pma]He called the poll amid confusion in the opposition camp and an uptick in his ratings, dented earlier in the year by scandals over suspected cronyism and a perception he had grown arrogant after nearly five years in office.Abe has backed U.S. President Donald Trump’s tough stance towards North Korea, which has test-fired missiles over Japan, that all options, including military action, are on the table. Trump is to visit Japan Nov. 5-7 to reaffirm the leaders’ tight ties.ABE’S GAMBLE PAYS OFFAbe’s snap poll gamble had seemed risky - some early forecasts saw the LDP losing a significant chunk of seats - after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, often floated as a possible first Japanese female premier, launched her conservative Party of Hope.That party absorbed a big chunk of the failed main opposition Democratic Party, which abruptly decided to run no candidates of its own. But voter enthusiasm soon waned despite its calls for popular policies such as an exit from nuclear power and a freeze on the planned sales tax rise.Koike did not run for a lower house seat herself - she was in Paris for a climate change event on Sunday - and failed to say whom her party would back for prime minister.“We had sought to put policies first. But we ended up with a very tough outcome, so I deeply apologise for that,” Koike told NHK.A new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), formed by liberal former DP members, was vying with Koike’s party for the top opposition spot, although both will have just a fraction of the LDP’s presence if forecasts prove accurate.“Day by day, we felt we were getting more voter support for our call to revive more decent politics, and not fret about whether it’s right or left wing,” said CDPJ lawmaker Tetsuro Fukuyama.Several experts noted the ruling bloc’s win was less a victory for the conservative, long-ruling LDP than a defeat for a divided opposition.“Simply put, this was the self-destruction of the opposition,” said Zentaro Kamei, a senior research fellow at think tank PHP Institute and former LDP lawmaker.Shinjiro Koizumi, the LDP lawmaker son of popular former premier Junichiro Koizumi, warned against LDP complacency.“It’s not just that our party has become arrogant and complacent. People are also getting increasingly fed up with us,” he told NHK.Abe, 63, has already led the LDP and its partner, the Komeito, to four landslide wins since he took the helm of the party. But turnout has been low and the LDP has typically won with about 25 percent of eligible votes. Others either stayed home or backed opposition parties.Kyodo news agency estimated turnout on Sunday - when heavy rain from powerful Typhoon Lan lashed much of Japan - at 53.7 percent, one point above the record low in the last lower house election in 2014.(Additional reporting by Hyun Oh, Elaine Lies, Kiyoshi Takenaka, Yoshiyuki Osada, Sumio Ito, Malcolm Foster and Hideyuki Sano.; Editing by Kim Coghill and Nick Macfie)"

Actor Tom Hanks recommends this: Brush up on your history.At the National Archives Foundation’s annual gala in Washington on Saturday night, Hanks was given the Records of Achievements Award “for his powerful illumination of the American story through his vast body of work in film and television.”Hanks, who has been described as “Hollywood’s top history buff,” spoke of the importance of learning from the past as a way to navigate the complexities of the present.“People are upset about what’s going on today. They’re furious, they’re frustrated, they’re worked up,” Hanks said, according to CNN. “If you’re concerned about what’s going on today, read history and figure out what to do because it’s all right there.”Hanks also touched on the national controversy regarding confederate monuments ― saying that while history should not be erased, an open discussion and reexamination of what’s being taught and celebrated is also critical. “Let’s have that discussion, let’s have that be part and parcel to an ongoing re-examination about what is taught about [America’s founding],” Hanks said. “But the destruction, the destruction is anti-social, period, the end. Be intelligent, and be smart, write about it, bring it up, talk about it.”Hanks has said before that he supports moving Confederate monuments and statues to museums where they can be appreciated with ample context provided. “If I’m black and I live in a town and every day I have to walk past a monument to someone who died in a battle in order to keep my grandparents and my great-grandparents illiterate slaves, I got a problem with that statue,” he told The New York Times earlier this month . “I would say if you want to be on the safe side, take them all down. Put them in some other place where people can see them, in a museum somewhere.”The Records of Achievements Award is the National Archives Foundation’s top honor ― one reserved for individuals “whose work has cultivated a broader national awareness of the history and identity of the United States through the use of original records.”Explaining Hanks’ nomination for the honor, U.S. Archivist David Ferrieros said “no actor has covered the span of 20th-century American history as broadly as [Hanks].”“He’s served in World War II (in both the European and Pacific theaters), negotiated for the U.S. in the Cold War, fought in Vietnam, worked in Congress, and led the space program,” Ferriero wrote in a news release, referring to roles roles Hanks’ has had. “He’s fought pirates and deadly viruses, befriended mermaids, and saved both Private Ryan and Gary Powers.” Hanks said he was “dazzled” to be part of the gala and described his love for history and digging into archives for work. “Part of my job has always been one not far from that of a lay-historian, to understand that I am a part of the documenting of the human condition and the American idea, even in the silliest of stories,” he said in a statement."

That’s because when people are fleeing at a moment’s notice, cats are typically more difficult to wrangle than dogs.“It’s harder to find cats in that kind of stressful situation,” Karen Blount, a veterinarian at Windsor Animal Hospital in Santa Rosa, told HuffPost. “More often than not, they bolt.”Many people tried their hardest to take their pets with them, but became separated at the last minute.Jennifer Trabucco told HuffPost that she and her husband noticed smoke pouring into their Santa Rosa home at around 1:30 a.m. on Oct. 9.“We only had about seven minutes to get out of our house,” she said.Her husband grabbed their three kids and dog while she found and scooped up their two cats, Jake and Luke, in her arms.“Right as I got outside, [the cats] kind of panicked,” she said. “Luke squirmed out of my arms and I was screaming ‘Oh my God, no!’”The two cats tore off in different directions — Jake went back into the house while Luke disappeared outside into the night. She ran back in and got Jake, but with flames bearing down and children and other pets in tow, she had to make the heartbreaking decision not to search for Luke.“It was so smoky that my husband lost sight of our road,” she said. “My three kids in the backseat, and they were crying because our cat got left behind. I was crying.”But Luke’s story has a happy ending. Days later, the family got a call from Sonoma Humane Society. Luke was injured, but alive. His microchip — a tiny implanted device that allows vets and shelters obtain an owner’s contact information — helped rescue workers find Trabucco. Trabucco was so happy, she burst into tears. Luke’s whiskers and ears were singed and all four paws were burnt, but he’s recovering and is clearly happy to be back with his family.“He’s been glued to us and purring,” Trabucco said. “All he wants is to be held.”Bizarrely, this is the second fire Luke and Jake have survived. Trabucco adopted both as kittens after a fire destroyed the patch of trees and grass where a feral mother had given birth to them.Other reunion stories shared on social media include a woman whose cat broke out of her carrier during an evacuation, and another whose cats leapt out of the car when she rolled the windows down only slightly for ventilation.The Sonoma Humane Society told HuffPost that more than 550 domestic animals are still reported missing. And dozens of animals have been found and treated for injuries, but their owners have not yet been located.Sonoma Humane Society, Sonoma County Animal Services, UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and Marin Humane Society are among many groups accepting donations online for animals affected by the fires. Blount said Windsor Animal Hospital is also accepting donations for a fund to help cash-strapped pet owners pay their veterinary bills in the wake of fires. Those donations can be made in person or over the phone.The Sacramento Bee has a comprehensive list of other organizations — both for animals and humans — in need of donations and volunteers in the wake of the fires.If you have lost or found a pet within Sonoma County, you can use a centralized online database that is shared between all shelters and rescue groups within the county."

Weighing in at almost 81 pounds, the 7-year-old Strudel was visibly far too heavy and suffering from issues like inflamed joints.The couple offered their fitness services for free, working with a veterinarian to develop a proper diet plan and designing an agility course that wouldn’t be too strenuous. In spite of her heft, Strudel was a natural.“We motivate dogs with treats, toys and praise but Strudel was actually easy, it’s almost like she knew what she had to do,” Kristy Cotthaus told HuffPost in an email. “We didn’t have to use any treats at all because she was motivated to do the agility [course] with just lots of praise.”Strudel is up for adoption through Hearts for Hounds, and in the meantime she’s being fostered by volunteer Kristen Horton, who can’t stop singing her praises.“Strudel is the sweetest animal we have ever met,” Horton said in an email. “She is calm, friendly, loves to play, snuggle, and walk, and is well-trained … Think gentle giant (though not so giant anymore!!)”Horton said that after losing about 25 pounds so far, Strudel is already a more energetic dog. In fact, Strudel had to leave her first foster home because shedding the weight made her a little too energetic around another family pet.“She had lost enough weight that she was fast enough to antagonize their cat so she came to us at the end of August,” said Horton.While Strudel’s cat-chasing tendencies are now apparent, Horton said Strudel loves other dogs and would do wonderfully in a home with kids who could “keep her activity up.” Aside from that, Horton noted whoever adopts Strudel will have to commit to a regimen including special foods and lots of exercise. Her joint problems make it tough for her to take the stairs, so a home where that’s not necessary would be ideal, and vets will soon evaluate Strudel to see if she’s suffering from any internal medical issues related to her weight. But, Horton noted, Strudel’s already been triumphant at overcoming a major challenge ― losing weight ― and that’s allowed her to get back to living a much more normal dog life.“She is a miracle of a pup so far,” Horton said."

Police had asked residents to stay home until they find the attacker who had fled on a bicycle.Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae told a news conference that eight people have been lightly injured in the attack and that the suspect was known to police from previous offences, including burglary.“We have no indication of a terrorist, political, or religious motive,” Andrae said. “I assume it is to do with a psychological disorder of the perpetrator.”Police had earlier said they believe the man, who attacked people at several different locations, acted alone.

It’s not like he’s the only guy who ever did it and he only did it in the last three, four, five years. And it’s not only in that industry.”Holder expressed hope that educating men to change their behavior could be a “silver lining” to emerge from the Weinstein scandal and other cases.“This is a man’s problem. It’s not like you need to talk to women about this. They get it. You gotta talk to guys and make them understand you can’t be a pig,” he concluded, drawing applause.Holder was the nation’s first black attorney general, serving from 2009 to 2015. He subsequently returned to practicing law at Covington, a major law firm where he worked before serving in the Barack Obama administration.Holder chairs the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group created to reform congressional redistricting. Obama has been active in the organization.Democrats believe their loss of state governments in 2010, the year of the most recent national census, which is used for redistricting, prompted a massive wave of gerrymandering that has put them at a disadvantage when it comes to controlling the U.S. House of Representatives."
