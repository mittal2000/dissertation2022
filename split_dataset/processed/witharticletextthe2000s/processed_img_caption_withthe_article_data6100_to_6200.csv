Speculation about Pippa Middleton’s wedding day look has been swirling since the famous former bridesmaid announced her engagement last July, and she did not disappoint on the big day. Pippa wore a high-neck, cap-sleeved lace designed by Giles Deacon with an elaborate train, a tiara and a bespoke veil as she married James Matthews at St. Mark’s Church in Englefield, England on Saturday. The lace detailing slightly reminded us of the show-stopping Alexander McQueen gown her sister, the former Kate Middleton, wore to marry Prince William in April 2011.Prince George and Princess Charlotte also looked predictably adorable for the occasion. Charlotte wore a white short-sleeved dress with a giant bow in the back with a head piece. George wore a white collared shirt with short trousers. Too. Cute. Congratulations to the happy couple.See even more photos here: "

2,POLITICS,Democrats Warn Trump Administration Against Killing Barack Obama's Retirement Rule,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-warn-trump-administration-against-killing-obama-retirement-rule_us_591f0dbae4b034684b0be24b,"The White House has delayed a regulation meant to save consumers billions of dollars on their retirement plans, putting it in limbo.",2017-05-19,A group of Senate Democrats have noted in a letter to the labor secretary that President Donald Trump has ordered an updated “economic and legal analysis” of the rule before anything happens to it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f0eb2270000640090ee4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump last month delayed a new rule that would require financial advisors to act in their clients’ best interests when they steer them toward retirement plans. Congressional Democrats warned Friday that the administration was considering killing the rule for good before even doing its own analysis.A group of Senate Democrats said in a letter they sent Friday to Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta that they were alarmed by claims from a retirement advisors’ lobby that he had made stifling the so-called “fiduciary rule” a “number one priority.” The American Retirement Association reported last week that Acosta had said he was looking to “freeze the rule” in a way that would “stick.” Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) noted in their letter to Acosta that Trump himself had ordered an updated “economic and legal analysis” of the rule before anything happens to it.“Instead of meeting with all stakeholders and considering multiple points of view, you appear to have prejudged the outcome of the review your agency was tasked with conducting,” they wrote. “In fact, it seems as though you have already arrived at your decision.”The fiduciary rule was a major regulation that former President Barack Obama issued in 2015. Until it goes into effect, the financial advisors who help people with 401(k) plans and retirement accounts are not legally obligated to act in their clients’ best interests the way many other financial advisors are. That gives them the leeway to steer clients toward high-fee investments even if those aren’t necessarily the best products under the circumstances.Warren and other Democrats say the fiduciary rule will save consumers billions of dollars a year by removing a clear conflict of interest for the advisors. But Wall Street groups have fought the regulation ever since it was conceived, and the new White House halted it before it could go into effect in April as planned. A member of Trump’s economic council had lobbied against the rule on behalf of Fidelity, one of the country’s largest investment managers, before joining the White House. The new implementation date for the fiduciary rule was pushed back to June, though Senate Republicans have asked Acosta to push back the rollout even further. Warren grilled Acosta over the rule during his confirmation hearing in March, trying to pin him down on his plans for it. “Will you protect workers saving for retirement from financial advisors who would cheat them?” she asked him in a long back and forth.Acosta wouldn’t indicate where he stood on the rule, saying only that he would follow Trump’s orders to review all regulations currently on the books."

Alexander Shcherbak/TASS (Photo by Alexander Shcherbak\TASS via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f47c01400004c0905c196.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A pair of bombshell reports on Friday threaten to overshadow President Donald Trump’s first overseas trip and further embroil his administration and presidency in scandal.The New York Times reported Trump told Russian officials that he felt “great pressure because of Russia” that he said was taken off when he fired FBI Director James Comey. Minutes later, the Washington Post reported that investigators are looking at a close Trump adviser as part of their probe into possible ties between Russia and Trump’s campaign.Trump met with Russian officials on May 10 after firing Comey the evening before. At the meeting, Trump told them he was not under investigation and bashed Comey, the Times reported.“I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,” Trump said, according to notes of the meeting read to the Times.Trump and the White House have repeatedly contradicted themselves over the reasoning for Comey’s firing, which took place as he led a probe into Russian influence into the U.S. election and potential ties to his campaign. The New York Times report is further evidence that Trump fired the FBI director at least in part to end the investigation ― something that’s only served to bring more attention to it.The White House did not refute the Times’ report, but press secretary Sean Spicer said it wasn’t the “real story.” “The President has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria, Ukraine, defeating ISIS and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people,” Spicer said in a statement. “By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia’s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia,” Spicer continued. “The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.”Not only did firing Comey not get investigators off Trump’s back, but the investigation into possible ties between Russia and his campaign also includes a close adviser, the Washington Post reported, citing unnamed officials.Key targets of the investigation until now have reportedly included former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and also former Trump campaign honcho Paul Manafort, two people who were part of Trump’s campaign but are not currently part of the administration. Flynn resigned in February after having lied to investigators about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak, who was one of the Russian officials Trump met at the White house on May 10. Also during Trump’s meeting with the Russian officials, he reportedly disclosed “highly classified information” that “jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State,” the Washington Post reported.  Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas related to the investigation into Flynn. White House officials initially claimed that Trump fired Comey on the advice of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and released a memo by the official voicing concerns about the FBI director’s behavior, including his handling of an investigation into 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.But Trump publicly said soon after that he made the decision ahead of time, and acknowledged the Russia investigation was part of his decision. “I was going to fire Comey, knowing there was no good time to do it,” he told Lester Holt. “And in fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, it’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election.’”Rosenstein contradicted White House officials’ initial claims as well. He told members of Congress this week that he knew Trump was going to fire Comey before he wrote his memo.This week, Trump repeatedly called the Russian investigation a “witch hunt.”"

5,POLITICS,Congress' Weed Guy Grapples With The Trump Administration,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-earl-blumenauer-sessions-congress_us_591f105ae4b094cdba53a04b,Earl Blumenauer tries to pass the peace pipe between Washington and the cannabis industry,2017-05-19,Attorney General Jeff Sessions' views on marijuana have rattled the cannabis industry.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f11962000003200cb19d1.jpeg?ops=crop_15_610_4017_2055%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) has been selling weed for years. Actually, let’s rephrase: Blumenauer, the bespectacled, bow tie-clad, bicycle-riding lawmaker whose district covers much of ― where else ― Portland, has been one of America’s most outspoken public officials on liberalizing America’s marijuana laws.It now has fallen on Blumenauer to partake in a different type of weed dealing: serving as an unofficial liaison between official Washington and a cannabis industry that is, even by its own vigilant standards, pretty spooked by the prospect of a federal crackdown on it.Though voters in eight states voted to legalize recreational or medical marijuana consumption in November, Donald Trump’s election and the confirmation of Jeff Sessions, an outspoken marijuana critic, as attorney general has stepped on a lot of buzzes.“The Trump presidency has sent shockwaves virtually everywhere,” Blumenauer told HuffPost this week, “and it has been an area of special concern for people who deal with marijuana because it appears that Jeff Sessions is no great friend of the industry.”“I think people are kind of torn,” Blumenauer said. “They see this amazing groundswell of support for state legal marijuana ― we’ve seen a huge shift in public opinion ― but they’re apprehensive and they should be.”Marijuana remains classified a schedule one narcotic under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, meaning the federal government deem it to have a “high potential for abuse” and “has no currently accepted medical use.” That puts it in the same class as heroin and flies in the face of decades of research.Overall, twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized some form of marijuana consumption. The Obama administration took an increasingly hands-off approach to federal enforcement of marijuana laws, crystallized by a 2013 Department of Justice memorandum known as the Cole Memo, which effectively let marijuana policy up to the states.The Trump administration, however has sent mixed signals about its approach. While Sessions made favorable comments about the Cole memo earlier this year, in a March speech he referred to marijuana as “only slightly less awful” than heroin. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in February that states should expect “greater enforcement” of federal marijuana laws. Blumenauer set out to calm nerves this week by holding meetings with cannabis industry representatives in Washington for a lobbying blitz. At a Wednesday press conference on Capitol Hill, Blumenauer and six House colleagues touted a set of bills aimed at allowing cannabis companies access to banking services. While Blumenauer didn’t provide the event’s best lines ― that honor went to Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.), who quipped that “the industry is not a little head shop with a poster of Che Guevara” and that Congress needed to “puff puff and pass” the bills ― he was undoubtedly the most animated of the group.“Ultimately we are going to legalize access” to marijuana nationwide, Blumenauer, wearing a bow tie patterned with cannabis leaves, told the crowd of journalists and marijuana advocates, “but the main items we can act on now are not controversial.” Blumenauer, 68, has been working on the issue since 1972 when, as a state legislator, he helped make Oregon the first state to decriminalize marijuana consumption. This congressional session alone, Blumenauer and three other lawmakers (including two Republicans) launched the Congressional Cannabis Caucus to focus on efforts to liberalize the nation’s marijuana policies. Blumenauer has introduced four bills on the matter and co-sponsored another five ― legislation that would, among other things, legalize the substance federally and regulate its taxation.If that weren’t enough to burnish his reputation with the cannabis industry, Blumenauer has at least one strain of marijuana named after him, described by the Portland marijuana site The Potlander as a “high-CBD, low-THC flower grown on a mountainside.” It even made the website’s list of the year’s best weed products.After Wednesday’s press conference, Blumenauer decamped to National Harbor, Maryland, to attend the Marijuana Business Conference and Expo ― or MJBizCon ― the nation’s oldest professional gathering for the cannabis industry. Navigating the maze of vendor booths, Blumenauer remained upbeat about the prospects for the industry, insisting that nationwide legalization is four years away, at most.“Last fall, in the nine states where marijuana was on the ballot, there were more votes cast for marijuana than for Donald Trump,” Blumenauer told HuffPost, “and hundreds of thousands of his supporters also supported the legalization effort.”He speculated that legalization could come about in a number of ways, including through legislation or by executive action from “the new administration that will replace Trump” that de-lists marijuana as a controlled substance.The sheer normalcy of MJBizCon buttressed Blumenauer’s sunny outlook that widespread legalization of marijuana is inevitable.True, a handful of psychedelic-themed convention booths decorated with rastafarian caricatures could be found, along with an above-average number of steampunk-looking dudes with tiny wireframe glasses and waxed mustaches. Yet aside from the companies’ preference for green-hued logos and their tendency to incorporate marijuana wordplay into their names (booths belonging to CannaGuard and CannaPro were within shouting distance of one another), MJBizCon resembled any other business conference. It was replete with vendors handing out memory sticks stamped with their company’s name and throngs of middle-management types exchanging business cards.Indeed, the workaday nature of the proceedings drove home how much whiplash the industry must be experiencing to have developed so far only to have the prospect of bankruptcy, or even jail time, become a possible, if still unlikely, threat. “I’m nervous, I’m really nervous,” said Steph Shever, executive director of Americans for Safe Access, a marijuana advocacy group, during a MJBizCon panel on federal drug policy.“Investors have [asked], ‘What’s Trump going to do?’” said Daniel Macris of Halcyon Organics, a Georgia-based medical marijuana provider, “And I say, ‘Dude, I don’t know, what’s he going to do with anything?’”Blumenauer told HuffPost that cannabis-related companies are “concerned, they want clarity ... because they are investing millions of dollars, they’re building business, they’re watching the public support grow, and they’re apprehensive” about the Trump administration.He said he believes that strong support for marijuana legalization ― 60 percent of respondents supported it in one recent poll ― will stay the administration’s hand.“Don’t give up on the federal government,” Blumenauer said during the panel discussion. “After four decades, I have never been more optimistic.”“The movement continues to grow, the industry continues to grow,” Blumenauer told HuffPost after the panel ended. “And I think it’s just going to be a case where events will overwhelm.”JM Rieger contributed reporting to this article.

6,POLITICS,"Obamacare Repeal Law Would Give Montana Republican $800,000 Tax Cut",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greg-gianforte-gop-health-care-law-tax-cut_us_591f13bae4b034684b0bee70,Greg Gianforte has waffled on the law.,2017-05-19,"Greg Gianforte, the Republican candidate for Montana’s open House seat, stands to benefit financially from the American Health Care Act.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f16711400004c0905c0d4.jpeg?cache=78FhRALzUQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Greg Gianforte, the Republican candidate for Montana’s open House seat, stands to get tax cuts worth nearly $800,000 a year if the House health care bill becomes law, according to a new analysis.The American Health Care Act, as the Republican bill that passed the House of Representatives is known, repeals the two tax hikes on higher earners that the Affordable Care Act used to fund expansion of insurance coverage: a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income and a 0.9 percent increase in the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax. Both taxes apply to individuals making $200,000 a year or more, and married couples making $250,000 a year or more.Based on Gianforte’s average yearly investment and wage income from 2005 to 2014, his annual tax bill would go down $785,413 if the AHCA passed, according to an analysis released Friday by the Center for American Progress Action Fund and Tax March, an organization backed by labor unions and progressive groups.CAP Action Fund senior fellow Seth Hanlon, a tax attorney who worked for former President Barack Obama, conducted the analysis. Hanlon calculated the size of the tax cuts based on the income reported in tax returns for Gianforte and his wife Susan from 2005 to 2014. Gianforte released them as part of his failed bid for governor of Montana in 2016.Gianforte, 56, founded two successful software companies, including RightNow Technologies, which he sold to Oracle for $1.5 billion in 2011.He and his wife made, on average, over $20 million a year in investment income and $1.6 million a year in ordinary wages over the 10-year period for which Gianforte disclosed his earnings. Assuming he continued to maintain this average going forward, he would get a $772,981 annual tax break from repeal of the net investment income tax and another $12,432 from elimination of the Medicare Hospital Insurance surtax.Shane Scanlon, a spokesman for Gianforte’s campaign, did not respond to a request for comment on the law’s financial benefits for the GOP candidate.Gianforte is hoping to fill a seat that Ryan Zinke vacated when Trump picked him to become interior secretary.He is locked in an increasingly close race with Democrat Rob Quist, 69, a folk music sensation in the state who is running on a populist platform of protecting public lands and making health care more affordable. The special election is this coming Thursday.In the past two weeks, Quist has made an issue out of Gianforte’s murky stance on the Republican health care law, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated would deny at least 24 million Americans health insurance. The law would have a significant impact in Montana, where the state’s uninsured rate dropped from 20 percent in 2012 to 7.4 percent in 2016 thanks to Obamacare.Gianforte told Republican-leaning lobbyists in a private call on May 5 that he was “thankful” that the House had passed the AHCA, according to The New York Times. He has since walked back the comment, telling Montana Public Radio that he would not have voted for the law, because “we don’t have enough data yet” to determine if it would bring down premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and maintain access to coverage in rural communities.The latter comments have not deterred Quist in his efforts to paint Gianforte as an unreliable defender of Montanans’ health care. Quist raised $550,000 in the four days following the Times report ― part of a more than $5 million haul that has come from over 200,000 individual donors.Quist’s campaign has plowed some of that cash into ads hitting Gianforte for voicing support for the law.The campaign’s two closing ads focus on the AHCA’s rollback of federal protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. The law would allow states to opt out of community rating regulations in Obamacare that require insurers to provide coverage at regional rates for people in the individual insurance market, rather than charge much higher premiums for people with past illness or other health histories the insurance industry has called “pre-existing conditions.” Those states that choose to opt out would have to create high-risk pools to cover those people, but conservative and liberal experts alike believe the federal funding for those pools would be woefully inadequate.In the ads, Quist discusses his own pre-existing condition from gallbladder surgery, claiming he is one of an estimated half of Montanans who have what would be considered a pre-existing condition.Quist struggled with medical debt for years after the surgery, which was botched and left him unable to afford insurance for a time due to a pre-existing condition. He has said that he supports single-payer health insurance because he does not want people to go bankrupt trying to pay for health care.The CBO has announced that it will release updated estimates of the Republican health legislation’s impact this coming Wednesday. The analysis is expected to show that the current version of the House bill would deprive more people of insurance than the earlier iteration, which preserved more features of Obamacare.Polling in the Montana House race has been sparse, but the available figures suggest Quist has gained ground against Gianforte.A May poll that a Democratic super PAC commissioned has Quist trailing Gianforte by 6 points, compared with an April survey showing him down some 15 points. After initially ignoring the race, the national Democratic Party has taken a greater interest in the past few weeks, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tripling its investment to $600,000 this month.The Republican Party is apparently also taking Quist seriously. President Donald Trump’s eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., returned to Montana last week to campaign for Gianforte a second time, and Vice President Mike Pence stumped for him last Friday. Apparently the high-profile visits were not enough to stem Quist’s momentum. On Tuesday, influential conservative writer Erick Erickson tweeted that internal Republican polls show Quist made gains in the race over the weekend.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whom Quist backed in the 2016 presidential primary, is speaking at events for Quist in Missoula, Butte and Billings on Saturday and in Bozeman on Sunday. Quist’s campaign had to move the Missoula rally to the 7,500-capacity Adams Center arena because of the high level of interest in attending.The story has been updated with the CBO’s announcement that it will soon release new estimates for the American Health Care Act."

There have been 40,000 confirmed Zika cases among residents. All of this could also affect travelers to the island. Little information is coming from Puerto Rico, which could give tourists a misplaced sense of security about the Zika risk there. A JAMA pediatrics study published in October 2016 predicted that Puerto Rico would see 110 to 290 Zika-related microcephaly cases between mid-2016 and mid-2017. Microcephaly is a severe birth defect connected to developmental disabilities and babies being born with smaller-than-average heads.But at last count, Puerto Rican officials had only reported 16 babies born with microcephaly, a staggeringly low figure considering the island has had 3,200 confirmed Zika cases in pregnant women since the beginning of the outbreak. These numbers don’t add up, according to some health officials who talked to health news site Stat under the condition of anonymity. They said Puerto Rico might be underreporting its Zika problem for tourism reasons.The U.S. isn’t keeping track of Zika in Puerto Rico. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn’t reporting adverse pregnancy outcomes for U.S. territories ― and according to the agency website, Puerto Rico is using different criteria to report Zika-related birth defects than the United States is. It’s also possible that mothers of babies born with birth defects may be unwilling to talk about it publicly. There’s a strong stigma surrounding Zika virus, Dr. Carmen Zorrilla, who runs the Maternal Infant Studies Center at the University of Puerto Rico hospital, told NPR. “You have pregnant women with a viral disease that may cause birth defects, which is serious,” Zorrilla said. “And then you’re blaming them for getting it.”The U.S. had more than 5,200 reported Zika cases as of May 17, including 218 local mosquito-born transmissions in Florida and six such transmissions in Texas, according to the CDC. There have been 1,845 cases of Zika in pregnant women in the U.S., 64 babies born with Zika-related birth defects and eight cases of Zika-related pregnancy loss.The CDC awarded Puerto Rico’s health department $9.5 million to set up a Zika tracking system for pregnant women and to identify Zika-affected infants and fetuses. But a deep rift between the CDC and Puerto Rican heath officials means the two groups aren’t collaborating, Stat reports. It’s not clear how long it will take for up-to-date, accurate information about Zika and microcephaly in Puerto Rico to come to light.“I see pregnant women every day,” Zorrilla told Stat. “What am I to tell them?”This reporting is brought to you by HuffPost’s health and science platform, The Scope.

His world revolved around his family first and of course, his music, second.”“He flew home for Mother’s Day to spend time with our family,” she continued. “He flew out mid-day Wednesday, the day of the show, after spending time with the children. When we spoke before the show, we discussed plans for a vacation over Memorial Day and other things we wanted to do.”But when the pair spoke on the phone after his show Wednesday at the Fox Theater in Detroit, she noticed something was off about the singer ― something fans at the show later said they noticed too. “He was slurring his words; he was different,” Vicky said. “When he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him.”Security eventually forced open the door of Chris’ hotel room at the MGM Grand Casino, where they found him unreponsive on the floor of the bathroom Cornell. A medical examiner later determined that the singer’s cause of death was “suicide by hanging.”“What happened is inexplicable and I am hopeful that further medical reports will provide additional details. I know that he loved our children and he would not hurt them by intentionally taking his own life,” Vicky said. Cornell family attorney Kirk Pasich said in a separate statement Friday that they believe the extra Ativan, which can lead to suicidal thoughts, potentially caused Cornell to take his life.“Without the results of toxicology tests, we do not know what was going on with Chris — or if any substances contributed to his demise,” Pasich said.

9,POLITICS,Trump's On The Verge Of Exploding The Health Insurance Market,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-blow-up-health-insurance-market_us_591f541be4b034684b0c6212,The government owes money to insurance companies. Trump reportedly doesn't want to pay.,2017-05-19,President Donald Trump has been threatening to kill cost-sharing reduction payments for months.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f55011400004c0905c1b8.jpeg?cache=knXm6QizL3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump has had his finger on the detonator of the bomb to blow up Obamacare for months. Now he may be about to press it.Trump told advisers earlier this week that he wants to cut off billions of dollars in payments to health insurance companies that serve the poorest enrollees in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, Politico reported Friday. If Trump follows through on this threat, he could wreak havoc on the health insurance system. Insurance companies are likely to hike premiums or to stop selling to people who buy coverage via the exchanges, like HealthCare.gov and Covered California, or directly (rather than obtaining coverage through their employers or government programs like Medicare and Medicaid).The results would be higher prices and fewer, if any, choices for consumers, and the effects could be felt quickly because many states would allow insurers to drop their customers right away in the absence of these payments. In short, this part of the health insurance market could fall apart under Trump’s watch if he doesn’t pay the money the federal government owes.At issue are what’s called cost-sharing reduction payments ― these are essentially reimbursements to health insurance companies, which are required to reduce out-of-pocket costs like deductibles and copayments for low-income customers. A pending lawsuit brought by House Republicans against the Obama administration in 2014 has challenged the legality of these CSR payments.“The White House has told Congress that it will make the May CSR, but has not made any commitment on further payments. No final decisions have been made at this time, and all options are on the table,” a White House official wrote Friday in an email to HuffPost.The White House’s caginess about these payments has driven health care and business groups to seek relief from the legislative branch.“We urge Congress to take action now to guarantee a steady stream of CSR funding through 2018. Such action would represent a strong, positive step for all consumers who buy their own insurance by eliminating the single most destabilizing factor causing double-digit premium increases for 2018,” reads a letter sent to Senate leaders on Friday from a coalition including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America’s Health Insurance Plans, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other health care, business and patient advocacy groups. “At this point, only Congressional action can help consumers.”Health insurance companies, state regulators, governors and congressional Democrats have been on edge about the exchange markets since Trump said during a pre-inauguration press conference in January that “the easiest thing would be to let it implode in ’17 and believe me, we’d get pretty much whatever we wanted.”Trump has made similar comments many times since becoming president, including during an interview with the Economist this month. “We’re subsidizing it and we don’t have to subsidize it. You know if I ever stop wanting to pay the subsidies, which I will,” he told the Economist. Trump has also inaccurately referred to this money as a “bailout” of the insurance industry, rather than as a reimbursement of money the government owes insurers.According to the Los Angeles Times, a senior Trump health official told insurers that the administration would promise to make these payments if the industry backed the health care bill the House passed last month ― a quid pro quo offer that the administration denies.To Trump’s thinking, dealing this major blow to Obamacare could force Democrats to the negotiating table over repeal of the entire Affordable Care Act. Congressional Democrats have loudly rejected that idea.What’s more, 60 percent of Americans don’t approve of negotiating tactics that disrupt insurance markets, according to an April survey by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Nearly three-fourths think Trump should work to keep the Affordable Care Act running while Congress considers a new health care law, and almost two-thirds ― including a majority of Republicans ― believe Trump and the GOP are responsible for any future problems with Obamacare.Yet Trump, against the advice of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and others, still favors cutting off the cost-sharing payments, Politico reported.And the Trump administration could make its intentions known in mere days.The Obama administration had appealed a trial court judge’s ruling in favor of House Republicans’ claims that the federal government is unlawfully making those payments without an explicit congressional appropriation. In the meantime, the judge allowed the Obama and then Trump administrations to continue reimbursing insurers.The appeals court has granted delays in the case this year as the Trump administration pondered what to do. But now the two parties face a deadline of Monday to update the court on their plans.Congress could resolve the issue at any time by simply appropriating the funding, but it hasn’t.Exchange enrollees earning up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level ― which amounts to $30,015 for a single person ― are eligible for cost reductions, which can transform deductibles of thousands of dollars into just hundreds of dollars for the consumer. The Affordable Care Act mandates that insurers pay the cost difference to medical providers and subsequently get paid back by the federal government themselves. More than 7 million people ― 58 percent of exchange enrollees ― received the subsidies this year.The cost-sharing reduction payments are crucial to the finances of insurance companies. Without this money, insurers would raise premiums by an average of 19 percent next year, on top of whatever the increases otherwise would have been, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated. Early rate filings in several states are consistent with those projections, which some insurers citing uncertainty about the cost-sharing reduction payments as a reason they’re asking for higher premiums next year.During his early months in office, Trump has gone out of his way to raise insurance companies’ concerns about whether they would ever get their money. The consequence has been heightened confusion and worry in the health insurance industry, as state officials complain they can’t get straight answers from the Trump administration.The White House threatened to cut off the money during negotiations with Congress over a spending bill in April, but relented. Still, Trump has never stopped talking about it, to the consternation of the health care industry and state officials.In letters delivered Wednesday, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state officials from both political parties, urged Senate leaders and the White House Office of Management and Budget to make sure the money doesn’t stop flowing. The bipartisan National Governors Association asked Congress to address the cost-sharing reduction payments last month.“The time to act is now,” Wisconsin insurance commissioner Theodore Nickel and Tennessee insurance commissioner Julie Mix McPeak wrote Wednesday on behalf of the insurance commissioners group to OMB Director Mick Mulvaney. It was Mulvaney who issued the April threat to halt the payments.“Carriers are currently developing their rates for 2018 and making the decision whether to participate on the exchanges, or even off the exchanges, in 2018. Assurances from the administration that the cost-sharing reduction payments will continue under current law will go a long way toward stabilizing the individual markets in our states while legislative replacement and reform options are debated in Congress,” Nickel and McPeak wrote.Trump, as the Politico report indicates, doesn’t seem inclined to provide those assurances or to take any steps to manage the insurance markets that his government is responsible for overseeing.Sam Stein contributed reporting."

A new story in People Magazine about the Obamas’ lives since leaving the White House offers revelations about the former president’s seemingly recent passion for fashion, including one of his more buzzed about staples: The brown leather jacket. As it turns out, there’s nothing new about it at all. “He’s had that jacket for quite some time,” Anita Decker Breckinridge, Obama’s chief of staff told the mag. “He really likes that jacket. People think he looks good in the jacket. He’s had it for a long time. I just don’t think he’s had the opportunity to wear it. When does the President ever get to go out in his leather jacket? It’s not something we see.”It’s true that Obama has really taken the bull by the well-dressed horns in the past few months, whether in bomber jackets or unbuttoned shirts. But with this new development, we can’t help but picture the former president staring longingly at the jacket during his tenure in office, waiting for the glorious day he’d get to wear it freely while still looking like (and being) a total boss.

As CBS Corp. CEO Leslie Moonves explained to a skeptical reporter, “the best pilots win at the end of the day.”Apparently, executives at the network were having trouble finding quality shows that spotlight characters who aren’t majority white men. If that’s the case, some state legislators might soon be able to lend them a hand.Lawmakers in New York are moving forward with a bill that would encourage TV production in the state to hire women and minority writers and directors in order to “enhance the diversity of stories and casts.” Behind-the-scenes hires can have a big effect: Research has shown that hiring more women and minorities in such roles affects diversity in the end product on screens everywhere. And on-screen representation is good for everyone.Many states, including California, Illinois and Georgia, have tax credit programs aimed to encourage film industry production for jobs and tourism. Most of “The Walking Dead,” for example, is shot in Georgia. “The Americans,” despite being set in Washington, D.C., shoots in New York City. Hundreds of writers, including Tina Fey and members of the Writers Guild of America, have written in support of the New York bill, Deadline reported earlier this month. (HuffPost is unionized under the auspices of the WGA-East, a sister organization of the WGA-West.) Sponsored by Sen. Marisol Alcantara and assembly member Marcos Crespo, the measure would earmark $5 million of its $420 million program to pay the salaries of women and minority writers and directors on TV shows. The hope is that by targeting TV shows, produced more quickly and in greater number, the bill will have a larger impact.“As an Afro-Latina immigrant, I knew what it felt like to grow up feeling invisible in American culture,” Alcantara told HuffPost. “It was so rare to see a character of color on television, and when you did see one, it felt like they were tokenized, stereotyped or killed off quickly. I think the overall quality of television, the different kinds of stories that can be told, the overall landscape of the art form will benefit greatly from having opportunities for diverse people to tell their stories, which I believe this legislation will provide.” If passed, effectiveness of the diversity provisions would remain to be seen. To professor Darnell Hunt, director of the UCLA’s Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, legal measures are “an important tool in the toolbox” to increase on-screen diversity. But they may not go far enough.“It strikes me as maybe a bit too little. I think maybe they could set aside a little more, when it’s such a huge problem in the industry,” Hunt said about the lack of on-screen representation, adding, “given how these tax credit programs are proven to work.”Despite the uncertain impact, other legislators are also thinking about what they can do to help.Some lawmakers in California, where a $330 million tax credit program aims to keep production in the film industry’s homeland, are mulling additions similar to the ones gaining steam on the opposite coast. Back in February, state assembly members Sebastian Ridley-Thomas and Kensan Chu held a hearing aimed to determine whether adding diversity provisions to the program would actually affect diversity ― both behind the camera and in front of it. Such measures are still under consideration. Other states are focused on diversity in film crews and other non-creator roles, although the influence of those guidelines on what we see on screen would be much smaller. In Georgia, once likened to the Hollywood of the South, a state representative held a hearing last November to consider adding provisions aimed at diversity, while Illinois already holds a diversity requirement in its state film tax credit program. Applicants there must submit paperwork proving diversity in production crews and production office hires. New York’s bill has a long road ahead of it: After its introduced in the state’s senate and assembly, it needs to pass there before finally landing on the desk of Gov. Andrew Cuomo. But with a record number of shows filmed there, nudging studios toward greater inclusion could give CBS ― and others ― more top-notch options next time around.Welcome to Battleground, where art and activism meet."

But a new report from the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics has uncovered just how many critical nutrients we’re discarding with our trash. What’s particularly concerning is that these are the very nutrients most Americans ― both rich and poor ― aren’t getting enough of.“Wasted food in the U.S. contains a staggering amount of nutrients, especially nutrients that we tend to under-consume,” Marie Spiker, one of the study’s authors, said in a video released alongside the report.In 2012, the amount of food Americans discarded was enough to provide 2,000 calories a day to 84 percent of the country’s adult population, according to the report. That same year, 15.9 percent of Americans struggled to buy food at times, per the Department of Agriculture. On top of this problem, the new report finds, Americans aren’t getting the recommended intake of certain nutrients including dietary fiber, calcium, potassium, and vitamins A, C, D, and E.“Some of the most important foods for people to eat are relatively low in calories,” Roni Neff, another author of the report, added. “Looking at items like vitamin D or fiber really help get a picture of the foods that we need to consume more of that are going right into the landfill.”The authors of the report analyzed two data sets from the USDA to calculate the nutritional value of food waste at retail and consumer levels in 2012.Here’s what they noticed about fiber, for example: The recommended daily fiber intake for a woman is 25 grams, yet women in America consume just 8.9 grams; meanwhile, the country squanders vast quantities of fiber-rich foods, enough to feed 74 million women their daily recommended amount of the nutrient.One of the main reasons tons of healthful foods end up in landfills is because they’re not considered pretty enough to sell.

Any of those descriptions would make it difficult to win a U.S. Senate special election in Alabama. Combine them all, you have Michael Hansen, and he intends to do just that.In a field of 19 seeking the seat, Hansen is one of eight Democrats running for that party’s nomination. When asked how he, in a GOP controlled state, would stand out in such a large group Hansen said that his experience in working with government bodies on drafting different pieces of legislations and ordinances gave him an inside look at how to get things done.He also pointed to the lack of trustworthy leadership within the state recently “We’ve had our share of corrupt politicians here, especially lately.” Referring to the recent scandal and resignation of Gov. Robert Bentley, and corruption conviction of Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard who has sentenced to prison. It also includes Chief Justice Roy Moore’s suspension for ordering State Judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. “I think people are sick and tired of that sort of business as usual, shady politics and corruption,” adding “my record of integrity is pretty impeccable.”Hansen is well aware of the uphill battle he is facing in the state, especially with conservative evangelicals who make up a huge portion of the voters in Alabama. “I grew up in Memphis Tennessee, in a conservative, Republican, Christian, Southern Baptist home,” he said, “that was my life, I thought I was going to end up in the ministry. So I understand the Christian faith.” He continued “What I know though, there are gay kids in those homes all over the state.” He said while many of them don’t have it easy, a large number of them do have families who love and accept them and once it involves someone in their family people are much more likely to be receptive. “I’m optimistic that if people get to know me, they will be willing to have a conversation.”His group, GASP, is an Alabama-based non-profit whose mission is to reduce air pollution focused on major sources of pollution like power plants and other large industry. Speaking about his environmental stance in a state that has a significant history in coal production Hansen said, “The reality is everyone has to breath clean air, has to have clean water to drink a safe place to live and make sure the food they eat isn’t going to poison them.” He added, “That is a universal thing; I don’t think that is a liberal thing,” and “it’s not contrary to conservative values to talk about taking care of our planet.”Commenting directly about those currently employed in the industry in his state “I’m a big fan of coal miners,” he said, “I think they do wonderful work that is a real sacrifice.” He then noted, “But the reality is we are moving away from coal, and we have to take care of the people who have made that sacrifice.” He went on to say that you can talk about the environmental impact and support those communities at the same time.Hansen says that a face to face showdown with Ten Commandments Judge Roy Moore would be his dream matchup this fall. “I want to be all about empathy and kindness,” something he says is lacking in our culture, “Roy Moore is the opposite of all that.” Saying that Moore’s brand of vitriol is the kind of rhetoric that makes gay kids hate themselves. “That’s what I want to fight against, the perception that that is all Alabama is.” He wants to be face to face with Moore to say “We’re here, we’re not going anywhere, and we’re people too.” He said Roy Moore in his opinion does not represent conservatism or Christian values at all. Continuing to say that “If people have a problem with that, I would say, It’s 2017 let’s get on with it, and let’s talk about policy.”On illegal immigration and its impact on the state, particularly in agriculture, he said, “Immigrants are an important part of not just our nation’s history but our current system.” Saying we need to make sure we are treating immigrants well, “Like humans and not like slaves.” Pointing to the passage in 2011 of HB56, an anti-immigrant law in Alabama, Hansen said that farmers in his state ended up suffering because of a lack of labor to help bring in their crops. He wants to work toward comprehensive immigration reform and paths to citizenship. “Not building a wall and deporting millions of people.” which he called both inhumane and an absurd waste of money.To many, the biggest hurdle he has to come is his party affiliation. In Alabama, the GOP controls all of the statewide offices and all but one of its current nine delegation members in Washington is Republican. When asked how he would overcome that kind of obstacle Hansen said in Alabama “There’s an opportunity because of the corruption on the Republican side of the aisle that people are fed up with.” He continued “Donald Trump is doing everything he can to make it easier for us.” But mainly he said that his understanding of struggle in the working class blue-collar communities like he grew up in would help his message reach those voters. “I get it, I’ve worked three jobs before and had to make a choice between prescriptions and groceries.”Speaking about his party’s recent history in the state he said, “Not just me, but Democrats have to talk to people and listen to their concerns,” and his party needed to, “tailor their policies to the things that impact people’s lives, not just the left vs. right policy making.” Emphasizing a need to make sure that people have their basic needs met and they have a chance at a good life. A message that he believes will resonate with voters in the state. “I don’t think we have enough listening.”As an Alabama native myself, I can understand the skepticism many have about his candidacy. It, however, isn’t unheard of for an openly gay candidate to win there. Patricia Todd was elected to the Alabama House in 2006 as the first openly gay candidate in the history of the state and has been reelected twice.Michael Hansen isn’t going in blind here, and he knows the difficulties he will encounter in filling the seat formerly held by current Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Knowing that, Hansen’s campaign may just be the breath of fresh air Alabama, and indeed the nation, desperately needs.Photo Credit: Michael Hansen for Alabama Facebook Page"

Lopez Rivera spent part of his boyhood in the neighborhood.On Thursday, Rivera, 74, was given a hero’s welcome in Chicago, just one day after he was released from house arrest in San Juan, where he served out the remainder of his time after former President Barack Obama commuted his 55-year sentence in January. Thursday’s events included a march down the Paseo Boricua accompanied by Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) and other Latino politicians in Chicago, bands, a flotilla and a reception in the park. Some of Lopez Rivera’s older supporters thought neither they nor Rivera would live to see him walk free. Others, like Moses Cintron, 68, simply felt relief after supporting Lopez Rivera for at least 20 years.Cintron and his wife, Lourdes, drove in from Cleveland to see Lopez Rivera, whom he had visited several times while Lopez Rivera was in federal prison in Indiana. He carried with him a picture of an old pickup truck that he had emblazoned with messages of support for Lopez Rivera. His current truck simply says “Free Oscar” on the sides. “Those letters have been on my pickup the last five years,” Cintron said. Rivera was sentenced in 1981 for his involvement with pro-Puerto Rican independence militant group Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN (and was later sentenced to an additional 15 years for allegedly plotting an escape).The group was linked to more than 100 bombings that injured dozens and killed five in cities like Chicago and New York. Though Lopez Rivera was never directly linked to specific bombings, he was convicted on multiple charges that included seditious conspiracy, or plotting to overthrow the U.S. government. President Bill Clinton offered Lopez Rivera and other FALN members clemency in 1999, but Lopez Rivera rejected it because it would not include all of the imprisoned associates. Even with the Obama commutation, Lopez Rivera was one of the longest-serving political prisoners in the world. He received support for his pardon from high-profile figures like Pope Francis, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda.Some, like Cappy Kidd of Chicago, thought Lopez Rivera’s sentence was unfairly harsh.“They kept him in prison all these years because he wouldn’t give up his support,” Kidd said. But others, notably family members of the victims who were injured or killed in the FALN bombings, have been outraged not only by Obama’s clemency move, but also by the intense support of Lopez Rivera, whom they regard as a terrorist.Joe Connor, whose father, Frank, was killed in the 1975 bombing at the historic Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan, spoke to NPR in January after Lopez Rivera’s commutation was announced. “I’m hearing he’s a freedom fighter. He’s done all these things. He’s not violent. But what did he do if not being a terrorist?” Connor said. “There’s no answer to it because he was a terrorist.”Connor, who was just 9 when his father was killed, was similarly furious over the move by Humboldt Park’s Puerto Rican alderman, Roberto Maldonado, to grant Lopez Rivera an honorary street sign in the neighborhood. Connor told the Chicago Sun-Times in February that the designation was “a direct insult to my father’s life.” Melissa Duprey, a 32-year-old from Chicago, views Lopez Rivera as an important example for young people, reminding them to organize and work for the change they want to see in their communities.Duprey was more skeptical of the politicians who came out for his homecoming, and assessed their motives as opportunistic and ultimately undedicated to Lopez Rivera’s ideals.For Veronica Tirado, a 25-year-old who recently moved to Chicago from Puerto Rico, Lopez Rivera remains an inspiring and potent symbol for young people on the island ― to which Lopez Rivera eventually plans to return ― and in the U.S. “His work teaches me that we as a diaspora can make change,” Tirado said. On the island, Tirado said, university students and teachers have been fighting the severe austerity measures that have chopped education budgets. Lopez Rivera, she said, remains relevant because “he still gives us hope.” "

This contract increase comes just two months after the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) released a damning report on its unannounced inspection of Theo Lacy. Mysteriously, OIG’s report was immediately removed from the government’s website after the May 9th vote.In the report, which now can be read on Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC)’s website, OIG found that Theo Lacy Facility was not complying with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s safe food handling guidelines, resulting in people in immigration detention being served spoiled meat. Theo Lacy Facility also was not complying with ICE’s Performance Based National Detention Standards, resulting in people being wrongfully held in a form of solitary confinement for long periods of time. OIG offered a number of recommendations in its report, but there is no evidence that the Orange County Sheriff’s Department or ICE have implemented these recommendations. In fact, CIVIC continues to document people in immigration detention at Theo Lacy being improperly placed in disciplinary segregation units that violate ICE’s standards. We also continue to hear stories from people currently detained at Theo Lacy about spoiled food.Perhaps even more alarming, CIVIC has documented multiple instances of physical abuse of people in immigration detention by the Orange County Sheriff’s Department (OCSD). As recent as this month, we have received complaints from people in immigration detention in Orange County who have been physically and verbally abused by OCSD. The decision by the Orange County Board of Supervisors to increase the contract with ICE is irresponsible. It is past time to end immigration detention in Orange County, California. "

Each of these locations have important diplomatic implications for America’s standing in the world, as well as political relevance for Trump’s waning popularity in America. Whether intentionally or not, this trip has huge interfaith significance as Trump makes a pilgrimage (of sorts) to the centers of Catholic, Jewish, and Muslim faiths.Trump’s international sojourn is making many nervous as it is one thing to provoke a nation state — say Mexico, with derogatory comments and threats — it is quite another to provoke a religion. Imam Sohaib Sultan of Princeton University feels that Trump’s negative rhetoric about Islam, up to this point, does not give him the credibility to speak to the Muslim world:The framing of the address may be at the root of the problem. Trump’s team has said this is a forthright speech about radical ideology in Islam and, according to National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, will be “inspiring yet direct.” Yet, this basic approach is the problem according to Imam Sultan:"
20,POLITICS,It’s Not Over: The FEC Is On The Job With Messy 2016 Reporting By Trump Campaign And JFCs,"OpenSecrets Blog, ContributorPublished by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics an...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-not-over-the-fec-is-on-the-job-with-messy-2016_us_591f6989e4b07617ae4cbc05,by Viveca Novak We’ll stipulate that President Trump’s problems with the Federal Election Commission don’t rise to the highest,2017-05-19,"<p> President Trump may be more concerned about Special Counsel Robert Mueller digging around, but the FEC’s on his case too. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591f69c11400002a0005c216.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Viveca Novak We’ll stipulate that President Trump’s problems with the Federal Election Commission don’t rise to the highest tier of his concerns these days, not by a long shot. In his hierarchy of hazards, newly appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller must loom rather large, while he might think of the FEC staff as a lowly mosquito — if he thinks of it at all.Much like the mosquito, though, the agency’s Reports Analysis Division finds any vulnerabilities, and is very hard to get rid of.Illegal corporate contributions, donations over the $2,700-per-election limit, anonymous gifts, double-counting, totals that should match but don’t. FEC analysts have kept the questions coming in a steady flow of letters to Brad Crate, treasurer of the campaign and of two joint fundraising committees (JFCs) Trump formed, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and Trump Victory.More than six months after the election, the campaign and the JFCs are still answering questions from the agency, filing amended reports and making refunds.Take the campaign’s September monthly report, covering Aug. 1-31, 2016. It has gone through four iterations. The first version, filed by the Sept. 20 deadline, was 25,625 pages long. But when it was amended for the first time — eight days after the election, and after an FEC request for more information — it came it at more than twice that length. The original report had failed to correctly identify hundreds of contributions that were routed to the campaign through the two JFCs.Many of those contributions were illegal — for instance, they were made by LLCs that were ineligible to donate to candidates or parties. The same report was amended twice more, including this week, about nine months after the donations came in.In fact, a week ago (May 12), the Trump campaign filed more than 189,000 pages of amended FEC reports — five reports in all, covering the months of July and September and including the post-general (Oct. 20-Nov. 28) and year-end (Nov. 29-Dec.31) periods.That included fixes prompted by a 53-page list sent by the FEC in April of possibly “excessive, prohibited and impermissible” contributions in his 2016 year-end report.Trump’s original filing for the month of September was 11,764 pages. Its amended report, issued after another lengthy missive from the FEC? 16,951 pages.The campaign and JFCs had vetting systems in place to screen contributions and make sure they were legal, according to responses Crates sent to the FEC. But experts say that while it’s normal for some questionable donations to slip through the cracks, Trump’s operation was like a sieve, only leakier.“It appears they didn’t try to fix [the reports] until they started getting letters from the FEC,” said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at Akerman LLP.Kappel noted that the Trump committee reported barely any debt throughout the campaign — but after Election Day, began soliciting contributions for “debt retirement.”Then, as soon as he was inaugurated, Trump formally filed to run for re-election in the 2020 election. His campaign committee’s next report redesignated tens of thousands of donations that had been given for debt retirement for the 2020 race instead — after a complaint had been filed by a watchdog group.Other problems: One donor was allowed to contribute a total of $18,400 for Trump’s general election campaign over several months. The limit is $2,700. In March, the campaign admitted that it counted the same contributions from 14 different donors three times.And we’ve previously reported on a 253-page letter the agency sent Trump’s campaign in January questioning large numbers of contributions on its post-general (Oct. 20-Nov. 28) report, as well as missives sent to his joint fundraising committees around the same time saying the committee had accepted anonymous contributions over the $50 limit for such gifts.Let’s not even get started on Trump’s inaugural committee; its FEC filing was shot through with mysterious and incorrect information, as we, Huffington Post and others discovered. The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the agency about the report, saying the inaugural committee had shown “reckless disregard” for the law.The errors in that report were “obvious and avoidable,” noted the Campaign Legal Center’s Brendan Fischer. “It appears they didn’t engage in even the minimal level of diligence.” Overall, Fischer said, the campaign finance reports filed by the Trump network have contained “an exceptional number of errors.”Other FEC letters to Make America Great Again, the JFC, have questioned the accuracy of year-to-date total contributions it listed for individual donors and pointed out that it appeared to be accepting contributions from foreign nationals, which the group only refunded in April.Kappel noted that he campaign’s reporting problems appeared to begin around the time the JFCs started up in mid-2016 and began allocating some of the funds they raised to the campaign, apparently without proper controls. Make America Great Again “is one of the worst JFCs I’ve seen, if not the worst,” in terms of reporting deficiencies, he said.It’s not that Trump didn’t have people knowledgeable about the nuts and bolts of campaign finance law around him. Crate, who had been CFO of 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s campaign, was treasurer of the Trump campaign and both JFCs; he runs a company that specializes in this kind of work. And the campaign’s general counsel was former FEC Chairman Don McGahn; he is now White House counsel.Crate did not return our call requesting comment.The degree to which this all will affect Trump’s totals and those of the JFCs isn’t yet clear, since more amendments are due to be filed. In December, in response to a number of FEC letters, the campaign refunded more than $725,000 in illegal contributions.But in any case, Trump apparently had enough money to win, even though he raised less than other recent major-party candidates and put less of his own money into his campaign than he’d promised. In no small part, his victory was due to all the free attention he received from TV news and the like that one company valued at more than $6 billion.Besides the mysterious degree of sloppiness shown by Trump’s operation in its FEC filings, there’s another lesson in the tussle between his organizations and the FEC: Whatever we and others may say about the FEC’s general failure to operate as a campaign finance enforcement agency (and there’s a heap of evidence for that argument), its Reports Analysis Division — which reviews every report that comes in the door and follows up with detailed questions about things that don’t look right — is definitely on the job."

A white Ford F-150 with five people inside pulled up next to him and the passengers started throwing beer cans at his car, authorities said.Khalsa drove off and called 911, but the truck followed him. When he stopped at another red light, Chase Little, 31, and Colton Leblanc, 25, got out of the truck, approached Khalsa’s car, and repeatedly punched his face through his open window.Khalsa pleaded with his attackers, he recalled in Thursday’s hearing, saying: “There is a misunderstanding; I am your brother.”Little and Leblanc didn’t back off, though, and continued to punch Khalsa, knocking off his turban and cutting some of his hair. Like many Sikh men, Khalsa wears a turban on top of his unshorn hair as a symbol of his faith.“Cutting a Sikh’s hair is one of the most humiliating things anyone can do to a Sikh,” Khalsa said during the hearing. “By cutting my hair, the attackers did not just attack my body; they attacked my dignity, my spirit, my faith, my religion and my entire community.”Khalsa’s right pinky was also stabbed during the attack and later had to be amputated due to an infection.When the light turned green, he drove to a gas station and waited for emergency responders. In his statement, Khalsa said he has suffered both physical and psychological effects. The loss of his finger has affected his ability to type, lift objects and rock climb with his daughter, he said. He added that he has experienced depression, anxiety and fear of strangers in the wake of the attack. Little and Leblanc did not contest the charges of felony assault and committing a hate crime. “The attack upon Mr. Khalsa based upon his perceived religion and identity is an attack upon us all,” said Contra Costa County Deputy District Attorney, Simon O’Connell, in a statement. “As a community we must do better and it is my hope that today’s sentence moves us further in that direction.”Hate crimes against Sikhs spiked after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and continue to affect the Sikh American community. Many Sikh men wear turbans and grow out their beards as a symbol of their commitment to their faith, and they are often mistaken to be Muslim and targeted in xenophobic attacks.In March, a Sikh man was shot in the arm in Kent, Washington after the attacker told him to “go back to your own country.” Last year, two men were arrested for allegedly beating and running over a 68-year-old Sikh man with a car.According to a 2015 report by The Sikh Coalition, roughly 67 percent of turbaned Sikh youth in Massachusetts, Indiana, Washington, and California say they’ve been bullied.Sikh Coalition staff attorney Pawanpreet Kaur responded to Thursday’s sentencing, saying: “Acknowledging that this bias-based attack is a hate crime under state law both recognizes the deep dignitary harm to Mr. Khalsa, and ensures that we, as a society, confront the problems of Islamophobia, racism and xenophobia that make the Sikh community a target for violence.In his final remarks, directed to Little and Leblanc, Khalsa said: “I hope that you will learn about me and my community and one day consider me you brother too.”"

Maybe you remember Bubbles? Here’s a refresher course.Jackson adopted the young chimp in 1983. By the late ‘80s, Bubbles was wearing diapers, traveling with Jackson on tours, sitting in on recording sessions and sleeping in a crib at Neverland Ranch. It was once rumored that Bubbles would serve as ring bearer at Elizabeth Taylor’s 1991 wedding, held at Jackson’s home, but Taylor’s spokeswoman denied it. Contributing to Jackson’s media mockery, the chimp’s presence helped to cement the singer’s lingering Peter Pan persona. In the early 2000s, Bubbles had become an aggressive adult, as apes are wont to do, and he was relocated to an animal sanctuary. Now, back to the news: The movie is a stop-motion coming-of-age story called, well, “Bubbles.” The script, written by Isaac Adamson, topped the 2015 Black List, an annual ranking of admired screenplays up for grabs. In a bidding war with Hollywood studios, Netflix bought the rights for a hefty sum nearing $20 million, according to Deadline. (HuffPost asked a Netflix rep to confirm that figure, but we didn’t immediately receive a reply.)Taika Waititi, best known for “Thor: Ragnarok” and “Hunt for the Wilderpeople”, and Mark Gufaston, who supervised the animation on “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” will co-direct “Bubbles.” Waititi and Gufaston’s clout lends the project a credibility that, say, Lifetime’s seemingly exploitative Jackson biopic cannot claim. The stop-motion aspect of “Bubbles” is another mark in its favor, primarily because the project can avoid the controversy that’s inevitable when selecting an actor to portray Jackson. Things didn’t go well earlier this year when footage showed Joseph Fiennes playing the singer in the British comedy series “Urban Myths.” The European network Sky yanked the episode after Jackson’s family called Fiennes’ casting “shameful.” “It’s an idea that fascinates me and one I want to develop further,” Waititi reportedly said in February, upon first signing on to direct the movie. “Most people know I’m a huge Michael Jackson fan, so the main thing for me is to make sure it’s respectful of him and his legacy. I’m not interested in making a biopic; I want to focus on telling a story that blends fact and fantasy, about an animal trying to make sense of the world.”No release date has been announced.――― UPDATE: A Netflix rep responded to say the news is “not confirmed at this time,” which implies it will be confirmed in the near future."

Brown) biological father, William Hill, on the first season of NBC’s breakout hit “This Is Us.”Warning! Spoilers below.After spending the season reconnecting with his grown son ― who was adopted by Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) as a baby ― William lost his battle to cancer on the Episode 16 of the show, titled “Memphis.” The whole episode was a tear-jerker, and a reminder to cherish the ones you love. But although William is no longer alive in the series, Cephas Jones confirmed to HuffPost during a Build Series interview that his character will be back in flashback scenes, which the show is known for. “I would come in each day in the dressing room and I would open the script going, ‘Is this the day that they’re going to kill him?!’ And it was so hard. I could imagine William feeling the same way ― waking up each day not knowing if it’s going to be your last day,” Cephas Jones said, adding, “As the actor in Ron, I didn’t want to leave. I wanted to stay a part of the show and stay a part of the family that we’ve created there. And lo and behold, that happened. That’s the next thing for Season 2.”According to the actor, the writers and creator Dan Fogelman will create a “really beautiful” storyline for William next season. “It’s similar to Jack’s character ― you already know that he’s died but we see his whole life throughout the season. So now, Season 2 will go back and fill in those spaces and those questions people have about William ― with his relationship with Jessie (Denis O’Hare) or how did he become a musician or how did he get from Memphis to Philadelphia?” Cephas Jones explained. “What and how and where they’re going to write, I have no idea, but I’m just really blessed and happy that I’ll be back for Season 2.”Cephas Jones said the cast is usually kept in the dark about storylines until table reads, where they freak out flipping through page after page.“We’re reading along going, ‘Oh, s**t! Oh, f**k! Oh my f**king God!’ And we’re laughing and we’re looking at each other going, ‘Oh no!’” he joked. “It’s definitely a page-turner and exciting and a lot of fun.”We can’t wait to see where Season 2 takes us. (Probably on another emotional roller-coaster, duh.)Watch the full interview with Ron Cephas Jones on Build below. "

Fueled by a freakishly warm Arctic, last month was the second-warmest April in 137 years, NASA said this week. This follows news that March and February were the second-warmest temperatures for those months respectively on record.Temperatures this year may be falling slightly short of the sky-high numbers of 2016 ― which was the hottest year in recorded history, propelled by the powerful El Niño. But the continuing heat is still causing climate scientists concern.That’s because monthly or yearly temperature anomalies aren’t typically worrisome to scientists; it’s climatic trends seen over decades or centuries that arouse alarm. And looking at the past 20 years, experts say the pattern is clear.Of the 17 hottest years on record, all except one has occurred in the 21st century, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (the exception was 1998, a very strong El Niño year). The top five hottest years on record have all occurred since 2010.And scientists expect this hot trend to continue. Though 2017 will likely see a slight dip in temperatures compared to last year, it will still probably rank among the hottest years in recorded history, according to Climate Central. And scientists say they don’t expect the heat to taper off anytime soon. Because of global warming, “each new year is basically predestined to be among the warmest on record,” Deke Arndt, chief of the monitoring branch of the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information, told Climate Central in December.Overwhelming scientific consensus says human activity, specifically the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is fueling global warming and its impacts, including rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather events and extinction. Last month, Hawaii’s Mauna Loa Observatory recorded its first carbon dioxide reading above 410 parts per million. It’s the first time in about 3 million years that the Earth’s atmosphere has had such high levels of CO2. U.S. President Donald Trump has called global warming a “hoax.” His choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has said CO2 should not be blamed for climate change. "
25,POLITICS,Trump Administration Notifies Congress About NAFTA Renegotiation,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-congress-notice-nafta_us_591dc01ce4b03b485caf70b0,The president must give a 90-day notice before opening talks on the mammoth trade deal.,2017-05-18,U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer speaks after being sworn in on Monday. He notified Congress of the administration's plans to renegotiate NAFTA on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591dc086270000640090eb35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told congressional leaders in a letter on Thursday.The president must give Congress a 90-day notice before beginning talks. The announcement, which comes three days after Lighthizer was sworn in, provides an opportunity for Trump to deliver on a campaign promise to dramatically improve the trade accord for U.S. manufacturers and workers.“The United States seeks to support higher-paying jobs in the United States and to grow the U.S. economy by improving U.S. opportunities under NAFTA,” Lighthizer wrote. “In particular, we note that NAFTA was negotiated 25 years ago, and while our economy and businesses have changed considerably over that period, NAFTA has not.”At just over a page, the letter offers few insights into the approach Trump plans to take in revamping the trade agreement. A draft of the letter that leaked at the end of March went on for nearly eight pages, alarming trade skeptics who thought the softer language represented a major climbdown from Trump’s tough campaign stance.Some of the specific goals that were outlined in the leaked draft and remain in the final version are unlikely to quiet these concerns. Like the earlier version, the new letter points out that digital trade was in its “infancy” when NAFTA was ratified and that the agreement’s provisions regarding intellectual property rights need to be updated. It also keeps language about expanding NAFTA to include the intellectual property protections and other regulatory streamlining in more recent trade agreements.The intellectual property provisions in the now-defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership were among the features that elicited the most criticism from liberal trade skeptics. Public health advocates in particular were wary of clauses that extended patent protections to biologics, fearing that it would make these drugs unaffordable to American trade partners. Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), ranking member of the trade subcommittee, claim in a letter to Lighthizer that his notice may provide too little “specificity” to even comply with the law requiring the president to inform Congress of his intentions. The notice period is a requirement of a 2015 law, the Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act.“Some fundamental and critically important questions remain unanswered today. That is particularly true given how different today’s one-page final notice is from the eight-page draft we received in March,” they wrote.A true test of efforts to renegotiate NAFTA is whether it scraps the investor-state dispute settlement system that allows multinational corporations to challenge domestic regulations, according to Lori Wallach, a leading progressive trade deal critic and director of Public Citizen’s global trade watch.“If corporate elites are allowed to dictate how NAFTA is renegotiated, the agreement could become more damaging for working families and the environment in the three countries,” Wallach said in a statement reacting to Lighthizer’s letter. “And modest tweaks will not stop NAFTA’s ongoing damage, much less deliver on Trump’s promises for a deal that will create American jobs and raise wages.”Trump’s efforts to rebalance global trade in favor of U.S. firms and workers have thus far largely been limited to symbolic gestures and the commissioning of studies that have the potential to reshape future trade relations.In April, for example, he initiated an investigation into whether foreign steel imports jeopardize national security. But the memorandum creating the inquiry sets in motion a process that could last as long as a year before it produces presidential action.Before Thursday, Trump’s NAFTA comments had been limited to bluster. At the end of April, the president announced that he had been on the verge of pulling out of NAFTA entirely, until phone calls from the leaders of Mexico and Canada convinced him otherwise.The White House has claimed that its toolkit would be limited until Lighthizer, a trade policy hawk respected by many progressive experts, could be confirmed as trade representative. Support from Senate Democrats ensured Lighthizer’s confirmation last week after three Republican senators defected.The vote for the top trade official reflects the way in which Trump’s trade agenda has the potential to elicit rare bipartisan backing. But if the reaction to Thursday’s letter is any indication, Democrats are not even eager to cooperate on the NAFTA talks.Economists are divided about the net impact of NAFTA on the U.S. labor market. Proponents of the accord note that it made consumer goods cheaper and helped U.S. auto manufacturers and other industries expand their supply chains. Critics say the manufacturing jobs it cost the U.S. in other fields has contributed to the decline in earning power for Americans without a college degree over the last two decades."

What in the world?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591dece4270000520090ec1f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Jon Ossoff, the Georgia Democrat on his way to potentially winning a congressional seat long held by Republicans, including Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, just got a big boost from the Democratic National Committee.The DNC announced Thursday that it’s sending in 10 field organizers to target Democratic voters who didn’t show up for the April 18 primary election, where Ossoff nearly won the House seat outright. He fell just shy of hitting 50 percent of the vote, which put him in a June 20 runoff with the top Republican, perennial candidate Karen Handel. His new staff members will target roughly 78,000 African-American, Asian and Latino voters who are registered to vote but didn’t cast ballots in April. They’ll spend the next five weeks helping with phone banks, canvassing and organizing drivers to take voters to the polls during early voting and on Election Day.“We’re working to talk to every single voter in this district by every possible means and leaving no stone untouched,” said DNC Chair Tom Perez.Beyond the DNC’s investment, the leading super PAC for House Democrats, House Majority PAC, announced Thursday that it is spending $500,000 on a broadcast television buy for Ossoff. It will also spend $200,000 for a get-out-the-vote field effort in his district, beginning this weekend and running through June 20.The moves show how eager the Democratic Party is to win this race, in part because it’s one of the first congressional elections since Trump became president and partly because it’s a stunning turn of events that Ossoff, a 30-year-old former documentary filmmaker and congressional aide to Rep. Hank Johnson (Ga.), is popular in this otherwise Republican district.It’s been held by Republicans since at least the 1970s, and its most recent inhabitant, Price, won the seat by 24 points in 2016. Ossoff’s success here has drawn national attention and brought in Hollywood celebrities eager to see him win, including actress Alyssa Milano, who personally drove people to the polls for the April primary.Ossoff’s opponent, Handel, is perhaps best known for being fired from Susan G. Komen for the Cure after she sparked a PR crisis by pushing her anti-abortion agenda onto the cancer research organization. She has since lost bids to be governor and to be a U.S. senator.A May 4 poll conducted by Georgia’s WSB-TV and Landmark Communication showed Ossoff and Handel in a dead heat."

29,POLITICS,Donald Trump Says Joe Lieberman Is His Top Choice For FBI Director,Marina Fang and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-joe-lieberman-fbi-director_us_591df2bbe4b094cdba52519a,"The president is ""very close"" to making a final decision, he told reporters on Thursday.",2017-05-18,Former Sen. Joe Lieberman leaves the West Wing of the White House after meeting with President Donald Trump on Wednesday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591df3a8140000850005be88.jpeg?cache=FxzR335X1F&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump is “very close” to selecting an interim candidate to replace former FBI Director James Comey, he told White House reporters on Thursday.Trump confirmed that former Sen. Joe Lieberman is his top choice, according to White House pool reports. The founder of Lieberman’s law firm ― Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman ― is one of the president’s top lawyers.Trump met on Wednesday with Lieberman and three other candidates: current acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe; Frank Keating, the former governor of Oklahoma who previously served as an FBI agent and in high-level positions in the Justice Department; and Richard McFeely, who served in the FBI for 24 years before retiring as executive assistant director in 2014.Lieberman, who was the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee before losing a primary bid for re-election and becoming an independent, would be an unconventional choice. He has no federal law enforcement experience and, while currently at a high-profile law firm, is most associated as a centrist Democrat. He has previously said that he would support an independent commission to investigate ties between Trump’s administration and Russia. But it is his background in politics that had Democrats reacting with severe reservation.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) called it a “mistake” to select an elected official to the post, saying that the FBI director should be a law enforcement official. While Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), in an interview with Huffpost, called the possible nomination “shocking.” “There is no reason to appoint a politician to run the FBI,” Schatz said. “It is contrary to everything the FBI is about and it undermines the confidence that the public needs to have in the independence of the agency. And more to the point, it is not as if there is no one else qualified to do this job. There are literally dozens of people who would get a unanimous vote.” It is rare for an FBI director to be appointed without the full backing of the Senate, Schatz noted. And he speculated that a Lieberman nomination would split the chamber. A top Senate Democratic aide, likewise, put the prospects of immense opposition to the pick bluntly in an email to HuffPost: “There couldn’t possibly be worse time to take the unprecedented step of handing the FBI over to a politician. That absolutely includes Senator Lieberman.”During a Thursday Democratic caucus lunch, Sens. Dick Durbin (Ill.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) trashed the idea of Lieberman, or any politician, being in charge of the FBI, according to a senior Democratic aide who was in the private meeting. A majority of Democrats in the room said they agreed that he’s a terrible choice. Not a one defended Lieberman.“The FBI director should be drawn from the ranks of career law enforcement‎, prosecutors or the FBI itself ― not politicians,” Durbin told HuffPost later.Republicans, by contrast, praised Lieberman. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) expressed “great admiration” for the former senator, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) speculated that Lieberman could get 100 confirmation votes, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said he would be “overjoyed” if Lieberman, who is a friend of his, were picked. “Joe Lieberman has more experience than all of my Democrat colleagues combined, so screw them,” McCain said of Democrats’ concerns.The need for a new FBI director came after Trump fired Comey last week, a stunning move that occurred amid the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. A series of explosive reports over the last week have heightened the appearance that Trump interfered with the investigation. In particular, The New York Times reported that Trump asked Comey to shut down a separate probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials, according to a memo Comey wrote to document a meeting with Trump.Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report."

On Thursday, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said the Turkish ambassador should be asked to leave the U.S., and the day before, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to explore bringing criminal charges against the men captured on video attacking demonstrators. “Agents of foreign governments should never be immune from prosecution for felonious behavior,” Royce wrote in a letter on Wednesday. There’s bipartisan agreement on the issue: Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) have directly accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s team of a role in the violence, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) echoed Royce’s call in a statement. “If Erdoğan bodyguards who participated in this attack have entered the country on diplomatic visas, those visas should be revoked right away,” she said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and McCain sent a joint letter about the incident to Erdogan Thursday. The State Department has reportedly summoned the Turkish ambassador for a meeting to discuss the clashes.New footage released by VOA Turkish Thursday evening added fuel to the fire. The video purportedly shows the Turkish president’s official car sitting in front of the door to the ambassador’s residence. Chants from the protesters ― “Baby-killer Erdogan!” ― can be heard. A man in a suit, presumably a Turkish official, speaks with someone seated inside the car. He then looks to another besuited man with a mustache, who nods twice and then runs in the direction of the rally. The chanting stops a few seconds later and more serious fighting appears to break out. Police sirens can be heard. Less than a minute later, Erdogan emerges from the car. He repeatedly looks at the violence and then walks into the residence.But as of Thursday, the only two people facing consequences related to the incident are private citizens who have starkly different views of Erdogan. Jalal Kheirabadi, 42, a Kurdish American of Iranian descent who lives in Fairfax, Virginia, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to assaulting a police officer. Necmi Ayten, 49, a Turkish Erdogan supporter who traveled from his home in Woodside, New York, to welcome the Turkish president, pleaded not guilty to assaulting a protester. Both men believe they were wrongfully arrested. Kheirabadi claims he was trying to defend himself from several men he believes were working for Erdogan. He says that a police officer got caught up in the scuffle. “Four people beating me, how can I recognize the people?” he said in an interview. Ayten claims he wasn’t even near the ambassador’s residence until after the clashes ended. He and his lawyer believe he was arrested by mistake and that cops were looking for a Turk to blame for the violence. “Any old Turk will do,” Gunay Evinch, his lawyer, said after the arraignment. A police report identified Ceren Borazan, 26, as the victim of an assault by Ayten. A Turkish Kurd who now lives in New Jersey, she told HuffPost she was attacked on Tuesday by multiple men she believes work for Erdogan. One attacker put her in a chokehold and ruptured a blood vessel in her eye, she said. Borazan added that as she ran towards cars looking for help she heard a man yelling “Bitch, it’s gonna be the end of your life,” in Turkish. “I swear I thought it was the end of my life,” she said. After looking at photographs of Ayten on Facebook, Borazan said she recognized him from the Tuesday clashes but was unsure whether he worked for Erdogan. A claim that Ayten denies.Unnamed government officials told NBC News and the Wall Street Journal that they believe the Turkish president’s bodyguards were to blame for the incident, in which police said at least nine civilians and one officer were injured. Two members of the Secret Service sustained injuries too, a Secret Service spokesperson told HuffPost on Wednesday night.U.S. authorities have not formally charged any member of the Turkish security detail for the violence, and in public, the Trump administration has avoided assigning blame. “Violence is never an appropriate response to free speech, and we support the rights of people everywhere to free expression and peaceful protest. We are communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms,” Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a Wednesday statement. The Metropolitan Police Department has said it is working with the State Department and Secret Service to find and hold accountable anyone involved in the altercation. Two people with knowledge of the case told the Washington Post that police are investigating Erdogan’s security team. But it is not clear whether U.S. officials will be able or willing to prosecute anyone on the Turkish president’s payroll. “Unless the bodyguards were clearly acting outside their bodyguard duties, they are probably immune from prosecution. While the specific facts of the incident… are important, they are similar to diplomatic drivers, who also enjoy immunity if, for instance they are involved in a traffic accident,” Hurst Hannum, an international law professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, wrote in a Wednesday email to HuffPost. “While this seems unfair to many people, U.S. diplomats and their staff enjoy exactly the same immunity in other countries.”The publicly available evidence also makes it difficult to pinpoint how the Tuesday afternoon violence began ― or to identify who is responsible.The incident took place after two separate rallies gathered outside the ambassador’s residence, one comprising Erdogan supporters and the other loud critics. The groups chanted slogans across from each other peacefully for nearly an hour. But things changed after black cars carrying Erdogan and his team arrived around 4 p.m. The president was attending an off-the-record session co-hosted by the U.S. think tank the Atlantic Council, which has cultivated controversial ties to Erdogan. In a Wednesday statement to HuffPost, Atlantic Council president Fred Kempe condemned the violence, which he said involved Turkish security, while defending the decision to privately host Erdogan.Video footage gathered by the protesters shows men in suits breaking through a protective line and beginning to kick and beat people holding Kurdish flags and placards as D.C. police and Secret Service officials tried to intervene. Anti-Erdogan protesters are convinced that the men in suits were Turkish bodyguards, and they believe Erdogan personally gave the order for the assault to begin. But pressed for evidence, they could not offer much. Several protesters who were roughed up cited the well-tailored suits worn by the other side and added that similar incidents occur regularly in Turkey. A Turkish Embassy statement Wednesday night accused the activists ― a mix of Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Yazidis and others ― of ties with a Kurdish militant group called the PKK, which the U.S. and Turkey list as a terror organization. “The demonstrators began aggressively provoking Turkish-American citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet the President,” the statement reads. “The Turkish-Americans responded in self-defense and one of them was seriously injured. The violence and injuries were the result of this unpermitted, provocative demonstration.”It did not say the Turkish security detail had any role in the violence.The case is hardly closed, though. The investigative website Bellingcat has announced that it will try to identify those responsible using material available on social media. “While it is difficult to prove that some of the men in these tweets are indeed bodyguards or other types of Turkish security officials, some of them clearly were, as shown both in a close analysis of the video and in reports from U.S. officials,” its initial post on the issue reads. It notes that some of the men were wearing items like earpieces and lapel pins and noted their presence in previous recordings of Erdogan’s travels.Four international law experts told U.S. News & World Report on Wednesday that they believe D.C. police could charge Turkish officials if they gather sufficient evidence. And the congressional statements suggested an appetite among U.S. officials to lift immunity in this case if necessary.Such a prosecution could escalate the incident to the status of a major diplomatic crisis. The already shaky U.S.-Turkish alliance could grow weaker. With Washington supporting an armed Kurdish group called the YPG in Syria that is successfully fighting the so-called Islamic State, Erdogan has accused Washington of empowering the PKK, which has killed hundreds of Turks. Kurds, meanwhile, believe America has come to its senses, prioritizing its new partnership over an alliance with an increasingly repressive government. Both sides see moments like Erdogan’s visit as hugely important ― as either a chance for the U.S. to make amends or to push back against the Turkish leader. Outrage after Tuesday appears to have only strengthened the Washington consensus that Erdogan is a difficult authoritarian who should at best be tolerated. The Turkish leader has jailed scores of Kurdish opposition politicians and at least 81 journalists, prompting congressional complaints, and his security team was also involved in violence during an Erdogan visit last year.That’s welcome news for the U.S. citizens and residents who saw their peaceful protest turn into a bloody brawl.Mehmet Tankan, a green-card holder of Turkish origin who said seven men held and repeatedly punched him on Tuesday, told HuffPost he wants the U.S. to know that it cannot trust Erdogan and his team to respect the Constitution. He wants a tougher response than what he saw yesterday.“Don’t let them to come to this country again, they are criminals,” Tankan said. “I know my country, America, will stop them.”Carla Herreria contributed to reporting.This story has been updated to include information about new video footage."

Al Franken grilled nominee David Bernhardt during his confirmation hearing.,2017-05-18,Deputy Interior Secretary nominee David Bernhardt faced pointed questions on climate change and conflicts of interest during his Thursday confirmation hearing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591de55a270000640090ebd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It appears President Donald Trump’s nominee for second-in-command at the Department of Interior shares ― or, at least, won’t be challenging ― the president’s aversion to climate change action.About an hour and a half into Deputy Interior Secretary nominee David Bernhardt’s Thursday confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, committee member Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) asked Bernhardt whether he believes climate change represents a “serious threat that requires aggressive action?”In response, Bernhardt commented that “we need to take the science as it comes, whatever that is.”After Franken interjected and stated, “I believe the science is pretty decided on this,” Bernhardt added, “I personally believe that the [human] contribution [to climate change] is significant, very significant. Now, that’s different that what we do with it, and here’s where people disagree.”“My task will be to take the science, put it in the paradigm of the administration’s policy perspective which is [that] we’re not going to sacrifice jobs for this and then look at the legal rubric and say how do we apply the law there?” Bernhardt added.Franken called his response “incredibly short-sighted” given job opportunities in the clean energy sector, and pressed Bernhardt on the matter again, saying “the science is in.” “Policy decisions are made,” Bernhardt responded. “This president ran on a particular perspective. That perspective won’t change to the extent that we have the discretion under the law to follow it. In some instances we might not, but those that we do, we’re absolutely going to follow the policy perspective of the president. And here’s why: That’s the way our republic works and he is the president.”Bernhardt, an attorney at the well-connected law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck who previously served as the Interior’s top lawyer under former President George W. Bush, also faced pointed questions on Thursday concerning potential conflicts of interest arising from Bernhardt’s connections to the firm’s current or former clients.Ahead of the Thursday hearing, 150 conservation groups signed a letter opposing his nomination, labeling him “a walking conflict of interest.” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), the committee’s ranking member, appears to share those concerns.Cantwell directly asked Bernhardt whether his firm benefited from the Trump administration’s recent decision to rescind the Obama administration’s 2015 decision to block the construction of a 43-mile pipeline that would pump groundwater from the Mojave Desert and transport it to Southern California.Bernhardt’s firm previously lobbied on behalf of Cadiz Inc., the company that hopes to build the proposed pipeline, and the firm is also poised to earn 200,000 shares of stock in Cadiz — worth about $3 million — should the project be completed.In response to the question, Bernhardt indicated that the firm had not, to his knowledge, benefited from the Trump administration’s policy change related to the Cadiz project.Bernhardt added that, if confirmed, he would exit the firm and would not have any continuing financial interest in the company. He said he would also recuse himself from any future matters related to Cadiz or any other former clients or employers, per an ethics agreement he has already signed.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.), the committee’s chairwoman, said in her opening remarks at the hearing that Bernhardt’s “extensive experience” at the Interior will serve him well in the role. She described the nominee as “an excellent choice.”The committee’s vote on Bernhardt’s confirmation has yet to be scheduled, but Murkowski vowed to move “as expeditiously as possible” toward a vote.Bernhardt’s nomination for the Interior post appears to be consistent with the White House’s effort to roll back environmental regulations and increase fossil fuel production. Environmental groups had hoped that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke would be a moderating voice in the administration, given his acknowledgement of climate change and his vow to preserve public lands.Shortly after Zinke took office in March, however, the former Montana congressman lifted a temporary moratorium on federal coal leasing, declaring an end to the so-called “war on coal.” That same month, Zinke repealed a ban on lead ammunition ― responsible for poisoning as many as 20 million birds and other animals ― in national parks and wildlife refuges. In May, he reopened millions of acres of federal waters to offshore oil and gas sites, but stressed that he would be cautious in approving new drilling projects. "
32,GREEN,Selling Dog Meat May Be Banned At This Year's Yulin Dog Meat Festival,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dog-meat-ban-yulin-china_us_591ddbeee4b094cdba522cdf,"Officials are not confirming the ban, and some people are questioning whether it's real.",2017-05-18,Dogs set to be killed at a market preceding the 2014 Yulin Lychee and Dog Meat Festival.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591ddd0d2e00002200935c7e.jpeg?cache=GPkv6UVK0R&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Animal rights activists are reporting that the local government in Yulin, China, will be banning the sale of dog meat at the city’s controversial Lychee and Dog Meat Festival in June.However, officials in Yulin did not confirm the ban when questioned by media outlets, leading some to question whether the purported ban is happening at all.The annual festival, which involves the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat, has incited protests both within China and internationally. National Geographic reports that in China, young people in particular are opposed to the dog meat trade.According to Humane Society International and the Duo Duo Project, officials told traders that restaurants, vendors and market traders will be temporarily prohibited from selling dog meat, beginning one week before the June 21 festival. Peter Li, HSI’s China policy specialist, said the ban is set to last until the festival is over and that there’s no evidence the ban includes any restrictions on cat meat.But city officials would not confirm any ban at all when both The New York Times and the BBC reached out to them. The BBC also reports that “some vendors” told the outlet they hadn’t heard of a ban.But Humane Society International told HuffPost it is confident in its sources and that it isn’t surprised Yulin officials won’t confirm the ban to the media.“It’s likely not in [the local government’s] interests to appear to be responding to national or global pressure,” Wendy Higgins, HSI international media director, said in an email. “The contacts in China of HSI and Duo Duo Project have spoken directly with a number of traders, all of whom confirm the ban, and that traders were told to attend a meeting at which the ban was explained.”So, what would be the point of a ban if officials won’t confirm it?Li said the likely goal is to prevent activists and journalists from taking gruesome-looking photos of canine carcasses.“What the authorities are trying to accomplish is not a ban announcement, but the disappearance of slaughtered dog bodies,” he said.And Higgins said that not formally announcing the ban was a logical strategic move.“If the ban is a failure, the officials can say ‘what ban?’ because they never confirmed it, and if it is a success, they can say ‘see what we have done’ and hopefully build on it next year until the problem goes away,” she told HuffPost.In an interview with the BBC, Li said the policy appears to stem from the new Communist Party secretary of Yulin, Mo Gong Ming, who wants to improve the city’s reputation around the world.Opponents of the Yulin festival often face criticism from those who point out it’s irrational to be more outraged over the slaughter of dogs than the slaughter of less traditionally cute and fuzzy animals like pigs and chickens ― which are killed and eaten in far greater numbers worldwide.But Li countered that there are specific reasons to oppose the Yulin festival besides the species of animals involved. For one thing, he said, dogs killed in the festival are often stolen pets. Eating dog meat is legal in China (as well as in many U.S. states), but stealing dogs is not.“Dogs slaughtered for food come from suspicious sources,” he said. “Many are stolen pets and rural guard dogs.” He noted that Chinese activists would protest a beef festival, too, if the animals were stolen cattle.And Higgins pointed out that many groups, including HSI, that oppose the dog meat festivals also actively fight for the rights of all animals that suffer in the food industry.“HSI doesn’t shy away from exposing and challenging the suffering of all animals killed for food around the world, including in Western countries such as the U.K. and U.S.,” she said. “Whilst we realize that we can’t stop the suffering of all animals for the food industry overnight, we shouldn’t use the suffering of pigs or chickens in one country as an excuse for inaction to stop the suffering of dogs in another country.”"

Offended An Entire City,Doha Madani,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-episode-of-nbcs-hit-show-chicago-pd-offended-an-entire-city_us_591dd4eee4b034684b0a6566,"The mayor of Crown Point, Indiana, is demanding a public apology.",2017-05-18,"A still from the ""Chicago P.D."" episode ""Army of One.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591e01fb140000960005bed9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mayor David Uran is demanding a public apology after an episode of “Chicago P.D.” that he claims portrayed the city of Crown Point, Indiana, as a racist community, according to The Chicago Tribune.“It was just a very bizarre episode, I thought,” Uran told the Chicago Tribune. “Obviously the story line isn’t true. We have never had a case like that here in Crown Point. Just the way it engaged the image of our city was a little disturbing.”The episode, “Army of One,” follows the police officers as they investigate the murder of a man named Elijah who was killed after being released from jail for statutory rape as a teenager. But Elijah’s aunt tells the officers that there was no rape and that the teens were in a consensual relationship. “They were just kids. They put him in jail for having relations … Because she was white and that don’t fly in Crown Point, Indiana,” the character says in the episode.Uran says this representation of the city gives a bad impression to millions of viewers who may not ever visit Crown Point. Community leaders such as Rev. Mark Wilkens of First United Methodist Church in Crown Point, have joined the mayor’s complaint. “I think they were really heavy-handed and condescending toward our city. I think they took the easy way out in terms of writing,” Wilkens told the Tribune.The complaints are rooted in the fact that the controversial storyline was set in a real place, but wasn’t based on a real case, potentially implying that a crime of this nature could occur in the actual city.Prior episodes of “Chicago P.D.” that were met with controversy were set in the city of Chicago and touched on topical issues such as police shootings and the Black Lives Matter movement.This isn’t the first time the show has been accused of being inaccurate on matters of race relations in Chicago as well. An opinion piece from the Chicago Tribune in January criticized the show for not showing racial bias in the police department as observed in Department of Justice reports. Reporter Nina Metz wrote:The show is meant as an escape. And we need shows that offer a distraction from real world anxieties. There is value in that. But it’s not so easy to swallow on “Chicago P.D.” now that the elephant in the room — of widespread problems with the system itself — is now singing and dancing and introducing itself to everyone, courtesy of that DOJ report.NBC did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Uran questioned why the show chose to use Crown Point as the setting for a such a controversial topic rather than use a fictional town. “We work hard everyday,” Uran said. “When I say we, it’s the people who live here and invest their dollars here. We have low crime rates. People maintain their properties. It is not the way they portrayed the city. All they had to do is change the name.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-quist-montana-donations_us_591df0b8e4b034684b0a92e1,"Contributions averaged $25 to Rob Quist, who is running against a multimillionaire with dark-money ties.",2017-05-18,Rob Quist is famous in Montana for fronting the Mission Mountain Wood Band. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591df305270000640090ec39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The populist Democrat running for Montana’s open seat in the House of Representatives has hit a major fundraising milestone, as a race ignored until last month by party officials heats up in its final week.Donations to Rob Quist, the bluegrass legend who won an unlikely bid for the nomination in March, have surpassed $5 million, his campaign announced on Thursday. The contributions averaged less than $25 each and came from roughly 200,000 individuals. For context, donations to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has endorsed Quist, averaged $27 donations during his insurgent bid for the Democratic presidential nomination last year. Fundraising surged this month after Greg Gianforte, Quist’s multimillionaire Republican opponent, waffled on his support for the controversial health care bill just passed by the House. Gianforte told conservative lobbyists he backed the bill in a private call later published by The New York Times. He walked back the comment days later amid uproar from the more than 70,000 voters whose health insurance could be imperiled if the deeply unpopular American Health Care Act becomes law.Quist, who supports single-payer health care and legalizing marijuana, has weathered his own history of financial woes, stemming from what he says was a botched gallbladder surgery that for years left him unqualified for affordable insurance.Forced to pay out of pocket for follow-up surgeries, Quist accessed Social Security and sold off part of the ranch he inherited from his family. In October 1994, the doctor responsible for the surgery denied allegations of malpractice, according to a report published this week by the conservative Washington Free Beacon.“Rob’s story is resonating with voters who want someone who will stand up for them,” Tina Olechowski, Quist’s communication director, said in a statement. “After medical complications following surgery, Rob got into debt. He paid off his debt, but Rob believes no one should ever face bankruptcy just because they get sick.”By contrast, Gianforte, who narrowly lost a bid for the Montana governor’s mansion last year, raised $2 million from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a dark-money super PAC funded by “tobacco companies, video game manufacturers, other corporations and wealthy donors,” according to Bloomberg BNA. The tech mogul, who sold a software company to cloud-computing giant Oracle for $1.5 billion in 2011, loaned himself $1 million to finance his campaign ahead of the May 25 special election.Republican attacks on Quist’s personal financial struggles have increased amid heightened scrutiny of Gianforte’s own investments. Gianforte listed in financial disclosures a nearly $48,000 stake in a French-Swiss cement maker accused of making payments to the Islamic State terror group, as HuffPost first reported on Wednesday. President Donald Trump criticized Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last August for once accepting a donation to the Clinton Foundation from the company. Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, campaigned last week alongside Gianforte.Gianforte also invested nearly $250,000 in index funds with holdings in Gazprom and Rosneft, the Kremlin-controlled oil and gas firms sanctioned by the U.S. after Russia invaded Crimea, The Guardian reported last month.  Gianforte had a 6-point lead over Quist in a poll released earlier this month by a Democratic political action committee. But internal GOP polling shifted against Gianforte last weekend amid proliferating scandals coming from the White House, according to the conservative blogger and radio host Erick Erickson.Shane Scanlon, a spokesman for Gianforte, did not respond to a request for comment. “Rob will represent all Montanans, not just the millionaires,” Olechowski said on Thursday, “and that’s why he’ll win next week.”"
35,ARTS & CULTURE,"The RompHim Isn't Just Lame Wordplay, It's A Sign Of Male Fragility",Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/romphim-bro-words_us_591de7fae4b034684b0a83bb,"Men need their own ""bro-ified"" trends to alleviate the anxiety of appearing feminine.",2017-05-18,These men aren't just wearing jumpsuits -- they're wearing <em>RompHims.</em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591de9b02e00002100935cc5.png?cache=iM6Zzx6IXE&ops=crop_0_105_680_250%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Candles, yogurt, rosé, and now rompers: Our capitalistic marketplace overflows with desirable, fun products that suffer from their association with women. Fortunately, businesses have found a way to market their goods to both women and men: bro branding. (”Bronding”?)We’ve had mandles, brogurt, brosé, and now the latest example, the RompHim™, a short jumpsuit for men. The RompHim launched via Kickstarter this week and quickly drew derision from Twitter wits. Men in rompers! Imagine!The summer romper, a cute number that typically looks like a sundress with shorts instead of a skirt, has firmly established itself in the past few years as a popular option for women. Though nearly impossible in bathroom contexts (nothing like hovering naked over a public toilet with one’s entire outfit pooled around one’s ankles to induce skepticism of the trend), it’s otherwise quite convenient. Women can have all the flirty style of a short sundress without the fear of stiff winds, bicycling and sitting cross-legged. Both men and women have rocked jumpsuits before this latest romper bubble, but the sudden popularity of ruffled, floral jumpsuits for women seems to have tainted the style’s gender-neutral reputation. Many of the recent Twitter jibes directed at the garment centered around the absurdity of a man dressing like a woman ― showing up to a date wearing the same romper as his female counterpart, preening himself over his cute new look, etc. There’s a genuine merit to the RompHim™ approach: Rompers are convenient (probably even more so for men, who will be able to pee in a romper without disrobing), and they’ve become ubiquitous in women’s fashion but not men’s. But it’s infuriating that advertisers have come to rely on artificial layers of masculinization to convince men to buy products that should be gender-neutral. Pink wine? That’s girl stuff. Brosé, though, that’s something for bros. Yogurt is something ladies in grey hoodies eat to maintain their svelte figures in between mothering and wifing, but brogurt is powerful, protein-packed nourishment for men. Scented candles are chick tchotchkes, but a mandle redolent of freshly mown football fields is perfect for your man cave. The products are marketed directly at men who actually want scented candles, rompers and rosé, but who fear their very masculinity will come into question if they indulge.Even as feminists chip away at the socially constructed gender roles that men and women have long felt obligated to perform, male anxiety seems more pervasive than ever. While women feel empowered to lean in to male roles ― and styles ― men battle internal and external pressure to protect a male-only space that distinguishes them from the “weaker” sex. Women today wear pants, Oxford shoes and shirts, and menswear-inspired everything; it’s still rare to see a man in a skirt, and many even find men in shorts to be laughable. Our conception of what men can wear remains as narrow as it was 50 years ago, if not more so. In the past, activists have mocked the pinkification of products to appeal to women ― perhaps most hilariously, Bic for Her ballpoint pens ― but apparently when women buy basic, mainstream products, men become embarrassed to consume the same things. It’s not too hard to get women to buy gender-neutral items (or even male-coded ones: think of the popularity of “boyfriend” jeans). After all, liking and using things men like and use can result in higher status for women. Drink whiskey, watch football, down a plateful of wings ― as long as you’re hot, you’re the perfect woman, and even if you’re not a solid nine, your choices will at least be deemed respectable.It’s men who nurture the more acute anxiety about gender neutrality. (This makes sense; in a world divided neatly into men and women, men have almost uniformly gleaned the advantages from this demarcation.) A man watching “Real Housewives” with a glass of zinfandel in a romper is flouting gender norms, but by adopting the lesser-respected female-coded habits. His wine and outfit need to be placed in a separate, more macho category than the identical versions consumed by women. “Don’t worry,” says a carton emblazoned with the name Powerful Yogurt, “just because you’re eating yogurt like a lady doesn’t mean you’re effeminate! You’re still the man here.”A 2016 follow-up on brogurt noted that brands like Powerful Yogurt were going “gender-neutral”: “[Excluding women] was a risk,” said one executive of their male-focused advertising. Was it, though? Women have always been OK buying products coded as male ― even as men run screaming from anything pink or cute. RompHim suggests their men’s cut rompers as a good option for women who prefer a unisex silhouette; the reverse of that two-birds-one-stone approach would never work out. The veritable rash of bro-ified terms for non-gendered products shows how deep male fragility runs: A man’s manhood requires constant signaling and buttressing to remain secure. Men who step out of line are derided as emasculated and sexually confused. For men to reap the benefits of a gender-neutral world, we rely on verbal tricks that only reinforce the gender-normative stereotypes that keep men boxed in. The real progress will be made when men can drink rosé in a romper without a single batted eyelash or “bro” prefix."

Meanwhile, the birth rate for women ages 25-29 (the demographic with the highest birth rate for more than three decades) fell from 104.3 per 1,000 in 2015 to 101.9 per 1,000 in 2016.The birth rate among women 35 to 39 also increased slightly from 51.8 to 52.6 per 1,000, and the rate for 40 to 44 year old women rose from 11.0 to 11.4. For women 20 to 24, it fell from 76.8 to 73.7. The teen pregnancy rate also declined.The provisional CDC data also found that the mean age at which women in the U.S. have their first child is 28. In 2014, that age was 26, and in 2000, it was 24.In 1970, the mean age of a first-time mom was 21. There are many reasons women choose to delay having children. As more women pursue higher education and enter the workforce, they generally choose to marry and become mothers later in life. As writer Rebecca Traister told NPR in 2016, women in the past generally married and had kids younger because they were financially dependent on husbands who could be earners. “Though we’re still not close to equal pay, women can be economically independent,” Traister said. “Thanks to the sexual liberation, thanks to developments within birth control, thanks to an expansion of reproductive rights, women can have sexually liberated lives.”She also noted that having kids outside marriage has become more socially acceptable. Indeed, the CDC found that 40.3 percent of babies born in 2015 were born to unmarried mothers. In 1969 that number was 10 percent and in 1940, it was just 3.8 percent.The birth rate overall showed a slight decline, from 62.5 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age in 2015 to just 62 in 2016.

It shows three Balch Springs police officers arresting a black man, who tells the officers he was in possession of a BB gun.After handcuffing the suspect’s hands behind his back, one officer uses a knife to cut off the man’s backpack. As cops remove the bag, the sergeant jolts the suspect multiple times with a stun gun, for no apparent reason.“I ain’t playin’ with you,” the sergeant says as the suspect cries out in pain.Most police departments restrict the use of stun guns to subjects who are aggressive or actively resisting. Some police departments prohibit or discourage shocking individuals who are handcuffed.Civil rights attorney Lee Merritt identified the stun gun-wielding officer as Sgt. James Young.“Sgt. James Young destroys the bad apple myth,” Merritt posted Wednesday to Twitter.Young, according to Merritt, was training officer for Balch Springs Officer Roy Oliver, 37, who was fired from the police department this month and charged with murder in the April 29 shooting death of Jordan Edwards, an unarmed 15-year-old African American.“As Oliver’s trainer, he passed on a culture of brutality by example,” Merritt tweeted. “It’s real life Training Day.”Oliver fired a rifle into a car filled with teenagers who were leaving a party. A bullet struck Edwards, who was a passenger, in the head. Edwards’ family has sued Oliver and Balch Springs, alleging the teenager was the victim of excessive force.In a statement posted to its Facebook page, Balch Springs police acknowledged the existence of the leaked body-camera video, but did not identify the officers in it. The video was reviewed by outside agencies that “determined charges would not be filed” against the officer, the police department said.Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber told KDFW-TV he’s concerned about the timing of the video leak, just days after the U.S. Department of Justice opened an investigation into Edwards’ shooting.“This was an administrative issue, not a criminal issue,” Haber said of the stun-gun incident.Merritt, who did not respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, tweeted that the video is “the tip of an iceberg.”David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

The little airport's survival is in doubt because of security restrictions when President Donald Trump visits his golf resort in nearby Bedminster, New Jersey.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591a16d11e00003a00623226.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ERWINNA, Pa. ― Steady rain drenches the grass airstrip. A gleaming 1928 biplane called the Bird of Paradise will stay in its hangar for now, behind the long-winged gliders and their towplanes that, in nicer weather, carry sightseers and thrill-seekers, and sustain tiny Van Sant Airport in rural Bucks County.Bar Eisenhauer, an antique airplane buff who runs the two-runway airport with his wife, Dannie, said they can deal with bad weather, even though their livelihood depends on a six-month season of taking tourists for rides in old airplanes. Rain eventually stops, he said, and they can often squeeze in a few customers before dark.But the Eisenhauers now face a problem far worse than no-fly weather ― something that threatens to put them out of business: President Donald Trump’s weekend trips to his golf club across the Delaware River in Bedminster, New Jersey.“We never saw this coming,” Eisenhauer said the other day on the high ridge where the airport’s cozy office sits, stuffed with flying memorabilia and old black-and-white photos of airplanes and pilots. “Of all the things ― this is something that could be really, really bad.”Trump, who campaigned on cutting business regulations and often touts his executive orders that do just that, has nevertheless created a red-tape death tangle for mom and pop airports in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida with his weekend travels to various Trump resorts.Whenever the president leaves the White House, the Federal Aviation Administration imposes “temporary flight restrictions” that tightly limit nearby air traffic. General-aviation airports ― those serving private planes ― are closed to takeoffs and landings within 10 miles of the president’s location. Those outside that 10-mile ring, but within 30 miles, like Van Sant, can allow aircraft to arrive and depart if they’re equipped with two-way radios and a transponder that constantly broadcasts location and identity. Commercial air traffic at regional airports isn’t affected.Two general-aviation airports near Trump’s golf club had to close this month when he visited Bedminster. At least 10 others were able to operate with restrictions, which include this warning: “Aircraft may not loiter.”Loitering covers pretty much everything the Eisenhauers do. The old propeller planes ― lovingly restored with glossy paint and lustrous wood ― take off from Van Sant’s grass runway for a leisurely loop along the Delaware River. Gliders soar on updrafts created by the area’s steeply carved terrain. Van Sant was built in the 1940s for crop-dusting and flight instruction. Now, it’s owned by the county. The Eisenhauers run flight operations, and depend on flying lessons and weekend tourists to earn a living. Other small airports covered by the Bedminster-area FAA restriction cater to hot air balloons and skydivers. But most also have restaurants, robust fuel sales and paved runways that can be used for takeoffs and landings of private planes ― even when the temporary flight restriction is in effect. Van Sant is so small that it’s seldom used by travelers. Yes, there’s food ― a guy on the porch with a barbecue grill. But only three of the Eisenhauers’ 15 airplanes have the kind of electronic equipment that would allow them to take off and land during temporary restrictions.“We’re pretty much grounded,” Eisenhauer said.The FAA says it has no ability to adjust temporary flight restrictions. “These things are set up at the request of the Secret Service,” a spokesman said.The Secret Service tries to balance “security and access,” a spokesman for that agency said, but “the primary responsibility of the Secret Service is to provide a safe environment for the president.” A White House spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.Trump spent most weekends during his first months in office at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where similar FAA orders restricted air travel. A nearby general-aviation airport lost much of its business to competing airports when Trump was at Mar-a-Lago, according to the Sun-Sentinel, a South Florida newspaper.With summer approaching, the president is adjusting his weekend routine to favor Trump National Golf Club, about an hour’s drive from New York. “The reason I am staying in Bedminster, N. J., a beautiful community, is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive,” Trump tweeted during a visit to his resort this month.Trump’s railing against business regulations hasn’t been lost on the Eisenhauers. Just last month, he issued a statement deploring what he called “excessive and unreasonable regulations” and touting his executive orders to undo “overreaching rules” so entrepreneurs can “spend more time creating jobs and less time navigating the federal bureaucracy.”Dannie Eisenhauer said she loves what Trump has been doing.“He’s done a lot of great things, but in this little situation, it’s killing us,” she said. “I’m a Trump supporter. I think if he knew what was happening to us, he’d do something.”The Eisenhauers learned on May 2 that Van Sant would be subject to a temporary flight restriction two days later. The order began that Thursday night and lasted until Sunday night. That took the heart out of a week’s business, something the Eisenhauers said has them scrambling for ideas on how to survive.“Movie nights, balloon rides ― we’re even thinking about kite-flying,” Bar said.“We freaked out at first,” Dannie said. “But I’m trying to stay really positive that something good will happen.”“This isn’t just one weekend,” she said. “This could go on for four years ― or more. It’s a situation, that’s for sure.”  "

Rain eventually stops, he said, and they can often squeeze in a few customers before dark.But the Eisenhauers now face a problem far worse than no-fly weather ― something that threatens to put them out of business: President Donald Trump’s weekend trips to his golf club across the Delaware River in Bedminster, New Jersey.“We never saw this coming,” Eisenhauer said the other day on the high ridge where the airport’s cozy office sits, stuffed with flying memorabilia and old black-and-white photos of airplanes and pilots. “Of all the things ― this is something that could be really, really bad.”Trump, who campaigned on cutting business regulations and often touts his executive orders that do just that, has nevertheless created a red-tape death tangle for mom and pop airports in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida with his weekend travels to various Trump resorts.Whenever the president leaves the White House, the Federal Aviation Administration imposes “temporary flight restrictions” that tightly limit nearby air traffic. General-aviation airports ― those serving private planes ― are closed to takeoffs and landings within 10 miles of the president’s location. Those outside that 10-mile ring, but within 30 miles, like Van Sant, can allow aircraft to arrive and depart if they’re equipped with two-way radios and a transponder that constantly broadcasts location and identity. Commercial air traffic at regional airports isn’t affected.Two general-aviation airports near Trump’s golf club had to close this month when he visited Bedminster. At least 10 others were able to operate with restrictions, which include this warning: “Aircraft may not loiter.”Loitering covers pretty much everything the Eisenhauers do. The old propeller planes ― lovingly restored with glossy paint and lustrous wood ― take off from Van Sant’s grass runway for a leisurely loop along the Delaware River. Gliders soar on updrafts created by the area’s steeply carved terrain. Van Sant was built in the 1940s for crop-dusting and flight instruction. Now, it’s owned by the county. The Eisenhauers run flight operations, and depend on flying lessons and weekend tourists to earn a living. Other small airports covered by the Bedminster-area FAA restriction cater to hot air balloons and skydivers. But most also have restaurants, robust fuel sales and paved runways that can be used for takeoffs and landings of private planes ― even when the temporary flight restriction is in effect. Van Sant is so small that it’s seldom used by travelers. Yes, there’s food ― a guy on the porch with a barbecue grill. But only three of the Eisenhauers’ 15 airplanes have the kind of electronic equipment that would allow them to take off and land during temporary restrictions.“We’re pretty much grounded,” Eisenhauer said.The FAA says it has no ability to adjust temporary flight restrictions. “These things are set up at the request of the Secret Service,” a spokesman said.The Secret Service tries to balance “security and access,” a spokesman for that agency said, but “the primary responsibility of the Secret Service is to provide a safe environment for the president.” A White House spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.Trump spent most weekends during his first months in office at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where similar FAA orders restricted air travel. A nearby general-aviation airport lost much of its business to competing airports when Trump was at Mar-a-Lago, according to the Sun-Sentinel, a South Florida newspaper.With summer approaching, the president is adjusting his weekend routine to favor Trump National Golf Club, about an hour’s drive from New York. “The reason I am staying in Bedminster, N. J., a beautiful community, is that staying in NYC is much more expensive and disruptive,” Trump tweeted during a visit to his resort this month.Trump’s railing against business regulations hasn’t been lost on the Eisenhauers. Just last month, he issued a statement deploring what he called “excessive and unreasonable regulations” and touting his executive orders to undo “overreaching rules” so entrepreneurs can “spend more time creating jobs and less time navigating the federal bureaucracy.”Dannie Eisenhauer said she loves what Trump has been doing.“He’s done a lot of great things, but in this little situation, it’s killing us,” she said. “I’m a Trump supporter. I think if he knew what was happening to us, he’d do something.”The Eisenhauers learned on May 2 that Van Sant would be subject to a temporary flight restriction two days later. The order began that Thursday night and lasted until Sunday night. That took the heart out of a week’s business, something the Eisenhauers said has them scrambling for ideas on how to survive.“Movie nights, balloon rides ― we’re even thinking about kite-flying,” Bar said.“We freaked out at first,” Dannie said. “But I’m trying to stay really positive that something good will happen.”“This isn’t just one weekend,” she said. “This could go on for four years ― or more. It’s a situation, that’s for sure.”  "

Many Somalilanders celebrating independence day today will remember the first, it took place just 26 years ago on 18 May 1991. The struggle they remember today was bloody. In a small country, it was a conflict that touched every family, every person in Somaliland.For many, the commemoration of those who gave so much for Somaliland carries extra weight this year. Not only is Somaliland and the region on the brink of famine, but the progress made since the declaration of independence seems to be under threat.The world has ignored Somaliland’s claim to independence, but in doing so it has perhaps also ignored one of the Horn of Africa’s few recent success stories. Recognised only as an “autonomous region,” Somaliland has made far more progress in building peace and transitioning to greater democracy than Somalia. Though it has not been immune to extremism, Somaliland has not experienced even close to the same level of violence as the south.In any country that has emerged from years of dictatorship and civil war, such progress is always fragile. Somalilanders have already paid a high price for the autonomy they enjoy, they have since played their democratic role in elections and referendums, but threats to that progress are already clear.When media outlets published claims of corruption and nepotism in the police force earlier this year, the authorities responded by arresting the reporting journalist. This followed similar arrests and intimidation of the media after parliament’s deeply controversial decision to allow the United Arab Emirates to build a military base in the port of Berbera.More than almost anything else ― apart from the famine facing the region ― the decision to allow a foreign military power to set up a base in Somaliland casts a shadow over this year’s independence day. So heated was the debate in parliament that soldiers escorted opposition MPs out of the chamber following the vote.When so many can still remember those who gave their lives for independence and sovereignty, there are serious debates to be had about the right forum to make such important and emotive decisions. When families have shed blood for control of their lands, shouldn’t they be asked directly for their consent?These debates become even more important when senior officials allege the deal was driven by corruption at the very top of government, in both Somaliland and Somalia.Somalia’s auditor general told a reporter that leading figures had been given “bags of cash” in Dubai to go ahead with the base. When there are few clear public benefits of the decision, questioning the probity of the deal becomes essential. If a country truly wants to be recognised as an independent nation, for example, why did it not use such a rare opportunity to exercise diplomatic leverage?The allegations of corruption come at a time when many see deliberate attempts to edit and tamper with Somaliland’s history, to forget those who sacrificed so much for autonomy. They are wary of the minimizing and even erasure of key figures from the recent past, those who were central in the struggle for independence but who it is politically convenient for those currently in power to forget.Somaliland and the rest of the region currently face the grave threat of famine, which must be the priority for local governments. However, when this crisis has been dealt with, there is a need for Somaliland to come to a national understanding about its history. It needs to commemorate and honour its past so that the lessons can be learned, and ensure mistakes are not repeated.When so little history separates the birth of Somaliland and today, it is even more shocking to see efforts to erase history for the benefit of narrow political aims.National days should be about recognising the sacrifices of the past, honouring and remembering those lost and those who remain with us. Despite the attempts to rewrite history, most Somalilanders know where they have come from. While they thought that their struggles had given them a clearer view of where they might be headed, I am afraid the view will be more obscure this independence day."

While ending the Labor Party’s dominance since 1948, Begin’s rise revolutionized American Jewry’s relationship to Israel too. The Six Day War roller-coaster – May 1967’s traumatic fears followed by June’s postwar euphoria – transformed Israel into American Jews’ fantasy-land. Israel’s rightward shift a decade later made Israel seem strange again, even vaguely embarrassing.In May 1967, Arab threats of another Holocaust unleashed unexpectedly deep American Jewish feelings about Israel.The theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel would explain that American Jewry had taken the miracle of Israel for granted since 1948. “We saw the [Tel Aviv] Hilton and forgot Tel Hai,” he wrote, delighting in the achievements, neglecting the sacrifices. After June 1967, American Jews discovered an equally astonishing love for the land of Israel, not just the state.Jerusalem’s reunification had Jews celebrating the liberation of a city they had never visited and a Wall whose absence they barely noticed. The Israel American Jews embraced was the Israel of Jerusalem of Gold and Golda Meir; of evil – if impotent – Arab enemies and of heroic – but humane – Moshe Dayan-like sabra soldiers. It was an Israel that confronted the Jews’ worst fear, annihilation – and emerged alive, victorious, nearly three times larger.But despite its power, this Israel had values too, singing wistful hymns of peace, not bellowing lusty victory whoops. This Israel was an American Jewish liberal fantasy.It was tough enough to woo World War II veterans and survive Arab onslaughts, soft enough to charm their hippie kids with a socialism American Jews worshiped from afar but never wanted to endure.A decade later, reactions to Begin’s rise were subdued.American Jewish support surged for Begin after Time introduced him as Begin-rhymes-with-Fagin, Charles Dickens’ antisemitic character; after president Jimmy Carter’s prickly approach to Israel’s new premier; and after Begin the right-winger made peace with Anwar Sadat’s Egypt.Still, American Jews – particularly American Jewish liberals – lost their storybook Israel, their summer camp Israel, what New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman would call “your grandfather’s Israel.”Although courtly, urbane and eloquent, Begin had an Old Testament fury that dismissed New World illusions, making many squirm. He was an Old Jew, not a New Jew, not one of those sexy sabra-soldiers of ’67 and ‘73 who won wars, not arguments. His Israel was one of settlements, not kibbutzim, of Mizrahim not Ashkenazim, of capitalists not socialists, of Right not Left.The shift operated on at least four levels. First, considering the periodic dust-ups between America and Israel before 1977 – culminating with the harsh Gerald Ford-Henry Kissinger “reassessment” of March 1975, freezing government contacts with Israelis to pressure them diplomatically – further clashes were inevitable. But the narratives were changing. Increasingly liberal and secular American Jews faced increasingly conservative and traditional Israelis. Therefore, tensions that might have been dismissed as blips amid exaggerated assumptions that Israel-the-liberal-utopia could do no wrong, now proved that Israel-the-newly-conservative-alien, knocked off its pedestal, could do no right.Finally, I regret to note, the tensions transcended diplomacy and ideology. The overwhelmingly white, Ashkenazi upper middle class – or upper middle class wannabe – American Jewish community harbored class and ethnic disdain for Begin’s rougher, gruffer – and yes, poorer and darker – Israel. I remember American Jewish leaders, liberal professors I admired, sighing, shuddering, admitting, in those less politically correct times, that “those people” were not “our kind of Israeli.”Israeli comedian Dudu Topaz expressed this prejudice, most infamously, during a June 1981 election rally. Topaz contrasted his “beautiful Israel” with Begin’s “tchachtchachim,” an epithet stereotyping Mizrahim, Jews from Arab lands, as hooligans. The next night, speaking from that same spot, Begin, proudly unhip, pronounced the word awkwardly, as if it were a disease one could catch through mere utterance. Begin had never heard the term before, explaining he only knew the unity of all Israel when fighting for freedom together. Four decades later, on one level, the political, ideological and sociological rupture has grown. As in any relationship – especially among different groups – prejudices creep in. When American Jewish liberals yearn for “our grandfather’s Israel,” I cringe. Their grandfather’s Israel sent Mizrahim to third-rate development towns and gave Israeli Arabs second-class citizenship status. Today’s Israel – with all its faults – is much more enlightened and appealing. I hear the fractured fairy tale in their false nostalgia – and smell the bigotry. Given these differences – consistent American Jewish support for Israel hovering around 70% is the true miracle. There have been bonding moments too, including 9/11 when Americans and Israelis, Jews and non-Jews, united against terrorist evil. There have been ongoing communal glue guns – like Masa and Taglit-Birthright Israel. By introducing young Israelis and American Jews to one another, these programs help members of both communities learn from each other and build living bridges. As in any family, our relationship is deep enough to avoid divorcing every time we bicker. Loyalty doesn’t require uniformity, merely a capacity to respect difference. We also need enough vision to see past the smaller deviations that divide us while appreciating the common needs, values and challenges that unite us.

Soon thereafter, the field buzzed about ways to change the City’s outdated funding model to rebalance its investment in arts and culture. When the planning process began last fall, initial conversations were about dedicating more City money to the arts, so that everyone—large performing arts centers, community museums, neighborhood culturally explicit arts groups, individual artists, and public school children—would benefit. But the 2016 presidential election changed things. With the federal administration expected to make cuts to programs New Yorkers care about—affordable housing, healthcare, and climate resilience, for example—we should expect significant cuts to both the State and City’s budgets. This does not bode well for an expansion of the City’s investments in cultural affairs or arts education. The Department of Cultural Affairs’ piece of the pie is likely to shrink, not get bigger.The City has set many impressive goals for itself in the draft policy proposals for the Cultural Plan that were released on Monday. The planning team is asking City residents to vote on the final goals of the Cultural Plan, which will be released this July. After reading these proposed goals, we ask, how will the Cultural Plan fulfill Mayor de Blasio’s pledge to make New York a more equitable city? Talking about equity and acting on it are two different things. How will the City ensure that more resources flow directly into and sustain the leadership of historically marginalized communities? How will the plan make sure that funds earmarked for diversity, equity, and inclusion are not simply co-opted by mainstream groups at the exclusion of smaller, culturally explicit agencies that have been historically undercapitalized? How will it ensure that investments in diversifying talent pipelines benefit everyone, not just large, mainstream organizations? Overall, how can the Cultural Plan promote a truly equitable sector? Further, how will the City hold itself accountable? What policies will change, and what measures will be used to enact an equitable distribution of City funding that ensures smaller, grassroots groups benefit? How will the City change its funding formula to put its stated commitment to equity into action? As City Council Majority Leader Jimmy Van Bramer – also chair of the City’s Cultural Affairs Committee – said in a recent interview with the New York Times, “…budgets are statements of values, budgets are about priorities.”As funders committed to helping our City’s arts and cultural groups thrive, we want to advance a system that allows culture to flourish and ensures equal access for all New Yorkers, no matter where they live. We welcome creative thinking about ways to achieve cultural equity in our communities, and we encourage all New Yorkers to register their voices and demand equity in the Cultural Plan by reviewing the draft proposals and voting in the poll here.By Kerry McCarthy and Michelle Coffey, co-chairs of the New York City Cultural Agenda Fund in The New York Community Trust.

I’m thinking about the trillions of dollars, the million or more “enemy” dead (a striking percentage of them civilians), the tens of thousands of American combat casualties, those 20 veteran suicides each day, and the diminished lives of those who survive all of that. There’s that pain, carried by an unknown number of women and men, that won’t disappear, ever, and that goes by the label “moral injury.”The Lasting Pain of WarWhen I started Hooper’s War, a novel about the end of World War II in the Pacific, I had in mind just that pain. I was thinking ― couldn’t stop thinking, in fact ― about what really happens to people in war, combatants and civilians alike. The need to tell that story grew in large part out of my own experiences in Iraq, where I spent a year embedded with a combat unit as a U.S. State Department employee, and where I witnessed, among so many other horrors, two soldier suicides.The new book began one day when Facebook retrieved photos of Iraqi children I had posted years ago, with a cheery “See Your Memories” caption on them. Oh yes, I remembered. Then, on the news, I began seeing places in Iraq familiar to me, but this time being overrun by Islamic State militants or later being re-retaken with the help of another generation of young Americans. And I kept running into people who’d been involved in my war and were all too ready to share too many drinks and tell me too much about what I was already up all too many nights thinking about.As these experiences morphed first into nightmares and then into the basis for research, I found myself speaking with more veterans of more wars who continued to suffer in ways they had a hard time describing, but which they wrestled with every day. I realized that I understood them, even as they seemed to be trying to put their feelings into words for the first time. Many of them described how they had entered the battle zones convinced that “we’re the good guys,” and then had to live with the depth of guilt and shame that followed when that sense didn’t survive the test of events.Sometimes they were remarkably articulate, sometimes anything but. It seemed not to matter which war we were talking about ― or whether I was reading a handwritten diary from the Korean War, an oral history of the Pacific War, or an old bestseller about a conflict ironically labeled “the Good War.” The story always seemed to be the same: decisions made in seconds that lasted lifetimes, including the uncomfortable balancing of morality and expediency in situations in which a soldier might believe horrific acts like torture could save lives or had to accept civilian casualties in pursuit of military objectives. In war, you were always living in a world in which no action seemed ideal and yet avoiding acting was often inconceivable.PTSD and Moral InjuryMatthew Hoh, that former Marine, now a veterans advocate, introduced me to the phrase “moral injury,” though the term is usually attributed to clinical psychiatrist Jonathan Shay. He coined it in 1991 while working for the Department of Veterans Affairs.We are, of course, beings with a complex sense of right and wrong, which can be messed with in disastrous ways. There are boundaries inside us that can’t be crossed without a great price being paid. Though the term moral injury is fairly new, especially outside military circles, the idea is as old as war. When people sent into conflict find their sense of right and wrong tested, when they violate deeply held convictions by doing something (such as killing a civilian in error) or failing to do something (such as not reporting a war crime), they suffer an injury to their core being.Examples of this phenomenon are relatively commonplace in popular culture. Think of scenes from Tim O’Brien’s iconic Vietnam War book, The Things They Carried, William Manchester’s World War II odyssey, Goodbye Darkness, William Styron’s Sophie’s Choice, or films like William Wyler’s The Best Years of Our Lives and Oliver Stone’s Platoon.You can find similar examples as far back as the Iliad and as recently as late last night. Lisa Ling, for instance, was a former Air Force technical sergeant who worked in America’s armed drone program before turning whistleblower. She was perhaps typical when she told the makers of the documentary film National Bird that, in helping carry out drone strikes which killed people across the globe by remote control, “I lost part of my humanity.”Once upon a time, society expressed skepticism or worse toward such formulations, calling those who emerged visibly suffering from the acts of war “cowards” or dismissing them as fakes and frauds. Yet today post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a widely acknowledged condition that can be identified by MRI tests.PTSD and moral injury often occur together. “I think having both PTSD and moral injury are the normal things for us,” Ling says of those in the drone program. Moral injury, however, takes place at the intersection of psychology and spirituality, and so is, in a sense, all in someone’s head. When experiencing moral injury, a person wields guilt and/or shame as a self-inflicted penalty for a choice made. PTSD is more physical, more fear-based, and often a more direct response to an event or events witnessed in war.Think of it this way: PTSD is more likely to result from seeing something terrible, moral injury from doing something terrible.Civilians, TooMoral injury doesn’t just affect soldiers, but civilians, too. Noncombatants are not just victims or targets, but often complex participants in war. This reality led me, as my book developed, to interview now-elderly Japanese who had experienced World War II as children. They described the horrific choices they faced, even at a young age. In a wartime landscape of hunger, survival often depended on small, grim acts that would never be forgotten.Sometimes, I sensed in talking to them, as in interviewing former soldiers, that the psychic injuries of wartime don’t end until the sufferers do. Moral injury turns out to be a debt that often can never be repaid.Those survivors of the end of the war in Japan who got the food necessary to live had to pay a price for knowing what happened to those who didn’t. In a landscape ravaged by war, just because something wasn’t your fault doesn’t mean it won’t be your responsibility. An act as simple as which of her children a mother offered a disappearing supply of water to first could mean the difference between life and death. And though, in truth, it might have been impossible in such circumstances and at such an age to know that you were responsible for the death of your sister or brother, 70 years later you might still be thinking about it with an almost unbearable sense of guilt.And here’s a small footnote: Did you know that it’s possible to sit quietly on a Tokyo park bench in 2017, perfectly aware of whose distant relatives and countrymen dropped the bombs that took away the water that forced that mother to make that decision, and still shamefully continue taking notes, saying nothing as you witness someone else’s breakdown?The Trip BackWhat help can there be for something so human?There are, of course, the bad answers, all too often including opioids and alcohol. But sufferers soon learn that such substances just send the pain off to ambush you at another moment, and yet, as many told me, you may still look forward to the morning’s first throat-burning shot of something strong. Drinking and drugs have a way, however temporarily, of wiping out hours of pain that may stretch all the way back to the 1940s. You drink in the dark places, even after you understand that in the darkness you can see too much.Tragically, suicide is never far from moral injury. The soul isn’t that big a place.One former soldier told me he’s never forgiven his neighbor for talking him out of going into the garage with his rifle. Another said the question wasn’t why he might commit suicide, but why he hadn’t. Someone I met knows vets who have a “designated driver,” a keeper not of the car keys but of their guns during emotional rough patches.The Department of Veterans Affairs counts a stunning average of 20 veteran suicides a day in America. About 65% of those are individuals 50 years old or older with little or no exposure to the country’s twenty-first-century conflicts. No one tracks the suicide rate for civilians who survive war, but it’s hard to imagine that it isn’t high as well. The cause of all those self-inflicted deaths can’t, of course, be traced to any one thing, but the pain that grows out of moral injury is patient. For such sufferers, however, progress is being made, even if the trip back is as complex as the individual. The Department of Veterans Affairs now acknowledges moral injury and its effects, and in 2014 Syracuse University created the Moral Injury Project to bring together vets, doctors, and chaplains to work on how to deal with it. In the meantime, psychologists are developing diagnostic assessment tools for what some call “soul repair.”One effective path back seems to be through helping patients sort out just what happened to them and, when it comes to remembered transgressions, what part of those may be their own responsibility (though not necessarily their own fault). What doesn’t work, according to Matthew Hoh, is trying to convince veterans who view themselves as damaged that, in the present American manner, they are really heroes.Others suffering moral injury may try to deal with it by seeking forgiveness.Lisa Ling, for example, traveled to Afghanistan, with a desire to truly grasp her role in a drone program that regularly killed its victims from thousands of miles away. To her surprise, during an encounter with the relatives of some civilian victims of such drone strikes, they forgave her. “I didn’t ask for forgiveness,” Ling told me, referring to what she had done in the drone program, “because what I did was unforgivable.”Killing by remote control requires many hands. Ling worked on databases and IT networking. Analysts studied the information in those databases to recommend humans to target. Sensor operators manipulated lasers to pinpoint where a drone pilot would eventually slam his missile home for the kill.“Like all of us,” she added, “I spent time on the mission floor, or at briefings where I saw and heard devastating things, or blatant lies, but to actually connect my individual work to single events wasn’t possible due to the diffusion of responsibility. For sensor operators, it is more like stepping on ants. For analysts, they get to know people over time. As watchers and listeners, they describe an intimacy that comes with predictably knowing their family patterns. Kissing the kids, taking children to school, and then seeing these same people die.”Moral Injury and WhistleblowersAnother way back is for the sufferer to try to rebalance the internal scales a little by making amends of some sort. In the case of moral injury, this can often mean drawing a line between who one was then and who one might be now. Think of it as an attempt to re-inscribe those internal borders that were transgressed so long ago.Perhaps not so surprisingly, the connections between moral injury and whistleblowing, like those between moral injury and suicide, appear to run deep.For example, Iraq War whistleblower Chelsea Manning’s decision to leak video of civilian deaths caused by members of the U.S. military may have been her version of amends, driven by guilt over silently witnessing war crimes. Among the acts she saw, for instance, was a raid on a printing facility that had been billed as an al-Qaeda location but wasn’t. The U.S. military had, in fact, been tricked into shutting down the work of political opponents of Iraq’s then-prime minister Nouri al-Maliki. Until Manning finally tells her story, this remains speculative, but I was at the same forward operating base in Iraq as she was and know what happened and how it affected me, as well as the others around us.Whistleblowers (and I was one of them) talk of conscience, of a realization that we were part of something that was wrong. Jonathan Shay suggests that the failure of moral agency does not have to rest with the individual alone. It can involve witnessing a betrayal of “what’s right” by a person in legitimate authority.That part of moral injury could help explain one of the most significant whistleblowers of our time. In talking about his reasons for blowing the whistle, Edward Snowden invoked questions of right and wrong when it came to the actions of senior American government officials. It would be a worthy question to put to Snowden: How much guilt and shame ― the hallmarks of moral injury ― do you retain from having been part of the surveillance state, and how much was your whistleblowing driven by trying to rid yourself of it?After all, for those suffering from moral injury, the goal is always the same: to somehow reclaim the good parts of oneself and to accept ― but not be eternally defined by ― what one did or didn’t do.I know, because for me, this is so much more than fiction.My War at Home“You mean that Vietnam helicopter thing?” A well-meaning family doctor asked me this when I got back from Iraq in 2010, referring to the way some vets react to the sound of a helicopter, sending them “back to the jungle.” No, no, far more than that, I responded, and told him a little about my sorry role in administering reconstruction projects in Iraq and how it left me more interested in vodka than my family. That was my own personal taste of moral injury, of a deeply felt failure to accomplish any of the good I’d hoped to do, let down by senior leaders I once believed in. It’s why I tell the story in Hooper’s War in reverse order, opening with a broken Nate Hooper in his late eighties finally finding a form of redemption for the events of a few weeks at war when he was 18. By moving toward an innocent boy as far away in rural Ohio as one can be from war, I felt I was working through my own experience of the damage war causes deep inside the self.In tallying the costs of war, what’s the price of a quick death versus a slow one? A soldier who leaves his brains on the wall in the den two decades after his war ended or one whose body remains untouched but who left his mind 10,000 miles away?The price of endless war is beyond calculation. As our wars continue to morph and roll on, the costs ― financial, emotional, and in blood ― only pile up as the men and women who have been welcomed home as if it were all over continue to be torn apart. The nasty conclusion on the scales of moral injury: that our endless conflicts may indeed have left our society, one that just can’t stop itself from making war, among the casualties.Peter Van Buren, a TomDispatch regular and former State Department official, blew the whistle on waste and mismanagement during the “reconstruction” of Iraq in his book We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People.

44,POLITICS,Republicans Preview Their Upcoming Defense Of Trump: Blame Comey,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-trump-comey-blaming_us_591cb2dee4b094cdba50d463,"The ex-FBI director was asking for it, basically.",2017-05-17,House Speaker Paul Ryan speaks to reporters today about the Donald Trump-James Comey controversy,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591cc47f140000960005bbb4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Many House Republicans are dealing with the furor over whether President Donald Trump pressured then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an agency investigation by calling for more information. But some of the GOP lawmakers are transitioning to a new phase of a Trump defense: It’s just one man’s word against another.“Comey has been shown to obfuscate,” Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) told HuffPost on Wednesday. “He got fired ostensibly for not being truthful, or not following the law.”Perry, like every Republican interviewed by HuffPost, said he needed to see the memo that Comey apparently wrote following his February meeting with Trump where the president reportedly pressured him to stop probing former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials. But Perry also said that even if the memo was as damning as it might appear, it wouldn’t necessarily persuade him that Trump had done anything wrong.“Okay, so we have the memo,” he said in a hypothetical. “It’s one man’s opinion.”Perry was far from alone in raising questions about Comey’s assessment of the conversation with Trump, which occurred about three months before the president fired the FBI director last week. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) seemed to preview a similar argument Wednesday morning when he questioned Comey’s version of the events.“I’m sure we’re going to want to hear from Mr. Comey about why, if this happened as he allegedly describes, why didn’t he take action at the time,” Ryan said.Other Republicans ― while insisting they needed to know all the facts before saying anything substantive about the Comey matter ― offered similar arguments aimed at undermining his credibility. Rep. James Comer of Kentucky wondered why acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, who appeared before the Senate intelligence committee last week in the wake of Comey’s firing, hadn’t raised the issue of Trump pressuring Comey and potentially obstructing justice.“The biggest question I have is why didn’t McCabe mention this in his testimony,” Comer said. “If it’s as serious as some would lead us to believe, then why didn’t he bring that before the Congress under oath? And why did Comey wait three months before he issued or reported this memo?”The memo’s existence was first reported yesterday by The New York Times. The White House has denied Trump prodded Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) also brought up McCabe testifying that the FBI’s Russian investigation had not suffered from any interference. And he echoed Ryan’s point that if Trump had pressured Comey to end it, Comey had acted improperly.“If this were any kind of a serious matter at all, Comey had the absolute obligation to report that to the Justice Department; certainly let his deputy know, and yet, there’s no evidence of that,” King said. “[Comey] never told, as far as I know, the Senate or the House Intelligence committees about any type of threat, never indicated anything about it.”Fellow New York Republican Tom Reed also raised some doubts about simply accepting one memo from Comey on the issue.“In this day and age, coming down to one person’s word against another, I just don’t think that will happen,” Reed said.But if it did come down to accepting the word of a former FBI director testifying under oath over a president who has shown a serial problem with the truth, would it take more to sway Reed that impeachment proceedings against Trump might be warranted?“Yeah,” Reed said, “you know, especially when you’re dealing with hearsay and things like that. You do want corroboration. You want solid evidence to be the foundation upon which the process works, and hearsay is obviously historically something we question [in] the American system of law.”"

Peele made history this year when his hit film “Get Out” became the highest-grossing debut for a writer-director with an original screenplay. Meanwhile, Chance the Rapper made history in February when he became the first independent artist to win Best New Artist at the Grammys.In a conversation posted by Teen Vogue on Tuesday, Peele asked the 24-year-old rapper about the creative process and the conflicts of being a black content creator making art during a time of heightened racial tension in America. “I’m conflicted about this time we’re living in. Because on one hand, we’ve taken steps backward toward gross intolerance,” Peele said.“At the same time,” he continued, “we’re in this renaissance, specifically in regards to representation in black work, where you have black directors and content creators making and getting platforms to do elevated things that we wouldn’t have been able to do five years ago. The duality of the moment is really fascinating and scary. I don’t quite know what to make of it.”For Chance, representation and art created by young black people is more important now than ever because of the continued fight against racism and police brutality. He told Peele:The problem is that my generation was pacified into believing that racism existed only in our history books. Now we’re in the age of instant information, where just looking at Twitter we can find out that unarmed people of color are being murdered by the police at an alarming rate. It’s kind of the same as when your generation saw Rodney King. There were a bunch of people who stood up and said, “Hey, this is happening all the time, and you guys just happen to know about it now because there’s video footage.” The police force is systematically racist, and it is designed so that they have the right to murder us and not face the same consequences as anyone else. But it is the young folks, the twentysomethings across history, that say, “Hey, we about to switch sh*t up.” I think we just happen to be the generation that makes the change.Read the rest of the interview at Teen Vogue.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the senators’ letter. Sessions promised to recuse himself from Justice Department investigations relating to the 2016 election in May, after he admitted that during his confirmation hearings, he did not disclose contacts he’d had with the Russian ambassador last year. The New York Times reported that senior White House and Justice Department officials “had been working on building a case” against Comey, and “Sessions had been charged with coming up with reasons to fire him.”On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that President Donald Trump personally asked Comey to shut down the FBI investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to Russian officials, according to a memo written by Comey about the February meeting. Sessions was not present at that meeting.Sessions is now, along with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, leading the search for the next FBI director. Stephen Gillers, a New York University School of Law professor specializing in legal ethics, said Sessions “reneged on his recusal promise to the Senate” by being part of Comey’s firing, although he said the attorney general could be involved in choosing his replacement in a limited capacity.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

47,POLITICS,Republicans Show No Signs They’re Ready To Break With Trump As Scandals Pile Up,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congressional-republicans-trump-scandals_us_591b902ae4b041db89654aa6,"“If the president is unpopular, it makes their agenda unpopular.""",2017-05-17,"Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) speaks with Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) June 16, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b91d51e0000280062367a.jpeg?ops=crop_0_84_4928_3121%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Reports Tuesday that fired FBI Director James Comey’s notes say President Donald Trump pressured him to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn sparked another wave of shock and outrage on Capitol Hill ― and even talk of impeachment among the usually reserved.The revelations, reportedly based on a memo Comey wrote after meeting with the president in February, pushed Republicans into a familiar posture: trying to avoid Trump’s mess without actually doing anything about it.Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chair of the committee tasked with investigating whether Flynn or other Trump associates were linked to Russian efforts to influence the election, insisted the burden of proof was on The New York Times, which broke the story, to publish the Comey memo ― even though he can subpoena it.Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) wouldn’t comment on the Times report, but scolded reporters for pursuing the “wrong” story. There’s a “weasel in here somewhere,” he said, referring to whoever leaked the previous day’s Trump scandal about the president sharing secret intelligence with Russian officials.“This person is a traitor, they’ve committed treason, and they ought to go to prison,” Risch said.Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.), a Trump ally, declined to comment, except to say there have been a lot of “misleading reports.”Congressional Republicans have grown accustomed to comments like these. With Trump seeming to tumble into a fresh scandal every few days, his supporters in the House and Senate have mastered ways of expressing disappointment, but doing nothing. When Flynn was forced to resign four weeks into the new administration over secret discussions with Russian officials, congressional Republicans were concerned but stood by the president. When Trump’s nominees to lead the departments of treasury, and health and human services misled Congress during confirmation hearings, GOP members were bothered but stood by the president. When Trump fired Comey, reportedly for refusing to promise loyalty, they were alarmed but stood by the president. And when the Washington Post reported on Monday night that Trump shared “highly classified” intelligence with the Russian foreign minister and ambassador, they were shocked and dismayed but stood by the president.Through all the expressions of GOP concern, nothing much has changed. While Trump ally Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) conceded that the White House appears to be in a “downward spiral,” other GOP lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appear troubled only by the unending drama and nuisance created by such scandals. McConnell has remained unwavering in his support for the president, dismissing calls for a select committee, an independent commission or a special prosecutor to investigate possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) didn’t skip a beat when Trump fired Comey, adamantly defending the move. Trump “lost patience,” he said, and people in the Justice Department had “lost confidence” in the FBI director. There’s no denying that months of bombshells have hampered the GOP’s agenda, creating distractions and making elected officials a little slower to offer public support. But rather than distancing themselves from Trump, Republicans are gently expressing tempered criticisms and the occasional admonishment, doing little in the way of constraining the administration or conducting effective oversight.That leaves open the question of whether there will come a point when Republicans would actually bolt from the president. Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia, an election prognosticator for House, Senate and presidential races, said the breaking point is “to be determined.”“If you’re a Republican senator and you’re critical of Trump, you’re critical of someone your own base of supporters is still pretty supportive of,” Kondik said. A recent Crystal Ball poll showed Trump’s approval among his own voters at 93 percent. “They are supposed to be in the honeymoon period, and it’s not like Republicans in the Senate have been 100-percent glowing about his presidency,” Kondik said. “Now, how much of that is window dressing and actual practical opposition remains to be seen. Republican senators don’t want to kneecap their president unless they absolutely have to.” Kondik said he sees only about three Senate Republicans who really stand to lose by not breaking with Trump ― Sens. Dean Heller (Nev.), Susan Collins (Maine), and Cory Gardner (Colo.). All three represent states won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton last year. But even those three senators have kept their Trump criticisms abstract. Collins told reporters on Monday she’d like to have one “crisis-free day.” But she has yet to call for a special prosecutor, and votes the party line the majority of the time. Party loyalty, of course, is not confined to Republican ranks. In the age of hyper-partisanship, everyone from voters to politicians gravitates toward party identification and ideological symmetry. Trump seemed primed to challenge this order, if only for his immense unpopularity and the seemingly endless wave of scandals that have engulfed his administration. Numerous news reports have predicted Republicans are about to break from the president. But most have chosen to simply create non-substantive distance. Corker is a perfect example. A close confidante of the Trump White House, he acknowledged after Flynn’s departure that the “dribble” of information about the administration’s relationship with Russia was making it impossible to get work done. And when Comey was fired, Corker said the administration “understand(s) that they’ve created a really difficult situation for themselves to move beyond this in a way that gives the American people faith and Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate faith.” But Corker wouldn’t say if a special prosecutor was needed, or if the Senate should request more briefings, or form a select committee.When it comes to voting, Republicans have been in lockstep with Trump. That’s not just because the administration has given them a steady offering of conservative legislation. It’s because breaking with Trump would make it harder to enact their own agenda.  “If the president is unpopular, it makes their agenda unpopular,” Kondik said.A well-placed former GOP leadership aide disagreed that a “smoking gun” would do Trump in, saying instead that the growing pile of scandal would eventually cause Republicans to make a run for it. “There is no one thing that will be the ‘straw that breaks the camel’s back,’” the longtime leadership aide said, speaking anonymously in order to provide a more candid assessment. “It’s cumulative: Firing the FBI director, sharing information with the Russians ... it all just adds up over time.“If this keeps up, you’re going to see more distance between Hill Republicans and the White House, particularly in the Senate,” the former GOP aide continued. “Every House member has to face voters next year ― but few senators are in a vulnerable situation.”For now, Republicans appear content with occasionally acknowledging that the White House did a bad thing, but nothing more. As McConnell said Tuesday, he’d be happy with “a little less drama from the White House.”"
48,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders And Top Progressive Leaders Cheer Larry Krasner Win In Philadelphia DA Primary,Kim Bellware and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/larry-krasner-wins-philadelphia-district-attorney-primary_us_591b8dfbe4b041db8965494a,Krasner's primary victory is part of a trend embracing reform-minded district attorneys.,2017-05-17,"Larry Krasner, a criminal defense attorney, won the Democratic nomination for Philadelphia district attorney on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b92021500002000db2b1d.jpeg?cache=rUTOIIrXX7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Top progressive leaders are hailing Democratic candidate Larry Krasner’s Tuesday night victory in the Philadelphia primary for district attorney. The race drew national interest as part of a growing trend of reform-minded candidates overtaking tough-on-crime prosecutors in what had historically been safe seats. Though Krasner is a heavy favorite come November, the Democratic National Committee plans to watch the general election race closely and help the Pennsylvania Democratic Party as needed, highlighting the contrast between Krasner and Republican opponent Beth Grossman.On Wednesday, Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders congratulated Krasner and wished him luck in the general election. “At a time when Attorney General [Jeff] Sessions is pushing the Department of Justice to restart the failed ‘War on Drugs,’ it is refreshing to see voters choose a prosecutor who wants to treat addiction as an illness, not a crime, and move to end mass incarceration,” Sanders said. “Krasner’s primary victory is an important step forward in the fight to reform a very broken criminal justice system.”Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, a former civil rights attorney, said in a statement there was “no better person” to lead Philadelphia’s DA office.“[Larry Krasner will] fight for a fair and smart criminal justice system that keeps Philadelphia’s communities safe, push for accountable policing, and oppose the Trump administration’s attacks on Philadelphia’s immigrant communities,” Perez said in a statement. Krasner earned about 38 percent of the vote in the seven-candidate primary. Joe Khan, the closest challenger, earned just over 20 percent of the vote. In February, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams announced he would not seek a third term. Williams, who came into office with a message of reform, has been seen as a disappointment by progressive voters with his heavy use of asset forfeiture and his decision to sue Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf for declaring a moratorium on the death penalty. Williams has been indicted on 29 federal fraud charges involving campaign funds and other financial disclosures. Progressive advocates and reformers from across the country, including the Democratic Socialists of America, veterans of the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and the Black Lives Matter movement, flocked to Krasner’s campaign and viewed it as an opportunity to notch a symbolically important win against the hard-line criminal justice agenda of President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Sessions subscribes to a lock-’em-up approach to crime that was in vogue in the high-crime 1980s and 1990s but has since fallen out of favor with conservative and liberal experts alike. He has already instructed federal prosecutors to pursue maximum penalties for drug-related offenses, effectively undoing reforms initiated by the Barack Obama administration.But the feds’ approach to crime stands in sharp contrast with how an overwhelming number of Americans are voting, said John Pfaff, a criminal law professor at Fordham University School of Law. “Prosecutors respond to the electorate that chose them: Philadelphians made it clear that they wanted a reformer, so Krasner will respond to that far more than whatever overheated rhetoric is coming out of D.C.,” Pfaff said by email Tuesday.Pfaff noted the local desire for reform is strong throughout the country ― even in some areas that voted for Trump. He cited Oklahoma as a prime example, where 65 percent of residents voted for Trump, one of the largest margins in the country. At the same time, 55 percent of them voted in favor of two referendums that decriminalized drug offenses and shifted resources into treatment.The desire to strike a blow for criminal justice reform is especially strong in Philadelphia, which had the fourth-highest per capita jail population among the 50 cities and counties with the highest rates as of 2008, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts Philadelphia Research Initiative.Philadelphia’s use of cash bail, which has been criticized for being effectively a poor tax that traps low-level offenders, increased from 2003 to 2009, and with average cash bail amounts jumping 39 percent over the same period, according to Pew.Krasner opposes practices like cash bail, as well as financial asset forfeiture, the death penalty and mass incarceration ― all reliably progressive stances. Yet instead of setting him apart as an outlier, Krasner’s leanings effectively pulled the other candidates toward more progressive stances as well, Philly Mag noted. “I think we will see state and local governments take consistently more reformist approaches than the feds in the years ahead, but that’s not too surprising; that was the pattern under Obama as well,” professor Pfaff said. Around the country, in counties that encompass cities including Chicago, Cleveland and Jacksonville, a combination of declining overall crime rates and grassroots activism have pushed the trend of prosecutorial reform. The Pennsylvania branch of the Working Families Party, a labor union-backed progressive faction, was among those groups to endorse Krasner early. The WFP estimates that as of Tuesday it will have knocked on over 70,000 doors in its efforts to elect Krasner.Working Families Party national communications director Joe Dinkin predicted that a win for Krasner would reverberate well beyond Philadelphia.“He’ll set the pace across America for a criminal justice reformer, because he knows that justice is what makes communities safe, not super-harsh sentencing,” Dinkin told HuffPost early Tuesday. “This is a tide-turning election,” Rashad Robinson, a spokesman for the criminal justice reform PAC, Color of Change, which supported Krasner, said after his win Tuesday. “At a time when Attorney General Jeff Sessions wants to reignite the discriminatory and failed drug war, Philadelphia can be a beacon to the nation of what real criminal justice reform looks like.”Deborah Tuerkheimer, a criminal law professor at Northwestern University’s law school who has monitored several of the high-profile DA races, noted that local prosecutors are uniquely poised to mitigate ― or abet ― the agenda of Trump’s administration. She cited Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, who has made efforts to fight the administration’s aggressive approach to immigrant deportations. “I think it matters who is in these positions,” Tuerkheimer said. “Local prosecutors can do more to make a dent in mass incarceration than anything federal prosecutors or the attorney general will be able to do.” This story has been updated to include comments from Perez, Sanders and Tuerkheimer."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/regulatory-accountability-act_us_591c84ffe4b034684b08c007,The bill would allow businesses to exploit new layers of red tape in the government rule-making process.,2017-05-17,Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell listens as Sen. Rob Portman (L) speaks during a media briefing after the Senate Republican weekly policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591c87491e00003a00623872.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senate Republicans advanced a bill on Wednesday that environmentalists say would thwart rules to protect public health and wildlife by making it easier for companies to tie up regulations in expensive lawsuits. Shrouded by the political chaos surrounding the White House, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the Regulatory Accountability Act that would impose dozens of new requirements on the government rule-making process. That will make it easier for businesses to trip up regulators with unnecessary steps, environmentalists say. “This bill is for polluters and others who want to escape accountability ― not for the American people,” Scott Slesinger, legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. “It would make it virtually impossible to safeguard the public from dirty air, unsafe food, contaminated drinking water and other threats.”The act proposes adding 53 requirements to the regulatory process, including a mandate that all rules with an economic impact exceeding $110 million go through a lengthy review. The bill would, for example, make it harder for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to update meat and poultry safety standards, the Food and Drug Administration to issue new rules on opioids and the Mine Safety and Health Association to upgrade protections for workers without clearing high hurdles set by deep-pocketed meat, pharmaceutical and mining companies.  Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the bill’s sponsor, said it would “provide certainty for businesses” and ensure regulations are cost effective. “This bill would create a smarter regulatory process that promotes job creation, innovation, and economic growth, while also continuing to protect public health and safety and the environment,” Portman said in a statement. “We will continue to work with members on both sides of the aisle to get their input, and I would urge the Senate to take up this common-sense, bipartisan bill.”The Center for Biological Diversity, though, argued the act would effectively give “powerful corporate interests like pesticide companies and the oil industry veto power over new regulations.”“This is a disturbing and deceptive attack on core environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act,” Jamie Pang, endangered species campaigner and policy specialist at the center, said in a statement after the committee vote. “Republicans know conservation laws are popular, so they use cynical bills with misleading titles to confuse the public. Their real goal is to make it almost impossible to create new protections for our air, water and imperiled wildlife.”The bill is part of a larger assault by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans on the standards used by agencies to draft rules, giving industries more say over the regulations meant to govern them. In March, Trump repealed a regulation to protect workers from wage theft. That same month, the EPA scrapped a rule requiring oil and gas drillers to report leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Last month, the White House killed a regulation meant to help workers save for retirement. The Senate panel also pushed forward two other bills on Wednesday to buttress the Regulatory Accountability Act. The Midnight Rules Review Act would allow Congress to overturn new regulations en masse, circumventing specific debate on issues such as federal overtime protections, financial regulations and offshore drilling rights.The American Sustainable Business Council came out against bill in January. “This would be like taking a chainsaw into surgery,” David Levine, the group’s chief executive said in a statement at the time.The Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny bill ― known as the REINS Act ― would require new regulations with an economic impact larger than $100 million to be approved by Congress. It also would require at least one chamber of Congress to approve any new regulation within 70 days of the rule’s proposal.“This process would effectively give a small number of senators veto power over any new significant public health and safety protection,” said Jack Pratt, chemicals campaign director at the Environmental Defense Fund.

50,POLITICS,The 'I’m Really Smart' President Faces Crises Of Ignorance,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-crisis-ignorance_us_591cc784e4b03b485cae62f4,Trump’s defenders now argue  he shouldn’t be blamed for his mistakes because he doesn’t know any better.,2017-05-17,"President Donald Trump speaks during the United States Coast Guard Academy Commencement Ceremony in New London, Connecticut U.S., May 17, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591cc8fe2e000021009359f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Just months after Donald Trump’s repeated campaign boasts about how smart he is, his White House and defenders now seem to be arguing exactly the opposite: that he shouldn’t be held accountable for his lapses because he doesn’t really understand what he is doing.When Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, defended the president’s sharing of sensitive intelligence information with Russian diplomats during an Oval Office visit last week, McMaster’s eventual explanation was that Trump could not have known the possible consequences of what he had done.“The president wasn’t even aware, you know, where this information came from,” McMaster said.The White House had to scramble after the Russians departed to let the CIA and the National Security Agency know what Trump had just said, presumably to inform Israel. The information in question reportedly came from Israeli intelligence ― and Russia is allied with Syria and Iran in the Syrian civil war, possibly risking the life of the Israeli agent who obtained the material.“He doesn’t have a lot of experience with classified information,” said Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak. “There’s a little bit of a learning curve there.”The White House did not respond to a HuffPost query for this article, but that “learning curve” argument has become common among Trump defenders, who argue that an “outsider” businessman should not be expected to understand the intricacies of government policy.Trump critics, particularly those who are Republicans, say they find that rationale offensive, and see the latest episodes as proof that their warnings were correct all along.“His erratic and dangerous behavior is just not sustainable,” said John Weaver, who managed Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s campaign for the GOP presidential nomination last year. “Six months ago, people were beating the hell out of us. … Not so much anymore.”The latest examples of Trump’s lack of knowledge and lack of interest in acquiring it fit into a pattern stretching back to the start of his presidency, on issues both large and small.In February, at an event commemorating Black History Month, Trump expounded on the virtues of Frederick Douglass, the Civil War-era abolitionist, as if he were an obscure figure, and in a manner that suggested Trump didn’t realize he has been long dead. “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice,” he said.During the crafting of the House bill to partially repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, Trump explained that he only just learned that making one change in the health care system has multiple effects in other areas. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” he said.Similarly, after numerous claims that China could easily deal with North Korea’s nuclear militancy, Trump said that a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping brought him new insight into the centuries-long history of the two nations. “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,” Trump told The Wall Street Journal.Trump could have informed himself on both topics as a private citizen, as a candidate running for the highest office in the country, or even as president ― by taking advantage of the expertise in his own Health and Human Services and State departments. Instead, he entered into discussions requiring background knowledge largely uninformed ― and then described his newfound information as if it were a major discovery.(Even with a health care bill now passed out of the House, it is still not clear Trump understands how the system works. In a May 4 interview with The Economist, he described it this way: “Insurance is, you’re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you’re 70, and you really need it, you’re still paying the same amount and that’s really insurance” ― an explanation that does not at all reflect how health insurance actually works in this country.)All of this has presented a challenge for White House staffers, who each day try to brief a president who is not terribly interested in being briefed and loses attention quickly.HuffPost reported not long after he took office that Trump did not like briefing books, and preferred memos no longer than a single page that used bullet points, and contained no more than nine bullet points on that page.And Reuters reported Wednesday that National Security Council aides prepping Trump for his upcoming foreign trip, the first of his tenure, have made sure to include his name frequently in the briefing material because “he keeps reading if he’s mentioned.”Trump’s lack of knowledge about national and world affairs was abundantly clear during the 18-month presidential campaign, when he frequently and repeatedly made incorrect statements on topics including illegal immigration, crime rates, trade policy and terrorism.Trump himself, though, sold himself as a man of great intellect, often pointing out that his uncle had taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Good genes, very good genes. Okay? Very smart,” he said at a South Carolina rally.Many of his supporters appeared ready to accept Trump’s version of himself, often offering the explanation that as a successful businessman, he was obviously smart enough to learn what he needed to become a successful president.In reality, Trump’s business record has been mixed, at best. He took over his father’s real estate company at the age of 28 in 1974. Its value in today’s dollars was close to $1 billion. Despite that start, Trump underperformed both the stock market and, even more dramatically, the real estate market over the decades, leaving him with a net worth billions lower than if he had simply liquidated his assets and invested in those funds.He ran his family business much as he runs the White House now ― based on whims with little research. This resulted in his ownership of a money-losing airline, and put him on the brink of personal bankruptcy after his purchases of several Atlantic City casinos.Trump’s main business in recent years has been licensing his name to hotel and condominium buildings that he does not own ― thanks to the success of his TV show, “The Apprentice,” in which he played a savvy and decisive businessman.“He’s clearly a great salesman,” Mackowiak said. “He’s developed a brand a long time. And a lot of voters found that appealing.”Republican National Committee members and donors also bought into the Trump “brand” last year, after it became clear that Trump, and not one of the favored “establishment” candidates, would win the GOP nomination. Only now, with Trump’s ignorance manifesting itself almost daily, are some of them coming to appreciate what happened.“People in the process don’t understand how little people outside the process know about either the process or the substance of the issues in government,” said a senior RNC member on the condition of anonymity. “I think the assumption is that subject knowledge can be handled by appointees. Get good people with knowledge and they will fill in the gaps. The problem comes when you don’t have knowledge and try to do it yourself, instead of deferring to those with knowledge.”Other Republicans see a much less charitable explanation for their party’s continued support for Trump: an expectation that Trump would be so malleable and so uninterested in policy details that he would sign whatever legislation they put on his desk.“They would let Donald Trump kill and eat their children if they can get their business tax cut,” said Rick Wilson, a Florida consultant who supported Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the primary, and has remained a vocal Trump critic all along.Wilson said some in his party may have seen Trump’s behavior as showmanship ― an act to win the presidency. The events and revelations of recent days, Wilson said, should help clear that up.“The mania and lunacy wasn’t an act,” he said. “It’s a true, honest-to-God political train wreck.”"

They weren’t amused.“Call Alex in my office,” said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), the bill’s author.Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said he wanted to re-read the bill before responding. But he said the president didn’t break any laws. “The president’s ability to communicate whatever he wants to, without it being a breach of the law, is very clear.

In August, the campaign of then-GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump hammered its Democratic rival for her ties to the firm. Breitbart News, the conservative news site that Steve Bannon led until he became White House chief strategist, criticized Clinton for sitting on the board of directors for LafargeHolcim’s North American division 25 years ago. “More than any major presidential nominee in modern history, Hillary Clinton is tied to brutal theocratic and Islamist regimes,” Stephen Miller, a senior Trump policy adviser, said at the time. “Now we learn she has accepted money from a company linked to ISIS.”Neither Shane Scanlon, a spokesman for Gianforte, nor the White House responded to requests for comment on Wednesday morning.

God bless. Much love!”Jordan was killed on April 29, when police in Balch Springs, Texas, responded to reports of underage drinking at a local house party and several teens fled the area, according to reports. Jordan died of a single rifle wound to the head after former officer Roy Oliver opened fire on a car the high school freshman and three other teens were riding in.The incident led Balch Springs Police Chief Jonathan Haber to fire Oliver, and the police chief admitted he initially “misspoke” when he said the car was moving “aggressively” toward police when they fired at it multiple times. Dallas County prosecutors have since charged Oliver with murder in connection with the shooting.Following Bryant’s gesture, Edwards family attorney S.

He was constantly pushing himself to be better, learn more and grow within an industry that typically only opens its gates for a select number of artists. In “I Am Heath Ledger,” the new documentary airing on Spike Wednesday night, viewers get a glimpse into Ledger’s personal goings-on and what he hoped to accomplish, not just as an actor, but as a “multidimensional artist,” before his tragic and untimely death at age 28 in January 2008. “The end game, ultimately, for Heath was to produce and direct feature films, and that passion was leading to some amazing opportunities for him and would have been something incredible for him to fulfill,” director Derik Murray told HuffPost in a sit-down interview following the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of “I Am Heath Ledger” last month. Matt Amato, Ledger’s friend who co-founded the production company The Masses with him, echoed that statement to HuffPost, explaining Ledger was ready “to flip the paradigm of this male-driven, macho bullshit culture that we’re drowning in” with his directorial debut, “The Queen’s Gambit,” which was sadly never made. The movie, based on the book of the same name, would have told the story of a woman who struggles with alcohol addiction as she works her way into the chess championships. “Matt and many of the [’I Am Heath Ledger’] cast would talk about the fact that Heath would be as interested in what the role had to offer as he was to who the director was,” Murray said of Ledger’s decision to take on certain projects. “He would look at those directors and he would be very much present during the filming and be learning from them each step of the way. He talked about how his passion was to be a director with ‘Queen’s Gambit,’ but it wasn’t to be.” Below, Murray, co-director Adrian Buitenhuis, and Amato talk with HuffPost about their documentary and Ledger’s craft, constantly alluding to the fact that everyone can learn a little something from the actor, who left this world far too soon. Congratulations on the premiere. Looks like it was a wonderful night. Derik Murray: I think what made the Tribeca premiere really special for all of us was that the family was there and many of the close friends that were interviewed for the movie. For many of them, that was the first time they saw the movie and so there was a lot of anticipation on our part as to how that would go ― not fearful, just anticipation — but it was fabulous. Everybody loved the movie.Had Heath’s family been given the chance to see the film beforehand? DM: We showed Heath’s family a rough cut, frankly for the purposes of talking about archive and pulling more material together and making sure we had some of the facts straight. But also, with the trust we built with them, we wanted to extend that [option], so we showed them the rough cut and that was a very emotional experience for them. They called us at 1 o’clock in the morning, very emotional about the movie and very much at the state of mind that they had no idea what it was going to be — they couldn’t really visualize it — but the message loud and clear to us was that it was Heath. It really captured his spirit.Matt, I’m truly sorry for your loss. This couldn’t have been necessarily easy for you. What was this film process like? Matt Amato: I’m just coming out of the end of a six-month journey, and I’m relieved. The important thing for me was the family, and they love it, and now it’s about the audience’s feelings about the movie. It exists now for the audience and I hope it’s inspiring for young people to not waste a minute of their life — to really, live, live, live.What did you want an audience member to leave the theater or a viewing of this film thinking or feeling? Adrian Buitenhuis: I definitely wanted people to be inspired. Inspired to see what you can do in your life and what you’re capable of. And also to show someone who, even if they gained a lot of success ― at least in Heath’s case ― [didn’t] forget about his friends or his family and kept them really close. It’s a nice testament to how to have relationships in your life. He made everyone close to him feel special in a way. He never looked down on anyone, from what I can tell making the film, and was inspiring his friends to be better and they were inspiring him. To see him as an artist and his work, and being able to work with his work, was really great.He’s kind of like a director of the movie in a way, because it’s a lot of his photography and footage that’s shown throughout. DM: We’ve been talking about this for quite some time, is that Heath, in many ways when making the film, would direct the storyline with all the footage that came forward to us. We’ve been calling him a director/co-director/partner all the way through.How did you go about gathering the photos and footage Heath captured?DM: When we first started doing the research, we realized Heath was much more than just this star of his generation or his acting ability — he was a multidimensional artist. When we learned that, we did some research on Matt’s involvement and his relationship with Heath and The Masses and, in that world, Heath was in partnership creatively with Matt, in business, and doing some amazing work with music videos and working with various artists, and that was something that Heath was very passionate about. The end game, ultimately, for Heath was to produce and direct feature films together, and that passion was leading to some amazing opportunities for him and would have been something incredible for him to fulfill.On the footage, through Matt, we had access to these music videos and then Matt was kind enough to open the door to some of the content that Heath had filmed and also content that had been filmed of Heath through his personal journey. That then basically started a dialogue with the family about the content that they might have through the estate and then friends stepped forward and provided us with their content, as well. So it was really a community effort that brought all that content together that you now see on the screen that captures Heath in an amazing way, through his own lens.For those who only know Heath as an actor, it really opens those doors for you to see him as a human being. MA: Yes, he was pretty wonderful. We talked a lot about directing and what we’d do if we moved forward with our company together ... Heath’s vision was an authentic vision. We were going on to make “The Queen’s Gambit,” which would’ve been his first movie, and I’m sure he was going to nail that. He was going to be working with his favorite cinematographer, Ed Lachman, who does amazing work with Todd Haynes. Heath was so turned on by how Todd works with Ed and he got a lot of clues about how we should work. He was not impressed with big money movies. He really liked how Todd worked with his producer, Christine Vachon, and all the sets and locations. A lot of times when Heath would do a movie, he would just completely drop off the map, because when you’re making a movie you have to stay focused and it’s like a 24-hour day, but I knew that he’d resurface when he was done. But with “I’m Not There,” he called me every day, like, “Man, we did that! And we did this! Oh my God, we’re making art!” He was just so thrilled to be working with Todd Haynes. So, as directors, we were very against the hierarchy kind of thing. When we did our music videos together with the crew, we would be the ones to go to Home Depot and get the mops and the brooms and get food for craft service, so when the crew would arrive, they’d see us doing that stuff …DM: Heath Ledger on craft service!AB: That was probably a mean craft service.MA: Yeah, he really cared about people. But then, once we got there, we would work to his max. Then, he would never really care about people’s complaints, you know, because we had set the bar. His energy and passion is something I think about all the time when I have a camera in my hands. Heath really kicks my butt.It seems he inspires you to this day. MA: I was working on the day he died, on a Bon Iver video in Wisconsin. I didn’t know what to do at that point — the world was just kind of turned upside down in one moment. I really thought long and hard about what I was so supposed to do — stay or go to LA or New York? And I thought to myself, “Well, what would Heath want me to do?” He wants me to shoot with a camera and create something beautiful, that’s what he wants me to do. He doesn’t want me to stop and worry and be sad. So from the moment he died, he was kicking my butt, and he still does it. He gives me the energy to work harder, to explore camera angles and shots, to push myself to make something as excellent as it could possibly be.The whole thing about Heath’s intelligence and his growth, each movie he did he became smarter — he was really absorbing everything. And that was big for a young person to not come off as a know-it-all or be threatened. He wanted to know. And that curiosity allowed him to be open and get really, really smart. I believe that by the time he died, he was quite brilliant. It would have been nice to see what “The Queen’s Gambit” could have been.MA: Hopefully we’ll make “Queen’s Gambit.” We’ll do it in St. Louis, with Ed Lachman. St. Louis has now become the chess capital of the world ... My little work co-op is right around the corner and there’s the world’s largest chess piece there, and it’s the Queen. It’s like right there, and I look at it and I’m like, “I’m no dummy! I can see the sign!” It’s about a young women, and we really wanted to flip the paradigm of this male-driven, macho bullshit culture that we’re drowning in. I feel like our culture really needs nurturing in this way and we need to be reflective and look at people and deal with people like this.AB: You guys valued the fact that there was a big community of artists in LA who valued the stuff that didn’t have a place to come together.MA: Yeah. Heath was ready to chuck LA for the next chapter. He wanted it to be in Brooklyn so he could be near [his daughter with Michelle Williams] Matilda. He was ready to leave all that behind. I loved that the film focused on his life and his art at the end, rather than the media circus that surrounded his death. DM: It’s interesting because we’re doing, and have been doing, a lot of work of this kind where we work with the families and estates. But this film, when the assembly was coming together, there was all sorts of media clips that were helpful in moving the story forward, but Heath’s footage really just kind of took a hold, took a different spirit, and said, “This is the path we’re going to go down.” It was clear that the media footage was completely in contrast with who Heath was. We already learned in the film that it was something he wasn’t comfortable with, so you’re really seeing the true Heath in these one-on-ones or sit-down interviews. As we started pulling those out and letting it breathe, and giving more space to Heath to tell the story, the film really became and transformed itself into the film it is today.MA: And music was really important to me. I really wanted to flood this production with music. Music that he was responsive to. I wanted music to sail us over the sad parts ― because music can do that, it does transcend. Bon Iver is one of the greatest musicians in the world today and to have his music in our movie is such a gift.DM: Two fabulous Ben Harper songs are in the film, we’ve got two Bon Iver songs — they’re there for a purpose and a reason, and they’re beautiful. Their compliment to the story is incredible.MA: Mia Doi Todd, Carlos Niño, Edward Sharpe. These were all people that Heath admired, and there were more to put in, but we had to stop some place.AB: All the artists were so generous because either Heath had a big impact on their lives or they were just inspired to be a part of it and lend their music to the project. It was a real collective. The same way people brought the footage together, musicians were coming and saying, “Yeah this is important, let’s do this.” And that was great.DM: That’s why the cast is so eclectic, you know, it’s not just driven by actors that were working with him on films. It has that music component to a significant degree.To see the moving documentary on Heath Ledger’s life, tune in to Spike at 10 p.m. ET on Wednesday, May 17.

Among the former Obama administration officials taking the plunge: Deanna Archuleta, left, who is running for mayor of Albuquerque; Kelly Gonez, who just won an L.A. school board seat; and Andrew Kim, who is exploring a run against Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5915f4dd1600001a22c5af41.jpeg?cache=SbzYJ8AMK1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― At a town hall last week in Willingboro, New Jersey, angry constituents screamed at Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur for a good five hours over his leading role in passing an Obamacare replacement bill. When they walked outside, Andrew Kim was there, eagerly awaiting them.Kim, 34, has his eye on MacArthur’s seat in Congress. He’s never run for office. And until recently he had no interest in elected office. As a national security expert who spent years advising President Barack Obama, Kim has long envisioned a career of rising up the ranks of the State Department and the Pentagon, serving his country as a bureaucrat or a behind-the-scenes operative. But then Donald Trump became president, and, like a good chunk of the country, Kim was horrified and began rethinking his career plan.At first he tried conventional political activism. Kim started a grassroots group in November, Rise Stronger, that has mobilized more than 50,000 people to take action in response to the Trump administration.But that didn’t calm his nerves. He started looking for other avenues for fighting Trump’s agenda. He watched his congressman, MacArthur, support the president’s ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and then craft a critical amendment to weaken the Affordable Care Act’s pre-existing condition protections. He grew more convinced that a run for office was his only recourse. Soon, Kim was raising money for a potential campaign.“It became a deeply personal decision when I saw that a person from my district was leading the charge on a piece of legislation like this,” Kim said. “He is not looking out for the people I grew up with in these communities that I learned to play baseball in and learned my ABCs in.”Kim, the son of immigrants who moved to America for a better life, is among a growing number of Obama administration alums who are trying their hand at electoral politics. That it took this long is what’s surprising. Obama, after all, was supposed to inspire a generation of youth to run for office, having made civic engagement cool again. But during his eight years in office, remarkably few of his aides actually pursued public office. Silicon Valley was far more alluring than city council.The election of Trump changed that, motivating these Obama vets in ways that their former boss never could. It was fear more than inspiration ― a pit-in-the-stomach anxiety that all the work they’d put in over the last eight years, the policies they’d helped pass and the political structures they’d promoted, was now under direct assault.“The young people who were drawn to Obama were drawn not just by the man but belief in democracy as a force for progress,” explained David Axelrod, Obama’s longtime aide. “That belief is very much being challenged today and they are rising to it by putting themselves out there. It is really heartening to see.”At least two former Obama administration officials are now running for Congress, with Kim being a potential third. Numerous others have their eyes on offices ranging from city councils to school boards to mayors.“When President Obama ran for office in 2008, he said the campaign wasn’t about him. It was about all of us,” said Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Obama. “It doesn’t surprise him that the staff that joined him on that journey, and worked every day on behalf of the American people in the Obama administration, are emerging as the next generation of leaders and elected officials.”Since the election of Trump, there has been a profound spike of interest in elected politics among progressives. More than 12,000 women have approached EMILY’s List, which recruits and trains female Democratic candidates. Another group, Run for Something, has had more than 9,000 Democratic millennials commit to running for state and local office.Like these other first-time candidates, the draw that many Obama alums felt to elected office began in the days leading up to Trump’s inauguration. It wasn’t just the realization of the despair that they’d felt since the election itself but a direct pitch from their former boss. In his January farewell address, Obama called on those “disappointed by your elected officials” to “grab a clipboard, get some signatures and run for office yourself.” Kelly Gonez, 28, was already feeling inspired by Obama when she left her administration job last summer to move home to Los Angeles and become a seventh-grade science teacher. She’d been working as an education policy advisor to Obama, helping to shape policies that restrict immigration enforcement activities at schools. She has a lot of Latino students in her class, some of whom may have undocumented family members. The day after Trump won, her kids told her they felt scared and sad.Listening to Trump’s rhetoric about immigrants, Gonez grew increasingly worried he would disregard the work she’d done to help protect kids like her students. Immigration enforcement officials recently arrested an undocumented father as he took his daughter to school in Los Angeles, and Gonez noticed a drop in attendance in her own class. This drove her to run for a board seat on the Los Angeles Unified School District. It was her first time running for office, and on Tuesday, she won. “We have to do more to make our communities feel safe because education isn’t going to happen if we can’t get kids to school,” Gonez said ahead of election night. “I looked at the country, in terms of who is running for office, and reflected on my experience in D.C. and thought, ‘Why not me?’”Haley Stevens, 33, who helped lead Obama’s task force that oversaw the 2009 financial bailout of the auto industry, is making her first foray into politics as well. Running against Rep. Dave Trott (R-Mich.) in a GOP-leaning district, she’s touting her record of bringing jobs back to Michigan, via the auto bailout and the country’s first online training program for digital manufacturing. She said she grew preoccupied by the thought that Trump’s budget cuts would destroy her state’s innovation economy and didn’t see Trott playing a preventative role.“The guy I’m looking to run against … he’s putting forward legislation to make it easier to collect on debts. Are you kidding me? Who does that benefit?” Stevens asked. “You can bring together people in really amazing ways. I’m a doer; we can do big things.”Every Obama alum who spoke to HuffPost could point to an endangered policy that, at least in part, spurred them to run for office.Deanna Archuleta, who is running for mayor of Albuquerque, said she is worried about water protections she helped put in place when she was deputy assistant secretary at the Interior Department.Carrianna Suiter Kuruvilla, who just won a seat on the Hyattsville City Council in Maryland, said she is concerned about paid family leave and sick leave policies put in place while she was director of intergovernmental affairs at the Labor Department.Amanda Farias, a 2012 Obama campaign field organizer who is running for a seat on the New York City Council, said Trump is “regressing” on gains Obama made on race relations and community policing.Still, for some, the urgency to run is less about protecting a specific policy and more about restoring compassion in public discourse.Ammar Campa-Najjar, 28, is running against Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.). He was a public affairs officer at the Labor Department, and his job required him to read hundreds of letters every day from struggling Americans. He recalled letters from people worried about being one illness away from losing health care and from parents saying they had to miss a child’s birthday again because they had to work overtime.“Pain is pain. I know there are people who are hurting,” Campa-Najjar said. “I don’t believe Trump supporters are all racist or ignorant. The thing they have in common is not that they’re ignorant but that they’re ignored.”Campa-Najjar knows his congressional bid is a long shot. He’s running in a conservative Republican district, and there are four other Democratic contenders. But as a Hispanic Arab who lived in war-torn Gaza for part of his childhood, who was then uprooted to California, he feels he owes it to Obama to step up his public engagement in ways beyond simply voting.“When I came to D.C., I was a young, biracial kid, trying to adjust to West Coast and East Coast culture, reconnecting with a Muslim father whose absence was always present. President Obama went down a very similar path. By watching how he did it and having a role in his administration, I found my place in America.”Sam Stein contributed reporting."

59,POLITICS,Steve Bannon Pulls Out Of Speech At Top Washington Think Tank,Amanda Terkel and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-brookings_us_591c71c8e4b0a7458fa4e694,The invitation rankled some scholars at the Brookings Institution.,2017-05-17,Scholars at the Brookings Institution were concerned after White House adviser Steve Bannon was invited to speak at a board meeting.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591c72ce1e00003a00623818.jpeg?cache=KqU6dmuXwN&ops=crop_6_0_2994_1823%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― White House chief strategist Steve Bannon withdrew from a planned appearance at one of Washington’s premiere mainstream think tanks after scholars expressed alarm that the institution would be giving legitimacy and a friendly forum to one of the most controversial members of President Donald Trump’s administration. Over the past month, staff members at the center-left Brookings Institution became aware that the think tank’s leadership had invited Bannon to address its board of trustees meeting in June, according to multiple Brookings staff members who requested anonymity to speak openly with HuffPost. Because it would be a board meeting, it would not have been open to the public.David Nassar, vice president of communications at Brookings, confirmed the invitation. Scholars at all levels of the organization developed concerns about Bannon’s appearance and whether they would be able to press him and engage in an open dialogue, according to the Brookings staff members. “There were some who thought it was no big deal. Some of us quite decidedly felt it was a very big deal, ethically obtuse and stunningly stupid,” said a senior staff member.Employees had an opportunity to express their worries to Brookings President Strobe Talbott at three in-person meetings last week, Nassar said.On Wednesday, Brookings informed staff that Bannon had decided not to attend. They did not state a reason for his decision. The White House did not return a request for comment on why Bannon backed out. “The rank-and-file worked hard and the leadership was responsive [in the meetings]. I’m proud to say I work here with how this played out,” said a senior staff member who attended one of the meetings.But when Bannon canceled, Brookings had not yet had the time to consider whether it wanted to change the format of his appearance, let alone inform him that they wanted a chance for staff to engage with him more openly. “Things never got that far,” Nassar said.As a result, the cancellation was apparently unrelated to any of the internal deliberations inside Brookings, he observed.Bannon is often credited as the intellectual forebear of Trump’s harshest nativist rhetoric and policies, earning him a notorious reputation among White House critics. Prior to joining the Trump campaign as chairman, Bannon chaired the parent company of far-right news site Breitbart, which has trafficked in racist, sexist and anti-Semitic content. As a conservative filmmaker, pundit and radio host, Bannon has expressed his view that the West is on an apocalyptic collision course with the Islamic world.Brookings often welcomes controversial figures to its downtown Washington offices. The think tank invited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to give a speech there last year. The event was not without major incident: Talbott threatened to cancel the speech, according to Foreign Policy, after Erdogan’s security personnel attacked Western and Turkish journalists and protesters outside the event. A Turkish official responded by preventing the clash from escalating further, and the speech was allowed to proceed as planned.After delivering his remarks, Erdogan was subject to thorough questioning by Brookings scholars that was broadcast live online.It was unclear to staff members whether they would have had the opportunity to grill Bannon with similar rigor, the senior staff member said.“When you have someone who is a perpetrator of fake news speaking to an institution that’s focused on getting truth out there, those things compete,” the staffer said. “There was real concern about the nature of that engagement being closed.”Brookings always invites members of the sitting administration to its annual board meetings, Nassar and other staffers noted. Often, a trustee will moderate a discussion with the official, perhaps with questions from other board members and/or scholars at the institution. “The manner in which we were handling it was completely consistent with how we’ve handled other board of trustees meeting,” Nassar said.“He is not coming. No solid information why,” said a senior staff member. “That said, if you worked for Trump, would you want just now to face any neutral audience?”"

On Tuesday, he announced the members of his 22-person cabinet ― 11 of them are women, including Olympian Laura Flessel as Minister of Sports, and publisher Françoise Nyssen as Minister of Culture. Tuesday’s appointments come just a few days after Macron submitted his list of candidates for France’s upcoming parliamentary elections.

The next day he gave Russians classified information in the Oval Office. And now it’s reported that Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to let go of an inquiry on the Russian entanglements of fired national security adviser Michael Flynn.That leaves out a lot, but just from those facts, some Republicans are starting to use the word “Watergate” to describe the scope of unfolding revelations about Trump.Yet few Democrats at this point are using the word that describes what Watergate was leading to: “impeachment.”“I’m not there,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) told reporters Wednesday. “I just want to get the information.”“I’m not afraid of the I-word,” said Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.). “Independent ― independent commission.” It might seem like a surprisingly reticent approach for a party that could stand to benefit politically. But Democrats are also looking at history and the damage the last impeachment proceedings, against President Bill Clinton, did to both the country and political parties involved. They find themselves walking a fine line between legitimate freak-out and overreach, and they do not want to blow it.If lawmakers get ahold of Comey’s Trump memo and others he reportedly wrote, and they confirm Trump tried to coerce the former FBI director, it should add pressure against Trump without Democrats having to manufacture it. If the facts lead Congress toward impeachment, Democrats want to make sure all of the evidence is lined up, and, well, unimpeachable. The strategy to avoid “Dump Trump” talk is such a deliberate stance that when Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) took to the House floor Wednesday to call for impeachment, he ended by noting his was a “voice in the wilderness,” at least for now. And there are certainly Democrats who do not feel constrained. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) mentioned, as she has before, the possibility of impeachment Tuesday. “We don’t have to be afraid to use the word ‘impeachment,’” she said. But most Democrats are exercising what appears to be genuine caution around something so momentous. Just to be sure, there have been talking points circulated to the Democratic talking heads who may get questions about impeachment.The suggested response is: “That’s not a question that can be answered until we get more facts. We need Director Comey to testify in a public hearing, all memos and tapes turned over, a special prosecutor to be appointed and an independent commission to take this investigation outside of Congress,” according to a memo from a Democratic operative.It sounds an awful lot like the words that are in fact coming from the mouths of lawmakers.But that doesn’t necessarily make the tactic cynical. Democratic sources asked about the reluctance to leap to the impeachment argument said that trying to use Trump’s current, not-fully-known troubles as fodder to remove him would actually undercut the seriousness of what Democrats fear the country is facing.“The worst thing Democrats could do is to make this move too early. There are many unanswered questions and facts to be learned and revealed,” one Senate Democratic aide said, speaking anonymously to discuss the private thinking of lawmakers. “It’s a serious step and requires a full understanding of the facts before making the leap.”There is a precedent for a take-it-slow approach. Looking back at the impeachment case against Clinton ― which became almost entirely partisan and ultimately focused on conduct that didn’t involve his official duties ― the then-GOP leaders, Newt Gingrich in the House and Trent Lott in the Senate, went out of their way to urge Republicans not to raise the issue of impeachment. Indeed, the House did not vote to start the process until a month after an independent counsel released the full investigation.The ongoing case against Clinton also backfired, with Democrats picking up seats in the 1998 midterm election when they had been expected to lose many. Democratic strategists see a similar danger in trying to overreach in the case against Trump.“You are empowering Trump surrogates if you first go to impeachment,” said a senior Democratic aide who requested anonymity to discuss congressional reasoning. “That’s all they have been trying to harp on over and over again ― ‘Democrats are sore losers, they want to nullify the results of the election, they want to impeach this president.’ That’s what they are using to motivate their base.”And, the aide said, starting an impeachment drumbeat now undercuts the arguments for getting full, fair investigations from an independent counsel and a 9/11-style commission.“Republicans are not going to support these things if all we’re talking about is impeachment. It is damaging to the effort to secure these independent investigations,” the aide said.Lawmakers also were adamant that launching premature talk about removing the president does more than muddy the political waters. It also has the potential to drive an even deeper wedge of distrust and anger into the already divided population.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said Congress members need to ask themselves if they want to “discharge” their duties and whether Trump’s actions call for removal from office. “In order for that remedy to be appropriate, the country has to believe that the series of conduct is such that this president cannot continue in office,” Schiff said. “It cannot be perceived as an effort to nullify the election by other means.”Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wouldn’t say if what Trump asked of Comey was an impeachable offense because senators don’t know if it actually happened or the “depth and breadth of it,” she said.“I’ve been through an impeachment hearing, and they’re not good for the country let alone the individual. And until we know much more than this, it should remain where it is today ― off the table,” Feinstein said.Asked why Democrats were comfortable with pursuing an independent commission to investigate the president’s conduct concerning the ongoing FBI probe when such bodies are known to take years to finish their work, Cummings replied: “to get it right.”“We are at a very significant moment in this country’s history. This is our watch. So if it takes a year, if it takes two years, if it takes three years, we need to get this right. Yeah, it may take a little time, but this is not about us; this is bigger than us; this is bigger than President Trump. This is about the soul of our democracy,” Cummings said. “Will it lead to impeachment? I don’t know. But one thing is for sure ... if there was a moment that we needed to leave our party hats outside the door, this is that moment.”Sam Stein contributed to this report."

REUTERS/Gary Cameron",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591b6acb1e0000280062360d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans think they have a better way to organize the individual health insurance market and deal with people who are already sick: throwing them a sad pool party.  The health care bill Republicans passed in the House earlier this month would allow states to opt out of the protections that the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” established for people with pre-existing medical conditions, but only if they set up so-called “high-risk pools” instead. These pools would accept people who are considered “risky” to insurance companies because their health histories suggest their future medical claims will cost the companies a lot of money. It’s not a new concept. High-risk pools have existed since the 1970s and were in operation in 35 states when the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. They’ve never had a ton of funding, and only insured about 220,000 people when they were phased out ― which is far fewer than the estimated 25 million with pre-existing conditions and no insurance.  House Speaker Paul Ryan touted his state’s version as an example earlier this month. “In Wisconsin, we had a really successful high-risk pool,” said Ryan, adding that 10 percent of Wisconsinites on the individual insurance market bought plans from the pool, which was called the Wisconsin Health Insurance Risk Sharing Plan. “They could go to any doctor or any hospital they wanted. And their premiums and co-pays were cheaper than they are under Obamacare today.”The Wisconsin pool covered about 20,000 people each year before it folded as the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies and protections for individual health insurance consumers took effect in 2014. The program had some shortcomings. Its typical enrollee had a $5,000 deductible ― the amount they would have to pay before their plan would begin to cover claims ― and lifetime benefits were capped at $2 million, according to the National Association of State Comprehensive Plans. Wisconsin, like many other states with these high-risk pools, required new enrollees to wait six months before the program paid claims relating to pre-existing conditions, as a way to limit expenses. Sue and Dan Wilson of Appleton, Wisconsin, had to use the state’s high-risk pool in 2011, after Dan retired from his job as a journalist at a local paper. Dan has high blood pressure, and Sue has diabetes. They searched for an affordable plan on the private market, but were rejected ― even for policies charging as much as $1,200 a month. They found they could get coverage through the Wisconsin Health Insurance Risk Sharing Plan for about $800 a month. But they could only afford one policy ― two was too expensive. Sue enrolled, while Dan went without insurance for about a year ― and even then, they had to dip into their savings to pay for it until they both were able to qualify for Medicare in 2012.“It was better than nothing,” said Sue Wilson in an interview. “I had insurance and my husband had no insurance. It was scary.”Wisconsin’s high-risk pool brought in $104 million in revenue from premiums in 2011 and paid out $178 million, which was typical for these programs more broadly ― losses in state pools across the country amounted to $1.2 billion that year, even with premiums that could be twice as high as market rates. States tried to make up the difference by imposing fees on insurance companies, and Congress chipped in with millions of dollars through occasional grants over the years, according to the Congressional Research Service.The details of the GOP’s American Health Care Act are still sketchy, even after the House voted to send the legislation to the Senate. But its basic idea is to funnel an unprecedented amount of federal money into new state high-risk pools ― as much as $138 billion over 10 years ― though the legislation doesn’t say that states actually have to use that cash for the pools. Just last year, Ryan proposed only $25 billion for the policy. During a hearing in February ― one of only a few hearings held on what eventually became the House legislation ― Wisconsin’s deputy insurance commissioner testified that when the state’s high-risk pool closed, premiums for everybody else in the state went up because the pool’s 20,000 enrollees were put on the state’s individual insurance market with healthier people. “Wisconsin insurers were quickly faced with an uncertain influx of individuals with serious health conditions,” deputy insurance commissioner J.P. Wieske said in his written testimony. The Republican bill would allow states to resegregate those sicker customers in pools, though it’s unclear if $138 billion in federal funds would be enough to subsidize states’ costs. The liberal Center for American Progress estimated that Republicans would need to throw another $200 billion into the state pools over 10 years just to cover 3 percent of the 31 million people currently insured in small group and individual markets. A 2014 study said creating a national high-risk pool that covered 15 million people would cost $178 billion per year.Both those estimates reflect what it would cost for high-risk pools to be effective in every state; Republicans say this is unfair because their legislation merely gives states the choice of creating such pools in lieu of Obamacare’s requirement to cover people with pre-existing conditions without charging them higher premiums. It’s not clear how many states would seek a waiver from Obamacare in order to do so.  “I think they’re going to be under tremendous pressure from their insurance industry to get one of these waivers,” Sabrina Corlette, an expert with Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said in an interview. She pointed out that the Republican bill would also remove the Obamacare requirement that everyone either buy insurance or pay a penalty ― meaning insurance companies would probably lose some of their healthier, less expensive customers. Given the uncertain funding, Corlette said states that do set up pools would probably look for ways to control costs through measures like imposing lifetime limits on benefit payouts and waiting periods for people with pre-existing conditions.“It’s just an incredibly inefficient way and frankly fiscally irresponsible if the goal is truly to provide a safety net for people with pre-existing conditions,” Corlette said. Congress tried to do high-risk pools on a large scale once before ― when it passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 ― and the example isn’t encouraging. The Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, as it was known, operated in every state, even in states that already had their own pools. Democrats intended the program to serve as a stopgap measure for sick people before Obamacare’s insurance reforms took effect in 2014. It also served as the clearest demonstration of how hard it is to predict what will happen with a high-risk pool. The $5 billion plan didn’t exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, but it only accepted applicants who’d been uninsured for at least six months. The Obama administration figured a few hundred thousand would enroll, but only about 100,000 did ― and their claims were so expensive that the administration closed the program to new enrollment a year early.For the people who do get insurance from high-risk pools, though, the programs can be lifesavers.Jill Morin of Raleigh, North Carolina, spent about six months uninsured after her husband’s company, which provided insurance for their family of four, went out of business in 2011. Morin, a real estate agent, has heart disease and had suffered cardiac arrest in 2009. She assumed nobody would sell her a policy they could afford on her commissions. “I couldn’t sleep at night,” Morin, 46, said in an interview. “I was so scared of what might happen to me it also affected my performance in my job.”When she found out North Carolina had a risk pool that offered premium subsidies for people with low incomes, she signed up immediately. At first, she was thrilled, but after paying about $600 in premiums per month, and not coming close to meeting her deductible, she was less thrilled. “It just didn’t make sense,” she said. (Morin’s husband has since obtained a new job that provided health insurance.)  Jeanette Hauser, 60, also heard about the North Carolina pool, which she thought sounded pretty good. There was just one problem: She lived in Arizona. She had previously had insurance through a statewide business association that allowed her to buy into a costly group plan, but the association announced it was going to stop offering it in 2013. She had a seizure disorder she controlled with medication, the result of a rare autoimmune disease, and knew she wasn’t going to have an easy time finding private insurance in Arizona.  “I spent approximately 60 days putting together a spreadsheet, trying to figure out which state would allow me to get insurance by one technique or another,” Hauser said. She and her husband decided to move to Raleigh, where she could apply for the state’s high-risk pool. Once she established residency, she applied for private insurance ― a prerequisite so she could then show pool administrators a rejection letter. But to her surprise, a North Carolina company actually accepted her application and offered several plans ― and she’s still covered by that company today.  Hauser, a retired administrator for an accounting firm, said she and her husband are happy with their new home, even though they only moved there for the insurance. She’s not sorry she didn’t even have to use the state pool. At the time she moved, after all, state pools were facing upheaval from the Affordable Care Act, which itself has faced constant threats from Republicans in Congress. “I was much more comfortable with taking a regular insurance plan,” she said.

Madison looked outside to see his detached garage on fire, and the flames inching closer to his house.“I screamed my wife’s name,” Madison told The Albany Times Union. “We all got out.”Firefighters quickly saw that the blaze was far more sinister than most house fires.“When they arrived, they saw a swastika and a racial epithet had been spray-painted on the garage,” Belardo said. “Putting that together with this fire is why we are investigating this as a hate crime.”The garage burned to the ground, but volunteer firefighters from five area departments saved the family’s home and limited the damage to the exterior. The Rensselaer County Sheriff’s Office and New York State Police are assisting Schodack police investigating the cause of the blaze. The Times Union reported the garage was not hooked up to electricity.A motive behind the crime – aside from hate – is unknown to police. Authorities said they’re unaware of any prior issues involving any family members. “This family has lived in this neighborhood for years,” Belardo said.Laurie Salzer, who lives in the neighborhood with her husband Adam, told Albany’s WNYT NewsChannel 13 it’s a quiet neighborhood.“Everyone gets along with one another and they’re all friends,” Salzer said. “So that’s another reason why this is so very disturbing.”Belardo said hate crimes are uncommon in Schodack, a small town in Rensselaer County. He said he can’t recall a similar crime during his two decades on the police force.“This does not represent our community,” Belardo said. “The community is outraged. We are 100-percent behind the family.”Madison told the Times Union he is glad his wife and children escaped.“People are going to be who they are,” Madison said. “My hope is they understand life is not a joke. You can’t toy with people.”Investigators said evidence from the crime scene may help identify the perpetrator.Meanwhile, members of the community have been reaching out to the police department to see how they can help the Madison family.“We’re getting calls from all over the area,” Belardo said. “It makes me proud that members of my community are stepping up and this family is not going through this alone. I know [the Madisons] are fearful, but we’re confident and working toward a quick resolution.”Anyone with information is asked to contact the Schodack police at 518-477-8077.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

But whom will she be dating? On Wednesday, ABC revealed the 31 men who will be jockeying for her roses this season ― a group host Chris Harrison described as “the most successful, most diverse, and of course, the most dramatic cast we have ever had on this show.”The bar for diversity (and successfulness) has been set fairly low by past seasons of “The Bachelorette,” which has been critiqued in the past for casting predominantly white men (and disproportionate numbers of fitness trainers) to romance its leading ladies. To date Rachel, an accomplished Texas attorney with dazzling good looks and easygoing charm, the franchise tapped a posse of more serious contenders, including several doctors and attorneys. For those who enjoy more whimsical “Bachelorette” jobs, don’t worry: We spy one man whose job is listed as “Tickle Monster” and another who says his occupation is “Whaboom.” Harrison takes a stab at explaining this job, describing it as “a lifestyle... an essence.” Oookay, then.At first glance, the cast of 31 appears to include 14 men of color ― including 11 black men ― as prospects for its first black Bachelorette. Certainly not a remarkable degree of diversity, except considering the franchise’s own alabaster-oriented casting proclivities.

Certainly, Trump has a much longer leash than a Clinton presidency would have been allowed. And it’s true that the apologists in the Republican delegation massively outnumber the skeptics. It is also accurate to say that some cracks are beginning to show in Trump’s D.C. firewall.Republican Senator Bob Corker said the administration was in “a downward spiral,” and that all these distractions and lack of discipline “creates a worrisome environment.” GOP Senator Susan Collins was quoted as saying “Can we have a crisis-free day? That’s all I’m asking.” Doug Andres, a spokesman for Speaker Paul Ryan, stated “The speaker hopes for a full explanation of the facts from the administration.”Tweets from Congressmen Jason Chaffetz, a staunch Trump defender, and Justin Amash also did little to encourage those inside the administration.The tumultuousness of the Trump campaign as expected has carried over to his presidency. The GOP was certainly not going to do anything about candidate Trump; the White House was at stake. However, his usefulness may have ended the day he was sworn in. The power and control they needed are now locked in, no matter who sits behind the Resolute Desk. Trump’s bombastic, reckless, and erratic behavior may no longer be welcome in the GOP, as it slowly costs the party more and more political capital.Will the GOP eat its own? Absolutely.With Mike Pence waiting in the wings the GOP has a much steadier hand and one that is more likely to play ball. Pence understands the Republican platform, their plans, and desires. He is far less liable to veer off course and chase his own rabbits. In Pence, the GOP has the prototype Republican and the perfect replacement to lead them to 2020. No drama, an honest face, and plenty of Washington political experience. Someone Trump supporters, after their initial outrage, could rally around and get behind in future elections.In Pence, Democrats have far less ammunition to battle the Republican mandates. The fight becomes about the issues only and not the messenger. Discrediting and obstruction become harder because a Pence administration will be much more capable of pursuing and communicating his agenda. You can also expect a Pence staff to be much more moderate and mainstream, again making the message much smoother.You only need to look at the State of Alabama for a recent precedent. Where 100% of statewide offices are held by the Republican party and have been for most of this decade, the GOP had to deal with its own. Starting with State Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard, at one time believed to be the most powerful man in Alabama Politics. He was removed from office after a conviction on ethics violations in June of 2016. Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, a longtime Republican, was suspended from his seat in September for ordering State Judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage, ending his term as Chief Justice for the second time.Then in April, Governor Robert Bentley was forced to resign when the Republican controlled state legislature moved to start impeachment hearings, over an alleged romantic relationship with his top advisor, and ethics violations in the wake of the coverup. Bentley won the 2010 election going away and for his first term and a landslide reelection was one of the most popular governors in Alabama history. None of that matters when the winds of change blow in and public opinion turns, even the most popular politicians find themselves abandoned by party leaders.Make no mistake, the Republican Party enabled and in many ways created this demon, and it will be up to the same party to stop it. Don’t for one second think that they won’t do just that when the avalanche finally breaks loose. Not necessarily because it’s right but because it is expedient.They won’t worry about the Trump voters, to the Party they were simply useful idiots. Voters who they know with certainty will fall in line with whomever the Party places at the helm. Their Champion is already in the wings.Trump most likely still feels untouchable, with his sense that the Presidency is some dictatorial monarchy. He assuredly will learn his lesson the hard way, and believe it or not it will be the GOP that teaches it to him.Photo: Flickr/Gage Skidmore"

Comey,"Alex Mohajer, ContributorPolitical Writer and Commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-comeuppance-and-absolution-of-james-b-comey_us_591b8b4ce4b0da7850311be2,"The embattled former FBI Director might have cost Hillary Clinton the election, but his parting shot for Donald Trump may bring down an American president.",2017-05-17,<p>James Comey testifies before Congress in hearings into Trump campaign associates and their relationship with Russia.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591c1f3b1e00009500623706.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After being unceremoniously relieved of his duties last week, embattled former FBI Director James Comey fired a parting shot from beyond the proverbial grave on Tuesday evening that was heard around the world. According to an explosive report in the New York Times, that parting shot is a memorandum drafted by Mr. Comey in February that details a private meeting held between himself and the president in the Oval Office.According to the memo, which would be permissible in a court of law pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, Trump allegedly asked Mr. Comey to shut down the federal investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned in February amidst revelations that he had engaged in pre-inauguration talks with Russian officials about possibly lifting Obama-era sanctions. The memo has already been asked for in a discovery request made by Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-Ut.), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee.The memorandum is essentially the most damning evidence to date that Trump has attempted to influence the ongoing investigation into his ties with Russia. Paired with explosive reports from only a day earlier that Trump revealed highly classified intelligence information to Russian officials, and Comey’s memo very well could signal the beginning of the end. Trump legitimacy has been questioned but more or less gone unchallenged in the six months since November’s presidential election.Congress is the only governing body that can initiate impeachment proceedings against a sitting American president, and despite numerous grounds for impeachment arising even before Trump assumed office, the GOP-controlled body has projected little to no interest in participating in a bipartisan impeachment effort.Whether the memo will be enough for Republicans to back impeachment is not likely, but there is growing unease within the party as to the political costs of continuing to support the president and failing to introduce Articles of Impeachment. As for Comey, the disgraced Obama-era appointee has been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks and months, and testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month that he felt “mildly nauseous” at the prospect of having cost Hillary Clinton the White House in the 2016 presidential election. Indeed, there’s no love lost between Comey and supporters of the former Democratic nominee for president, who has echoed sentiments made by Nate Silver and other analysts that Comey contributed to interventionist forces that cost her the election.“If the election had been held on October 27, I would be your president,” Clinton told journalist Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event, referring to Comey’s now-infamous letter to Congress on October 28 in which he violated Department of Justice protocol to publicly suggest that Clinton was under a renewed investigation for criminal wrongdoing related to her emails.She was cleared days later, of course, but the damage had been done. “Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race,” said Nate Silver, Editor-in-Chief of FiveThirtyEight. “Late-deciding voters broke strongly against Clinton in swing states, enough to cost her Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.”Of course, while Clinton won the national popular vote by nearly 3 million, she lost the electoral college by a razor-thin 79,000 votes in three states: Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. In his testimony before Congress last week, Comey explained his reasoning for violating protocol and speaking publicly about an investigation so close to an election. “Concealment would have been devastating,” Comey said, prompting many to wonder why the same rationale did not apply when Comey had information in October regarding Trump team members reportedly having contact with Russia, which he did not disclose prior to the election. Indeed, in March, Comey revealed that the FBI began its investigation into Trump’s relationship with Russia as early as July 2016, around the same time that Trump broadcast his hopes during a live press conference that Russia find HIllary Clinton’s ‘30,000 missing emails. Comey did not disclose any of this information to the American public.For now though, it seems that Comey has been promoted from tertiary character to a starring role in this ongoing saga. Many believe that the former FBI Director losing his job is not payment enough for Comey, and that losing Hillary Clinton the election and handing the nuclear codes to Trump are deserving of more severe punishment. But if losing his job and his credibility constitute his comeuppance, then there exists no greater mea culpa than putting into motion the take-down of an American president.Alex Mohajer is the Co-Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Bros4America.

It was based on an urgent call I made at the 2016 UNESCO World Press Freedom Day conference in Helsinki, Finland.Journalism Schools Must Include Safety Courses in Curricula Too many journalists are victims of violence and impunity, and more should be done in academia to prepare media students for the perils they are likely to face. I urge all faculty members at this conference to incorporate a course on safety for journal­ists in their curricula. It’s not a luxury; it’s an urgent necessity.According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), one journal­ist is killed every five days in the line of duty and the impunity of such acts is unabated. Unlike the issues of journalism and freedom of expression, journalists’ safety has not been a popular topic of academic research. It has rarely been discussed as a specific research question, much less in practical courses. I participated in another session on new frontiers in disinformation and the use of propaganda, also a threat to journalists’ safety. Panelists discussed various aspects of media’s misleading messages, hate speech, phony photographs and visuals, manipula­tion by terrorist groups, and the proliferation of news websites as a counterforce to government-controlled media and corporate monopolies. The issue of journalists’ safety was very much part of that discussion, as was my insistence that it should be taught at universities to make sure students understand what awaits them. It began in Amman One way of mitigating risks to journalists is by introducing safety courses in the cur­ricula of university media programs. Short workshops for professionals are not enough. War correspondents and freelancers are among the scores of journalists worldwide who risk life and limb every day to tell stories of conflicts and relay images of human­ity’s miseries, often without any protection. I was in Amman, Jordan, in January 2015 working with UNESCO and the Interna­tional Federation of Journalists (IFJ) to train journalism and media academics – deans and faculty members – from Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and Iraq. The faculty from Lebanon represented the Lebanese University, the American Uni­versity of Science and Technology, and Holy Spirit University; from Palestine there were professors from Birzeit University, Al Quds University, and An-Najah National University; and from Iraq there were professors from the Faculty of Information at Al Iraqia University in Baghdad, and the Faculty of Information at Salahuddin University in Erbil.The aim was to introduce safety for journalists as a required course in their respec­tive curricula. If taught in its entirety, the course would span 12 weeks over an aca­demic semester. UNESCO and IFJ have been active in promoting the topic and have published guidebooks on how journalists can protect themselves in various scenarios. The two-and-a-half-day workshop was a team effort including Australian journalist, trainer and safety expert Clare Arthurs. We asked the participants what their interests and priorities were, and presented them with a draft curriculum, draft lesson plans, and methods to benchmark and assess the material. While several of the ’trainees’ acknowledged the need for safety awareness, most were still wedded to traditional teaching methods, giving more weight to theory than practice. This is a problem universities face region-wide in the Arab World, as untold num­bers of academics teaching journalism courses have never worked in newsrooms, in the field, or faced the types of threats and dangers that are par for the course. Arthurs’ journalism-cum-academic background and mine added weight to the argument. Having worked on media curricula at academic institutions in a previous incarnation, I knew full well what overhauling a program and introducing new courses entailed. There are endless committee meetings frequently involving faculty members who know nothing about the subject and who hail from different disciplines. There are ego trippers in the staid halls of academe, turf wars, a snail-paced bureaucracy, and those who fear a new course may knock an existing one off the curriculum. There’s also the matter of a university’s accreditation and whether such an offering would lessen the curriculum’s value. But the subject matter is not limited to conflict zones, wars and terrorism. There are natural disasters, epidemics, and other events that put journalists’ lives in danger, and they’re being given short shrift. Our team of trainers was reinforced by Adrien Collin from IFJ, George Awad from UNESCO, and others with field experience. We focused on the need to include units on planning, risk assessment, personal safety, operational self-sufficiency, travel secu­rity, transport, first aid to handle a number of emergencies in the field, health care in hostile environments, demonstrations (and riots), natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, ballistics, kidnapping, women’s safety (given the large number of women jour­nalists in the line of fire), digital security, international humanitarian law, local laws, ethics, and safe investigative reporting. Workshop discussions centered on how many weeks were in a semester, and that varied by institution, depending on whether they were state-run or private universities. There was the issue of the language of instruction. Most taught in Arabic, but some taught in English and others in French, depending on the country, although in the Arab world, it is not unusual to have trilingual educators, students and journalists. One critical issue was who would teach such a course. The trainers felt strongly that a practicing journalist with teaching/training experience was best fit for the assignment. The course is tailored to the needs of various educational systems, contexts and lan­guages in the region, and can be adopted worldwide. It is to be made available online for easy access to all those interested in helping safeguard journalists.Progress in Beirut Academics, media professionals and experts met in Beirut in February 2016 to push for the course. The conference there was a follow-up of the 2015 launch and grouped Egyptian academics from Cairo University, the American University in Cairo; from Iraq’s Salahuddin University in Erbil; from Jordan’s Petra and Philadelphia Univer­sities; from Morocco’s Institut Supérieur de l’Information et de la Communication; from Oman’s Sultan Qabous University; from Palestine’s Birzeit and Al Quds Univer­sities; from Syria’s Yarmouk and Damascus Universities; from Tunisia’s Sfax University and the Institut de Presse et des Sciences de L’Information; from Lebanon’s Lebanese University, Holy Spirit University, Lebanese International University, and Rafic Hariri University. By then, Michael Foley from the School of Media at the Dublin Institute of Tech­nology had come on board to help shape the course that was written in English and Arabic. “Students of journalism must understand the risks they confront when they work,” noted then IFJ President Jim Boumelha at the opening. The IFJ produces an annual report of media casualties, added Boumelha, saying most of those targeted are local journalist whose names get tepid reactions and do not resonate in the media, unlike the spotlight shed on foreign correspondents. The academics went over a draft of the course to be offered as one required uninter­rupted 12-week unit, as an elective course or one from which they can select compo­nents to incorporate into other relevant media courses. Speakers included a security expert as well as four noted Lebanese journalists – two who work locally and two whose international track record in covering conflict zones is legend. “News organizations should train journalists and insist on safety measures and the use of proper equipment,” said Yazbeck Wehbe, a veteran of Lebanon’s LBCI TV News who also teaches journalism at several Lebanese universities. Patrick Baz, a world-renowned photojournalist whose career is linked to Agence France-Presse (AFP), offered valuable insights on how he covered some of the hottest spots in the Arab world and what lingering impact it has had on him. “Being a correspondent is going to places, and bearing witness to war crimes,” said Samia Nakhoul, a Reuters veteran and Middle East editor who was seriously injured and almost died when U.S. tanks lobbed shells into the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad where foreign media were based during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. News organizations should provide trauma counseling as well as safety training, while universities should equip their students with the requisite knowledge and skills to face all manner of hazards, Nakhoul said. The “Model Course on Safety of Journalists” on which I worked is now in print in English and Arabic and will soon be online on the UNESCO and IFJ websites. "
72,POLITICS,Experts Press Feds To Eradicate Lead Poisoning By 2021,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ending-lead-poisoning-2021-epa_us_591a26d7e4b05dd15f0a9105,It won't be easy under an administration that wants to slash environmental and health regulations.,2017-05-16,"A 6-year-old boy in Flint, Michigan, has blood drawn to test his blood lead levels on Feb. 4, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591a2c2c1600001a22c5b5ff.jpeg?cache=b5dJ8a6C7b&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In just five years, the U.S. could end the problem of lead poisoning, a group of health experts argues ― if federal overseers are given more ammunition to attack the problem despite an administration that wants to gut regulations. A coalition of scientists, doctors and children’s health advocates published an opinion piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics on Monday that calls on the government to stamp out lead poisoning in American children by 2021 ― or ensure no child has a blood lead level greater than 5 micrograms per deciliter ― and eliminate lead exposure altogether by 2030.Project TENDR (Targeting Environmental Neurodevelopmental Risks) advocates for reducing exposure levels to chemicals and pollutants that contribute to neurodevelopmental problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Lead contamination of the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, which caused a rise in the number of the city’s children who had lead poisoning, drew public attention to the problem in 2014. But lead exposure affects communities across the country. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces lead restrictions, estimates 6.5 million to 10 million homes are connected to lead service lines. Nearly 3,000 areas in the U.S. have higher lead poisoning rates than Flint, according to a Reuters investigation. Exposure to peeling paint in older homes is the biggest source of lead poisoning, disproportionately affecting low-income families. Forty years ago, 88 percent of young children in the U.S. had elevated levels of lead in their blood. Today, just 2.5 percent of kids ages 1 to 5 have lead levels above the now-lower threshold set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2012. (The threshold had been 10 micrograms.) But lead is a neurotoxin that isn’t safe in any quantity. It’s particularly toxic for young children, increasing their risk of brain and nervous system damage. “Lead is one of those things that people tend to get lulled into a sense that ‘we’ve already dealt with the issue, we took it out of gasoline and regulated the amount in paint,’” said David Bellinger, lead author of Monday’s article and an environmental health professor at Harvard University. “It took something like Flint for people to realize that there’s just enormous reservoirs of lead out there in the environment … and that all it takes is some human error or some engineering failure and the problem resurfaces,” Bellinger said.Bellinger said the drastic reduction in lead exposure since the late 1970s shows how effective regulations have been, but he said that the EPA and other federal agencies need to strengthen their lead restrictions ― which cover drinking water, paint, air quality, soil, dust and other sources ― to keep up with current research. Project TENDR also calls for dedicated funding for more programs that actively eliminate sources of lead. They say the government needs to put a complete ban on the use of lead in products including aviation fuel, cosmetics, wheel weights, industrial paints, batteries and lubricants. Its call for stronger lead rules could be a tall order under the current administration. President Donald Trump has signed executive orders to slash regulations and proposed gutting the EPA’s budget, including its lead paint programs.To carry out the president’s directions, the EPA is accepting public comments through Monday on regulations it could repeal.In East Chicago, Indiana, which is undergoing a lead crisis at a public housing complex built on the site of a former lead refinery, several organizations wrote a letter published by the Northwest Indiana Times that urged the agency to strengthen, not reduce, its lead regulations.  Repealing lead regulations or defunding prevention programs would “perpetuate a completely preventable public health crisis,” the groups wrote on behalf of residents at the East Chicago complex, designated an EPA Superfund cleanup site. The EPA has been looking at updating its lead rules for a couple of years, including possibly requiring cities to replace all lead pipes, one of the goals of Project TENDR. But the agency acknowledges it would be an enormously difficult and expensive undertaking ― Flint received tens of millions of dollars from the EPA and the state of Michigan to replace its lead service lines, and nationwide pipe replacement would cost more than $16 billion. “It’s going to make the work harder to fight back against the rising tide,” Bellinger said of Trump’s anti-regulation crusade. “So we just have to work with our representatives, our senators, and make sure that these issues don’t get pushed aside and that at least Congress is trying to keep a focus on them.”"

But it remains heavily invested in oil and gas — to the tune of several hundred million dollars ― according to an investigation by its own employees and students.UNITE HERE Local 33, a union of graduate employees, and Fossil Free Yale, a student group pushing for the Ivy League school to divest completely from the oil and gas industry, confronted the university with their findings in a Tuesday letter to Yale’s chief investment officer, David Swensen.Their analysis of Yale’s $25 billion in endowment investments shows that at the same time the university has been publicly positioning itself as a leader in climate-conscious investing, it was profiting off the fossil fuel industry, Elias Estabrook, a spokesperson for Fossil Free Yale, told HuffPost. Local 33 and Fossil Free Yale said that since Swensen in 2014 urged the university’s investment partners to consider climate change in future financial decisions, Yale has continued to hold numerous investments related to energy extraction.In June 2016, for example, Yale held $230 million worth of stock in Antero Resources Corporation, a Denver-based oil and gas company with extensive hydraulic fracturing operations, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. And as recently as June 2015, the university had around $110 million invested with ARC Financial Corp., a major Canadian private equity management company that specifically focuses on energy, according to Yale’s latest available tax filing. The Connecticut university also had $53.7 million invested in Merit Energy Company, a privately held oil and gas producer, according to the company’s latest tax filing. And the school owned roughly $2 million worth of shares in Whitehaven Coal, the Australian company behind the controversial open-pit Maules Creek coal mine in South Whales, according to a website on which Local 33 shares its information on Yale’s investment assets.The findings suggest Yale isn’t walking the walk, even as it has made major announcements about its commitment to sustainability and the role it plays in addressing climate change. And given the complexity of the university’s endowment model ― in recent decades, it has shifted away from investments in publicly traded companies and toward private equity investing ― representatives of Local 33 and Fossil Free Yale say its possible they’ve only scratched the surface of the school’s fossil fuel holdings.In August 2014, Swensen wrote to each of the university’s fund managers about how climate change influences the university’s investment program. He said his office “bases its approach to global warming on the conclusion that greenhouse gas emissions pose a grave threat to human existence,” and recognizes that “climate change (caused by deforestation and emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases) creates a substantial risk of significant changes to the world’s ecosystem.’’ That made “consideration of the impact of climate change essential when evaluating investment opportunities,” he said.Although Swensen did not call for divestment, he urged the school’s external endowment managers to “assess the greenhouse gas footprint of prospective investments” as they invest funds.Yale spokesman Thomas Conroy, responding to Tuesday’s letter from the two school groups, cited a 2014 statement in which the school declined to recommend divestment but took note of Swensen’s guidance on the issue.Asked to comment on specific financial holdings, Conroy said, “Yale does not disclose or comment on its investments.”Like many other universities, Yale’s board of trustees, known formally as Yale Corporation, has resisted calls that it divest from fossil fuels. The Yale Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility, which advises the board on policy matters concerning ethical investing, in August 2014 argued that divestment was a misguided and ineffective approach to addressing the climate crisis. It said the school would have its “greatest impact” on the issue through its core mission of research, scholarship and education.However, it adopted new guidelines saying Yale “will generally support reasonable and well-constructed shareholder resolutions” that seek “company disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, analyses of the impact of climate change on a company’s business activities, strategies designed to reduce the company’s long-term impact on the global climate, and company support of sound and effective governmental policies on climate change.”In April 2016, Swensen announced in a second letter that Yale had identified several investment partners that held positions “inconsistent” with its policies on climate change. Two investors responded by divesting around $10 million of the school’s endowment from coal and oil sands operations.Some environmentalists celebrated the move. Bill McKibben, a leader in the fossil-fuel divestment movement, called it a “key day” in that effort.” Others, however, criticized what they saw as a decision based on economics rather than ethics. At the time, a communications director for Fossil Free Yale called the announcement “progress,” but “not divestment,” according to Yale News.That “partial divestment” prompted Local 33 and Fossil Free Yale to look more closely at Yale’s holdings. “We were very surprised to discover that in fact the university, through its endowment investments, remains bullish on fossil fuels and continues to invest in fossil fuels and in the carbon economy,” Aaron Greenberg, chair of Local 33, told HuffPost. “There are so many of these examples where it seems like Yale is waiting until the science screams at them about how environmentally unsustainable these investments are, and not on their own evaluating significant environmental and social risks,” he said. Greenberg and Estabrook say all of the investments in the disclosure reports are troubling ― particularly the 2015 stock acquisition in fracking giant Antero. The natural gas industry has come under increased scrutiny for its release of methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent that carbon dioxide, and potential impacts of fracking on drinking water. In its most recent SEC disclosure, filed Monday, Yale maintained Antero shares valued at $91 million.With its Antero stock, Yale is “in effect gambling that short term profits outweigh the possibility that science would reveal long-term harm to the earth’s climate,” argue Local 33 and Fossil Free Yale. The groups also spotlight Yale’s stake in Whitehaven Coal through the $591 million the school has invested with Farallon Capital Management LLC, Whitehaven’s largest shareholder, according to the university’s latest tax disclosure. The Maules Creek coal mine, which opened in 2015, was a scene of mass protest over deforestation and threats to endangered species, with activists chaining themselves to construction equipment and hundreds of people being arrested. “Along the lines of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline, it’s a central front in the battle to ensure that environmentally and culturally sensitive lands are protected,” said Greenberg.The findings by Local 33 and Fossil Free Yale can be found at 33wallstreet.org.Global climate change has spurred pressure on institutions around the world to cut ties with fossil fuels. In the United States, those calls have intensified as the Trump administration advocates for increased domestic oil, gas and coal production and moves quickly to roll back Obama-era policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2011, more than 700 institutions worldwide have divested more than $5 trillion in assets, according to Go Fossil Free, an arm of McKibben’s 350.org environment group. More than 100 universities and colleges, including Harvard, Barnard, Stanford, Georgetown and the University of California have committed to either partial or full divestment.Rachel Calnik-Sugin, a Yale sophomore and member of Fossil Free Yale, told HuffPost that if Yale truly wants to lead on climate change, it must disclose and divest. “More than ever we need moral leadership from our universities,” she said. “We can’t just be passive.”"
