0,POLITICS,"This Is What Actual Voter Suppression Looks Like, And It's Appalling",Nico Pitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voter-suppression-2016_us_581028c2e4b02b1d9e63bcd2,"In one county, a reduction in polling places has helped cut early voting by 85 percent.",2016-10-26,2016-10-24-1477270619-2419267-NC_polling_places.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-10-24-1477270619-2419267-NC_polling_places-thumb.jpg,"Donald Trump regularly tells his supporters that the election has been rigged against him, and on Monday he accused Hillary Clinton’s campaign of utilizing a “voter suppression technique” that involved manipulating polls. (Politifact rated his claim “pants on fire” false.) But with early voting now underway in several states, the real-world effects of actual (and very consequential) voter suppression have begun to bubble up.Exhibit A is North Carolina, where in recent months reporters discovered that state Republican leaders had sent emails directing GOP appointees on local elections boards to “make party line changes” to limit early voting.In one message, titled “CRITICAL and CONFIDENTIAL,” a Republican district chairman urged election officials to offer only one early voting site for the minimum hours allowed by law, so as not to give Democrats an advantage.Early in-person voting began in North Carolina on Oct. 20, and Professor Michael McDonald, an elections expert at the University of Florida, said the impact of reduced voting sites is already evident in early returns:Not all local boards listened, but some did, and the effect is obvious. The volume of early voting is generally down in the counties that reduced the number of polling locations and is up where the number increased.A similar story emerged on Tuesday, when The Nation’s Ari Berman reported that Green Bay, Wisconsin, had denied a request for a second early voting site because, as the city’s clerk wrote in a private email, additional voting locations would be “more of a benefit to the [D]emocrats.”Green Bay is the third-largest city in the state, and during the primary election in April, students at its University of Wisconsin campus reported waiting up to two hours to vote.Afterwards, eight UWGB student groups (including the campus Republicans and Democrats) asked for an early voting site to be located on campus. The city said no, and its Republican-appointed clerk Kris Teske explained why.“UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole,” Teske wrote privately to a state ethics commission official in an email obtained through an open-records request.“I have heard it said that students lean more toward the [D]emocrats,” she continued. “I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn’t going to happen. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the [D]emocrats?”In the end, the city’s only early voting site is a 15-minute drive from campus and is only open during work hours.Meanwhile, in Ohio, the state’s Democratic Party and two groups representing the homeless petitioned the Supreme Court on Tuesday to help stop enforcement of a restrictive election law passed in 2014.Under the law, Ohio voters can have their ballots thrown out if they make a single clerical error on their ballot forms, even if election officials can accurately identify the voter despite the error.Local media reports have featured stories of unsuspecting voters whose ballots were tossed in 2014, like a husband and wife couple who inadvertently mailed their ballots using each others’ envelopes.Tuesday’s petition to the Supreme Court included other examples. Ronald Gilbert, who is 86 and legally blind, had his ballot discarded because he mistakenly wrote that day’s date in the birthdate field. Kadar Hiir, an immigrant from Somalia, lost his vote after accidentally flipping the date and month in the birthdate field.CLARIFICATION: This story was updated to make clear that Guilford County will be opening additional polling places later in the early-vote period.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

PRRI’s 2016 American Values Survey, found that a majority of white evangelical Protestants (62 percent) and white mainline Protestants (54 percent) favored temporarily banning Muslims from other countries coming to the United States. White Catholics were divided on the proposed policy, with 48 percent reporting that they were supportive and 49 percent opposing. On the other hand, Christians of color ― who are increasingly accounting for larger shares of the American Christian population as a whole ― appeared to reject the ban. A majority of black Protestants (68 percent) and Hispanic Catholics (62 percent) rejected the ban. Members of non-Christian religions and religiously unaffiliated Americans were even more strongly opposed (70 percent and 74 percent, respectively). Overall, most Americans (56 percent) rejected the policy of temporarily banning Muslims from entering the country, while 43 percent said they supported the idea.Catherine Orsborn, campaign director of the anti-Islamophobia coalition Shoulder to Shoulder, told The Huffington Post that most of America’s mainline Protestant denominations and a number of evangelical groups have pledged to work with her campaign to find ways of addressing anti-Muslim sentiment in their congregations. On a grassroots level, she’s heard from many white Christians who want to show their support. But she said there’s a lot of work left to do, particularly around the issue of race. “Anti-Muslim bigotry is a religious issue, yes, but it is also an issue of racial bias and discrimination, which is why I think there is a pretty clear racial divide in these numbers,” Orsborn told The Huffington Post in an email. “White Christian privilege is something that many white Christians are beginning to recognize, but this self-reflection is unfortunately not very widespread. Those who have had less experience with overt or systemic discrimination are often less aware of it, and I think these numbers reflect that reality. “ In addition, the survey found that America’s religious groups have different views about how American culture and way of life has changed since the 1950s. White Christians were more likely than any other religious group to say the cultural changes have been bad for the country. In particular, a strong majority of white evangelical Protestants (74 percent) said American culture has changed for the worse since the 1950s. That sentiment was shared by 59 percent of white mainline Protestants and 57 percent of white Catholics.Conversely, black Protestants (60 percent), Hispanic Catholics (65 percent), members of non-Christian religions (66 percent) and the unaffiliated (66 percent) said that America has actually changed for the better. Jim Wallis, a progressive evangelical leader, told The Huffington Post that white Christians’ attitudes about the Muslim ban and about America’s cultural trajectory are actually symptoms of a broader problem. For Wallis, these protectionist and pessimistic attitudes about America are actually reflective of a fear among white Christian Protestants that they are losing the prominence they’ve enjoyed in this country since its founding.“Islamophobia is part of the larger problem of white Christians in America acting more ‘white’ than ‘Christian.’ ‘Make America Great Again’ really means ‘Make America White Again,’ because in the 1950s brutal racial segregation was the rule,” Wallis told HuffPost in an email. “It represents the fear of the emerging demographic reality in this country – that by 2040, the United States will be a ‘majority of minorities.’”“The Church has got to help people not just accept the new multicultural reality, but to welcome it and celebrate it.” The 2016 American Values Survey was conducted among a sample of 2,010 Americans between September 1 and 27 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.

3,ARTS & CULTURE,Paul Beatty Becomes First American To Win Man Booker Prize For Fiction,"By Nigel Stephenson, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2016-man-booker-prize_us_581023ffe4b001e247df4321,The chair of the judging panel said his novel “The Sellout” was a unanimous choice.,2016-10-26,"Author Paul Beatty was honored for his book, ""The Sellout,"" a biting satire on race relations in America.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5810242f1a000071285bbcbc.jpeg?cache=nXWc9Farf5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Paul Beatty was on Tuesday named as the first American to win the prestigious Man Booker fiction prize, for “The Sellout,” a biting satire on race relations in the United States.The narrator of “The Sellout,” an African-American called “Bonbon” tries to put his Californian town back on the map, from which it has been officially removed, by re-introducing slavery and segregation in its high school.The 289-page novel begins with “Bonbon” facing a hearing in the Supreme Court, looking back over the events that led up to that point.The language is uncompromising and may offend some readers. So might some of the content - one old black film actor asks to become Bonbon’s slave - as Beatty lampoons racial stereotypes. The protagonist’s father is unjustly shot by police.“This is a hard book. It was hard for me to write, it’s hard to read,” said a tearful Beatty immediately after winning the award at a ceremony at London’s historic Guildhall.“For me, it’s just really gratifying that something that’s important to me is also important for other people,” he later told a news conference.Chair of the five judges for the 50,000 pound ($60,900) prize Amanda Foreman said “The Sellout” had been a unanimous choice, reached after a meeting lasting some four hours.“It plunges into the heart of contemporary American society with absolutely savage wit of the kind I haven’t seen since Swift or Twain,” she said.“It manages to eviscerate every social nuance, every sacred cow, while making us laugh and also making us wince ... It is really a novel for our times.”Asked about the language, Foreman said, “Paul Beatty has said being offended is not an emotion. That’s his answer to the reader,” Foreman said.“The Sellout” is 54-year-old Beatty’s fourth novel. He has also edited an anthology of African-American humor.It was publisher Oneworld’s second Man Booker victory after winning the 2015 prize for “A Brief History of Seven Killings” by Jamaican Marlon James.Beatty said he would not have written the book had his partner not persuaded him to apply for a grant that allowed him time to complete the book.“I don’t like writing,” he said. “I’m a perfectionist in some ways and I get easily disgruntled and discouraged with what I’m doing.”Apart from the 50,000 pound prize, each of the six shortlisted authors wins 2,500 pounds ($3,045) winning the Man Booker can have a major impact on a writer’s sales and readership. James told Reuters recently that winning the prize can have a “seismic” impact.In its 48-year history, the prize has gone to authors including Salman Rushdie, Hilary Mantel and Margaret Atwood. Three years ago the rules were changed to cover any novel written in English, regardless of the writer’s nationality, and published in Britain. Previously it was confined largely to authors from the Commonwealth.Since January, the judges have read 155 novels before whittling the pile down to a “longlist” of 13 then a shortlist of six.This year’s shortlist comprised works by two Britons, a Briton born in Canada, a Canadian and two Americans.Deborah Levy, whose “Hot Milk” was in the final six this year, has been on the shortlist before, while Ottessa Moshfegh’s “Eileen” was her debut novel."

But U.S. Ambassador Douglas Lute raised concerns that the aircraft carrier would be used to contribute to bombing of civilian targets around Aleppo."

How much longer? ... Get out, leave us in peace. You’ve stolen and destroyed our beautiful country enough.”“THE REVOLUTION WILL CONTINUE!”Maduro, elected to replace late leader Hugo Chavez after his death three years ago, counters it is in fact the opposition vying for a coup beneath the veneer of peaceful protests.Chavez was briefly toppled in a 2002 putsch, where some of the current opposition leaders played key roles.“Some want to see Venezuela full of violence and divided,” a red-shirted Maduro told cheering supporters at a rally on Tuesday, where he vowed to stand firm. “They won’t return! The revolution will continue!” he said, pumping his fist.Opposition protests two years ago, championed by Lopez, led to 43 deaths, including security officials and both government and opposition supporters. As a result, some Venezuelans are wary of demonstrations or see them as futile.And Venezuela’s poor have to prioritize the all-consuming task of finding affordable food, while many remain skeptical of the opposition, which has a reputation for elitism and whose internal squabbles have for years been a boon for “Chavismo.”Still, the opposition estimates 1 million anti-government protesters flooded Caracas early last month in the biggest demonstration for over a decade, and was hoping for a similar or better turnout across Venezuela on Wednesday.Maduro said he was convening a special Committee for the Defense of the Nation at the presidential palace on Wednesday, to analyze the National Assembly’s actions against him and a tentatively scheduled dialog with the opposition this weekend.National Assembly head Henry Ramos, a veteran politician who swaps insults with Maduro near-daily, was invited."

And while he says he doesn’t see eye-to-eye with Clinton on everything, he writes, “I agree with Clinton more than I disagree with her.”“I am voting for Hillary Clinton,” he wrote. “Clinton has the plan to move American forward. I believe in moving forward.”McKesson, who has been at the front lines of protests across the country demanding justice for black lives, has become a public figure for his relentless activism. Earlier this year, he ran for public office when he campaigned to be the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, his hometown city where protests sparked in April 2015 over the death of Freddie Gray. Mckesson has also separately met with Bernie Sanders, during his run for president, as well as Clinton to discuss various policy proposals. Through it all, racial progress has always been a priority for McKesson, and while he refers to Clinton’s weaknesses with regard to issues of race earlier in the campaign, he says he's confident she's evolve.  “When Clinton started this campaign, she didn’t appear to understand the urgency of the need to address racism. When I first met with her in October 2015, she had not yet released comprehensive policy positions dealing with racial justice. She seemed slow to grasp why it was important to act with comprehensive proposed solutions.”McKesson said he also credits the civil unrest that has erupted over the unjust police killings of black men and women as reasons for why Democrats have pushed for stronger proposals on issues he believes matter most. They include the use of private prisons, increasing the minimum wage, examining the role of institutional and implicit bias and acknowledging the need to address racism directly, among others.“Clinton’s platform on racial justice is strong: It is informed by the policy failings of the past and is a vision for where we need to go,” he wrote, before going on to explain how Clinton’s new proposal promises to undo key parts of the controversial 1994 crime bill that was signed into law by Bill Clinton. As for his take on Trump, McKesson says the republican presidential nominee is an abomination to American democracy and that he only wants to take the country backwards.“When Trump says, ‘Make America great again,’ he is referencing an era when people were singled out and harmed because of their race and religious beliefs, and when violent enforcement of Jim Crow masqueraded as the will of the people,” he wrote. McKesson said America needs to look past Trump and although Clinton may not be perfect, he believes that she is best equipped to lead the nation as its next president. “Politics is compromise, by its very nature,” he said. “But we never compromise on our values and beliefs. I will vote for Clinton and plan to continue to challenge her on her platform and these commitments when she’s in the White House.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Social media amplifies the human tendency to bind with one’s own kind. It tends to reduce complex social challenges to mobilizing slogans that reverberate in echo chambers of the like-minded rather than engage in persuasion, dialogue and the reach for consensus. Hate speech and untruths appear alongside good intentions and truths. We’ve seen this both in the Trump campaign in the United States as well as the Brexit campaign in Great Britain.When the body politic is serially divided among itself, each “tribe” hewing to its own chosen reality, polarization rigidifies. Paralysis and gridlock set in. Simple answers or authoritarian and strongman alternatives start to look like attractive ways to create order out of chaos.Wael Ghonim, a social activist whose Facebook posts helped ignite what would become the Arab Spring in Egypt in 2011, has experienced this process firsthand. During the Egyptian revolution, Ghonim said he thought that, “all you need is the internet” to set a society free. It turned out otherwise. That revelation has given the man, once branded the face of his country’s revolution by Western media, pause for further reflection. It prompted him to found Parlio, an online social platform to promote civility and dialogue. He is now pursuing the same aim at Quora. Ghomin spoke to The WorldPost via email about about how to curb the “mobocracy” of social media and make it more of a platform for civil, reasoned reflection that fosters consensus instead of polarization.At what point in your experience did you realize that the participatory power of social media has a big downside? What event, or series of events, changed your mind?This wasn’t triggered by a single event. It started to become more clear to me as we were having more serious conflicting views on the way forward for Egypt after the collapse of the [former Egyptian President Hosni] Mubarak’s regime. This wasn’t just about “social media” being mainly responsible for the divide ― to elevate it to that role would be as naive as calling the revolution, “the social media revolution.”I started to notice that our leaderless movement was turning into a mobocracy. Those with the loudest voices were defining the roadmap. Instead of having a vision for a future that we agreed on, we were all led into a cul-de-sac of unintended consequences by spontaneous and reactive decision-making.While social media did not create this underlying dynamic, there is no doubt that the algorithmic structure of social media amplified and abetted the turn to mobocracy. The internet has empowered the masses and introduced a more decentralized medium for communicating with each other. But is this so-called “liquid democracy” without any form of meritocracy that sorts out the wheat from the chaff a good thing for society?In the current U.S. presidential campaign, [GOP nominee] Donald Trump is a living example of the damage the mobocratic algorithms of social media can do to the democratic process. He effectively used social media to bypass both the political establishment and the mainstream press.Would he have been able to do this 20 years ago? I highly doubt it. The attention he got was mainly due to the power of social networks vis-à-vis the old political parties and the crisis facing the mainstream media who are desperately chasing views regardless of the substance. As Trump put it [in regards to his large Twitter following]: What exactly do you mean by “mobocratic algorithms”? In social media today, the ultimate prize is getting more eyeballs on posts. For that to happen, the system is designed to reward content that gets the largest number of “likes” and comments.Why is that a problem? That might work really well when one of us shares a photo of our family, or of a recent adventure, with friends. But when exchanging opinions, content that would draw “likes” or comments is content that confirms people’s biases or, the opposite, that elicits highly passionate and emotional comments against a post, crowding out the less emotive and cooly analytical opinions that would add productively to the conversation.Can this platform be transformed to enable a refinement of raw emotion, to enlarge the public view through dialogue, negotiation and consensus?That is the challenge. While once social media was seen as a liberating means to speak truth to power, now the issue is how to speak truth to social media.As I’ve said, today’s social media currency is based on the numbers of followers, likes and shares. You are rewarded for broadcasting your opinion much more than engaging in conversations. And the more you appeal to those who agree with you, the more social currency you are going to get.People will be as shallow as platforms allow them to be. Products are like social movements ― they have implicit cultural norms that people follow. As a product manager I’ve learned through the years that you can design for product experiences that engages people in anyway you want. If you want to see more dialogue, you simply have to create product experiences that reward such a dialogue and make it satisfying to those who are engaged in it. The critical question, then, is, “what is the incentive for social media platforms to do so?”What responsibility do the Silicon Valley giants who drive social media have to temper the mobocratic algorithm? Do they have any incentive to do so as long as the business model is based on ads chasing eyeballs?This is one of the tough questions that, for the short term, I have no answer for. But I believe that we are seeing more and more people talk about these issues. This will eventually make creating more meritocratic algorithms that encourage reasoned dialogue part of the bottom line of social media platforms.For example, for many years Twitter ignored the trolling/harassment problem, and [that] in the past few years backfired a lot on them to the extent that it started hurting their own business bottom line. So now they are working on figuring out how to curb it.Our duty is to increase the awareness about these issues in public, and as I said earlier, speak truth to social media power.We’ve seen this in other industries in the past. Take the oil industry, for example. It now spends billions of dollars to be more socially responsible. The good news is that it won’t take us decades before we see “social media responsibility.” It will evolve much faster.Isn’t the imperative to monetize content by reaching the most eyeballs already leading to a kind of self-censorship ― “That won’t get so many views, let’s not publish it”?Absolutely. We are trained to adapt to systems. In the present system, why would someone invest in something that would take more time and get less traction?As you suggest, this continuous effort to grab attention not only affects users, but producers of content [as well]. The primary incentive is to create sensational content that more eyeballs will turn toward. What used to be a small, fun article on the 18th page of the Guardian, could now be the only featured article that people see in their feed from the news organization or on Facebook.What would an algorithm that promotes truth-seeking dialogue and civility ― a meritocratic instead of mobocratic algorithm ― look like? Algorithms could start embedding credibility features within their ranking to give more distribution to content that is vetted as truthful or constructive. One of the living proofs of this possibility is the Google page rank algorithm, which does take credibility of a web page into account as one of the many signals for whether a specific page should be featured as the first answer when people search for a particular keyword. One major difference to note here, however, is that the wisdom of the crowds at Google is much easier because the crowd isn’t publicly influenced by others. In social media, people end up seeing what others think before they decide on their reaction to a specific post. Some have argued that the silo and filter bubble effect is simply a response to the avalanche of information available today. It is a way to organize information overload. As social media and the web mature, do you see a resurgence of “curation” as the next response to overload, in effect, the return of trusted mediators and experts instead of the information anarchy of amateurs?That’s already happening today in many ways. There is one thing I want to highlight though. The fact that we are living in information overload doesn’t mean that only presenting users with content that they are going to “like” or “comment” on is the right way to go.In machine learning there is what we call “exploit,” which is when you optimize the algorithm to increase the probability of a user expanding or liking or commenting on a post. But there is also code to “explore” ― when you are showing content where you have no idea whether the user will like it or not, but are trying to find out. Given the economy of the web today, most of the platforms focus too much on “exploiting” and less so on “exploring” and being exposed to all that other information out there that we might not otherwise see.So, bottom line, you are saying the message can catch up to the medium if we put our minds to it?Absolutely. If there is will, there is power. We are already seeing the glimmers of it today, and it’s our job to keep pushing the limits and speak the truth to social media platforms.This interview has been edited for clarity."

Thomas stands on the roof of Mar Mattai -- a reportedly 1600-year-old Christian monastery, known as one of the oldest in the world -- as U.S.-led airstrikes pound Islamic State positions in the distance.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f6f8f1800002d00dc407f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MAR MATTAI MONASTERY, Iraq ― Standing atop the fourth-century monastery he calls home, the Rev. Thomas peers out at a sand-hued horizon. The morning is still and silent, except for birds singing in the nearby bell tower.Then, a thunderous boom breaks the calm, sending the birds into flight. It’s the sound of U.S.-led airstrikes on Islamic State militants mere miles from here. When ISIS took over large swaths of Iraq in the summer of 2014, including nearby Bashiqa ― the once religiously and ethnically mixed city wedged up against this mountainside Christian enclave ― he decided to stay, whatever the cost.“In the beginning, we were afraid, but Saint Matthew was protecting us,” said the stoic monk, referring to a Syriac Christian saint who sought refuge in northern Iraq and founded the monastery, now one of the oldest in the world.As Thomas spoke, war planes flew overhead and another strike shook the monastery.At least 70 families sought refuge here, by Thomas’ count, just as their ancestors did in centuries past, fleeing persecution to this mountainside sanctuary. “If ISIS had reached here,” he said, “they would have driven us out.” Thomas would have been just one of a long line of monks killed or expelled by invaders and rulers throughout the monastery’s 1600-plus years of history. But luck ― or faith, as he says ― was on his side. ISIS never made it to Mar Mattai. The extremist fighters stopped just short. And now, over two years later, the militant group’s power seems to be waning. A U.S.-backed offensive launched on Oct. 17 could push ISIS out of its last main stronghold here and end its reign as a land-holding force in Iraq. But the effort could take months and come at great human cost ― as the death toll is already steadily rising.The push gives Thomas hope. And he’s not the only one.In recent days, Iraqi and Kurdish forces have retaken numerous predominantly Christian areas from ISIS. Though some towns and buildings have been damaged and booby-trapped by the hardliners, their churches looted and homes leveled in airstrikes, the fact that ISIS is on the run is cause for celebration for the Iraqi religious minority they have so terrorized. When Nadia Younan heard the war planes and air strikes over Bashiqa, she was overcome with feeling ― and it wasn’t the fear that has consumed her since ISIS rose to power. “I’m so happy!” she said, giddily. “The bombing means they’re taking out ISIS.”The 57-year-old lived in Mosul all her life before ISIS forced her out over two years ago. She was given a choice: convert to their violent, skewed version of Islam or die. Younan chose life. She left Mosul with her family on July 19, 2014, at seven in the morning. That moment is burned in her memory. It was a Saturday, she recalls, when she left her home for the last time with a few meager belongings ― mostly cash and medicine for her ailing mother. “Are you Nasara?” asked an ISIS fighter manning a checkpoint on the edge of the city. He was using a term to mean the followers of Christ, from Nazareth. ISIS militants have routinely painted Christian homes with the Arabic letter nun, or “N.”When the fighter realized the family was indeed Christian, he pocketed what little they had left, ordering them to leave. Younan didn’t have a cent to pay the driver who had risked his life to shuttle them to safety, but he bid them farewell without protest. “He was a good Muslim,” she said, thinking back fondly. With no money and nowhere to go, Younan and her family made their way up the winding mountain path to Mar Mattai. “God directed us here,” she said, looking around at the cream colored stone courtyard. “We are safe.”She’s lived here ever since, relying on the good grace of the monks for basic necessities. Younan was heartbroken when her neighbors of three decades joined ISIS. Though she may never return to Mosul, she said, if the militants lose power, it could open a new chapter for Christians here. “We want to come back to life,” she said, her lip quivering as she held back tears. While the monastery is quiet and near-empty now, it was bustling in 2014 when ISIS advanced on a handful of Christian towns and cities in the area.The mountain’s name ― Alfaf, from the root Arabic word meaning “thousand” ― pays homage to the thousands of monks who at one time lived and worshipped here.Most displaced families who initially fled to Mar Mattai have since moved on, fearful that ISIS could possibly break through the Kurdish Peshmerga fighter lines guarding them and storm Mar Mattai, as they have done at other monasteries and religious sites. They feared they would suffer the same fate as the Yazidis, murdered en masse, their bodies dumped in shallow graves not far from their own ancestral homeland in northern Iraq. ISIS forced thousands more into sexual enslavement and child soldier training camps. “ISIS hates all people,” said Bashar Behnam, a local school bus driver, who is Christian. “They hate Sunnis, Shias, Kurds, Christians and Yazidis.”Before ISIS dug in their heels and gained local support ― mainly due to Sunni Arab grievances towards then Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki and his Shiite-led government they slammed as sectarian and authoritarian ― Behnam never had any problems with his Muslim neighbors, he said.“They have no religion!” a woman standing nearby yelled out, referring to the form of Islam ISIS claims to follow. Though the militant group is being pushed out of the area surrounding Mar Mattai, locals still worry about ISIS mortars hitting their homes.Just last month, several mortars targeted a religious celebration near the monastery, locals say. Some men took up arms when ISIS encroached in order to defend their homes, churches and monastery against the heavily armed militant group. While some local Christians have yet to come back, families are slowly returning to the tiny villages below Mount Alfaf. Behnam said he had considered smuggling his family to Europe, following the footsteps of his son, who left in 2015 after the local economy tanked due to ISIS ruling next door. The trip cost $11,000. Behnam’s son now works at a pizza shop in Sweden.“We are so tired,” the 46-year-old said wearily. “It’s always war, war, war.” But Behnam says he’s since changed his mind. He’s not going anywhere.

13,THE WORLDPOST,"Iraqi Christians, Protecting An Ancient Monastery, Watch Battle Against ISIS With Hope",Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iraqi-christians-mosul-isis_us_580f1bc5e4b0a03911ee88ca,One Christian woman fled Mosul after ISIS gave her a choice: convert or die.,2016-10-26,Birds perch and sing inside of a bell tower at Mar Mattai Monastery.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f71bc1a000071285bba19.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MAR MATTAI MONASTERY, Iraq ― Standing atop the fourth-century monastery he calls home, the Rev. Thomas peers out at a sand-hued horizon. The morning is still and silent, except for birds singing in the nearby bell tower.Then, a thunderous boom breaks the calm, sending the birds into flight. It’s the sound of U.S.-led airstrikes on Islamic State militants mere miles from here. When ISIS took over large swaths of Iraq in the summer of 2014, including nearby Bashiqa ― the once religiously and ethnically mixed city wedged up against this mountainside Christian enclave ― he decided to stay, whatever the cost.“In the beginning, we were afraid, but Saint Matthew was protecting us,” said the stoic monk, referring to a Syriac Christian saint who sought refuge in northern Iraq and founded the monastery, now one of the oldest in the world.As Thomas spoke, war planes flew overhead and another strike shook the monastery.At least 70 families sought refuge here, by Thomas’ count, just as their ancestors did in centuries past, fleeing persecution to this mountainside sanctuary. “If ISIS had reached here,” he said, “they would have driven us out.” Thomas would have been just one of a long line of monks killed or expelled by invaders and rulers throughout the monastery’s 1600-plus years of history. But luck ― or faith, as he says ― was on his side. ISIS never made it to Mar Mattai. The extremist fighters stopped just short. And now, over two years later, the militant group’s power seems to be waning. A U.S.-backed offensive launched on Oct. 17 could push ISIS out of its last main stronghold here and end its reign as a land-holding force in Iraq. But the effort could take months and come at great human cost ― as the death toll is already steadily rising.The push gives Thomas hope. And he’s not the only one.In recent days, Iraqi and Kurdish forces have retaken numerous predominantly Christian areas from ISIS. Though some towns and buildings have been damaged and booby-trapped by the hardliners, their churches looted and homes leveled in airstrikes, the fact that ISIS is on the run is cause for celebration for the Iraqi religious minority they have so terrorized. When Nadia Younan heard the war planes and air strikes over Bashiqa, she was overcome with feeling ― and it wasn’t the fear that has consumed her since ISIS rose to power. “I’m so happy!” she said, giddily. “The bombing means they’re taking out ISIS.”The 57-year-old lived in Mosul all her life before ISIS forced her out over two years ago. She was given a choice: convert to their violent, skewed version of Islam or die. Younan chose life. She left Mosul with her family on July 19, 2014, at seven in the morning. That moment is burned in her memory. It was a Saturday, she recalls, when she left her home for the last time with a few meager belongings ― mostly cash and medicine for her ailing mother. “Are you Nasara?” asked an ISIS fighter manning a checkpoint on the edge of the city. He was using a term to mean the followers of Christ, from Nazareth. ISIS militants have routinely painted Christian homes with the Arabic letter nun, or “N.”When the fighter realized the family was indeed Christian, he pocketed what little they had left, ordering them to leave. Younan didn’t have a cent to pay the driver who had risked his life to shuttle them to safety, but he bid them farewell without protest. “He was a good Muslim,” she said, thinking back fondly. With no money and nowhere to go, Younan and her family made their way up the winding mountain path to Mar Mattai. “God directed us here,” she said, looking around at the cream colored stone courtyard. “We are safe.”She’s lived here ever since, relying on the good grace of the monks for basic necessities. Younan was heartbroken when her neighbors of three decades joined ISIS. Though she may never return to Mosul, she said, if the militants lose power, it could open a new chapter for Christians here. “We want to come back to life,” she said, her lip quivering as she held back tears. While the monastery is quiet and near-empty now, it was bustling in 2014 when ISIS advanced on a handful of Christian towns and cities in the area.The mountain’s name ― Alfaf, from the root Arabic word meaning “thousand” ― pays homage to the thousands of monks who at one time lived and worshipped here.Most displaced families who initially fled to Mar Mattai have since moved on, fearful that ISIS could possibly break through the Kurdish Peshmerga fighter lines guarding them and storm Mar Mattai, as they have done at other monasteries and religious sites. They feared they would suffer the same fate as the Yazidis, murdered en masse, their bodies dumped in shallow graves not far from their own ancestral homeland in northern Iraq. ISIS forced thousands more into sexual enslavement and child soldier training camps. “ISIS hates all people,” said Bashar Behnam, a local school bus driver, who is Christian. “They hate Sunnis, Shias, Kurds, Christians and Yazidis.”Before ISIS dug in their heels and gained local support ― mainly due to Sunni Arab grievances towards then Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki and his Shiite-led government they slammed as sectarian and authoritarian ― Behnam never had any problems with his Muslim neighbors, he said.“They have no religion!” a woman standing nearby yelled out, referring to the form of Islam ISIS claims to follow. Though the militant group is being pushed out of the area surrounding Mar Mattai, locals still worry about ISIS mortars hitting their homes.Just last month, several mortars targeted a religious celebration near the monastery, locals say. Some men took up arms when ISIS encroached in order to defend their homes, churches and monastery against the heavily armed militant group. While some local Christians have yet to come back, families are slowly returning to the tiny villages below Mount Alfaf. Behnam said he had considered smuggling his family to Europe, following the footsteps of his son, who left in 2015 after the local economy tanked due to ISIS ruling next door. The trip cost $11,000. Behnam’s son now works at a pizza shop in Sweden.“We are so tired,” the 46-year-old said wearily. “It’s always war, war, war.” But Behnam says he’s since changed his mind. He’s not going anywhere. And the offensive to retake Mosul from ISIS was a big deciding factor.Around him, the rumble of war echoed across the sandy plains. But with it came another sound, like a breath of life: children playing in the street and the clanging of workers building a family house.“I have more faith now than ever,” he said, smiling softly beneath a canopy of citrus trees.Kamiran Sadoun contributed reporting.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Investment in clean energy capacity beat that of fossil fuels 2 to 1 between 2008 and 2015, according to the United Nations Environment Program.Leaders in the environmental community praised the statistics. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, hailed the move as a “historic milestone,” but he called on leaders to “maintain our focus to keep up the momentum” behind the clean energy transition.“The international community has reached a turning point as we hit the accelerator on the transition to a clean energy economy,” Brune said in a statement. “This news doesn’t just mean the world installed more renewable energy than dirty coal ― it means cleaner air, new jobs, and a more stable climate.”While the IEA did raise its estimate for the amount of renewable energy produced by 2021, the agency also warned of barriers to entry in developing countries and renewed calls for “stronger policy efforts” in the heat and transportation sectors."

The new study, published in the journal Nature, offers some of the first genetic proof.“What we’ve done here is tried to get at the origins of the first cases of AIDS that were ever noticed,” said Michael Worobey, the evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who led the study.Using a painstaking new approach, Worobey and colleagues pieced together the entire genetic sequence of the HIV virus from eight archived blood samples taken in 1978 and 1979 from gay and bisexual men participating in a hepatitis B study.The team traced genetic changes in the virus samples taken from male patients in New York and San Francisco. The researchers found that the HIV virus first jumped from the Caribbean to New York City around 1970, triggering the North American epidemic.The team used the same approach to extract the full HIV genetic code from “Patient Zero,” a flight attendant identified as Gaetan Dugas in the Randy Shilts 1987 bestseller “And the Band Played On.”Shilts, who wrote his book after Dugas had died, identified him as playing a key role in spreading the virus; media accounts painted him as a villain. The new study, however, found no biological evidence suggesting Dugas was the primary cause of the HIV epidemic in North America.Dugas was first associated with the epidemic through a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that connected AIDS to sexual transmission of the disease in a cluster of 40 homosexual men.In the study, Dugas was identified as “Patient O” because he was from outside of California, where the outbreak was believed to have started. That letter “O” was later mistaken for the number “0” and Dugas eventually became known as “Patient Zero,” meaning the first patientinfected in an epidemic.“This individual was simply one of thousands infected before HIV was recognized,” study co-author Richard McKay, a medical historian at the University of Cambridge, told reporters in a telephone briefing.Worobey said the technique developed to extract and restore HIV genes from old blood samples borrows from technology used to identify ancient DNA.Once they had the genetic code, the team evaluated the mutations made by the virus as it copied itself. This allowed the team to build an HIV family tree. Worobey believes a chimp first infected a human in Africa in the early 20th century. The virus that caused the U.S. epidemic emerged from Africa in the mid to late-1960s, and caused an outbreak in Haiti and other Caribbean countries.In 1970 or 1971, this strain hopped from Haiti to New York, making the city a hub of transmission, Worobey said. The virus spread to a large number of people “many years before AIDS was noticed,” he said.The team believes the virus arrived in San Francisco in 1975. The first five cases of AIDS were identified in California 1981, and they were first attributed to HIV in 1984.“Our analysis shows that the outbreaks in California that first caused people to ring the alarm bells and led to the discovery of AIDS were really just offshoots of the earlier outbreak in New York City,” Worobey said.

Scientist anticipated mass casualties.And those predictions have come to fruition, according to Gergely Torda, a researcher with the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce that recently revisited many of those sites.“Basically we have seen the better [healthier] part of the reef so far,” said Torda, midway through a secondary survey of those initial reefs. “But it confirms what our predictions were for the portion of the reef that would eventually die.”Bleached corals, named for when they turn bright white, aren’t actually dead. But the color change happens in times of stress, usually when water temperatures become too warm and force the vivid algae that lives inside corals to leave. Corals can recover, but if temperatures are too warm for too long, the structures can die.Torda’s team, led by Professor Terry Hughes, has only seen about 50 of the initial 83 reefs at this stage, mostly in the healthier and only somewhat-bleached regions near the lower and middle sectors of the Great Barrier. But mortality is high enough that eventual forays into what was once the most pristine sector of the reef ― the 400-mile stretch alongside the northernmost part of Australia ― will most likely reflect dire results.Reefs around Lizard Island, an epicenter of coral research off Far North Queensland, have “pretty much no coral left,” Torda said.“In March, we measured a lot of heavily bleached branching corals that were still alive, but we didn’t see many survivors this week,” said Andrew Hoey, a Taskforce researcher working on the island, in a press release. “A lot of the survivors are in poor shape.” Although the full scale of death won’t be known until November, none of the horror is unexpected. Researchers have warned the ongoing effects of climate change could continue to wallop sensitive coral ecosystems with increased frequency, and severity. Some describe the Great Barrier as a marathoner trying to heal itself from an injury, but repeated races could prove too much in the coming decades.However, despite the urgent need for action, scientist have warned against writing an obituary for the reef too soon.

The message should be that it isn’t too late for Australia to lift its game and better protect the GBR, not we should all give up because the GBR is supposedly dead.”Torda said there is hope for the most hard-hit regions of the reef to heal, but recovery efforts are usually “measured in decades in a very optimal scenario.” Even if the world were to halt all production of fossil fuels tomorrow, the planet is still locked in to continued warming over that period that could very well hit the Great Barrier while it was down, he said.“This unfortunate event is now probably a wake-up call to the public, to policy makers, and hopefully we’ll have a positive outcome,” Torda added. “The question that I have is: ‘Is it too late or not.’”You can view a full map documenting the severity of coral bleaching along the Great Barrier Reef here."

Masonry fell from some buildings in Rome.The epicentres of the quakes were near the town of Castelsantangelo sul Nera in the Marche region.The historic late 15th-century rural church of San Salvatore in Campo, near Norcia in the Umbria region, which had been weakened by the August quake, collapsed.Electrical power was lost in some of the areas and some roads were closed.Wednesday’s earthquakes caused more damage to already precarious structures in Amatrice, the town worst hit by the 6.2-magnitude tremor in August, officials said, but there were no injuries."

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) won’t say which presidential candidate he’s voting for, a curious move considering he’s now changed his mind about his endorsement four times.Kirk, who is struggling in his Senate race against Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth, said months ago that he planned to write in former CIA Director David Petraeus for president. But in an interview with a Chicago radio station on Wednesday, he refused to confirm whether that was still his plan.“I said that largely out of total frustration,” Kirk said. “The joke I’ve seen going around is, ‘If you had a rowboat and it sprung a leak with Hillary and Trump in it and it sank, who would win?’”Asked if that means he doesn’t have a candidate he’s planning to vote for, the Republican senator replied, “I don’t at this point. Pretty frustrated by the choice that we have now.”Kirk’s comments come after he’s endorsed ― and then un-endorsed ― different people for president four times. He originally backed GOP nominee Donald Trump, but announced in June that he couldn’t support him anymore and planned to write in Petraeus instead. In July, he changed his mind and said he planned to write in former Secretary of State Colin Powell. By mid-August, Kirk changed his mind again, and was back to endorsing Petraeus.His latest position, which is that he has no candidate, comes less than two weeks before Election Day.Asked for comment on Kirk’s changing positions, his campaign spokesman Kevin Artl had only this to say: “Give it up.”Kirk isn’t the only GOP lawmaker in a tight race who is trying to escape Trump’s shadow. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) won’t say who he’s voting for, either. Senate hopeful Joe Heck (R-Nev.) said Tuesday that voters don’t have a right to know who he’s voting for. Rep.

24,MEDIA,Donald Trump Campaign Aims To Replace The Media’s ‘Spin’ With Its Own,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-facebook-live_us_580f5979e4b02444efa522e9,"The GOP nominee's team gives its version of the news on Facebook Live, though without newspeople there to challenge them.",2016-10-25,Donald Trump's advisers appeared on a new nightly Facebook Live broadcast.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f5b95180000be00dc4013.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Donald Trump adviser Cliff Sims launched the inaugural episode of a nightly Facebook Live broadcast by promising to give viewers “the message straight from the campaign.”“You don’t have to take it through the media filter and all the spin that they put on it,” Sims said.Instead, the Trump campaign provided its own spin, unchallenged, during a half-hour broadcast that included the familiar trappings of a news program but without journalists who actually report the news. The nightly broadcast should appeal to Trump fans who proudly distrust the “mainstream media” while reflexively believing a historically dishonest candidate and his paid political operatives.Politicians have long used new technology to try getting around the so-called media filter and speaking directly to the American people, from Franklin Roosevelt’s radio broadcasts to the Obama White House’s reliance on social media. Trump, who is said to be considering a post-election media venture, has bragged that having his Twitter and Facebook megaphone is already better than owning The New York Times. It’s given him the ability throughout the election to attack critics and grab headlines. Just as Trump ramps up attacks on the news media for his sinking poll numbers, adviser Boris Epshteyn described Monday’s show as a way of “bypassing the left-wing media.”The co-hosts’ first guest was Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who two hours earlier was herself complaining about media coverage on MSNBC. During the 4 p.m. hour, Conway told MSNBC host Steve Kornacki that he needed to be “more fair” after he accurately pointed out that Hillary Clinton is ahead in all but a few outlier polls. She claimed Trump can’t get a “fair shake” in the media, and criticized the amount of attention given to 12 women claiming Trump sexually harassed or assaulted them, an unprecedented series of allegations made against a major party nominee.Conway questioned whether “what’s passing for breaking news these days and goes on and on and on with endless coverage, particularly on the three major networks, is actually what Americans want to hear.” She said journalists, like Kornacki, were “cherry-picking what you think people want to hear based on what you want to say.”For instance, Conway argued a Wall Street Journal report that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee gave nearly $500,000 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, wife of then-associate FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, deserved “wall-to-wall coverage.” After his wife’s election, McCabe was promoted to deputy director and helped oversee the investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email account when she was secretary of state.While Trump seized on the Journal story Monday as evidence of murky Clinton connections, some media outlets looking into the claims found nothing scandalous. Kornacki, too, indicated he didn’t view the story’s findings as evidence of corruption. (Watch nine minutes in.)The MSNBC host ran through the series of events and asked Conway if she believed “there was sort of foresight on the part of the Clinton campaign to enlist Terry McAuliffe to ask a political action committee to give money to a candidate whose spouse would months later be placed into a position of partial responsibility over an investigation that at the start of that campaign hadn’t even begun?”“At least I got you to spend two or two and a half minutes on it,” Conway responded.Kornacki said Conway’s framing of the story “sounds sinister,” but repeatedly challenged her as to why it supposedly is. “You said it’s a big story,” Kornacki told her. “I’m asking you why it’s a big story, because everything I just ran through doesn’t sound like too big of a story to me. It sounds like something if you put it in a headline, it might be rough, but when you put the context out there, it’s different. So, I’m asking you, what is the scandal there?”Conway revisited other claims against “Hillary Clinton and her ilk,” and questioned why Kornacki, and other journalists, are “deciding” and “curating what you think the news is for the voters.”Of course Kornacki, and other hosts, exercise news judgment in deciding what are the most consequential stories of the day.Around 6:30 p.m., it was Trump’s advisers deciding what story should lead their first broadcast. They went with the McAuliffe story. Co-host Epshteyn described the Virginia governor as someone who “shares very much in [the Clintons’] crooked ways” before turning to Conway. Conway said the events in Virginia were part of a “pattern” with Clinton and her husband, who she described as “grifters and gifters.”Unlike Kornacki, Epshteyn didn’t ask Conway for specifics as to why the state Senate donations were evidence of corruption. Maybe that’s because the co-host suggested himself that they were similar to “what the mob does.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And I’ve been endorsed largely, at least conceptually, by the military. We’ve had tremendous veteran endorsements because the veterans have been treated so unfairly,” the GOP presidential nominee told News4Jax after a meeting with first responders at a county sheriff’s office in St. Augustine, Florida. Trump is once again embellishing the truth about his endorsements.The National Fraternal Order of Police, a union representing its 325,000 members, endorsed Trump. So, too, did the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, a union representing 5,000 immigration officers. Ditto for the National Border Patrol Council, which represents some 16,500 immigration officers. But those groups don’t represent the totality of America’s police or border patrol.Moreover, federal agencies are prohibited from engaging in political activity. As are active-duty military or civilian personnel, under Department of Defense guidelines.Despite his veteran endorsements, Trump’s claim that the military supports him “conceptually” also doesn’t appear to stand up to scrutiny. According to a poll of military service members conducted in September by Military Times and Syracuse University’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families, Trump is statistically tied with Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson.Trump’s disregard for the truth prompted St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office, which he visited Monday in Florida, to issue a clarification on Twitter after the GOP nominee claimed the agency had endorsed him.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

At least one group is already sending its money that way.Women Vote!, a super PAC operated by the pro-choice women’s group EMILY’s List, contributed $325,000 to various state-level super PACs in Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont in October. The group also sent $45,000 to House Majority PAC, a super PAC working to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives.The contributions by Women Vote! are the first the group has made to state-level Democratic Party groups this election cycle. The group is giving $125,000 to Our Vermont, a super PAC run by the Democratic Governors Association; $100,000 to Patriot Majority NM; $50,000 to WIN Minnesota’s 2016 Fund; $35,000 to Colorado Citizens Alliance and $15,000 to the group Common Sense Values, also in Colorado. The money will go toward Democratic efforts to keep control of the governorship in Vermont, win back control of the Minnesota and New Mexico state Houses and win control of the Colorado state Senate.Carolyn Fiddler, spokeswoman for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, characterized the shift in resources down the ballot as “smart investments.”“Campaigns for state legislative races continue up through Election Day,” she said. “The needles are still moving in these races.”These races are all very important to Democrats working to win back or maintain control in states with a strong Democratic tilt. The 2014 midterm elections were a nationwide wipeout for Democrats at the state level. Republicans won control of the Minnesota House (by a wide margin) and the New Mexico House (by a slim margin). In Colorado, Republicans won a one-seat advantage in the state Senate after the successful recall of two Democratic senators for their support of gun control legislation. Now, Democrats hope to win the chambers back.In Vermont, Democrat Sue Minter is in a tight race with Republican Lt. Gov. Phil Scott for the governor’s seat. They are running to replace the unpopular Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin, who chose not to run for another two-year term after serving for eight years.EMILY’s List is currently engaged in a campaign to flip state legislative chambers for Democrats ahead of the 2020 national Census and congressional and state legislative redistricting. Colorado, Minnesota and New Mexico are on the list of states targeted by the group.The group has endorsed seven women in New Mexico House races, including Joanne Ferrary, who is running to defeat an incumbent Republican in a swing district. In Minnesota, they have endorsed five women for the state House. And in Colorado, EMILY’s List has endorsed four women for the state Senate. One of them is Rachel Zenzinger, who is running in a favorable district currently held by a Republican.The contributions by Women Vote! are not the only ones from national groups to down-ballot super PACs. Labor unions, in particular, are major supporters of Democratic outside groups at the state level.Patriot Majority NM has received $350,000 from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, $100,000 from American Federation of Teachers and $65,000 from the National Education Association’s super PAC. The New Mexico group also received $100,000 from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund.WIN Minnesota’s 2016 Fund received $475,000 from AFSCME’s national and local committees and $150,000 from the NEA. It also received $50,000 from Bloomberg’s group and $50,000 from Americans for Responsible Solutions, a pro-gun control group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who survived being shot in the head in 2011 in a mass shooting that killed six people.In the past week, Clinton and other major Democratic Party figures have started to focus on promoting down-ballot candidates at their rallies and in advertising. On the stump, Clinton, President Barack Obama and other surrogates have boosted Democratic candidates and offered pointed critiques of Republicans running for the House and Senate.Obama has gone further and endorsed 150 state legislative and judicial candidates. The president’s endorsements are expected to entail his appearance in television and radio ads, robocalls, mailers and other material informing voters.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article mistakenly identified Common Sense Values as a Kentucky group. In fact, EMILY’s List has not made a contribution to any Kentucky super PACs.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

27,WOMEN,‘Good Girls Revolt’ Is A Show About 1969 That Will Ring True For Women In 2016,Taylor Pittman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/good-girls-revolt-joy-bryant-eleanor-holmes-norton_us_580f7668e4b000d0b158b201,As star Joy Bryant says: “We’re still talking about this shit.”,2016-10-25,"In ""Good Girls Revolt,"" Joy Bryant portrays Eleanor Holmes Norton, the lawyer who represented a group of women who sued Newsweek magazine for discrimination in 1970.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f86f1180000be00dc40f9.jpeg?cache=c7xRc9g9tX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amazon show “Good Girls Revolt” focuses on the lives of a very particular group of New York women in the late 1960s. But the issues it zeroes in on are still painfully relevant to many American women.“Good Girls Revolt” is centered around a group of women who work as researchers (never writers or editors ― those jobs are reserved for their male colleagues) at the fictional News of the Week magazine. Eventually, they decide to file a lawsuit against their company for gender discrimination.The premise is a fascinating one, even more so because it’s based on a real landmark discrimination case filed against Newsweek magazine in 1970. The experience prompted Lynn Povich, one of the women behind the suit, to write the 2012 book The Good Girls Revolt. Actress Joy Bryant plays Eleanor Holmes Norton, the lawyer who represented the women ― and who went on to become a U.S. congresswoman. Bryant told The Huffington Post she was “so honored” to portray Norton, a game-changing presence in both the civil rights and women’s movement.“She is, was and will always be a badass, and she was a badass during a time where it was very dangerous for women or black women or black people to be badasses,” Bryant said.HuffPost spoke to Bryant about her portrayal of Norton, the feminist movement of the ‘60s and today, and her character’s “amazing” afro. Did you get to meet Eleanor Holmes Norton?I did. I met her right before we began filming and have seen her since.What was she like?Every bit as awesome as I imagined her to be. I was honestly very intimidated prior to meeting her because here is a woman who has accomplished so many great things, especially during a time when she was coming up as an esteemed civil rights lawyer and she was always at the front lines of the civil rights movement and the women’s movement. She is lovely. She is brilliant. She is committed. And she’s serious about what she does, but she has a wonderful sense of humor ― and you need to, especially doing the things that she has done.What was it like to portray her after meeting her?It calmed me in a way. I think she liked me when she met me so we hit it off. The next thing was thinking, “I hope she likes what I do.” The last thing I would want is for her to be like, “Ugh, why didn’t they get somebody else to play me?” So there was that for sure, but I tried to put that out of my mind as much as possible and just trust that my conversations with her and my own research meant I would do her justice and I really hope that I have.Watch the trailer for “Good Girls Revolt” below.Early on in “Good Girls Revolt,” one of the characters explains that when she decides to have a kid she’s going to quit her job at News of the Week so she can focus on her family. When Norton decides to represent the women at the company, she’s pregnant. Was that contrast intentional?Eleanor was and is a woman who is self-possessed and was comfortable in the work-life balance. Her career was very important to her as was being a mother, but she didn’t see there being issue with her having both of them. And it’s not so much about having it all because no one can have it all, but you can have a lot of what you want. I think at the end of the day the fight is for the choice to live your life the way that you want to live it. If you want to work and have a family, then you should be supported in that. If you decide that you want to take a break from your career to stay at home, then you should be supported in that as well.That’s what it’s all about. It’s having the freedom to make the choices that we want and feeling comfortable and supported in the choices that we make. I think that’s what the ultimate fight of feminism is all about really. I think that Eleanor from the very beginning understood the intersection between feminism and civil rights, feminism and the struggle for black liberation, and she was always at the forefront of those issues.In one scene, Norton tries to persuade another woman of color to join the lawsuit against the magazine. What was creating that scene like?That was one of my favorite scenes, and it was very important to me that in my appealing to her that I try to express to her our commonality. [In the show I tell her something like], even though the box that [a white character] is in looks prettier than yours, she’s still in a box. We are connected and her fight is our fight and our fight should be theirs as well.In actuality, the black researchers were not a part of the lawsuit, but I think that what was interesting about playing it this way is that it was great to have that conversation. It really touches on not just feminism as a whole, but also white feminism or mainstream feminism vs. black feminism, feminism of women of color. With women back then and even now, there’s often a tone deafness when it comes to women of color within the women’s movement. We all have to understand that as we talk about feminism, as we talk about things that affect women, we have to address race and we have to understand intersectionality of all these things. I feel like that scene touches on that.You’ve mentioned how the show focuses on issues that are still important today even though it’s set in the late 1960s. What was it like portraying a character in the past while also acknowledging that women and people of color are still fighting for equality today?What’s crazy and wonderful about being involved in this show is that we’re not just talking about history. I mean we are, but it’s not just something that happened in the past and that’s it. We’re talking about issues then that are still relevant now. On one side, women like the women who filed the suit, women like Eleanor Holmes Norton, the fight that they gave back then continues today and we are all beneficiaries of that. But on the other side, we’re talking about the same thing. I’m just wearing an afro and we’re wearing period clothes. That’s the only difference. We’re still having these conversations. We’re still breaking glass ceilings. We’re still fighting for reproductive rights. We’re still fighting for the same things. If anything, being a part of this show and having these conversations, I think that it made being a sister even more important to me, not that it wasn’t before but to see myself within this struggle more clearly I walked away with a stronger sense of sisterhood. Also it was frustrating because it’s like, “We’re still talking about this shit.”It’s so relevant and now as we’re approaching the dawn of the first female president ― please, Jesus [laughs] ― it is more relevant than ever before. The same way we were when we elected a black president, some people thought that we were automatically post-racial. Electing a female president doesn’t mean that we’re post-sexism or post-misogyny at all. It’s only as the people in power start to see their power slipping away that they grab harder and tighter, so I think it’s only going to get gnarlier. We will be on equal footing one day, but the fight continues. And I think being on this show really brought that home. It’s not just a story that I read. It’s not just something that happened. It’s still happening and we, beneficiaries and fighters, are very much a part of the fight still.Did you find any scenes especially difficult to shoot?As we were filming, one more black body after another black body was being gunned down by police ― unarmed citizens, unarmed black citizens. It felt like as we were filming it was just like, “Jesus Christ.” And I think that everyone is feeling that in a way, or they should. As this show is primarily focused on the women’s aspect of human rights and civil rights, it was also a volatile time then in our country when black people and people of color were fighting for their lives. And we’re still doing that. We’re still talking about gender equality and workplace discrimination and we’re still talking about segregation and we’re still talking about police brutality and we’re still talking about these things. I think the current times definitely affected me to play the past in a way.I think it’s difficult in general to constantly see these images and hear the stories of unarmed black people or just black people in general being murdered by police. That is traumatic. That is race-based trauma and as a black woman how could I not be affected by that? As I’m playing a woman who again was at the front lines, who was with Medgar Evers hours before he died before he was assassinated, who was down in Mississippi, who was fighting a fight. So I can’t help but be even more charged coming on set every day because it’s like, “Damn, when are things really going to change?” Again the fight must go on.So now that the show is finally about to come out, why should people watch “Good Girls Revolt?”“Good Girls Revolt” is a great show touching on some issues that everyone can still relate to now, but also shining light on some really great women who fought for their right to write. So many women have benefited from it. I think it’s a great moment in history that has gone unsung for a long time. And who doesn’t love the ‘60s?Exactly.Oh, and my afro is amazing! That is actually the main reason that they should watch the show. My afro is doing all kinds of things.I’ll just put that down as your answer then. That’s right. Two words: my afro.“Good Girls Revolt” will be released on Amazon on Friday. The pilot is currently available to watch for free.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Bryant told The Huffington Post she was “so honored” to portray Norton, a game-changing presence in both the civil rights and women’s movement.“She is, was and will always be a badass, and she was a badass during a time where it was very dangerous for women or black women or black people to be badasses,” Bryant said.HuffPost spoke to Bryant about her portrayal of Norton, the feminist movement of the ‘60s and today, and her character’s “amazing” afro. Did you get to meet Eleanor Holmes Norton?I did. I met her right before we began filming and have seen her since.What was she like?Every bit as awesome as I imagined her to be. I was honestly very intimidated prior to meeting her because here is a woman who has accomplished so many great things, especially during a time when she was coming up as an esteemed civil rights lawyer and she was always at the front lines of the civil rights movement and the women’s movement. She is lovely. She is brilliant. She is committed. And she’s serious about what she does, but she has a wonderful sense of humor ― and you need to, especially doing the things that she has done.What was it like to portray her after meeting her?It calmed me in a way. I think she liked me when she met me so we hit it off. The next thing was thinking, “I hope she likes what I do.” The last thing I would want is for her to be like, “Ugh, why didn’t they get somebody else to play me?” So there was that for sure, but I tried to put that out of my mind as much as possible and just trust that my conversations with her and my own research meant I would do her justice and I really hope that I have.Watch the trailer for “Good Girls Revolt” below.Early on in “Good Girls Revolt,” one of the characters explains that when she decides to have a kid she’s going to quit her job at News of the Week so she can focus on her family. When Norton decides to represent the women at the company, she’s pregnant. Was that contrast intentional?Eleanor was and is a woman who is self-possessed and was comfortable in the work-life balance. Her career was very important to her as was being a mother, but she didn’t see there being issue with her having both of them. And it’s not so much about having it all because no one can have it all, but you can have a lot of what you want. I think at the end of the day the fight is for the choice to live your life the way that you want to live it. If you want to work and have a family, then you should be supported in that. If you decide that you want to take a break from your career to stay at home, then you should be supported in that as well.That’s what it’s all about. It’s having the freedom to make the choices that we want and feeling comfortable and supported in the choices that we make. I think that’s what the ultimate fight of feminism is all about really. I think that Eleanor from the very beginning understood the intersection between feminism and civil rights, feminism and the struggle for black liberation, and she was always at the forefront of those issues.In one scene, Norton tries to persuade another woman of color to join the lawsuit against the magazine. What was creating that scene like?That was one of my favorite scenes, and it was very important to me that in my appealing to her that I try to express to her our commonality. [In the show I tell her something like], even though the box that [a white character] is in looks prettier than yours, she’s still in a box. We are connected and her fight is our fight and our fight should be theirs as well.In actuality, the black researchers were not a part of the lawsuit, but I think that what was interesting about playing it this way is that it was great to have that conversation. It really touches on not just feminism as a whole, but also white feminism or mainstream feminism vs. black feminism, feminism of women of color. With women back then and even now, there’s often a tone deafness when it comes to women of color within the women’s movement. We all have to understand that as we talk about feminism, as we talk about things that affect women, we have to address race and we have to understand intersectionality of all these things. I feel like that scene touches on that.You’ve mentioned how the show focuses on issues that are still important today even though it’s set in the late 1960s. What was it like portraying a character in the past while also acknowledging that women and people of color are still fighting for equality today?What’s crazy and wonderful about being involved in this show is that we’re not just talking about history. I mean we are, but it’s not just something that happened in the past and that’s it. We’re talking about issues then that are still relevant now. On one side, women like the women who filed the suit, women like Eleanor Holmes Norton, the fight that they gave back then continues today and we are all beneficiaries of that. But on the other side, we’re talking about the same thing. I’m just wearing an afro and we’re wearing period clothes. That’s the only difference. We’re still having these conversations. We’re still breaking glass ceilings. We’re still fighting for reproductive rights. We’re still fighting for the same things. If anything, being a part of this show and having these conversations, I think that it made being a sister even more important to me, not that it wasn’t before but to see myself within this struggle more clearly I walked away with a stronger sense of sisterhood. Also it was frustrating because it’s like, “We’re still talking about this shit.”It’s so relevant and now as we’re approaching the dawn of the first female president ― please, Jesus [laughs] ― it is more relevant than ever before. The same way we were when we elected a black president, some people thought that we were automatically post-racial. Electing a female president doesn’t mean that we’re post-sexism or post-misogyny at all. It’s only as the people in power start to see their power slipping away that they grab harder and tighter, so I think it’s only going to get gnarlier. We will be on equal footing one day, but the fight continues. And I think being on this show really brought that home. It’s not just a story that I read. It’s not just something that happened. It’s still happening and we, beneficiaries and fighters, are very much a part of the fight still.Did you find any scenes especially difficult to shoot?As we were filming, one more black body after another black body was being gunned down by police ― unarmed citizens, unarmed black citizens. It felt like as we were filming it was just like, “Jesus Christ.” And I think that everyone is feeling that in a way, or they should. As this show is primarily focused on the women’s aspect of human rights and civil rights, it was also a volatile time then in our country when black people and people of color were fighting for their lives. And we’re still doing that. We’re still talking about gender equality and workplace discrimination and we’re still talking about segregation and we’re still talking about police brutality and we’re still talking about these things. I think the current times definitely affected me to play the past in a way.I think it’s difficult in general to constantly see these images and hear the stories of unarmed black people or just black people in general being murdered by police. That is traumatic. That is race-based trauma and as a black woman how could I not be affected by that? As I’m playing a woman who again was at the front lines, who was with Medgar Evers hours before he died before he was assassinated, who was down in Mississippi, who was fighting a fight. So I can’t help but be even more charged coming on set every day because it’s like, “Damn, when are things really going to change?” Again the fight must go on.So now that the show is finally about to come out, why should people watch “Good Girls Revolt?”“Good Girls Revolt” is a great show touching on some issues that everyone can still relate to now, but also shining light on some really great women who fought for their right to write. So many women have benefited from it. I think it’s a great moment in history that has gone unsung for a long time. And who doesn’t love the ‘60s?Exactly.Oh, and my afro is amazing! That is actually the main reason that they should watch the show. My afro is doing all kinds of things.I’ll just put that down as your answer then. That’s right. Two words: my afro.“Good Girls Revolt” will be released on Amazon on Friday. The pilot is currently available to watch for free.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Boyd, 22, was killed by a Chicago officer in 2012, and Jones, 55, was killed in 2015. Al Jazeera’s 25-minute film, “The Lives of Black Women,” explores their deaths through interviews with both women’s families.“They don’t talk about women that much when they get killed by the police,” said Boyd’s brother, Martinez Sutton. “They barely talk about women. Why is that? It’s crazy, because you see that even in death, women play the second role.” As of October, 10 black women have been killed by police this year, according to a tracker from The Guardian. The film mentions that, on average, police kill one black woman every month.If there’s a relative lack of publicity about their deaths, there’s also the issue of impunity: In both Boyd and Jones’ cases, the officers who shot them weren’t punished. Dante Servin, the off-duty officer who killed Boyd, was found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2015 because the judge thought he should be facing more severe charges. Robert Rialmo, who killed Jones, was not charged with any wrongdoing.“People don’t care about black women. They just don’t,” said Page May, a teacher and organizer with the grassroots organization Assata’s Daughters, in a scene from the film. “We’re in the way, in the case of Rekia Boyd. We’re angry black women. Or we’re just too angry and too black and too womanly in the case of Sandra Bland. We’re either too ‘X’ or we’re invisible.” Servin, the officer who shot Boyd, explained in the film that he believes police need to have a certain mindset to be effective at their jobs.“As police, you have to have a hunter mentality ― in that you have to to be out there, you have to be the predator, you have to hunt crime,” Servin said. “You have to think like a predator to catch the predators. To be a good policeman, you have to think like that.” But a hunter or warrior mentality ― which trains officers to survive a situation by any means necessary ― is dangerous, often leading to more violence against members of the community. Paul O’Neal, 18, was unarmed when a Chicago police officer shot and killed him after he crashed a stolen car in August. Rialmo, the officer who killed Jones, also shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier, 19, after the teen allegedly swung a baseball bat at him.In 2013, in what is perhaps the most infamous recent case of police brutality in Chicago, former police officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times.This is one reason Sutton continues to fight ― something he had to explain to a police officer at a protest, he said.When the officer asked him why was he still fighting, Sutton replied, “Wouldn’t you? If someone came and took away your sister, your wife or your son or daughter ― would you just stop fighting? Would you stop talking? Would you turn away from the world?”Watch “The Lives of Black Women” in its entirety above. "

The school was his only Power Five offer, and LeVert was a relative afterthought compared to the program’s star players who joined that year, including future pros Trey Burke, Tim Hardaway Jr., Mitch McGary, Nik Stauskas and Glenn Robinson III.But just three years later, LeVert ― selected 20th overall in June’s NBA Draft ― is poised to become one of the league’s top young players. In fact, a lingering health question was the only reason he wasn’t selected in the lottery, after he endured three foot fractures in three years of college.At 6-foot-7 and with a staggering 6-foot-10 wingspan, the Columbus, Ohio, native represents the new age, prototypical NBA wing. LeVert can legitimately guard three positions ― a skill few possess ― and he can score as well.In 15 games as a senior last year, he averaged nearly 17 points while converting 45 percent from distance. Better yet, LeVert offers remarkable versatility as a playmaker and is a consistent wing rebounder, averaging five assists and five rebounds per game.The modern NBA game, more so than ever before, rewards that versatility. Can you create matchup problems? And better yet, can you solve matchup problems?Golden State’s Draymond Green is a great example of this new setup. An unconventional four or even five man for the Warriors, Green ― like LeVert ― doesn’t so much have a “position.” Green is often employed as a center with one lineup, only to assume point-forward duties with another. LeVert doesn’t have the ability to play as many spots on both ends as the All-NBA Green, but he offers a similar skill set. And aside from No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons, the 22-year-old LeVert may have been the most dynamic two-way player in the entire draft class. From an offensive standpoint, he is an effective isolation player and expanded his pick-and-roll game every year in college, a valuable asset in itself. Teams that have capable pick-and-roll wings ― think the Warriors (Klay Thompson), Rockets (James Harden), Raptors (DeMar DeRozan), Clippers (Jamal Crawford) and Blazers (C.J. McCollum) ― become extremely difficult to defend in the half-court, and in turn are some of the league’s top flight offenses.We certainly cannot expect the same out of the Nets, as the team has gone into complete rebuilding mode, shipping off all of their previously valuable assets save for center Brook Lopez. But the good news for LeVert is that recently minted head coach Kenny Atkinson will employ an up-tempo, motion-based offense ― a far cry from the plodding style of former coach Lionel Hollins.LeVert excelled playing in a similar style in college for John Beilein, a creative offensive mind who loved to get his athletes out in space, while also relying on ball movement and dribble-drive in the half-court.And LeVert, to his credit, is hardly lacking in confidence.“I was a lottery type of talent,” he told reporters recently.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

33,POLITICS,Social Security Continues To Lift An Enormous Number Of People Out Of Poverty,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/social-security-poverty-relief_us_580fb43ee4b08582f88c6ab7,"The social insurance program spares more than 22 million Americans from deprivation, according to a new report.",2016-10-25,"President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act on Aug. 14, 1935.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580fc8c41800002d00dc421c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Social Security lifted more than 22 million Americans out of poverty in 2015, according to a report released Tuesday.The new analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, is the annual update of a recurring study using official data on the non-Social Security income of some 60 million beneficiaries of the program. Assuming beneficiaries had to rely exclusively on this non-Social Security income, over 22 million of them would have incomes below the federal poverty level. The paper’s co-authors, Kathleen Romig and Arloc Sherman, admit that the analysis assumes non-Social Security income would remain static in Social Security’s absence. In reality, seniors and disabled workers might save more if they knew they could not rely on the program’s benefits.They nonetheless believe their findings demonstrate the vitality of Social Security’s benefits ― and should give caution to politicians considering cutting the program.“Depending on their design, reductions in Social Security benefits could significantly increase poverty, particularly among the elderly,” Romig and Sherman write.Social Security reduces poverty most dramatically among Americans aged 65 or older, who make up the bulk of beneficiaries, according to the report.Currently, 8.8 percent of Americans aged 65 or older liver in poverty. Without Social Security, however, 40.5 percent of those seniors would be impoverished, CBPP found.The think tank also analyzed Social Security’s impact on elderly poverty in each state.The program lifts the most elderly people out of poverty in Florida.But it reduces the percentage of elderly state residents in poverty by the largest margin in Mississippi. Presently, 14.5 percent of Mississippi residents aged 65 or older live in poverty. Without Social Security, 56.9 percent of those seniors would be in poverty.Of course, Social Security is not just for seniors: the program lifted over 1 million children out of poverty in 2015 as well, according to the report.Social Security plays a lesser-known, but increasingly crucial role in the lives of children, who receive benefits if they have retired, deceased or severely disabled parent.Over 60 million Americans receive Social Security benefits. As of August, the average benefit was $1,238 a month, or $14,857 a year. Beneficiaries will get a 0.3 percent cost-of-living adjustment in 2017 to allow benefits to keep pace with inflation.Originally conceived as a pension benefit for retired workers, it later expanded to include the survivors of deceased workers, as well as severely disabled workers and their dependents.Due to the retirement of the Baby Boomers, Social Security faces a financial shortfall that will prevent it from fully paying all promised benefits starting in 2034 if Congress fails to take action to reform the program. Conservatives favor reforms focused on reducing benefits, while progressives favor revenue increases, like lifting the cap on earnings subject to Social Security payroll taxes. (Americans only pay into Social Security on the first $118,500 they earn.)Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has promised she will not cut benefits and will increase taxes on wealthy Americans to both close the program’s funding gap and increase benefits for vulnerable seniors.Donald Trump, her Republican opponent, has said he would not cut benefits, but offered only vague plans for how he would avoid doing so. He has suggested the program could be made solvent by cracking down on fraud, which is far too uncommon to be a source of major savings, or growing the economy by cutting taxes and repealing Obamacare, which would also fall short of saving Social Security enough money to continue paying out promised benefits in full."
34,POLITICS,"Americans’ Respect For Police Soars To Highest Point In 50 Years, Survey Finds",Max Greenwood,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-respect-surge-2016_us_580f80a1e4b02444efa57a15,"Just last year, people's confidence in their local police was significantly lower.",2016-10-25,"After rising racial tensions and heightened criticism of police brutality in recent years, a Gallup survey finds that respect for law enforcement is at its highest point in 50 years.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f81311a000071285bba8b.jpeg?cache=tLLlWhEp0D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Respect for local police in the United States has hit a 50-year peak, according to a Gallup poll released Monday. About three-quarters of Americans now say they have a great deal of respect for law enforcement in their community, a stark uptick from 2015, which saw Americans’ confidence in police sink to a 22-year low of 52 percent.A number of high-profile police-involved killings of unarmed black men have helped spark a national discussion about police practices over the last couple of years. The debate this year has been fueled in part by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who kneels when the national anthem plays before games in order to protest policing practices he says disproportionately harm people of color. The NFL player has gained supporters and staunch critics over his demonstration ― but although protests and broader conversations about policing have been polarizing, the new survey suggests that speaking out in favor of reform is not necessarily tied to disrespecting police officers. Kaepernick has specifically called out the behavior of “rogue cops,” for example, saying he’s challenging a system that often protects bad officers and resists reforms to bring about transparency and accountability. And other surveys have shown that Americans tend to have more faith in police in their communities, even if they believe there are problems elsewhere in the U.S.The increased respect for law enforcement comes at a time when many officers feel as if they’re on the defensive. Shootings of cops in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Dallas over the summer sparked an outpouring of support for law enforcement, which Gallup notes could play a role in the apparent spike in respect among both whites and nonwhites. A heavily armed gunman shot and killed five police officers in downtown Dallas in July, an act the city’s police chief said was revenge for police-involved shootings of nonwhites. Less than two weeks later, a shooter in Baton Rouge left three officers dead and another three wounded. Months earlier, Louisiana had passed a law making it a hate crime to target police officers and firefighters.Respect for local cops remains divided by race, despite overall gains. White Americans, conservatives and Republicans were most likely to express respect, the survey found, with at least 80 percent of respondents from each group saying they had “a great deal” of respect for police in their area. But some of the largest increases recorded by the survey were among nonwhites and millennials. Sixty-seven percent of nonwhites reported having a great deal of respect for local police, a 14 percent increase over October 2015. Among people aged 18 to 34, respect for law enforcement jumped by 19 percent in 2016, to a total of 69 percent.Still, it’s unclear if the surge in respect for law enforcement in 2016 is simply a reaction to recent events, or if it’s indicative of a continuing trend, according to the poll."
35,POLITICS,Surprising Strength For Donald Trump In This Democratic City,Nico Pitney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-las-vegas-trump_us_5807f924e4b0180a36e8b275,How the presidential race looks from the epicenter of America's housing collapse.,2016-10-25,Hillary Clinton addressed a crowd of supporters in North Las Vegas after her debate against Donald Trump on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580af14f1a000071285bb1ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. ― If Donald Trump manages to eke out a victory in the fiercely contested swing state of Nevada, it will be thanks in part to this sun-blasted Las Vegas suburb, one of the communities hit hardest by America’s most recent housing crash.The Republican nominee’s grip on certain segments of the populace seems to have grown here, even as his standing has weakened elsewhere in the state and country. Hours before the final presidential debate last week, four paid canvassers knocking on doors for Hillary Clinton confronted just that.Though registered Democrats significantly outnumber Republicans in the area, all four Clinton canvassers said they’re finding increasing support for Trump.It’s not just door knocks that suggest that Trump has gained ground here. Donation patterns tell a similar story. In both 2008 and 2012, about twice as many residents in the area donated to Democratic presidential campaigns than to Republicans. This year, more residents are giving overall ― and they’ve donated to Trump by a ratio of 5-to-1.The appeal of Trump in these parts offers one of the best illustrations of how the recession altered modern electoral politics. President Barack Obama may have stabilized the housing market and sparked a modest economic turnaround. But progress has been uneven. And frustrations have boiled over.The housing market in North Las Vegas, Nevada’s fourth-largest city, has recovered since 2011, when one of its zip codes had more foreclosures than any other in America. Yet it is increasingly beset by squatters living in still-vacant properties. Local police received more than twice as many squatter-related calls last year than in 2012.And according to the canvassers, election tensions are running especially high.Ashley, a 20-year-old working for the local Democratic Party, said an older man became enraged when she put campaign materials on his door. “He was like, ‘Don’t leave this on my property! That’s trespassing. I’ll call the police on you!’ Then he went and opened his garage door and flashed a gun.”Another young canvasser, Kia, said a woman chased her after she left a flyer. “She threw it at me, she tried to push me and she told me she was going kick my ass.” (The canvassers I spoke with said they were afraid to give their last names.) The Clinton campaign has sent its highest-powered surrogates to North Las Vegas in recent weeks, including Obama and former President Bill Clinton. Following Wednesday’s debate, Hillary Clinton made a surprise stop to address a rally at the city’s largest park.At that same park, earlier in the day, I chatted with Kyle Chirnside, an audio engineer who self-identified as a conspiracy theorist and former punk-rock anarchist. We watched his 2-year-old daughter frolic around the playground.“I didn’t like the policy that Secretary Clinton put in place about the foreclosures with the banks, the deals that she made with the banks,” he said. “I thought that was kind of abrupt because it left a lot of people without houses.”(It’s unclear what policy he was referring to, as Clinton did not play a significant role in any housing legislation that passed while she was in the Senate.)Chirnside was coy about which candidate he supported. But he said he’s rooting for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and questioned why Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been “silenced” in recent months. (I mentioned that Sanders has actually been on the campaign trail supporting Clinton.)“I’ll vote for anything that brings about chaos at this point,”Chirnside concluded. “We need a little chaos, to shake things up.”Elsewhere, I met Shannon Barton, a real estate agent who said he’d previously backed Obama. “I feel Hillary’s a crook. I’m a registered Democrat. I will not vote for Hillary. I’ll vote for Trump, someone different, just because of all the lies she’s done.”Barton said he felt locals were primarily concerned about the economy, though he acknowledged he was doing well himself. “The housing market’s actually gone up. It’s pretty stable. I’ve had the best year of my career this year.”Nevada voters gave Barack Obama a striking 12-point win in 2008, though his margin of victory dropped to 6 points in 2012. State polls this year have shown a consistently tight presidential race, with Clinton currently enjoying a modest lead.Many of the Clinton supporters I talked to in North Las Vegas sounded like Contreal Lyles, 44, a truck driver, and Julia Lyles, 42, his wife and dispatcher.It’s true, the economic recovery has been slower than they’d like, but things are unquestionably on the mend, they said. Yes, Obamacare’s been too pricey, but it’s a step in the right direction. And Clinton might not be their ideal candidate, but she’s grown on them, and the alternative is unacceptable.“We have two sons in the Air Force,” Julia Lyles shared as she gazed at her younger son playing basketball nearby, explaining why she could never vote for Trump. “We’re going to have war if he gets in.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) wrote in the letter. “We would also strongly recommend that the USGA seriously consider suspending further events at Trump properties.” The USGA has faced renewed calls to move the event in recent weeks, after The Washington Post released a 2005 video in which Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, openly talked about forcing himself on women without their consent.“The decision that the USGA makes is more consequential than simply the geographic location of a golf tournament,” the senators wrote. “In declining future association with a brand that degrades women, the USGA and LPGA have an opportunity to make clear to the world, and most especially young Americans, that our nation will not tolerate nor do business with anyone or any company that condones or excuses action that constitutes sexual assault.”The USGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was addressed to Mike Davis, its CEO. The USGA manages the Women’s U.S. Open, though many of the players are LPGA Tour members. Mike Whan, the head of the LPGA, faced questions about the event during a tournament in South Korea earlier this month. “In a strange way, I’m lucky that the LPGA has no direct dealings with Donald Trump or Donald Trump properties,” Whan said, according to Reuters.Golfweek interviewed a dozen LPGA players during the South Korea event and found that most had no objection to keeping the event at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.English golfer Jodi Ewart Shadoff, however, said the event should be relocated.“On principle, I feel it’s just not right,” she told Golfweek. The USGA, LPGA, PGA Tour and PGA of America all distanced themselves from Trump in July 2015, after he launched his campaign by asserting that Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists and said that his partners in the golf world “know I’m right.” The PGA Tour moved an annual event from Trump’s Doral course in Miami to a new location in Mexico City, but said at the time that the decision was motivated by a sponsorship issue, not his campaign for president.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

They found adult refugees making clothing for Zara and Mango.Since most refugees can’t legally work in Turkey, those in the report had been employed through a middleman who paid them ― often less than $1 per day ― in cash, the report added. The youngest refugee worker, a 15-year-old boy, worked more than 12 hours a day ironing clothes. Other tasks included refugees spraying hazardous chemicals without any face masks.The brands mentioned in the report denied the claims.“All the brands say they carefully monitor their supply chains and do not tolerate the exploitation of refugees or children,” the BBC report said.“We had previously found no evidence of Syrian workers employed in factories that supply us, so we were very disappointed by these findings, which are extremely serious and are unacceptable,” a Marks & Spencer spokesperson told The Huffington Post.The company said it won’t tolerate unethical practices and is working to offer permanent legal employment to all Syrian workers in its factories.Mango, meanwhile, said in a statement that the factory implicated in the report, Goreteks Tekstill, was actually sub-contracted unknowingly. “Under no circumstances was the use of child labor or Syrian workers detected” after performing an audit of the factory, the statement said, adding that Mango is investigating the claims.Currently, almost 3 million Syrian refugees live in Turkey, according to U.N. Refugee Agency data. The ongoing conflict in Syria has forced many to flee for border countries where making a living is often virtually impossible. Turkey is in the process of building a cement wall along its entire border with Syria to stem the refugee inflow. "

Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United bring into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets.“What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton,” Trump said.“You’re not fighting Syria any more, you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,” he said.Trump said Assad is much stronger now than he was three years ago. He said getting Assad to leave power was less important than defeating Islamic State.“Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,” he said.OBAMA FOCUSED “ON HIS GOLF GAME”On Russia, Trump again knocked Clinton’s handling of U.S.-Russian relations while secretary of state and said her harsh criticism of Putin raised questions about “how she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil,” if she wins the presidency.On the deterioration of ties with the Philippines, Trump aimed his criticism at Obama, saying the president “wants to focus on his golf game” rather than engage with world leaders.Since assuming office, Duterte has expressed open hostility towards the United States, rejecting criticism of his violent anti-drug clampdown, using an expletive to describe Obama and telling the United States not to treat his country “like a dog with a leash.”The Obama administration has expressed optimism that the two countries can remain firm allies.Trump said Duterte’s latest comments showed “a lack of respect for our country.”The interview comes two weeks before the Nov. 8 election, with Trump trailing badly in the polls. He repeated his assertion that the “media is rigging the polls” and said his supporters were upset with the leadership of the Republican Party.“The people are very angry with the leadership of this party, because this is an election that we will win 100 percent if we had support from the top. I think we’re going to win it anyway.”He said if he wins he would not consider putting Democrats in his cabinet but would work with them on legislation.(Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson, Alana Wise and Ginger Gibson in Washington and Emily Flitter in New York, editing by Paul Thomasch and Ross Colvin)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

He said 17 soldiers from Djibouti were killed.AMISOM, which is battling the Islamist rebels in support of the government, said a vehicle packed with explosives was set off at the base and 10 suspected al Shabaab militants attacked. “The terrorists were all killed,” it said on Twitter.“Reinforcement from a nearby base was rushed to the camp and the situation swiftly brought under control,” AMISOM added.Al Shabaab, whose assessment of casualties often varies from those of officials, typically rams the entrance to a target site with a car or truck bomb so that its fighters can storm in.The al Shabaab spokesman also said the group shot senior intelligence officer Colonel Abdiasis Araye as he walked to a mosque late on Monday in Mogadishu.He also said al Shabaab was behind Tuesday’s early morning attack on a hotel in Kenya’s northeastern Mandera town, killing at least 12 people according to police and 15 people according to al Shabaab’s account. Al Shabaab has often launched attacks in neighboring Kenya, saying it will continue until Kenyan forces were withdrawn.Kenya’s government has repeatedly said it would not be forced out of Somalia by al Shabaab, saying it sees the mission as a matter of national security."

Mitt Romney, engaged in a pitched fight to unseat President Barack Obama, is campaigning hard as the election closes, drawing major crowds and inspiring Republican visions of a White House takeover. Now imagine, as Romney campaigns, that a story breaks detailing how his onetime company, Bain Capital, took $17 million in insurance money for business damages that it very likely had not incurred. It would be a scandal. Romney’s ethics would be questioned. The campaign would come to a halt for a bit.OK, ignore the insurance fraud. Let’s say as Romney was campaigning down the stretch, a story broke that his super PAC, Restore Our Future, was caught discussing how to secretly funnel illegal donations from a Chinese source into its coffers. Watchdog groups would be in an uproar. Obama’s campaign would pounce and Romney would be forced to condemn the group immediately, lest he seem like he was benefiting from foreign money.Let’s say that neither the Chinese donations nor the insurance fraud happened in our re-imagining of the 2012 election. Instead, an article was published in the closing days of the race saying Romney had held parties with underaged girls and cocaine. OK. That’s impossible to imagine. Let’s say the article reported that he’d openly discussed trying to pick up John Travolta’s wife, Kelly Preston, just days after the couple’s 16-year-old son had died. You’re right ― again, impossible to imagine.How about this: An article came out showing that Romney had used his campaign funds to purchase his own book, No Apology, and then turn around and sell that book at a massively hiked-up price to the very donors who were giving to him in the first place. That could have happened in this altered rendering of 2012. And if it had, Romney would have been viewed as callous, at a minimum, and deceitful at worst.Of course, none of it happened to Romney. As you’ve likely concluded, each one of these stories has popped up about Donald Trump in just the last few days. And they all have had marginal impact at best; disappearing, as Warden Norten would say, “like a fart in the wind.” That may be because they’ve been overshadowed by the broader controversies orbiting Trump’s campaign: the continued accusations of sexual assault and his routine skepticism about the election’s legitimacy. That may be because other items have sucked some oxygen from the room, such as the publication of the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, or the expected sharp rise in premiums for health insurance plans sold on Obamacare exchanges.But in the end, the practical impact is the same. Trump is not Teflon. Cumulatively, these stories have caused damage. He is very likely going to lose the election, and by a margin far greater than Romney did. But he will have fundamentally moved the Overton Window for what qualifies as scandalous behavior for a presidential candidate. That might bring some positives with it in the long run, such as helping wash away some of the puritan sensibilities and standards we have about how politicians should behave. But it will also launch a whole new genre of campaign rationalizations for bad behavior (Trump, remember, will end this campaign having never released his tax returns ― a first for a nominee since the days of Nixon). It will be a while, if ever, before a candidate like Trump runs for president again. But future candidates for president will get graded against Trump. And that will make actual “gaffes,” like the variety that Romney committed ― “binders full of women” comes to mind ― look positively quaint in comparison.

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a news briefing. “You could say that the death rate has increased three-fold.”About 2,200 migrants were plucked to safety in the central Mediterranean in 21 rescue missions on Monday and 16 bodies were recovered, the Italian Coast Guard said.At least 17 corpses from those weekend incidents are being brought to Italy, the International Organization for Migation (IOM) said.“We were told by witnesses there may be many more. There may be other shipwrecks that occurred over the weekend that we’re learning more about,” IOM spokesman Joel Millman said.Since the European Union-Turkey deal in March to close down pathways to Greece, the Libya to Italy route across the central Mediterranean has become the main route. One per every 47 migrants or refugees attempting the voyage between Libya and Italy is meeting is dying, the UNHCR’s Spindler said.“Smuggling has become a big business, it’s being done almost on an industrial scale. So now they send several boats at the same time and that puts rescue services in difficulty because they need to rescue several thousand people on several hundred boats,” he said.“But when you have so many people at sea on boats that are barely seaworthy, then the dangers obviously increase.”"

In October, the U.S. Treasury Department changed a number of the United States' trade and health regulations regarding Cuba. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e3dba1a000074285bb6a3.jpeg?cache=cKzttgkrFI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Dr. C. William Keck sat down to write an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, imploring Congress to end the United States’ Cuba embargo so that Cuban and American researchers could better collaborate, he had no idea that the U.S. Treasury Department’s lift of sanctions was just days away.The embargo isn’t completely gone, but many goods and regulations are now available to Americans. While news of the loosened sanctions has focused on trade policy and travel souvenir rules, Keck sees a clear win for public health and medical research: The government lifted sanctions on joint health research, Cuba pharmaceuticals that earn FDA approval and bank accounts for authorized health-related business, effective October 17. That’s important because many countries around the world look to Cuba as a model for improving population health, an area that Cuba excels in even with modest resources.For example, in June 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eliminate mother-to-child HIV and syphilis transmission, according to the World Health Organization. (In comparison, the United States’chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis rates hit a record high this year.)Previously, if U.S. and Cuban scientists wanted to collaborate on research, the U.S. teams would have to apply for a license ― a bureaucratic hurdle that slowed down medical research and limited binational innovation. What’s more, Cuban medical products were off limits because of the trade embargo.For a glimpse at what easy medical exchange could bring us, look no further than Heberprot-P, a treatment for diabetic foot ulcers that can reduce the risk of amputation and the CimaVax lung cancer vaccine, both of which are approved for FDA evaluation. While CimaVax hasn’t been studied in the United States yet, a Cuban study published in the journal Clinical Cancer Research in February found that non small-cell lung cancer patients who were given four injections of the drug lived an average of three months longer than the control group. For patients with high levels of a certain protein in their blood at the start of the study, the survival effect was more pronounced, with 20 percent of vaccinated patients still alive after five years.HuffPost talked to Keck, who is a professor emeritus at Northeast Ohio Medical University and a member of the Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba, a nonprofit that promotes U.S.-Cuba health collaborations. Here’s what we can learn from Cuba as relations between the two countries continue to thaw:Q: Let’s start at the beginning. How did Cuba build such an advanced health system with limited economic resources? A: At the time of the Cuban revolution, the government made the decision that health care and education were human rights. While you can argue about many things the Cuban government did, those two things they seemed to get right. One of the silver linings of the embargo is that Cuba had to develop its own internal capacity to do research and develop medications because they were cut off from anything produced in the United States. Q: Some of the recommendations you detail in your op-ed have already come to pass. Are there outstanding rules you’d still like to see loosened up? A: Well, what we’d like to see, of course, is the embargo disappear.For example, it’s still illegal for U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba for medical treatment. If you can’t get a drug here, and it might be a lifesaving for you and you want to go there to get it, it’s illegal to do that.Now that doesn’t mean people aren’t doing it. It’s fairly easy to go illegally if you want. But it doesn’t make sense to make it illegal to go there to get medical care. If you are traveling to Cuba and you fall and break your ankle, you can certainly get emergency treatment, but you can’t get primary care or dental care or anything like that. We also suggest allowing interested U.S. health profession students, particularly public health, nursing and medicine students, to be able to go to Cuba and get a degree or take courses.In an era of health reform, it makes sense for physicians, nurses, and quite frankly, others, to better understand a model that melds medicine and public health effectively.Q: What public health lessons can the United States learn from Cuba?A: How do you develop a system that can actually focus on improving population health?They experimented. They went through trial and error and evaluations. In the 80s, they came up with this family doctor and nurse idea, to have a primary care provider who lived in the community and whose major priority was improving population health status. Unlike students trained in the U.S. or Western Europe, Cuban students are trained to improve population health status.We certainly aren’t here. When I went to medical school, I was taught to do battle with disease one patient at a time. You dealt with what came in the door. You didn’t focus much on the community. We diagnosed and treated illness and injury and didn’t worry much about what happened beyond that. It’s a much different approach. Every Cuban [med school] graduate has to be a family physician for two years. If they wish to specialize after that, they can take the exam and if they pass, they can get specialty training.What that means is every physician, even the most esoteric pediatric cardiac surgeon, has a strong understanding of prevention, of family medicine and the system and the way it operates. The family doctor is respected, because every physician has done it and appreciates how hard it is.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

The Art of the Deal had a new paperback edition printed last October, and the hardcover is currently in print and available from Random House and retail booksellers. Barnes and Noble, for example, sells it for $22.35.The Trump Make America Great Again Committee is a joint fundraising operation between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. An RNC spokeswoman referred a question about the books to the Trump campaign, which did not return phone calls and emails requesting comment over a period of days. Random House representatives also did not respond to Huffington Post queries.While a second joint Trump-RNC committee concentrates on large contributions, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee focuses on small-dollar donations using online and direct-mail fundraising. As of Sept. 30, 77 percent of all the money it raised came from donors who have given less than $200.According to the committee’s Oct. 15 FEC filing, it paid Penguin/Random House $91,866 on Aug. 30, $98,975 on Sept. 1, and another $98,975 on Sept. 22. The purpose for all three was listed as: “Collateral: Books.”The publishing house has printed five titles by Trump, including How to Get Rich and Think Like a Billionaire. The biggest seller, though, was The Art of the Deal, which was published in 1987 but has remained in print ever since. Trump frequently boasts about it in his campaign speeches, and it is the only one mentioned on the Trump fundraising website.At the standard bulk discount offered by publishers, Trump’s fundraising committee could have purchased some 17,000 copies of the hardcover edition. Under a typical publishing contract, that quantity would generate over $70,000 in royalties, which Trump would have to split with his co-author.According to Trump’s financial disclosure statement filed in May, Trump received between $50,000 and $100,000 in royalties for that title over the previous year.The Daily Beast previously reported that Trump spent $55,000 in money from his own campaign to buy copies of his latest book, Crippled America, which was published by Simon and Schuster. Copies were distributed to GOP delegates attending the summer convention in Cleveland.The purchase of books is just the latest example of Trump using donors’ money to purchase goods and services from his own businesses and generating personal profit for himself.Trump houses his campaign headquarters in Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, where the campaign pays $169,758 a month for office space at about $100 per square foot. (The Clinton campaign, in contrast, rents two floors in a Brooklyn Heights office building for about $32 per square foot.)Trump paid his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach $423,373 on the same day in May that his campaign finalized a deal with the RNC that began bringing him hundreds of millions of dollars of outside donations ― even though the only events he’d held there were two victory parties and an afternoon news conference two months earlier. He could have held those three events at nearby hotels for a total of about $40,000.In July, Trump’s campaign sent $48,240 to his Westchester County golf course. The only event it had hosted for him was a June 7 victory party. Trump could have used a ballroom at a nearby Marriott hotel for less than half that much.And Trump’s insistence on using his own personal Boeing 757 jet is now costing taxpayers millions of dollars extra. Because Trump’s Secret Service detail is making up a large percentage ― and on some days even a majority ― of the flying passengers, the agency must pay a proportionate share of the $10,000-an-hour flying costs.Had Trump chosen to charter a more suitable airliner that would accommodate his staff, his security detail and his traveling press corps, as both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and previous GOP nominees have done, he could have driven down the costs for everyone.Trump’s staff has defended his decisions to spend more at his own businesses rather than use less-expensive alternatives by pointing out that he is contributing $2 million a month to his own campaign.That $2 million figure, however, is dwarfed by the many tens of millions of dollars per month coming to Trump’s campaign from both large and small donors.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
46,HEALTHY LIVING,Young Football Players' Brains Change After One Season,"Andrew M.

Still, it's unclear if brain changes will lead to health problems in the future.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f7307180000be00dc4093.jpeg?cache=Qtk0UstbTr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - Children’s brains undergo noticeable changes after just one season of football, even if they were never diagnosed with a concussion, according to a new imaging study.While there is no way to know whether the changes may lead to health problems down the road, the researchers found that the degree of change seen in the brain’s white matter tracts was tied to the amount of exposure a child had to head impacts during play.“It’s really another study that suggests there are changes in the brain associated with all of these head impacts,” said lead author Dr. Christopher Whitlow, of the Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.He and his colleagues write in the journal Radiology that among U.S. contact sports, American football has a high rate of traumatic brain injury. A lot of focus has been placed on examining the role of brain injuries, such as concussions, on future health problems like the degenerative brain disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).“If we really want to understand what’s going on at the end of the line for professional players, we need to be looking at the very beginning,” Whitlow told Reuters Health. “That’s our youth and high school players.”For the new study, the researchers recruited 25 young football players between 8 and 13 years old. All participants were boys, and wore helmets during play with a device to measure hits to the head. The hits were confirmed by videos.The boys also had specialized images of their brains taken before and after the football season. The researchers then analyzed those images for changes to the brain’s white matter, which consists of bundles of nerve fibers connecting different parts of the brain.Despite the boys having no symptoms or signs of concussion, the researchers found changes to the brain’s white matter and its connection points after the season. The number of changes tracked with how many hits to the head the boys had taken during play.“More exposure, more changes,” Whitlow said. “Less exposure, less change.”The findings help confirm the results of past studies, said Dr. Jeffrey Bazarian, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.“We don’t know for sure if these changes are bad,” said Bazarian, who was not involved with the new study. “The only way to know this is if we follow these particular players over time.”While the lack of data on what these changes mean doesn’t provide parents and coaches with a lot of information, he noted that other research has found six months of rest may be able to reverse some of these changes in some people - not all, however.Young athletes may not want to take part in contact sports year round, said Bazarian. “Even though this study doesn’t specifically say that, maybe the brain needs a break.”Parents can also help by watching their children practice and play to see if they’re not acting normal after a hit to the head, said Whitlow. Additionally, it’s important to have athletic and healthcare professionals on the field in order to help players.Whitlow added that the benefits of sports like football need to be weighed against the potential risks.For example, he said sports help young people develop leadership and teamwork skills. Additionally, there are the overall benefits of physical activity.“I think we want to encourage our children to play sports,” said Whitlow.Bazarian said more research on this topic is crucial.“A study like this really needs long-term follow up,” he said.Additionally, he said, most studies on this subject include only male participants. Females need to be in the studies to see if their brains respond differently.SOURCE: bit.ly/2fa0sfk Radiology, online October 24, 2016."

The World Meteorological Organization reported Monday that carbon concentrations surpassed 400 parts per million last year for the first time.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580fbf45170000232face1f9.jpeg?cache=E3Rt3Bgyu0&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last year’s average carbon dioxide concentration crossed a major milestone and will likely stay at or above that level for several generations, the World Meteorological Organization announced Monday.In 2015, average global CO2 levels for the year surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time, the WMO revealed in its annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin. Many scientists regard that measurement, which indicates the ratio of carbon dioxide to other gases in the atmosphere, as a climate change touchstone ― though it’s not considered a tipping point. And the uptick is happening at an alarming rate.“The increase of CO2 from 2014 to 2015 was larger than that observed from 2013 to 2014 and that averaged over the past 10 years,” the report noted.CO2 concentrations last year were equal to 144 percent of pre-industrial levels. Other emissions measured in the report, methane and nitrous oxide, were equal to 256 percent and 121 percent of pre-industrial levels, respectively. Among those, however, CO2 contributes the most to warming and is responsible for about 81 percent of the increase in radiative forcing over the past decade.The increase was in part fueled by last winter’s El Niño event, which contributed to droughts that reduce the ability of forests and other carbon sinks to absorb excess CO2, but the bulk of the increase is due to unbridled human activities ranging from “growing population, intensified agricultural practices, increase in land use and deforestation, industrialization and associated energy use from fossil sources,” the report noted.“The year 2015 ushered in a new era of optimism and climate action with the Paris climate change agreement. But it will also make history as marking a new era of climate change reality with record high greenhouse gas concentrations,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said with the release of the report. “The El Niño event has disappeared. Climate change has not.”Lowering CO2 emissions, which stay in the atmosphere and oceans for thousands of years, is crucial to keeping global temperatures from crossing the 2 degrees Celsius threshold, the amount of warming that climate experts indicate as the “point of no return.” The report follows recent findings that CO2 concentrations last month remained above 400 ppm for the entire month of September, when levels are usually at their lowest following months of spring and summer plant growth absorbing emissions. “[I]t already seems safe to conclude that we won’t be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year ― or ever again for the indefinite future,” scientist Ralph Keeling, who runs the Scripps Institution of Oceanography’s carbon dioxide monitoring program, wrote in a blog post following the September findings.The WMO’s report comes at a crucial time; next month, world leaders will meet in Marrakech, Morocco, for the United Nations climate change negotiations. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the increases in carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide from pre-industrial levels. "

50,RELIGION,Tim Kaine Reaches Out To Mormons With Stories Of His Own Mission Work,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-kaine-mormon_us_580f7e6ae4b000d0b158bfd6,"With a third-party candidate rising in the ranks in Utah, Tim Kaine appeals directly to Mormons in a new op-ed.",2016-10-25,"Democratic vice presidential nominee U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) speaks during a campaign rally at Florida International University on October 24, 2016 in Miami, Florida.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f9b3c180000be00dc415a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Honing in on Mormons’ strong tradition of missionary service, Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine reached out to the religious group with his own reflections about life in the mission field.In an op-ed published in the Deseret News, a Utah-based publication owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Kaine spoke about how he took a break from law school when he was younger to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras. “They say that nobody comes back from serving a mission the same person, and that was certainly true of me,” Kaine wrote in the op-ed. “My time in Honduras became my North Star, a crucible of my values. It has influenced everything I’ve done in public life since: as a civil rights lawyer, city councilman, mayor, lieutenant governor, governor, and now, a senator.”The LDS church has been a reliably Republican religious group for decades. According to the Pew Research Center’s 2014 religious landscape study, 70 percent of Mormons lean toward or identify with the Republican party. Utah, a majority-Mormon state, hasn’t backed a Democratic candidate for president since 1964. But many Mormons have not been fans of Donald Trump.  Several influential Mormons have been part of the “Never Trump” camp for months ― including the conservative commentator Glenn Beck, and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, former Gov. Mitt Romney. The Deseret News has called for Trump to drop out of the race. But Mormons aren’t necessarily fans of the Hillary Clinton, either. A recent Deseret News poll suggests that the two opponents are tied at 26 percent in Utah. About 22 percent of Utahns said they’re voting for the independent candidate Evan McMullin, a Mormon whom observers say has a good chance of winning the state. In his op-ed, Kaine attempted to connect with Mormons who are dissatisfied with the Trump-Pence ticket. He wrote about his work as a Christian missionary ― an experience that many Mormons share.The LDS church puts a strong emphasis on missionary work and proselytization. It has 15 missionary training centers throughout the world that offer young Mormons crash courses in language and evangelization before sending them off to 418 mission fields to bring new converts into the fold. Mormon men typically spend about two years in the mission field, while women serve 18 months.While all Mormons are not required to serve a mission, many choose to volunteer. There are currently more than 74,000 Mormon missionaries serving in far-flung regions of the world.As a result, several aspects of missionary work that Kaine wrote about in his op-ed would be familiar to Mormons ― from struggling to communicate in a foreign language, to learning how to accept donations of food from other people. Kaine, a Catholic, also pointed out a historical similarity between the LDS church and his own denomination. Both Catholics and Mormons have been victims of religious persecution in America. In December 2015, soon after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, the church issued a statement declaring that while it is “neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns … [the church] is not neutral in relation to religious freedom.” Partly due to Mormons’ history as a persecuted minority in America, members of the church are often quick to denounce religious discrimination when they see it. Additionally, because many American Mormons have served in missions outside of the United States, they are wary of the negative rhetoric against immigrants that often arises in Donald Trump’s speeches. Kaine wrote about these tensions in his pitch to Utah’s Mormons: “This election season has taught us some uncomfortable lessons, not the least of which is how a person’s religious tradition can be used as a weapon by politicians seeking to capitalize on fear,” he wrote. “Hillary Clinton and I pledge to stand with you against these dangerous threats to our American values, and for the safety and the integrity of our families. Americans may worship divinity in different ways, but far more unites than divides us in our values, dreams and traditions.”David E. Campbell, political science professor at the University of Notre Dame and co-author of a book on Mormons and American politics, believes Kaine's message will resonate with Mormons, since missionary work is an important aspect of their faith and culture. Still, he's not sure if it will have the effect the candidate is hoping for. ""I would expect that this op-ed will, at most, nudge a few moderate Republican Mormons into supporting the Clinton/Kaine ticket,"" Campbell told The Huffington Post in an email. ""Its more likely effect will be among Mormon Democrats -- a small and embattled group -- who can cite Kaine's missionary experience as 'cover' for voting Democratic."""

53,POLITICS,Portland Could Be The First City To Tackle Outrageous CEO Pay,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/portland-oregon-ceo-pay_us_580f6d4ae4b02444efa5520f,Of course the progressive Oregon city would be a pioneer on this.,2016-10-25,"Occupy Wall Street protesters demonstrate in Portland, Oregon, on Nov. 13, 2011. Nearly five years later, the city government is taking on executive pay.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580f923f180000be00dc4137.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," Portland, Oregon, may soon be the first American city to take a legal stand against outsized CEO pay. In an explicit bid to reduce extreme income inequality, the city government is considering penalizing companies that pay CEOs many times more than average workers.Known for its progressive politics, Portland has already given workers paid sick leave, and the state of Oregon has raised the minimum wage. But this penalty more directly targets a major driver of income inequality that affects more people, said Portland City Commissioner Steve Novick, who called the city’s proposal a “direct assault on extreme inequality.”The draft of the proposed ordinance even cites the research of Thomas Piketty, a French economist who’s drawn attention to the issue of rising income inequality in recent years. Piketty’s bestselling 2014 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, argues that rising executive pay is a major contributor to the widening ― and destabilizing ― gulf between the rich and everyone else.“Like most other lefties, I bought [Piketty’s book], but haven’t read it all,” Novick told The Huffington Post. (The Wall Street Journal named the book the “most unread of 2014.”) Under the city’s proposal, a public company that pays its CEO more than 100 times what its typical worker makes would pay an additional 10 percent of the business tax it already owes the city.A company that would normally owe $100,000 in taxes, for example, would pay $110,000 if its CEO earns more than 100 times the average worker. If the company pays its CEO more than 250 times the average worker, the penalty rises to 20 percent.On Wednesday, all five members of Portland’s city council, including Novick, will weigh arguments on the proposal, which was inspired by a similar, failed effort in California in 2014. A vote is scheduled for December. Novick said he wasn’t sure how his colleagues were leaning. Portland estimates that the new tax would pull in between $2.5 and $3.5 million annually, money it would direct toward services for the homeless. More than 500 companies would be affected, the city estimates ― including General Electric, which pays CEO Jeff Immelt $17.4 million a year, or 202 times what the average GE worker makes; 21st Century Fox, which pays CEO Rupert Murdoch 311 times its average worker; and Walmart, which pays CEO Douglas McMillon $5.1 million, or 209 times the average Walmart worker’s pay.It will be even easier to implement the law once a Securities and Exchange Commission rule ― established by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill ― goes into effect next year. The rule requires public companies to report their CEO-to-worker pay ratio.Portland’s proposal to penalize companies for extreme pay disparities is the latest sign that the fight against income inequality is expanding. Activists, academics and lawmakers in some cities and states have focused on pressing worker needs like a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave, but some are turning their attention to executives’ ballooning incomes. They echo Piketty’s argument that rising pay for the wealthiest Americans widens and reinforces inequality. Other research suggests that outsized pay also inhibits productivity and morale in the companies that are paying record amounts to CEOs. Seventy-four percent of Americans believe CEOs are overpaid, according to one recent survey, and outrage over their fat paychecks is growing.In the last several decades, executive pay has risen dramatically compared to pay for typical workers. In 1989, CEOs made about 59 times what the average worker pulled in. In 2015, they made 276 times what a typical worker makes ― about $15 million on average, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute.This century, companies are locked in what amounts to a compensation arms race ― each paying their chiefs more and more in order to seem competitive. Meanwhile, average worker income has barely budged.Proponents of Portland’s new tax concede that one city’s policies likely won’t inspire major Fortune 500 companies to slash CEO pay or raise worker salaries, but they are hoping to spark a nationwide movement.San Francisco has already expressed interest in similar legislation, former labor secretary and University of California, Berkeley professor Robert Reich said in a Facebook post about the law. “Cities and states ― and, hopefully, eventually, the federal government ― should discourage huge pay gaps and reward socially-responsible companies that keep executive pay within reasonable bounds,” Reich wrote.Of course, companies and business organizations aren’t big fans of this trend. A new city tax “will do nothing to address income inequality,” the Portland Business Alliance wrote in a letter to the city. The group, which represents 1,850 businesses operating in the region, argues that large companies generally pay workers better than smaller companies and that punishing and shaming businesses won’t fix the problem.A similar effort in California failed to pass in 2014. While a majority of the state’s legislators voted to impose a surcharge on companies with high pay disparities, they did not secure the two-thirds supermajority required in the state to pass new taxes. There’s even a bill floating around the House of Representatives that Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.), the California legislator behind that state’s CEO bill, proposed in October.The only chance it has of passing in the House, DeSaulnier told HuffPost, is if Democrats win majorities in both the House and the Senate in two weeks ― not a likely possibility, according to most polls.Still, DeSaulnier is encouraged that Portland is attempting its own law. He said these kinds of movements often bubble up at the local level before catching fire nationwide. “If the West Coast does it and you have a critical mass,” he said, “I think they would have to take notice.”"
54,POLITICS,Portland Could Be The First City To Tackle Outrageous CEO Pay,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/portland-oregon-ceo-pay_us_580f6d4ae4b02444efa5520f,Of course the progressive Oregon city would be a pioneer on this.,2016-10-25,"Portland City Commissioner Steve Novick, an attorney and former U.S. Senate candidate, calls the city's proposed CEO tax a ""direct assault on extreme inequality.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," Portland, Oregon, may soon be the first American city to take a legal stand against outsized CEO pay. In an explicit bid to reduce extreme income inequality, the city government is considering penalizing companies that pay CEOs many times more than average workers.Known for its progressive politics, Portland has already given workers paid sick leave, and the state of Oregon has raised the minimum wage. But this penalty more directly targets a major driver of income inequality that affects more people, said Portland City Commissioner Steve Novick, who called the city’s proposal a “direct assault on extreme inequality.”The draft of the proposed ordinance even cites the research of Thomas Piketty, a French economist who’s drawn attention to the issue of rising income inequality in recent years. Piketty’s bestselling 2014 book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, argues that rising executive pay is a major contributor to the widening ― and destabilizing ― gulf between the rich and everyone else.“Like most other lefties, I bought [Piketty’s book], but haven’t read it all,” Novick told The Huffington Post. (The Wall Street Journal named the book the “most unread of 2014.”) Under the city’s proposal, a public company that pays its CEO more than 100 times what its typical worker makes would pay an additional 10 percent of the business tax it already owes the city.A company that would normally owe $100,000 in taxes, for example, would pay $110,000 if its CEO earns more than 100 times the average worker. If the company pays its CEO more than 250 times the average worker, the penalty rises to 20 percent.On Wednesday, all five members of Portland’s city council, including Novick, will weigh arguments on the proposal, which was inspired by a similar, failed effort in California in 2014. A vote is scheduled for December. Novick said he wasn’t sure how his colleagues were leaning. Portland estimates that the new tax would pull in between $2.5 and $3.5 million annually, money it would direct toward services for the homeless. More than 500 companies would be affected, the city estimates ― including General Electric, which pays CEO Jeff Immelt $17.4 million a year, or 202 times what the average GE worker makes; 21st Century Fox, which pays CEO Rupert Murdoch 311 times its average worker; and Walmart, which pays CEO Douglas McMillon $5.1 million, or 209 times the average Walmart worker’s pay.It will be even easier to implement the law once a Securities and Exchange Commission rule ― established by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill ― goes into effect next year. The rule requires public companies to report their CEO-to-worker pay ratio.Portland’s proposal to penalize companies for extreme pay disparities is the latest sign that the fight against income inequality is expanding. Activists, academics and lawmakers in some cities and states have focused on pressing worker needs like a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave, but some are turning their attention to executives’ ballooning incomes. They echo Piketty’s argument that rising pay for the wealthiest Americans widens and reinforces inequality. Other research suggests that outsized pay also inhibits productivity and morale in the companies that are paying record amounts to CEOs. Seventy-four percent of Americans believe CEOs are overpaid, according to one recent survey, and outrage over their fat paychecks is growing.In the last several decades, executive pay has risen dramatically compared to pay for typical workers. In 1989, CEOs made about 59 times what the average worker pulled in. In 2015, they made 276 times what a typical worker makes ― about $15 million on average, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute.This century, companies are locked in what amounts to a compensation arms race ― each paying their chiefs more and more in order to seem competitive. Meanwhile, average worker income has barely budged.Proponents of Portland’s new tax concede that one city’s policies likely won’t inspire major Fortune 500 companies to slash CEO pay or raise worker salaries, but they are hoping to spark a nationwide movement.San Francisco has already expressed interest in similar legislation, former labor secretary and University of California, Berkeley professor Robert Reich said in a Facebook post about the law. “Cities and states ― and, hopefully, eventually, the federal government ― should discourage huge pay gaps and reward socially-responsible companies that keep executive pay within reasonable bounds,” Reich wrote.Of course, companies and business organizations aren’t big fans of this trend. A new city tax “will do nothing to address income inequality,” the Portland Business Alliance wrote in a letter to the city. The group, which represents 1,850 businesses operating in the region, argues that large companies generally pay workers better than smaller companies and that punishing and shaming businesses won’t fix the problem.A similar effort in California failed to pass in 2014.

60,POLITICS,Republicans Threaten Lawsuits Over TV Ads Linking Them To Donald Trump,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-tv-ads-trump_us_580e34b2e4b000d0b157b24f,"Saying a candidate supports Trump is basically defamation, they argue.",2016-10-24,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Naples, Florida, on Oct. 23, 2016. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e65171b00005030ef9048.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Some Republicans are running so far away from their party’s nominee that they are threatening to sue TV stations for running ads that suggest they support Donald Trump.Just two weeks before Election Day, five Republicans ― Reps. Bob Dold (R-Ill.), Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), David Jolly (R-Fla.), John Katko (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican running for an open seat that’s currently occupied by his brother ― contend that certain commercials paid for by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee provide false or misleading information by connecting them to the GOP nominee.Trump is so terrible, these Republicans are essentially arguing, that tying them to him amounts to defamation. All five Republicans have, at some point, said they don’t support Trump. And all five have a bit of a case: The DCCC ads do use some creativity to tie them to Trump. It’s somewhat standard practice for candidates to threaten TV stations with legal action in an effort to get ads pulled. The Federal Communications Commission has said that stations have some legal responsibility ― when dealing with ads from independent groups ― to eliminate ads with “false, misleading, or deceptive” content. But legal action is rare. Mostly, candidates count on TV stations to take down such ads.The DCCC says none of the stations pulled the spots, though some ads’ runs have already ended.Either way, the ads all leave an impression that the candidate they’re targeting supports Trump, even when the candidate himself has said otherwise. Whether that’s misleading enough for legal action is someone else’s call.The commercials all use different means to make the same point: In Jolly’s case, the ad asks voters to “imagine” Trump as president with Jolly supporting him, providing some roughly manipulated pictures of the two together to help fill in the blanks. Jolly’s lawyers say the commercial is “patently false,” telling a local Florida station that just because the ad includes the words “dramatization” doesn’t mean it can display “fraudulent images.”The ad targeting Katko uses footage from May of the candidate saying he “absolutely will support” the GOP’s eventual nominee. But Katko’s lawyer says he “has never and does not currently” support Trump. He calls the ad “blatantly false.”The other cases are similar.The DCCC ties Coffman to Trump by showing him questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States. (Coffman’s lawyer takes issue with the ad’s assertion that his client supports Trump, which is sourced to a February report in which Coffman said he’d support the eventual Republican nominee. Yet there’s a lengthy record of Coffman criticizing Trump.)Coffman, who sent two letters over two different ads, also takes issue with a second ad stating that “Coffman said he’d support Trump for president.” Coffman’s lawyer says that claim is “false and defamatory,” an indication of just how damaging supporting Trump can be in Coffman’s Latino-heavy district.“Over the last two election cycles, Nancy Pelosi and her SuperPac have spent millions of dollars trying to smear Mike’s record. It didn’t work then and it won’t work now,” said Coffman campaign spokeswoman Cinamon Watson.Dold demanded the removal of an ad that claimed he was privately raising money to defeat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The DCCC was referencing an event Dold headlined called “Beat Hillary at the Distillery.” Dold says the money only went to local candidates.Fitzpatrick has also had his lawyer draft a cease and desist letter, taking issue with an ad that says the candidate “supports Donald Trump and his dangerous agenda for women.” While Fitzpatrick doesn’t refute claims that he wants to defund Planned Parenthood, his lawyer said that branding him as a Trump supporter threatens “substantial and immediate harm to the campaign and Mr. Fitzpatrick’s personal reputation.”Dold, Jolly, Katko and Fitzpatrick did not immediately respond to request for comment from The Huffington Post.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(AP Photo/Jim Cole)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Michelle Obama is an indomitable force on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton, and the Democratic nominee has Donald Trump to thank for that. At a fundraiser for Clinton in La Jolla, California, on Monday, President Barack Obama said his wife is campaigning harder than ever because Trump is the Republican nominee for president.“Some of you may be aware of the fact that Michelle does not really love politics,” Obama said to laughter at the event. “But the passion that she’s brought to campaigning this time speaks to the degree that this election is different, the choice is different.”No matter how much he disagreed with his opponents, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012, Obama said he always considered them “honorable people.” “I wasn’t concerned about the Republic if they had won,” Obama said. “And so part of the reason Michelle is working the way she is, is because she understands, as I understand, that some more fundamental values are at stake in this election. It has to do with our basic standards of decency ― how do we treat people.”Two weeks ago, Michelle Obama delivered an emotional speech about a hot-mic recording of the Republican nominee bragging about groping women. “This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and groping women,” she said. “It is cruel. It is frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts.”Trump held back for a while, but finally lashed out at the first lady late last week. “We have a president. All he wants to do is campaign. His wife ― all she wants to do is campaign,” Trump said. “And I see how much his wife likes Hillary. But wasn’t she the one that originally started the statement, ‘If you can’t take care of your home’ ― right? ― ‘You can’t take care of the White House and the country?’”The Obama campaign denied at the time that his wife’s statement about family values was about Clinton. For the first lady, Obama said on Monday, the election comes down to this: “Do we treat people who are of a different faith as part of the fabric of America, or do we label them as something foreign, not a ‘real American,’ and thereby subject to different standards when it comes to how our laws apply?”And this: “Do we think of women as equal and full citizens, capable of doing anything, or do we think of them as objects of either scorn or lust or our own satisfactions?”“Do we think that government is something serious, that we have an obligation to make sure that to the best of our abilities we leave the country a little bit better off than how we found it, or do we think that it’s an infomercial or a reality TV show,” Obama continued. In the end, he said, “Michelle’s conclusion is, is that we can’t have [Trump] in the Oval Office.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

They argued that a union would harm employee pay and benefits, as well as staff communication and rapport with management.The Fusion Union Organizing Committee responded on Monday with a letter to Lee, who is also chief news, entertainment and digital officer at Univision, Fusion’s parent company, calling for an end to the meetings and immediate recognition of the union.“We call on you to live up to Fusion’s values by putting an immediate end to anti-union messaging and respecting our decision to organize for collective bargaining,” the organizing committee writes in the letter, which was obtained by HuffPost. “This is your chance to show to your employees and our readers that Fusion isn’t just pretending to be supportive of unions.”The unionization drive’s leaders criticize the company’s arguments during the anti-union meetings. “At these meetings, staffers have been given inaccurate information by Fusion executives about how the union would potentially affect their salaries, their benefits, and their relationships with their colleagues in order to undermine the union effort, all while claiming to support us,” the organizing committee writes. “Given the circumstances, it’s impossible to see this as anything other than an attempt to undermine our efforts to unionize.”The committee asks Lee to provide a “substantive response” to the letter by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. “We are considering what ultimately will be best for the long term success of Fusion and its employees, and that, of course, involves talking to them,” Fusion spokesman David Ford said in a statement about the company’s meetings with staff regarding the union drive. “We respect and will continue to support our team unconditionally.”The Fusion Union Organizing Committee announced on Oct. 5 that a majority of staff signed cards electing the Writers Guild of America, East, as its collective bargaining representative. Management declined to immediately recognize them, announcing plans to try to persuade employees that a union would not serve their interests.If Fusion stands firm in its refusal to voluntarily recognize the union, it can demand a secret-ballot election supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. Such an election would give management more time to argue against unionization.Fusion is the latest in a series of newer digital news outlets whose workers have formed unions in the past two years, including The Huffington Post, which is also represented by the Writers Guild of America, East. (HuffPost staff is currently negotiating its first contract.)Gawker Media kicked off the wave, achieving recognition in June 2015. As the Fusion organizing committee notes in its letter, Univision recognized the union and contract of workers at Gawker’s heir, Gizmodo Media Group, when it purchased GMG in August.Resistance to unionization in the digital media industry has been uncommon, but not unheard of. The staff at Law360, which voted to unionize in late August, faced an especially aggressive anti-union campaign.The challenge for executives seeking to dissuade journalists, writers, producers and other staff trying to unionize is that the employees enjoy the support of colleagues in the industry. Fusion’s staff has raised awareness of its cause with the hashtag #FusionUnion, which, as the committee notes in its letter to Lee, many sympathetic professionals in the field have used to tweet their support for workers.Kat Santiago, a video producer for Fusion in New York and a former producer for HuffPost Live, said she was disappointed to hear Gartner and Eilemberg argue that a union would “undermine the relationship they have with us now.”“Ultimately we feel this is a good move for employees and the company, and if they’re serious about respecting our wishes like they claim, they should voluntarily recognize our union,” she said.Here is the full text of the Fusion Union Organizing Committee’s letter to Lee:Isaac Lee,"
63,POLITICS,Oversampling Is Not A Nefarious Democratic Plot,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oversampling-donald-trump_us_580e4089e4b000d0b157c2b2,It's a technique commonly used by pollsters -- including Trump's campaign manager.,2016-10-24,"Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a rally in St. Augustine, Florida, on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e75e7170000862aacde4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s campaign has highlighted some of the finer, typically ignored points of polling this year, usually by boisterously misunderstanding them.“WikiLeaks also shows how John Podesta rigged the polls by oversampling Democrats ― a voter suppression technique,” the GOP presidential nominee told voters during a Florida rally on Monday.Trump’s claim appears to be loosely based on a leaked 2008 email from a Democratic activist, which, as The Washington Post reported earlier Monday, includes an enjoinder to “oversample” certain generally Democratic-leaning subgroups including racial minorities and younger voters. Trump supporters, apparently, read this as an instruction to ensure that polls were purposely skewed to include extra Democrats.Oversampling, though, isn’t about overstating the size of one group relative to others ― it’s about making sure the results for that group are as accurate as possible.Often, pollsters are looking to get a better picture of a group that ordinarily comprises only a small fraction of survey-takers. They’ll make an effort to find extra people in that group, raising the sample size and allowing them to better measure what that slice of the population thinks. Crucially, though, oversampling doesn’t change the weight that any subgroup is given in the poll overall. As the pollsters at Pew Research explain in their extensive FAQ:For some surveys, it is important to ensure that there are enough members of a certain subgroup in the population so that more reliable estimates can be reported for that group. To do this, we oversample members of the subgroup by selecting more people from this group than would typically be done if everyone in the sample had an equal chance of being selected. Because the margin of sampling error is related to the size of the sample, increasing the sample size for a particular subgroup through the use of oversampling allows for estimates to be made with a smaller margin of error. A survey that includes an oversample weights the results so that members in the oversampled group are weighted to their actual proportion in the population; this allows for the overall survey results to represent both the national population and the oversampled subgroup.Since African-Americans make up about 13.6 percent of the population, for instance, a poll of 1,000 people would typically include only about 136 African-Americans. The margin of sampling error for African-Americans’ opinions in that case, per Pew, would be somewhere around 10.5 percentage points.So, pollsters interested in focusing on African-Americans’ views might oversample them as a group, conducting another couple of hundred interviews to bring up their sample size and lower the margin of error, offering more reliable information. The poll would still be weighted, however, so that African-Americans would account for the same 13.6 percent of the national population.Oversampling, while useful, is expensive, which would make it a particularly baffling and ineffective way of biasing the polls. “If you wanted to just bias the poll, you wouldn’t waste the extra money making all these extra calls ― you’d try to manipulate it from the beginning,” Republican pollster Jon McHenry told The Atlantic. “This is an added expense to the pollster with the idea of getting more information about a certain subgroup, and weighting that back so you understand the overall as well.”Don’t take our word for it, though ― or Pew’s or McHenry’s. We’ve also pulled up some real-world examples of when oversampling might come in handy, courtesy of Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.Here, for instance, is a 2013 poll of the New York City mayoral race from Conway’s firm, The Polling Company, Inc./WomanTrend. The survey, conducted on behalf of the city’s police commissioner, oversampled Republicans to get a better sense of his chances in the party primary. Here’s another poll conducted in part by Conway’s firm, which oversamples African-American women, Latinas, Asian/Pacific Islander women and Native American women.And here’s Conway’s firm oversampling young, black and Hispanic voters for a poll on behalf of the conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

68,WOMEN,Why Hillary Clinton Supporters Stormed The Brooklyn Bridge In Pantsuits,"Emma Gray, Kira Brekke, and Maria Tridas",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-pantsuit-day-hillary-clinton_us_580e0a3ae4b0a03911ed9c0f,Welcome to #NationalPantsuitDay. 👚👖✨,2016-10-24,New Yorkers march in honor of National Pantsuit Day on October 22.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e33991a000071285bb67e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Much has been said about the “enthusiasm gap” that exists among Hillary Clinton supporters. But watching nearly 200 women and men march across the Brooklyn Bridge waving signs with quippy taglines like “B*tch, pleats,” “Grab him by the ballot” and “Nasty women get sh*t done,” there was no enthusiasm gap in sight. Welcome to National Pantsuit Day, put together in just four weeks by four millennial Clinton supporters.A month ago ― before the first debate had even taken place ― Sami Kriegstein felt like she was the only person in her professional circle who was “out” for Clinton. “I’m really vocal and I couldn’t understand why other people weren’t more vocal about their support,” said Kriegstein, 30, who with the help of three friends, decided to create an event to celebrate Clinton and her iconic professional uniform. Kriegstein, along with co-creators Kate Dearing, Mike Jacobson and Lauren Stephenson, wanted to make National Pantsuit Day a positive, celebratory affair. The key was to rally men and women around Clinton ― not just against Donald Trump. “I wanted to focus on why you should be a Hillary supporter,” said Kriegstein. “[Clinton is] all business. She’s disciplined, she’s intelligent and she’s a woman trying to break through in a man’s profession. And I think the pantsuit really represents all of those things. The idea of National Pantsuit Day was really just to make it cool and fun to support Hillary.”And have fun they did. According to Jacobson, around 200 people showed up in New York to march from Manhattan’s Foley Square, across the Brooklyn Bridge and over to a Clinton campaign field office where Michelle Kwan ― yes, that Michelle Kwan ― came out and encouraged participants to volunteer. Events also took place in Philadelphia, Detroit, Boston, Dallas, San Francisco and Los Angeles.New York marchers wore brightly-colored pantsuits and held cut-outs of Clinton, Eleanor Roosevelt, Michelle Obama and Beyonce. They shouted “I’m with her,” as people stopped on the side of the Brooklyn Bridge to take photos and cheer. Cath Kane, 45, who came to the march with her husband and their 5-year-old daughter Zora, told The Huffington Post that it was the positive tone of the event that drew her to participate:This rally was the perfect antidote for our whole family at this point in the race. It was the opposite of the toxic negativity and factionalism we have experienced in the run-up to the election. I’ll bring my daughter into the polling booth with me to vote for Hillary on November 8th, but before that happens I wanted my daughter to see that it isn’t just me electing the first female President. I wanted her to see the happy range of faces, races and genders, the gorgeous diversity that makes up her city and ultimately her nation. She is old enough to remember all this, and so instead of the meanness and discord pervading the news, I wanted my daughter to remember some of the joy and solidarity leading up to this historic day. The evening wrapped up at Hill Country Barbecue, dubbed “Hillary Country” by the Pantsuit Day crew, where participants ate, drank and posed with a Hillary Clinton cut-out. Kriegstein and her co-organizers passed out cards to all National Pantsuit Day participants with instructions on how to donate their pantsuits ― or simply donate money ― to Dress for Success, a non-profit dedicated to economic gender equality by providing professional attire to women who might not be able to afford it themselves.The organizers of National Pantsuit Day hope their efforts get people pumped to get out to the polls come November 8. “I want to vote for [Clinton] because I’m f**king excited for her and all the work she has done,” said Dearing.Jacobson interjected, echoing Dearing’s sentiments: “I’m voting for her because she’s possibly the most qualified candidate of all time.”Scroll down for more photos and video footage from National Pantsuit Day:Select photos by Joe Kepferle.

Eight days before the beginning of a crucial enrollment season for the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance exchange marketplaces, federal officials announced Monday how much prices are going up. The gist: a lot. But like everything Obamacare, it’s not that simple. The law’s financial assistance will protect millions of lower-income families from these premium increases, and others can find relief by switching to different plans next year to save money. There will be losers, however, mostly among higher-income households that find can’t avoid the premium increases and are forced to either pay more or go without health insurance. The average premium for the second-lowest-cost “silver” level plan on the exchanges ― the ones used to calculate tax credits eligible households can use to make coverage less expensive ― is increasing by 25 percent next year in the 39 states that use the federal system on HealthCare.gov, according to a Department of Health and Human Services report. The least-costly plans, on average, will range from $366 a month for “bronze” coverage to $674 a month for “platinum,” not counting subsidies. Health insurance companies across the country are levying higher prices ― sometimes, much higher ― for 2017 than they did during the first three years of the Obamacare exchanges. The average benchmark plan price rose 2 percent from 2014 to 2015, and 7 percent from 2015 to this year. HHS didn’t provide an estimate of the overall average premium increases for all plans sold on the federal exchanges.President Barack Obama made a forceful case on Thursday that the Affordable Care Act has been a success, pointing to the 20 million previously uninsured people gaining coverage since 2014 and the uninsured rate, which has never been lower. Obama also trumpeted provisions of the law, such as the ban against health insurers rejecting customers with pre-existing conditions and the availability of preventive medical services without co-payments.The health insurance exchanges, however, haven’t attained the stability insurers demand to earn a profit on their Obamacare business, leading big players like UnitedHealth Group and Aetna, along with some smaller, regional insurers, to scale back participation in these markets because of financial losses, and others to raise rates. The result, as the new HHS report makes clear, is that consumers will have fewer choices next year at the same time premiums are climbing. The total number of insurance providers available on the federal exchanges for next year is 167, a net decrease of 68. Likewise, the average number of insurance policies available in each county has declined from 47 to 30.The average increase for the benchmark plans masks a tremendous amount of variation on what’s happening at the state level. According the the HHS report, a 27-year-old on average faces a 116 percent increase for an unsubsidized benchmark plan in Arizona, but that same person in Indiana would see a 2 percent price decrease. And the actual, unsubsidized dollar amounts vary greatly, from $760 a month in Alaska to $219 a month in New Hampshire.The main problem with the exchanges so far is that those who enrolled proved to be sicker, and thus costlier, than insurers and regulators expected, and too few healthier customers signed up to offset those expenses with their premium dollars. This forced insurance companies to raise premiums to cover those costs. In addition, temporary programs from the Affordable Care Act that were designed to compensate insurers with sicker-than-average customers expire this year, so companies also are increasing rates to make up the difference.Health care costs are rising across the nation, although more slowly than they used to. But the dynamics causing Obamacare premium increases aren’t affecting those who get coverage elsewhere, including from government programs like Medicaid and Medicare or from employers. Job-based insurance premiums have been going up at a lower-than-historical rate in recent years, and that trend is expected to continue in 2017.Open enrollment on the health insurance exchanges begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31. The Department of Health and Human Services on Monday switched on a “window-shopping” feature on HealthCare.gov that allows consumers to review unsubsidized prices. “For consumers who currently have marketplace coverage or are uninsured, our advice is the same as it’s been: Go check out HealthCare.gov for yourself,” Kathryn Martin, HHS acting assistant secretary for planning and evaluation, told reporters on a conference call Monday. “Not only are you likely to find affordable options for quality coverage, but the odds are good you’ll find plans more affordable than the public debate about the ACA might lead you to expect.”Eighty-four percent of the people who use the exchanges receive tax credits and thus will be protected, as least in part, from higher prices. That’s because the maximum premium for subsidy-eligible people is pegged to a percentage of their incomes, so the financial assistance will rise along with the premiums. The HHS report further shows that these consumers could actually spend 20 percent less per month than this year if they shop around and opt for the cheapest available plan in their current “metal” level for 2017, which would provide comparable coverage.Tax credits are available to households earning between the federal poverty level and four times that income, or about $12,000 to $47,000 for a single person, and about $24,000 to $97,000 for a family of four. At the lower end of the income range ― and 81 percent of those on the federal exchanges earn 250 percent of the poverty level or less ― the subsidies are large. That’s why, despite the large rate increases for next year, HHS estimates that 77 percent of marketplace consumers could find coverage for $100 a month or less, and 65 percent could get plans that cost $50 a month or less.Nevertheless, that still leaves millions of people who don’t qualify for tax credits on the exchanges, or who buy unsubsidized policies directly from a health insurance company or through a broker. Those households will bear the full brunt of these premium hikes. Some portion of them will decide they can’t afford the increase and will opt to be uninsured and pay the tax penalty for not having coverage, under the law’s individual mandate. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 9 million people get their insurance “off-exchange,” and HHS data show that 2.2 million people who enrolled on the exchanges this year didn’t receive subsidies.Obama administration officials are describing 2017 as a “transition” year for the exchanges, because insurers now know enough about their customers’ costs to more accurately set prices. Officials predict large increases are less likely in the future. The Department of Health and Human Services projects 13.8 million people will choose a plan during the three-month sign-up campaign for 2017, which would be 1.1 million more than the tally during the 2016 open enrollment period. Average monthly paid enrollment will be 11.4 million next year, also 1.1 million higher than the same figure this year. This represents modest growth, despite the fact that tens of millions of people remain uninsured, and even though just under half of them would qualify for subsidies. HHS also estimates that 2.5 million subsidy-eligible people currently are paying full price because they aren’t using the exchanges and instead are buying directly from insurers off the exchanges.But high sticker prices, especially for those who receive small subsidies or none at all, threaten to discourage people who need the coverage the least: those healthy individuals that insurers covet because they pay in and seldom draw down. If these exchanges can’t find the right balance between costs and revenues, insurers will be less willing to sell policies on them, and customers will be less willing to buy that coverage, which would undermine the system for everyone using it.Obama has proposed a number of amendments to the Affordable Care Act, as has Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, including increasing the financial assistance available and creating a government-run public option plan that would compete with private insurers.

I’m sorry for it. Rape in all forms is a crime. I regret writing passages that have been taken to suggest otherwise.” PREVIOUSLY: Peter Thiel thinks sexual assault can sometimes be defined as “seductions that are later regretted.”The Guardian reporter Julia Carrie Wong recently unearthed a few troubling quotes about rape culture and sexual assault from the book The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism And Political Intolerance On Campus, which Thiel, the PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member, co-wrote with fellow Stanford alum David O. Sacks. According to publisher Independent Institute, the book was published in 1998. The book focuses on the impact multiculturalism has on academic institutions and discusses subject areas including gender, race and political correctness. Some of the book’s most inflammatory quotes are included in a section that discusses a 1991 Stanford rape case involving a 17-year-old female student and a star athlete (it’s eerily similar to the Brock Turner case). The section features multiple arguments that not only discredit victims of sexual assault, but also sympathize with perpetrators.“[Thiel] attempted to discredit the idea of date rape ― he wrote that the definition of rape had been erroneously expanded to include ‘seductions that are later regretted,’” Wong wrote. “He also suggested that the movement to combat it on college campuses was motivated by animosity toward men.”Thiel’s stance on this shouldn’t be all that surprising given his misogynistic track record. In a recently unearthed 2009 essay Thiel suggested that women getting the right to vote is bad for democracy. The Silicon Valley billionaire also donated $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign (after the barrage of sexual assault and harassment allegations came out against the GOP candidate). Thiel, an openly gay man, has received criticism for his endorsement of a “platform that is actually dangerous to LGBT people.” Although Thiel and Sacks admit that the alleged perpetrator in 1991 was “clearly guilty” of serving alcohol to a 17-year-old woman, they continue to perpetuate the idea that the woman “regretted” the entire incident, forcing her to call it rape. Stanford’s sexual assault policy at the time read: “Sexual assault by force or coercion, including deliberate coercion through use of drugs or alcohol, is absolutely unacceptable at Stanford University,” according to Wong. Wong wrote that Thiel and Sacks found this policy to ― somehow ― be problematic. According to Wong, Thiel and Sacks’ response to the sexual assault policy was: “Ludicrous!” It is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks.The two geniuses later wrote that rape charges are “nothing more than belated regret,” all while using the term rape in quotes (because it might just not be real when a woman cries rape!).Read below to make your blood boil (emphasis ours): ... But since a multicultural rape charge may indicate nothing more than belated regret, a woman might “realize” that she had been “raped” the next day or even many days later. Under these circumstances, it is unclear who should be held responsible. If the alcohol made both of them do it, then why should the woman’s consent be obviated any more than the man’s? Why is all blame placed on the man?Just when you thought it couldn’t get worse, Thiel and Sacks also suggest that the real victims of the “rape crisis movement” (whatever that may be) are, of course, men: “The purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising ‘awareness.’” Head over to The Guardian to read more disturbing excerpts from Thiel and Sacks book. All we have to say:The Huffington Post has reached out to Thiel for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

He was ultimately acquitted of all charges.A New York Times book review of his 1988 memoir, “Reunion,” one of more than 20 books published under his name, called Hayden “the single greatest figure of the 1960s student movement.”Outliving contemporaries Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton, Hayden remained active in left-wing politics well into the 21st century, posting on Twitter just a week ago.Winning election himself to the California state Assembly in 1982, and then the state Senate a decade later, Hayden went on to serve a total of 18 years.Later he became director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center, a nonprofit left-wing think tank devoted mainly to analysis of continued U.S. military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, drug policy and global poverty.Hayden was married to actress Jane Fonda from 1973 to 1990, with whom he had two children. Midway through their marriage, the couple graced the cover of People Magazine.In later years his writings were published in national publications including The New York Times, the Boston Globe and the Denver Post. He served on the editorial board and was a columnist for The Nation magazine, and was the author of more than 20 books.Tributes poured in on social media:"

He said that “politicians manipulating the public with fear” ― like so many have in an effort to defeat Trump ― “is never a good thing.”But only a few short moments later, he couldn’t help himself from getting in on the attack, too, when he said that anyone who votes for Trump on Nov. 8 will be committing an act of legal terrorism. “I want them [Trump supporters] to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8th,” Moore said.Asked to elaborate on the claim, Moore said that Trump has made it quite clear that he hopes to cause destruction to the current political system, and that anyone who votes for him should know they are enabling a dangerous man.“Legally, you have a right to vote on November 8th,” Moore said. “You can go in there and even though you’re not necessarily in favor of Trump and you don’t like him that much and you know he’s a little crazy, you also know he’s going to blow up the system. The system that took your job and house away from you. You get to get back at the system now and blow it up and this is the only day you can do it legally. He’s told everybody that’s what he’s going to do. He’s the outsider who is going to ride into town and blow up the old way. So you, as a voter, get to participate in the detonation. He’s going to get a lot of votes from people who actually just want to sit back and watch the thing blow up.”Earlier this month, Moore released a surprise documentary called “TrumpLand,” a deceptively titled film that more so focuses on the filmmaker’s love of Clinton. But when it comes to Trump, he not only fears him; he fears for him, too. “He’s not a well person and he needs help,” Moore said. “If you’re a human being with a soul and a conscience, you want him to get help.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
78,POLITICS,"Private Prison Company Backs Super PACs For Donald Trump, Senate Republicans",Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-private-prison_us_580e7b02e4b000d0b1583000,GEO Group is one of the few publicly traded companies to make major super PAC donations.,2016-10-24,"Donald Trump benefited from the private prison company GEO Group's $150,000 in super PAC contributions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e7c5d1700009c2aacde65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The GEO Group, one of the two largest private prison companies in the country, emerged in 2016 as one of the very few publicly traded companies making significant contributions to super PACs.Through contributions from its corporate entities and its political action committee, the Florida-based company contributed $673,200 through the end of September, putting its weight behind Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Republican control of the Senate. Its largest contributions have been $200,000 to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund and $150,000 to Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump super PAC run by consultant Alex Castellanos.The contributions come as activist groups put pressure on federal and state governments to end funding for private prisons. Activists are also pushing a broader campaign of divestment that targets private prison companies.In August, the Obama administration announced that the Department of Justice would phase out the use of private prisons for federal detention after the DOJ Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing report on private prison operations and oversight. The decision sent private prison stocks, including those of the GEO Group, tumbling. Those stocks took another dive after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her opposition to private prisons during the first presidential debate.“I’m glad that we’re ending private prisons in the federal system,” Clinton said. “I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn’t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.”It is perhaps no surprise then that GEO Group would place its money behind Trump. In his first political campaign, the real estate mogul has both promoted private prisons and supported immigration policies that would require a massive increase in spending on detention facilities.In June, Trump told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews that he would like to “do a lot of privatizations and private prisons” because “[i]t seems to work a lot better.”Statements like these make it unlikely that a Trump administration would look favorably on the Justice Department’s move away from private prisons. An analyst for the financial research firm Compass Point told Bloomberg that if Trump were to win the White House, “our sense is that a reversal of this policy would be likely.”In an email, GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez denied that the company’s support for Trump is based on his favorable view of the private prison industry. Paez wrote that the company was only involved in the political process to promote “the use of public-private partnerships, including in the delivery of offender rehabilitation programs, both in-custody and post-release.”“As a matter of long-standing policy, our company does not take a position on or advocate for or against any specific criminal justice, sentencing, or immigration policy,” Paez wrote. “We have always believed that we are most effective and at our best when those we care for re-enter society as productive and employable citizens.”Contributing to candidates and supporting them through super PACs amounts to investing in their messages, countered Scott Roberts, senior campaign director for criminal justice at the progressive activist group Color Of Change.“They’re directly supporting the type of divisive law and order politics that Donald Trump is promoting,” Roberts said. “It is key to cut off the revenue to these private prison companies, because they are using that to influence the political process in a way that is beneficial to their bottom line, but is detrimental to the country as whole.”GEO Group may deny that Trump’s or any other candidate’s position on private prisons influences the group’s political involvement, but it is clear which candidate would negatively impact the company’s bottom line and which candidate would expand funding.This goes beyond the question of whether the federal government should contract to private prison companies. It extends to the candidate’s immigration policies.While many of Trump’s policies have shifted throughout the campaign, his position on immigration has remained relatively stable. He has promised to crack down on immigration by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as spend more for enforcement and border patrols and round up and deport anywhere between 2 million and 11 million undocumented immigrants.These policies would require significant federal investments in companies like GEO Group, which operate federal immigration detention centers through Immigration and Customs Enforcement. GEO Group already receives large contracts from the federal government to operate multiple immigrant detention facilities. A study by the liberal think tank Center for American Progress found that the cost of detaining 5 million immigrants prior to deporting them would cost $28.1 billion. That is up from the current $2.25 billion the government spent on immigrant detention in 2014. A similar study by the conservative American Action Forum found it would cost $35.7 billion to detain all 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country. Such large-scale detention would likely be contracted out to private prison operators like GEO Group. Trump was not the GEO Group’s first choice in the Republican primaries. The company donated $100,000 to a super PAC supporting Rubio and gave another $88,290 to the super PAC backing Florida’s former Republican governor, Jeb Bush.GEO Group is also spending tens of millions to help maintain Republican control of the Senate. It has also donated $50,000 to a super PAC supporting Rubio’s Senate campaign and $75,000 to a super PAC supporting the failed congressional campaign of Republican Rebecca Negron in Florida’s 18th congressional district.Progressive activist groups like Color Of Change have fought to make private prison operation a presidential campaign issue. In the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he supported a policy to end private prisons and introduced a bill in Congress to do just that. Clinton, meanwhile, was criticized for receiving campaign contributions from lobbyists who represented private prison companies. Color Of Change was among the advocacy groups that pressured her to return the contributions and stop raising money from individuals connected to the private prison industry. The Democratic presidential nominee eventually announced that her campaign would no longer raise money from federally registered lobbyists representing private prison companies or from the PACs connected to them. Clinton’s campaign donated past contributions to a charity that helps female inmates reintegrate into society after their release. Soon after that, she announced that she supported ending federal and state funding for private prisons.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Its largest contributions have been $200,000 to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund and $150,000 to Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump super PAC run by consultant Alex Castellanos.The contributions come as activist groups put pressure on federal and state governments to end funding for private prisons. Activists are also pushing a broader campaign of divestment that targets private prison companies.In August, the Obama administration announced that the Department of Justice would phase out the use of private prisons for federal detention after the DOJ Office of the Inspector General issued a scathing report on private prison operations and oversight. The decision sent private prison stocks, including those of the GEO Group, tumbling. Those stocks took another dive after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reiterated her opposition to private prisons during the first presidential debate.“I’m glad that we’re ending private prisons in the federal system,” Clinton said. “I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn’t have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.”It is perhaps no surprise then that GEO Group would place its money behind Trump. In his first political campaign, the real estate mogul has both promoted private prisons and supported immigration policies that would require a massive increase in spending on detention facilities.In June, Trump told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews that he would like to “do a lot of privatizations and private prisons” because “[i]t seems to work a lot better.”Statements like these make it unlikely that a Trump administration would look favorably on the Justice Department’s move away from private prisons. An analyst for the financial research firm Compass Point told Bloomberg that if Trump were to win the White House, “our sense is that a reversal of this policy would be likely.”In an email, GEO Group spokesman Pablo Paez denied that the company’s support for Trump is based on his favorable view of the private prison industry. Paez wrote that the company was only involved in the political process to promote “the use of public-private partnerships, including in the delivery of offender rehabilitation programs, both in-custody and post-release.”“As a matter of long-standing policy, our company does not take a position on or advocate for or against any specific criminal justice, sentencing, or immigration policy,” Paez wrote. “We have always believed that we are most effective and at our best when those we care for re-enter society as productive and employable citizens.”Contributing to candidates and supporting them through super PACs amounts to investing in their messages, countered Scott Roberts, senior campaign director for criminal justice at the progressive activist group Color Of Change.“They’re directly supporting the type of divisive law and order politics that Donald Trump is promoting,” Roberts said. “It is key to cut off the revenue to these private prison companies, because they are using that to influence the political process in a way that is beneficial to their bottom line, but is detrimental to the country as whole.”GEO Group may deny that Trump’s or any other candidate’s position on private prisons influences the group’s political involvement, but it is clear which candidate would negatively impact the company’s bottom line and which candidate would expand funding.This goes beyond the question of whether the federal government should contract to private prison companies. It extends to the candidate’s immigration policies.While many of Trump’s policies have shifted throughout the campaign, his position on immigration has remained relatively stable. He has promised to crack down on immigration by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as spend more for enforcement and border patrols and round up and deport anywhere between 2 million and 11 million undocumented immigrants.These policies would require significant federal investments in companies like GEO Group, which operate federal immigration detention centers through Immigration and Customs Enforcement. GEO Group already receives large contracts from the federal government to operate multiple immigrant detention facilities. A study by the liberal think tank Center for American Progress found that the cost of detaining 5 million immigrants prior to deporting them would cost $28.1 billion. That is up from the current $2.25 billion the government spent on immigrant detention in 2014. A similar study by the conservative American Action Forum found it would cost $35.7 billion to detain all 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country. Such large-scale detention would likely be contracted out to private prison operators like GEO Group. Trump was not the GEO Group’s first choice in the Republican primaries. The company donated $100,000 to a super PAC supporting Rubio and gave another $88,290 to the super PAC backing Florida’s former Republican governor, Jeb Bush.GEO Group is also spending tens of millions to help maintain Republican control of the Senate. It has also donated $50,000 to a super PAC supporting Rubio’s Senate campaign and $75,000 to a super PAC supporting the failed congressional campaign of Republican Rebecca Negron in Florida’s 18th congressional district.Progressive activist groups like Color Of Change have fought to make private prison operation a presidential campaign issue. In the Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he supported a policy to end private prisons and introduced a bill in Congress to do just that. Clinton, meanwhile, was criticized for receiving campaign contributions from lobbyists who represented private prison companies. Color Of Change was among the advocacy groups that pressured her to return the contributions and stop raising money from individuals connected to the private prison industry. The Democratic presidential nominee eventually announced that her campaign would no longer raise money from federally registered lobbyists representing private prison companies or from the PACs connected to them. Clinton’s campaign donated past contributions to a charity that helps female inmates reintegrate into society after their release. Soon after that, she announced that she supported ending federal and state funding for private prisons.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

More than 90 percent of its population lives below the poverty line, and nearly half of the country’s children are chronically malnourished or stunted.But three consecutive years of severe drought, widespread crop failure and water shortages have driven Madagascar to the brink of utter “catastrophe,” United Nations agencies said last week. More than half of the population in southern Madagascar, or around 850,000 people, are now experiencing “alarming” levels of hunger, according to the agencies. At least 20 percent of households in the region are on the verge of famine.“These are people living on the very brink,” Chris Nikoi, regional director of the U.N.’s World Food Programme, said Thursday in a statement. “Many have nothing but wild fruits to eat. We must act together now to save lives.”The stories out of southern Madagascar are bleak: Children are being pulled out of school to look for food and water; 1 in 3 families has turned to “desperate measures” like begging and selling land to survive; and 4 in 10 households have eaten their vital seed stocks in desperation, leaving nothing for the upcoming planting season. “I met women who told me they had nothing to feed their babies except the fruit of the red cactus growing by the roadside,” Ertharin Cousin, WFP’s executive director, said last week after visiting some of the country’s worst-hit areas.Red cactus fruit is said to cause severe constipation, but the Inter Press Service reports that thousands of Malagasy children have been living off the wild fruit.“I have never experienced this kind of hunger,” Rasoanandeasana Emillienne, a local farmer with four children, told the news outlet in June. “We are taking one day at a time because who knows what will happen if the rains do not return.”This is the third year in a row that Madagascar has struggled with failed crops and water scarcity. The next harvest is not expected until March, reports Al-Jazeera. Last week, the WFP, together with the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and UNICEF, said it needs more than $140 million to support efforts to bring food and assistance to starving Malagasy communities. This includes the treatment of malnutrition in over 200,000 pregnant women, nursing mothers and children under the age of 5.“The situation is extremely worrying,” Cousin said. “The hunger and malnutrition we’re seeing is the result of three years of ruined harvests. We must receive the necessary funding to respond before it’s too late.”Climate change, exacerbated by an especially powerful El Nino, has been blamed for aggravating dry conditions and reducing crop production not just in Madagascar, but across the southern African region. An estimated 14 million people in countries including Malawai, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and South Africa are currently facing hunger due to drought.“It’s becoming common knowledge now that we will experience droughts [in Africa] much more,” Beatrice Mwangi, a director at humanitarian organization World Vision, told The Guardian earlier this year. “In the past it was one big drought every 10 years, then it came to one drought every five years, and now the trends are showing that it will be one every three to five years. So we are in a crisis alright, that is true.” "

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) would like to remind you that lots of people move to Florida.,2016-10-24,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) says we shouldn't worry about climate change because ""mankind has actually flourished in warmer temperatures.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580e56771b0000442cef8ff7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on Monday said he doesn’t think people should worry about finding solutions to climate change ― because historically, “civilization thrives” in warmer temperatures.“Climate has already changed, always will. I’m just not an alarmist. We will adapt,” Johnson told Wisconsin radio station WHBY. “How many people are moving up toward the Antarctica, or the Arctic? Most people move down to Texas or Florida, where it’s a little bit warmer.”Climate change has been described as one of the most urgent issues facing mankind, and scientists say immediate policy action is necessary to mitigate its effects. But you wouldn’t know it from the tone of Johnson’s remarks on Monday.“Obviously, man affects the environment, and we should do everything we can to maintain a clean environment, but you need an affluent society. You need a strong economy,” the senator said. “Let’s not shoot ourselves in the foot with policies.”Johnson made a similarly dubious argument in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Friday, when asked about his claim that sunspots cause climate change.“I’ve never denied climate change. It has always changed, always will,” he said. “The sun has the primary effect on weather and climate on planet Earth, so I’m just not a climate change alarmist.”“Mankind has actually flourished in warmer temperatures,” he continued. “I just think the question always is what is the cost versus the benefit of anything we do to try and clean up our environment ... I’m highly concerned about the climate alarmists that are going to spend a lot of money and have no impact whatsoever on the climate but have a great deal of harm on our economy.” Johnson also claimed that “the jury’s out” on climate change, even though virtually the entire scientific community is in agreement about the cause, the nature and the seriousness of the problem. In fact, many groups of scientists have said their models actually underestimate the magnitude and impact of climate change.“The jury’s out,” Johnson said. “The models have not been predictive. They were predicting much higher temperatures, and that hasn’t panned out yet.”When pressed, he admitted that he is a climate change skeptic, but added that “it’s not the right question.”Johnson has a record of making shaky claims about climate change. This summer, he incorrectly said that “the climate hasn’t warmed in quite a few years,” even though 2014 and 2015 were the hottest years on record and 2016 is on track to surpass both of them.He also claimed that liberals and progressives who want to address climate change ― including former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Johnson’s opponent in this year’s Senate race ― are like Josef Stalin and Hugo Chavez in that they “want to control everything.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

But whether reporters are able to follow her or him throughout the day, as is done for the sitting president, remains unclear. Neither campaign has yet agreed to a protective pool to track the president-elect’s movements, a departure from recent election cycles. “It is not normal and it is unacceptable,” Jeff Mason, a Reuters correspondent and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, told The Huffington Post.The White House Correspondents’ Association oversees the rotating group of reporters who travel everywhere with the president and file dispatches to the larger press corps on what he’s doing, whom he’s meeting with and when he returns home. (Here are some examples). This arrangement, known as a protective pool, is considered necessary to ensure journalists are present in the event of any newsworthy comment or moment, including a threat on the president’s life. Both the Clinton and Trump campaigns have traveling press pools, but neither is fully protective. The Democratic and Republican standard-bearers in recent election cycles ― including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney ― had protective pools in place by the time they wrapped up the summer conventions.In letters sent Tuesday to the Clinton and Trump campaigns, the WHCA’s leadership expressed “profound concern and consternation” at both for so far failing to establish a protective pool system and urged each “to remedy the situation without delay for the remainder of the 2016 campaign.”“The WHCA expects the new president-elect to have a protective pool immediately, just like the president does, and we are set to take over coordination of the pooling process from the campaign press corps directly after the election,” members of the WHCA board wrote. “Not having a protective pool accompany the president-elect would be a particularly serious breach of historical precedent and First Amendment responsibilities. It would prompt consistent and public criticism from the White House press corps, represented by the WHCA board. We urge you to take steps now to ensure that a protective pool is put in place.”The Trump campaign did not respond yet to the WHCA’s letter, while the Clinton campaign acknowledged receiving it, according to Mason.The Clinton campaign has provided its traveling press corps with more access and logistical information than its rival’s team, though at times, the lack of a fully protective pool has been problematic. For instance, reporters weren’t apprised of Clinton’s whereabouts for 90 minutes after she became unsteady after a Sept. 11 event this year.“That failure of transparency about Secretary Clinton’s whereabouts and condition created an unnecessary panic about her health situation that dominated the news cycle for days,” the WHCA’s board wrote in its letter to the Clinton campaign. “Having a protective pool would have remedied the kind of chaos and speculation that resulted from those events, which did not serve the public’s interest.”Clinton national press secretary Brian Fallon emphasized in a statement that the campaign had improved press access and was open to conversations going forward.“Since the convention, we have taken a number of steps to improve our traveling press corps’ ability to cover Hillary Clinton, but of course it is the job of news organizations to always press for greater access,” Fallon said. “We respect that, and intend to have continued conversations with them about the issues they have raised.”Trump, whose actions during the 2016 election have been seen as an unprecedented threat to press freedom, does not fly to events with his traveling press corps, as had been customary of presidential nominees, and even mocked reporters when they were late to an event last month. His campaign didn’t notify the traveling press corps before the candidate flew to the second presidential debate. And while Clinton has taken questions a dozen times from traveling reporters in recent months, Trump has not held a news conference since July. In a letter to the Trump campaign, the WHCA’s board wrote that its “concerns about transparency, access, and the timely flow of information from the presidential candidates are not limited to” the Republican nominee. However, the board noted that “the Trump campaign is lagging behind the level of press access provided by its Democratic counterpart.”A Trump spokesman did not respond for comment. The WHCA’s primary concern is coverage of the president, and it played only a limited role during press disputes involving the candidates. But while Trump and Clinton reporters have negotiated access with the campaigns during the election cycle, the WHCA traditionally picks up the role when it’s clear who’ll be the next president. The WHCA has hoped to establish a transition print pool from Nov. 9 through Jan. 19, the day before Inauguration Day.Read the WHCA’s letters to the campaigns below:This article has been updated with a comment from Clinton’s camp."

Thanks to the work of Alastair Bruce, characters on the show properly stood, sat, ate, drank and wore evening gloves, according to rules that had been finessed for centuries.That’s not because manners are currently obsolete; most people aside from that one guy who sits by you at your office learned the basics of posture and how to avoid repulsive eating or drinking noises. At its simplest level, that’s all etiquette is ― how to be a social person without bumming out everyone else. In the 21st century, though, the rules have changed. And, for those interested, there are still people who will tell you “the right way” to stand, sit, eat and choose an outfit for dinner. For a price.In January, The Plaza Hotel in New York ― now two decades free from the ownership of Donald Trump ― is slated to open its very own etiquette school so that “those looking for a prestigious international education in etiquette no longer have to fly to Europe.” Guests can reserve spots in two types of classes led by manners maven Myka Meier: single evening courses for $75 and immersive weekend packages starting at $2,750. They’re pricey, but useful.At a recent Plaza brunch, Meier demonstrated for a group of reporters how to properly wrangle a cloth napkin. The “right” way, she said, is to place the napkin on your lap just after you sit. The napkin should be unfolded, to the left, refolded in half and placed on your lap. Any and all wiping should be done on the inner sides, from the edge near the crease, so that the folded napkin remains clean on both sides. When you’re finished eating, you can pinch the napkin from the center and lay it a conical shape to the left of your plate. (The “wrong” way, we assume, is how we used to wrangle cloth napkins ― by smearing croissant flakes from our fingers on any side, eventually working the cloth into a greasy ball.)If you ask Meier, the “right” ways to do things haven’t changed so much as they’ve been updated. Men don’t have to hold doors for women, because, it turned out, women have functioning arms. (Also: Feminism.) Opening a door for someone nowadays is merely a sign of respect.After lessons in Western manners from finishing schools in England and Switzerland, Meier will bring her expertise to the Plaza. It’s a fitting place, we learned, because staff are already told to behave as “actors,” performing their jobs as if they were part of a show (called “Downton Abbey”).The Plaza Finishing Program with Beaumont Etiquette covers tips for business, dating, dining and wedding etiquette. With certain unnamed guest speakers, Meier will cover how to enter and exit cars, converse, eat spaghetti, choose a diamond, pose for photos, use “sophisticated verbiage” and speak with service people ― then, presumably, how to properly apply Purell. (We kid.)Sit up straight, cross your ankles ― both heels on the floor ― and head here to check it out."

The only problem? Ocean’s albums weren’t submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline for Grammy consideration. According to Billboard, Ocean’s decision to keep his album out of the running may have been intentional. Maybe the R&B singer wanted to send his own message about the state of award shows these days? Anyhow, Ye still thinks Ocean can get a nomination because of that one time Lady Gaga performed even though she wasn’t up for the Best New Artist Award. (Huh?) “She wasn’t nominated for best new artist, right?” he said. “But they wanted her to perform at the show, they wanted her to open.

The Longview News-Journal reported that Parish switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party in 2013. Earlier this month, Terry Jennings became the only Democratic justice on the Texas First Court of Appeals after he too quit the GOP. The turning point for Jennings was in January, when he officiated a same-sex wedding and realized that he just didn’t belong in the GOP any longer.“As the father of two daughters, and the son of a woman born before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, I am equally excited that we are about to elect our first woman president,” Jennings said in his announcement. “Too many Republicans are not. I appreciate and embrace that we are a nation of immigrants, of individuals of many different faiths and ethnicities — all one people under our Constitution — all of whom are guaranteed equal protection under the law. Too many Republicans do not.”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Darrell Issa's (R) campaign.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5803edcd170000c316acc498.jpeg?ops=crop_0_6_2592_1831%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama called Rep. Darrell Issa “shameless” on Sunday night, hitting the endangered Republican for referencing an alliance with him in a campaign mailer. The mailer, which was first reported by The Huffington Post, shows a picture of Obama signing a bill that Issa co-sponsored. On top of the photo is a quote from Issa, saying he was “very pleased” the president signed legislation that established a bill of rights for survivors of sexual assault. It’s a dramatic turnaround for the congressman, who rose to national fame as the administration’s antagonist. During a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee event held next door to Issa’s California district Sunday night, Obama tore into the incumbent for wasting taxpayer money on “trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere” and obstructing the administration at every turn. “And this is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me,” Obama said to laughter, according to remarks provided by the White House.“Now, that is the definition of chutzpah,” he continued. “Here’s a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history ― despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration.”Issa’s adversarial stance with the administration, and contribution to furthering birtherism, are why Trump became the Republican nominee, Obama said. “I think somebody called Darrell Issa ― was this you, Doug, who said Darrell Issa was Trump before Trump?” Obama said, referring to Issa’s challenger retired Marine Col. Doug Applegate. “And now he’s sending out brochures touting his cooperation with me. Now, that is shameless.”In fact, in the HuffPost story last week that touched on the mailer, Applegate’s campaign spokesman, Robert Dempsey, had compared Issa to Trump. “Issa was Trump before Donald Trump,” Dempsey told HuffPost last month in Oceanside.Issa hit back on the president Monday, faulting Obama for the death of Americans abroad and at home. “I’ve worked with the administration on good legislation where it was possible, and called out wrongdoing wherever I saw it, and will continue to do so,” Issa said in a statement.Applegate’s long-shot bid against Issa caught the Democratic Party’s attention when he came within 5.3 percentage points of Issa in California’s free-for-all primary. The race rating was changed to “toss-up” by the Cook Political Report ― a nonpartisan newsletter tracking elections ― earlier this month, a sign that Issa’s re-election is in doubt. If Democrats do manage to take back the House or make a significant dent in Republicans’ majority, it will happen because of races like Issa’s.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

When he woke up, he could only speak in Spanish.“Our life has changed through this process,” his mother, Dorah Nsemoh, told the station.Reuben, whose English has since returned, said he knew a little Spanish because his friends and a brother speak the language.

Once he’s fully healed, he looks forward to returning to his favorite sport ― though his coach insists he’ll have to wear a helmet.“Why not start using it in practice and in the games?” Reuben’s coach, Bruno Kalonji, told WSB-TV, advocating use of the safety gear. “Everybody is waiting for that big [injury] before they start wearing the mask.
