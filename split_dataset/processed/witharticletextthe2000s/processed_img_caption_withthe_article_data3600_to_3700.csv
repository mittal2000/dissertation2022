There was no immediate word on his condition.The man appeared to have lain in wait for the soldiers in a pedestrian zone near their base in Levallois-Perret on the northwestern edge of the capital where France’s domestic counter-terrorism agency is based.He accelerated his BMW car into the troops, who were starting their patrol, when they were a few meters away, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said, before speeding off and sparking a huge manhunt.“This was a deliberate act, not an accident,” Collomb told reporters outside the hospital where the three more seriously injured victims were being treated.He said a terrorism investigation had been launched.The soldiers were part of Operation Sentinel, launched in the wake of Islamist attacks in Paris in early 2015. The Levallois-Perret attack was the 15th on troops and police in the last two-and-a-half years, many of them Islamic State-inspired.Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told lawmakers in parliament that the assailant had been detained. One policeman was injured by a stray bullet in the operation.The daily newspaper Le Parisien named the suspect as 37-year-old Hamou B., originally from Satrouville west of Paris and said that searches had been carried out at his home and those of his associates. The Paris prosecutor’s office declined to comment.“I saw the traffic stop ahead of me,” said one truck driver who identified himself as Teddy, speaking on the motorway after the suspect was seized.“The police got out their cars, took cover and started firing. The gunshots were coming from everywhere.”The BMW car, the same one that was used in the attack, was riddled with bullet holes and surrounded by balaclava-clad police officers, a Reuters cameraman said.“PRE-MEDITATED”Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly said Wednesday’s attack was proof there remained an active threat and that the 7,000-strong Sentinel force “was more necessary than ever”.Three soldiers had light injuries, Parly said, while three others were more gravely hurt but not as seriously as previously thought.Patrick Balkany, mayor of Levallois-Perret, called it a “disgusting” act of aggression that was “without any doubt” premeditated.Nadia Lephrohon, resident of an apartment building directly above the scene, said she heard a dull thud and then soldiers shouting.“I saw two soldiers on the ground and the other soldiers were shouting. There was another man out there, a bystander, who was saying ‘It’s a car. It went that way. Follow it! Run after it!’”, Lephrohon said.Islamist militants or Islamist-inspired attackers have killed more than 230 people on French soil since January 2015, including one attack on Paris and another on the Riviera city of Nice.Operation Sentinel has put heavily armed combat troops in public view as they patrol key sites in military fatigues, at an annual cost running into hundreds of millions of euros.While it did not prevent the November 2015 attack when gunmen killed 130 people in Parisian cafes and a concert hall, Sentinel troops have disarmed or killed would-be attackers on several occasions since – including a February incident where a machete-wielding assailant attacked soldiers outside the Louvre art museum, and another on Saturday at the Eiffel tower.This year, assailants attacked soldiers at the Louvre museum site in Paris in February and at Orly airport in March. An assailant shot a policeman dead on the Champs Elysees avenue in the capital in April.Levallois-Perret is about 5 km (3 miles) from city center landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Elysee Presidential Palace.(Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta, Caroline Paillez, Brian Love and Johnny Cotton in Paris, Fabian Bellouit in Marquise; Writing by Brian Love and Richard Lough; editing by Richard Balmforth)"
1,POLITICS,How To Thaw The Climate Conflict,"William S. Becker, ContributorEnergy & Climate Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-thaw-the-climate-conflict_us_598b1845e4b08a4c247f270c,This week’s circulation of an authoritative government report on global climate change is putting some heat on America’s,2017-08-09,<p>The glaciers in Glacier Bay National Park are moving faster than Congress and the White House in reacting to global climate change.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b1de02200001a001a5248.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week’s circulation of an authoritative government report on global climate change is putting some heat on America’s denier-in-chief, according to the New York Times. The draft report, written by scientists inside and outside the U.S. government, “will force President Trump to choose between accepting the conclusions of his administration’s scientists and the demands of his conservative supporters,” the Times says.That’s true. Trump now must decide to publish the report as written or to allow his non-scientists to alter its contents to conform with his belief that global warming isn’t real. As it stands now, the report’s conclusion that “evidence for a changing climate abounds” leaves little room for equivocation.What frustrates the overwhelming number of scientists who keep warning us about climate change and the local leaders whose communities are being assaulted by extreme weather events is that the debate over climate science should have been settled, and in fact was settled, years ago. The Administration’s objective and the strategy of climate deniers in Congress has been to keep the debate alive to legitimize doubt and justify inaction. Equally frustrating is that Washington’s stalemate on this issue could be resolved easily if the combatants really wanted to find common ground. As so many of us have said for so long, the deniers and skeptics could at least acknowledge the chance that our climate scientists have it right. From that perspective, the latest report can be accepted as an assessment of risk if not reality. The responsible reaction would be to minimize and manage that risk.Furthermore, as so many of us have said for so long, the things we can do to manage climate risks are socially, economically and environmentally beneficial to the nation, even if it turns out that scientists have over-estimated the threat of global warming and misdiagnosed its causes.Climate deniers deny that fact, too, arguing that confronting climate change would kill American jobs and cripple our economy. But what kills jobs and cripples competitiveness are elected leaders who want to keep the economy stuck in 20th century technologies and fuels rather than grabbing the opportunities in front of us today. The data show clearly that our most dynamic jobs engine now is the renewable energy industry. The world’s most competitive economies will be those that capitalize on rather than resist the world’s transition to clean energy. In fact, the work involved in mitigating and adapting to climate change can and should be one of our most vibrant new industries. In short, this tedious conflict between climate denial and climate activism should not continue. Record-setting weather disasters consistent with climate science are happening all around us. The risks of denial are evident, considerable and real. Keeping the federal government from acknowledging that is not healthy skepticism. It’s a dangerous and despicable political strategy. Correction: My original post said the new report from federal climate scientists had been “leaked”. The New York Times, where the news story of the report first appeared, has since acknowledged that the document was not leaked; its authors had previously made it available to the public for review.

The circumstances of his death remain unclear.North Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from traveling to the isolated country, beginning in September.Lim’s Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labor camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.On Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury”."

Barney Frank (D-Mass.) says a number of parties are responsible for ""don't ask, don't tell.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59555f371800003800672299.jpeg?cache=doshiEYIMm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In late February 1994, President Bill Clinton instituted a policy for the armed forces that allowed gay members to serve provided they weren’t openly gay. “Don’t ask, don’t tell” was billed as a compromise between Clinton’s campaign pledge to allow openly gay members to serve and insistence from military brass that doing so would imperil morale. But, if anything, it was a defeat for the newly elected president. “Don’t ask, don’t tell” effectively placed gay and lesbian service members into a lesser class. And for the subsequent decade and a half, as the law remained stubbornly in place, Clinton’s legacy took a hit for it.In the latest episode of the “Candidate Confessional” podcast, one of the chief legislators responsible for overturning “don’t ask, don’t tell” says this criticism of Clinton is “unfair.”Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) says the compromise Clinton ordered was largely the result of circumstances outside his control. As Frank recalls, Clinton hadn’t intended to make gays in the military the first (major) issue he confronted after winning election. But a ruling that came before he took office ― in which a federal judge said the existing prohibition on openly gay service members was unconstitutional and ordered the reinstatement of a gay service member ― forced his administration to take a position (by either appealing the decision or not). Frank himself didn’t help matters when he let slip to The Washington Post’s David Broder during the transition between the George H.W. Bush and Clinton administrations that the latter intended to ax the ban.But the real precipitating event came from Congress. With Clinton contemplating issuing an executive order that would have allowed for openly gay service members, congressional Republicans threatened to put an amendment into the Family and Medical Leave Act, a bill Clinton desperately wanted to sign into law, that would have made the prohibition on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender military service a statutory provision. Enough Senate Democrats said they’d support the measure that a Clinton veto would have been overridden. He was left with a choice.“Either you accept writing into permanent law the ban or you disappoint this big promise,” Frank recalls. “So they agree to [vote] without the amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act in return for Clinton holding off on an executive order. So the Family and Medical Leave Act becomes law.”Frank had other criticism with how the issue was handled at the time. He said the LGBT advocacy community dramatically misplayed its hand, mainly in assuming that lawmakers could be flipped by the end of the debate rather than demanding they take positions immediately.“The problem was … our opponents lobbied congress and my guys had rallies,” he says. “The offices were getting flooded with antis. The pro gay groups were having rallies.”But history has been far harsher toward Clinton than toward the advocacy community or the congressional Republicans who forced his hand ― a reading of the debate that Frank says is fundamentally misguided.“People have unfairly said, ‘Well, why did you make that the first issue of the presidency?’” he says. “And the answer is, we didn’t. We didn’t want it to be. But we had no choice.”Listen to the full episode above.“Candidate Confessional” is produced by Zach Young. To listen to this podcast later, download it on Apple Podcasts.

To Nuclear Provocation, Again","Susan Thistlethwaite, ContributorI am a Professor of Theology and President Emerita of Chicago ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-christian-faith-says-no-to-nuclear-provocation_us_598b3735e4b0f25bdfb3212b,"As a Christian pastor and teacher, I strongly oppose nuclear weapons and the threats to use nuclear weapons. I also denounce",2017-08-09,<p><em>Members of Desert Lenten Experience hold a prayer vigil during the Easter period of 1982 at the entrance to the Nevada Test Site</em></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b38f615000028008b5d20.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a Christian pastor and teacher, I strongly oppose nuclear weapons and the threats to use nuclear weapons. I also denounce the types of conservative Christian theologies that, since the dawn of the nuclear age, have not only predicted an imminent nuclear holocaust but have actually desired and promoted it.This type of conservative Christian nuclear theology is manifestly insulting to God, as it promotes contempt for what God has created. It has been rejected over and over by countless believers, religious leaders, and whole religious organizations. They have proclaimed a resounding “NO!” to nuclearism in all its forms, both religious and secular.In Genesis 1: 31 it is written that God looked on the creation and called it “very good.”Conservative Christianity ignores this sacred text, and ignores the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth in order to lust after nuclear conflagration. The script for this theology goes like this: this world is sinful and fallen and must be destroyed in order to bring about the apocalypse and the return of Christ.From screeds like Hal Lindsey’s The Late Great Planet Earth to the recent statement by Robert Jeffress, the Texas Evangelical who just issued a statement that says, in part, “In the case of North Korea, God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong Un,” this kind of conservative Christian evangelicalism has fed an actual longing for catastrophic violence on earth.This craving for violence is evident in Jeffress’ statement. Should the U.S. actually “take out” the leader of a nuclear armed nation, this can provoke nuclear war, draw in China and perhaps other nations, and potentially bring about a nuclear winter that will end life on earth.This type of “end times” theology is also actively opposed to the core teachings of Jesus of Nazareth and his love for this world and the people in it. Jeffress actually admits, “A Christian writer asked me, ‘Don’t you want the president to embody the Sermon on the Mount?’ … I said, absolutely not.”And I say, and countless Christian leaders have said over and over,Absolutely YES.Faith opposition to nuclear weapons has been crucial in preventing nuclear war since these weapons were used for the only time at the end of World War II.There has been tremendous theological and ethical clarity about the insult of the nuclear threat to God’s will and God’s creation. Today it is clear we need to once again not only promote this ethical lucidity but use every one of the nonviolent tools we have to reject nuclear threat and we need to employ all of our religious resources to support this sacred work.We need to articulate over and over what Cardinal Joseph Bernardin expressed in his 1983 Commencement Address at Notre Dame University:Because the nuclear issue is not simply political but also a profoundly moral and religious question, the Church must be a participant in the process of protecting the world and its people from the specter of nuclear destruction.There is no more commonly held religious conviction, across the world’s faith traditions, than care of the creation and the rejection of nuclear weapons as a threat to all life. We make this abundantly clear in “Interfaith Just Peacemaking: Jewish, Christian, and Muslim Perspectives on the New Paradigm of Peace and War.”For me as a Christian pastor and teacher, Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount and its teachings are central to the Christian faith. Jesus taught, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.” (Matt. 5:9) For those of other faiths, there are also core teachings that call for the protection of God’s creation and the imperative to pursue the work of peacemaking.We must take a stand, again, against nuclear weapons. Where we need to concentrate our faith voices today, indeed, right this minute, is on preventing a nuclear first-strike that will draw the world into nuclear war.I call on all people of faith and all people of humanist values to join with me in contacting the members of the United States Congress and demanding that they pass legislation to take away Donald Trump’s ability to launch a nuclear first strike.Half a million people have already signed a petition  supporting a bill reintroduced in May of this year by Senator Ed Markey and Representative Ted Lieu that would require a declaration of war by Congress before the president could launch an unprovoked nuclear attack. The president would still retain the power to launch a nuclear attack if a foreign nation attacked first.This is a moral and political imperative, and it has become a moral and political emergency in recent days.Take action now. Call, fax and write your members of Congress and call on them to pass this crucial legislation.For God’s sake, for your children and grandchildren’s sake and for the sake of the whole planet, we must not delay."

Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene, police said.The driver of the van, who has not been identified by police, said she didn’t realize Myles, who would have turned 4 later this month, was still in the vehicle after picking him and other children up for delivery to another daycare location. The woman was described as “extremely distraught,” Mina said.Authorities are still awaiting the results of an autopsy but believe that his death is heat-related. If confirmed, Myles’ death in a hot car would be the fifth for a Florida child this year and the 32nd nationwide, Mina said.Temperatures in Orlando reached a high of 94 degrees on Monday, The Associated Press reported, though the temperature inside the vehicle could have easily been much higher.Little Miracles Academy did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday.Little Miracles Academy has been previously found not following rules designed to protect children, according to records from the Florida Department of Children and Families reviewed by local media.The day care last month was found having not complied with a rule that requires day care centers to record when children arrive, where they are being transported to, and what time they left. At least two staff members are also required to perform a sweep of vehicles used to transport kids, according to a records review by WFTV.Those instances were two of five violations found during DCF inspections since 2015, according to a review by The Orlando Sentinel.DCF secretary Mike Carroll in a statement on Tuesday expressed plans to shut down Little Miracles’ two locations.“DCF is pursuing every legal option available to cease operations by tomorrow at both of these facilities,” he said."
9,WOMEN,Follow The Leader: Colorado Is A Pioneer In Bipartisan Pro-Choice Policies,"Karen Middleton, ContributorExecutive Director, NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/follow-the-leader-colorado-is-a-pioneer-in-bipartisan_us_598b706be4b08a4c247f27fa,"Our message is simple: leave the decision to the women, their families, their faith and their doctors.",2017-08-09,<p>Colorado leads the way in access to affordable contraception.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b71061400002800ecffe7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Colorado has been a leader in protecting and expanding access to women’s health care. In April 1967, Colorado passed the nation’s first state law allowing safe, legal abortion. It was a bipartisan bill, passed in a majority-Republican legislature. In recent years, the state has emerged as a model for dramatically reducing unintended teen pregnancies by expanding access to long acting reversible contraception and supporting policies to expand access to reproductive health care information and resources.Access to reproductive health care is good economic policy. As Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, “The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.” In Colorado, our forward-thinking policies reflect who we are ― pro-choice. We recognize that the freedom to make your own personal, private medical decisions is a right that belongs to the individual, not the government. That freedom from government intrusion into personal decisions transcends a number of issues.The Casey opinion also reaffirmed the rights found in Roe decision, stating “Roe determined that a woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy is a ‘liberty’ protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”Seven in 10 Americans back Roe v. Wade, and that number holds all across the states, from the reddest part of Kansas to the bluest part of New York, including the districts some appear to be worrying about. Standing firm on the ability to make a personal decision about women’s access to abortion care without interference from politicians is even stronger.If you want to focus on winning elections, take a lesson from Colorado. In a state split evenly between Republicans, Democrats, and Unaffiliated voters, we have tested this theory across three elections ― including two mid-terms ― with attempts to overturn abortion rights via “personhood” ballot measures. Every time, anti-choice efforts have failed by landslide margins statewide ― including the county adjacent to Colorado Springs ― in 2014. The General Assembly has repeatedly rejected attempts to restrict abortion and reproductive rights, and in 2017 we passed measures *increasing* access to contraception, which received national accolades.At a time when we are seeking pro-choice Republicans to step forward as candidates, it is troubling to see national Democrats signaling a willingness to compromise on the issue of anti-choice Democratic candidates. Among voters, we can identify clear majorities that support choice on both sides of the aisle.Our message is simple: leave the decision to the women, their families, their faith and their doctors. Do not attempt to restrict access to abortion care. This is not a litmus test. It is a civil rights issue.The voters don’t want it. Voters can differentiate between the right of an individual to make a decision on abortion, and the government making it for her. It’s not a matter of belief. It’s a matter of laws and public policy.Bluntly, Republicans recognize being anti-choice is a losing proposition. Sen. Cory Gardner ceded the issue in 2014 when he pretended to be pro-choice and denied the existence of a federal personhood bill he co-sponsored. Gardner has since cast multiple anti-choice votes in Congress. But he knew if he campaigned on being anti-choice, he would lose.This is where the argument that there are “some districts” where you cannot be pro-choice falls apart. There is no data to support that. When will we stop treating an issue with 70 percent support as controversial?Access to abortion care is a critical part of women’s health care, and the attacks on access to care across the states is already putting women’s lives and health in jeopardy. The rise of anti-abortion forces coupled with the fear of our allies to engage is precisely what led us to this place. In the same way progressive messages and values have been demonized, abortion has been vilified alongside health care, social services, and human rights. In the same way we need to continue to push forward and stand for what’s right on values-based issues, we cannot yield on abortion access.As Lindy West put it in the New York Times, “Democratic candidates are perfectly welcome to refrain from terminating their own pregnancies. But to be anti-choice on a policy level is absolutely indefensible from an economic justice, racial justice, gender justice and human rights standpoint. And if the Democratic Party does not stand for any of those things, then what on earth is it?”In 50 years, NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado has seen a lot of battles over abortion rights.

Prior to the tweet’s posting, Trump phoned McConnell to complain about the senator’s remarks, The New York Times reported. Trump also reportedly vowed to continue calling for a repeal of Obamacare and urged McConnell to do so as well.Trump had certainly projected optimism about the prospects of repeal well before there was any real chance of it. In February, he claimed repeal was on track to succeed by the middle of March. It went on to fail in the House in March, before passing in a revised form in May.The president rarely lets criticism go unanswered. Trump’s social media director Dan Scavino lambasted McConnell on Twitter earlier on Wednesday for offering “more excuses.”Trump has issued stinging indictments of trusted allies in the past, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his first supporter in the Senate. But this is his first public spat with McConnell, the steely tactician responsible for shepherding the remainder of Trump’s legislative agenda through the notoriously tricky Senate.In a nod to McConnell on Tuesday, Trump endorsed McConnell’s preferred candidate in the Republican Alabama Senate primary: Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.), who has been occupying the seat vacated by Sessions earlier this year.It is unclear how a chill in relations between Trump and McConnell might affect the GOP agenda. Trump is pushing a bill introduced by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) that would dramatically reduce legal immigration. He also has ambitious plans to overhaul the tax code and pass a budget with deep spending cuts.McConnell indeed presided over the narrow defeat of the so-called “skinny” Obamacare repeal bill at the end of July. McConnell appeared to be as blindsided and disappointed in the result ― made possible by Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and John McCain (Ariz.) breaking with their fellow Republicans ― as Trump was. The bill’s collapse signaled the end of efforts to repeal Obamacare for the foreseeable future."
11,POLITICS,Democrats Hold Iowa State House District That Went Heavily For Donald Trump,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrat-phil-miller-wins-iowa-special-election_us_598b28d3e4b0449ed5073acb,It's a positive sign for Democrats.,2017-08-09,"Democrat Phil Miller, a 65-year-old veterinarian, won a special election to represent Iowa's 82nd House District.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598b29db140000401aecfe8d.jpeg?cache=v69SNIrqr9&ops=crop_3_65_913_801%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In a special election on Tuesday, the Democratic Party maintained control of an Iowa House district that President Donald Trump won by a large margin in November.Democrat Phil Miller, a 65-year-old veterinarian and president of the Fairfield school board, defeated Republican Travis Harris by about 9 percentage points in House District 82, which covers a southeastern stretch of the state.Miller’s win to replace five-term Democrat Curt Hanson, whose death in June sparked the special election, would not ordinarily be notable.But the district picked Trump over Hillary Clinton by some 21 percentage points in November, prompting Democrats to hail Tuesday’s win as a major victory. Miller also bested then-President Barack Obama’s winning 2012 re-election margin in the district by about 7 percentage points.“DLCC is putting Republicans on notice ― tonight’s victory in a district Trump won by 21 points just last fall is a testament to Democrats’ strength in deep red districts,” Jessica Post, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement Tuesday night.Miller’s win “shows that rural Iowans are rejecting an agenda that prioritizes the wealthiest at the expense of hardworking families,” Tom Perez, Democratic National Committee chairman, said in a statement Wednesday morning. The DLCC contributed $50,000 to Miller and sent their regional political director to help get out the vote and advise on strategy.The DNC hosted get-out-the-vote phone-banking for Miller from its Washington, D.C., headquarters. In July, the central party body also increased its monthly contribution to state Democratic parties to $10,000 ― a one-third increase over its 2016 investment level.Miller ran on a platform of making health care more affordable, increasing education funding and boosting worker pay. He emphasized his deep roots in the community as a veterinarian who helps many local farmers keep their livestock healthy.Andrea Phillips, first vice chair of the Iowa Democratic Party, suggested to HuffPost that the Republican-controlled legislature’s passage of “horrible” bills had produced a backlash. Iowa, which remains under unified Republican control, gutted public sector collective bargaining rights and defunded Planned Parenthood earlier this year, Phillips noted.“It’s looking more and more like what happened in 2016 was people who were feeling left behind and disaffected by the system wanted to shake things up a little bit,” Phillips said of Trump’s strong performance in the district. “But now they’re able to see what the policy effects of that are and both at the national level and the state level they’re not happy with that.”Miller may have also benefited from an unforced error by Harris. The GOP candidate ran an ad attacking Miller for a school board vote allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. But Fairfield is still reeling from the June suicide of a transgender teenager, so it is possible the ad hurt Harris more than it helped.In a series of special elections since November, Democrats have had more success at the state level than in congressional races. In addition to maintaining control of the seat in Iowa on Tuesday, Democrats have flipped four Republican-held state legislative seats that went heavily for Trump. The upset outcomes include victories in the New York and New Hampshire legislatures in May, and a pair of wins in the Oklahoma legislature in July.Not all of the results were favorable for Democrats on Tuesday. The party failed to flip two GOP-held Missouri legislative districts in special elections, one in the House and one in the Senate. Democrat Michela Skelton was nonetheless able to win 48 percent of the vote in her failed bid for Missouri’s 50th House District. Democrats did not contest the seat in 2016, but Trump defeated Clinton there by 21 percentage points."

Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.) was speaking to a large crowd of constituents in Chico, California, on Monday when audience members began to boo and heckle him over his support of House Republicans’ health care bill. According to the Congressional Budget Office, around 23 million people would lose coverage under the American Health Care Act.“I think that your vote to throw 22 million people off of health care is reprehensible and in the service of the rich, I think it’s venal,” one audience member said. “My sincerest wish... I hope you suffer the same painful fate as those millions that you have voted to remove health care from. May you die in pain.”According to the Los Angeles Times, the constituent was a holding sign that read, “Lackey for the Rich!” The exchange was one of several heated confrontations during the meeting, one of several that LaMalfa has held this year. Republicans lawmakers have largely avoided town-hall style events following outrage over their health care plans.Another participant at Monday’s event said that her teenaged son died in 2016 of an opioid addiction. She explained that losing health care would be devastating for those suffering from drug addiction.“The health care bill that you voted for, the AHCA, would discontinue health insurance from millions of people,” she said. “I want you to know that these are life and death decisions that you are making. I don’t have a son anymore.”LaMalfa defended his efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, telling KRCR that he wants “to help middle income Californians, middle income Americans be able to afford health insurance.”But as one audience member put it, “you keep going on about middle-income families but almost a quarter of the population in your district is living below the poverty line, so what does that do for them?”Watch more of the contentious event below, courtesy of North State Public Radio."

The firm is the Maryland-based arm of Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceuticals Co., the Chinese drugmaker run by former Shenzhen mayor and billionaire Ye Chenghai, who with his family controls a 66-percent stake in the $5 billion company. The NIH proposal comes amid growing public backlash against deals that give drugmakers exclusive rights to treatments developed by federally funded researchers without requiring them to sell the drugs to Americans at a reasonable price.Last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced legislation that would require federal agencies and federally funded nonprofits, such as research universities, to secure a reasonable pricing agreement from a manufacturer before awarding it exclusive rights to drugs, vaccines or other health care products. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) introduced a companion bill in the House.Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) included a clause in the military spending bill last month directing the Department of Defense to break pricing monopolies when the cost of a taxpayer-funded drug is higher than the median price charged in the seven countries that have at least half the per-capita income of the United States. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) followed up with a similar amendment in the Department of Health and Human Services spending bill making its way through the House of Representatives.Cuban, a loud critic of President Donald Trump, is the first business leader and television celebrity to weigh in on the issue.“You have to do it as a condition of the funding for the research or any tax credits,” Cuban said of preventing price gouging on government-developed drugs. “Once a company has the rights to the drug it’s too late.”Licensing of taxpayer-funded drugs first entered the national spotlight earlier this year, when Sanders vocally opposed the Defense Department’s plan to give drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur exclusive rights to a Zika vaccine developed by the U.S. Army. The French pharmaceutical giant demanded a monopoly on the vaccine ― used to inoculate against the mosquito-borne and sexually transmitted Zika virus, which causes devastating birth defects ― despite an Army request for a reasonable pricing agreement. The company has a history of charging up to eight times more for its drugs in the U.S. than in France or the United Kingdom.Monopoly licenses are granted to incentivize manufacturers to make important drugs available, despite the high costs of researching and developing the treatment. The U.S. government agreed to up to $173 million to cover second- and third-phase trials on the vaccine.Less is known about the Salubris deal, but critics panned the agreement as brazen at a time when lawmakers and watchdog groups are increasing scrutiny of such monopolies.

Such was the case on Tuesday night, when the comedic legend wound his way to a performance of the “Groundhog Day” musical, a production based on the 1993 film directed by the late Harold Ramis ― starring Murray himself.According to a delightful account of the evening provided by New York Times culture reporter Sopan Deb, the latest Murray charmfest began with the actor cracking jokes at passersby, tipping a bartender $50 and indulging in selfies with his many, many adoring fans. It ended, however, with the actor “visibly sobbing” after watching the Tony-nominated musical alongside his brother Brian Doyle-Murray and “Groundhog Day” screenplay co-writer Danny Rubin.“By the time the cast was bowing on stage, Mr. Murray was in tears,” Deb wrote. “He waited a minute to compose himself before joining the rest of the audience to cheer the cast.”Murray claimed it was the moral of the beloved story that moved him to tears. “The idea that we just have to try again,” he explained to Deb. “We just have to try again. It’s such a beautiful, powerful idea.”Beyond crying, Murray also fist-pumped at the sight of the show’s jaded weatherman protagonist, Phil Connors, whom the Times described back in ’93 as “a perfect character for Mr. Murray.” He also let out an exclamatory “Wow!” after Rebecca Faulkenberry’s performance of “Playing Nancy.”All in all, it was a wild night at the theater for Murray and the patrons lucky enough to sit near him."

The remaining 24 percent aren’t sure.Thirty-five percent of the public wants to see the level of legal immigration decrease, while 46 percent say it should increase or remain at its present level. There’s a closer divide on Trump’s overall attitude toward immigration. Forty percent say his approach is too harsh, while 37 percent call it about right, with 5 percent calling the president too soft on the issue.Both a 58 percent majority of voters who supported Trump in last year’s election and an even broader 81 percent majority of those who backed his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, believe legal immigration is largely a good thing for the U.S. But there’s a significant political divide on the preferred level of immigration, with 62 percent of Trump voters and just 14 percent of Clinton voters supporting a decrease.Views also vary to some extent by age: Americans older than 65 are twice as likely as those younger than 30 to support a decrease in legal immigration levels, even though they’re slightly more likely than the younger group to embrace legal immigration as a benefit to the nation.In a press briefing last Wednesday, White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller dismissed the relevance to the immigration debate of the poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty. “The New Colossus,” written by Emma Lazarus, reads in part: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”“I don’t want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of liberty and lighting in the world; it’s a symbol of American liberty lighting the world,” Miller said in response to a question from CNN’s Jim Acosta. “The poem that you’re referring to was added later. It’s not actually part of the Statue of Liberty.” Fifty-six percent of Americans say that Lazarus’ quote still should apply to immigration policy, with just 22 percent saying it should not apply.

The process, to the frustration of many Australians, has been mired in bureaucracy and political infighting, and multiple hurdles remain before same-sex marriage can become law.On Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull laid out his proposal for how Australia might change the definition of marriage under the Australian Marriage Act to include same-sex unions. Turnbull’s plan aims to appease both marriage-equality advocates and the more conservative elements of his Liberal Party in order to maintain his government’s tenuous grasp on power.Turnbull is seeking to hold a non-legally binding voluntary public postal vote (at the estimated cost of $122 million) before an official parliamentary vote in November. A different plan ― to hold a non-legally binding but compulsory national vote before the parliamentary vote in November ― was killed off by a hostile senate on Wednesday. Part of the reason that the path to marriage equality is so convoluted has to do with both Australia’s current political landscape and the role of past prime ministers in shaping the debate.

In some ways, the subject has become as much about leadership as about addressing inequality. Rather than allowing the much-called for free vote in Parliament, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott ― who once trained as a priest and who, while in office, opposed same-sex marriage ― said politicians should hold a plebiscite to let “the Australian people have a say” on the future of same-sex marriage. The vote was not expected to be compulsory and its result would be non-binding. Abbott’s successor, Turnbull, has expressed his support for marriage equality. But he is walking a political tightrope. Turnbull’s Liberal-National coalition has a slim, one-seat majority, and there’s a real fear that it could lose control of Parliament.

Turnbull has described it as an issue of trust.“We’ve made a very clear commitment here and we are sticking with it,” Turnbull told reporters in Canberra this week. According to the plan, the postal vote would start as early as Sept. 12 and run through Nov. 7. A “yes” vote to legalize same-sex marriage would lead the government to put forth a bill for Parliament that would formally change the country’s current definition of marriage. The MPs and Senate would be free to vote on the bill according to their beliefs, rather than being tied the official party positions.But in embracing a non-binding plebiscite, just as Abbot did before him, Turnbull knows that any result could be ignored by Parliament.  Criticism of Turnbull’s plan from all sides of the debate has been fierce, and the outlook is far from certain. Opponents of same-sex marriage are expected to try to delay the postal vote, while marriage equality advocates have threatened a legal challenge, possibly affecting the timetable. The government has also yet to provide crucial details on the issue. Those opposing plebiscites view them as non-binding, non-representative and wasteful during a time of budget restraint.

Campaigning was marked by fiery rhetoric but public speeches were largely free of the ethnic hatred that has marred previous contests as the two men faced off for a second time.Odinga said he rejected results from the country’s election commission, raising fears his supporters could mount street protests.“They (the results) are fictitious, they are fake,” he told a news conference, saying the election board was required by law to display forms signed by party observers from each polling center certifying the results and had not done so.The electoral commission urged voters to wait calmly for results.“During this critical phase, we urge all Kenyans to exercise restraint as we await official results from the polling stations and indeed as they start trickling in,” it said.Odinga comes from the Luo people in western Kenya, an area that has long felt neglected by the government and resentful of their perceived exclusion from political power.Kenyatta is a Kikuyu, an ethnic group that has supplied three of Kenya’s four presidents since independence from Britain in 1963.Any glitches - innocent or otherwise - in the high-tech electronic voting and tallying system could be grounds for the loser to allege fraud, as Odinga did in 2007 and in 2013. Given his age, this is probably his last crack at the top job.As he voted, Kenyatta said he would be willing to step down if he lost and called on Odinga to do the same."

20,TASTE,"Cooking Off The Cuff: Smoky, Minty Eggplant – With Dates! – For A Spiced Duck Dinner","Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-smoky-minty-eggplant-with_us_5989d8dfe4b0f25bdfb31fba,"When the chef Alain Senderens died a while ago, Jackie and I were put in mind of our dinner at his long-gone Paris restaurant",2017-08-08,<p>Smoky eggplant scented with mint and sweetened with nuggets of dates</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5989d9861400002800ecfb94.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the chef Alain Senderens died a while ago, Jackie and I were put in mind of our dinner at his long-gone Paris restaurant l’Archestrate. That would probably have been 35 years ago – the place closed in 1985 and is now the site of Alain Passard’s Arpège – but one dish on the menu stuck in my mind: Canard Apicius, a spectacular duck dish whose method of preparation and honey-spice glaze were intended to evoke the cookery of ancient Rome (sort of). I made a stripped-down version of it a few days ago, but today’s dish is a simple seasonal one I hit upon to accompany the duck: An aromatic and subtly flavored mush of eggplant (aubergine) reminiscent of Russian- or French-style eggplant caviar, but with softer flavors – including dates of all things – and a purer eggplant character. It almost goes without saying that it has many applications: It is grand with other poultry, and you can eat it on its own (warm or cold) with grilled bread, as a snack, a first course or part of a light lunch or dinner.First you need to cook your eggplants, which can be done a couple of hours in advance if logistics dictate it. I cooked them in two stages. On a grid over the open flame of my gas range, I cooked plump medium-sized purple eggplants (an average of 10 ounces – 280 grams – apiece; figure one per person, or fewer if this is to be a side dish or dip/spread), turning several times, until the skin was blistered, somewhat charred and smelling pleasantly smoky. This took about six minutes over medium heat. I then cut them in half lengthwise, laid them cut side down on a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet generously drizzled with olive oil and put them into a 375º F (190º C) oven until very tender, about 15 or 20 minutes; start checking after 10 minutes. If you have an outdoor grill, all of this can take place there: grill over medium-high heat until charred, then, without halving, move to a cooler part of the grill and continue to cook until very, very tender.While the eggplants were cooking, I softened the flavor of one medium-large clove of garlic per eggplant: I peeled them, cooked them in boiling water for half a minute, tossed the water and repeated this twice more. I then simmered them in salted water until they were very tender, which took a good ten minutes. This mild garlic provides a background flavor, not the front-and-center garlickiness that it would impose if left raw or sautéed. I pureed the garlic in a food processor with not too much olive oil; if you’re making a very small batch using one or two cloves of garlic, mash them with a fork.When the eggplants were cool enough to handle, I scooped out all the soft flesh and added it to the food processor (along with the garlic if you’ve mashed it by hand). As I did this, I allowed – encouraged – flakes of the charred skin to fall into the pulp, because they add a very appealing smokiness even when the eggplants have been cooked indoors. This is a key element of the dish, so do not be hyper-careful when you scrape the flesh off the skin.I added good wine vinegar, a scant half teaspoon per eggplant, and a little olive oil – say 2 teaspoons per eggplant or even less – and pulsed the food processor four or five times, until the eggplant had broken down into a mash – not a purée – in which ropy but tender fibers remained visible and palpable. (If, because of your particular eggplants, the mixture seems watery, boil off some of the water in a non-stick skillet, stirring constantly.) I transferred this to a bowl (in which the whole affair could have been made by hand) and stirred in a lot of chopped fresh mint leaves and some salt. When I tasted it, I found it needed a little more mint. If you can, resist the temptation to add more olive oil: when cooked this way, the eggplant flesh is moist and seemingly mucilaginous, so the unctuousness afforded by lots of oil is already there.Finally – in the main innovation here – I stirred in corn-kernel-sized pieces of dates, figuring one medium-sized date per eggplant. I blanched and peeled mine before removing the pits and dicing them, which sounds fussy but which saves you from having to scrape sticky, paper-thin date skin from your teeth after eating.That’s it. Eat tepid or at room temperature and marvel at the prominence of the eggplant and mint flavors and the little nuggets of sweetness from the dates.(Why mint? And why dates? Because the fancy-restaurant accompaniment to canard Apicius included dates stuffed with a purée of dates and mint and warmed up in butter. That’s why.)"

She is a Master’s candidate in Global Policy Studies at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas.Note: this article originally appeared in the East-West Center’s Asia Matters for America/America Matters for Asia initiative on August 8, 2017. In July, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and his wife Yumi welcomed South Korean President Moon Jae-In at a presidential luncheon hosted by the South Korean Embassy with a greeting in fluent Korean. They were the only American couple invited to the event.Governor Hogan and his wife Yumi — the first Korean American first lady of any US state — have encouraged Marylanders to build strong ties with Korean communities in the state. In 2016, Governor Hogan declared January 13 as Korean-American day, commemorating the day that the first Korean Immigrants arrived in the United States in 1903. Also, he proclaimed April 5 as Taekwondo day in Maryland — a day for the Korean traditional martial art — and hosted the first Maryland Governor’s Cup Taekwondo Championship in March 2017.Korean communities have significantly contributed to Maryland’s economic development and cultural diversity. A Korean shopping center, Lotte Plaza Market, has revitalized the area along Route 40 in Ellicott City, which struggled with a depressed local economy about 10 years ago. In December 2016, state officials designated a five-mile stretch on Route 40 as Korean Way, recognizing Korean contributions to the local economy. This year, Eleanor Roosevelt High in Greenbelt became the state’s first public school providing Korean courses, after a years-long effort by the school’s principal, the South Korean Embassy, and Bob Huh — the Korean teacher at the school.Last year, Maryland exported $233.4 million in goods to South Korea, with the state’s top 3 trade items being chemicals, minerals, and computer and electronic products. In 2015, Maryland signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Gyeonggi Province in South Korea to increase business and innovation. In 2016, the state announced the signing of a Letter of Intent between two Korean energy firms — The Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) and LS Industrial System (LSIS) — and Montgomery College to build an eco-friendly micro grid on the school’s Germantown campus.Every Lunar New Year, many Asian-Americans in Maryland wear their own traditional clothes and gather at the Government House in Annapolis for an Annual Asian Lunar New Year Celebrationhosted by Governor Hogan and the First Lady. The passion and dedicated efforts by the first couple of Maryland lead the state’s stronger relationship not only with South Korea, but also with other Asian countries, enriching the state’s culture and economy."

In those days, everything was about rebellion, right down to what the rebels wore. Turtleneck sweaters were a protest against neckties. Tie-die shirts signaled nonconformity. Bra burning was one small step for womankind. Bell-bottom pants were probably a social statement, too, but nobody seems to know what it was.More importantly, children of the baby boom rebelled against materialism by moving from suburbs back to the land or joining the Peace Corps. They rebelled against racism, sexism and the Vietnam War. It was not only the Age of Aquarius; it was also the Age of Activism.Environmental stewardship was on the agenda, too, but with greater collaboration from some of our presidents and congresses. In 1965, the President’s Science Advisory Committee suggested that environmental quality was every citizen’s right. In 1969, Congress passed the National Environmental Policy Act “to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony.”One draft of the Act included this more detailed statement:The Congress recognizes that each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthy environment and that each person has a responsibility to contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.That language did not make it into the Act, not because members of the House and Senate disagreed with it, but because they worried that the statement was too vague and would result in an avalanche of litigation.Unfortunately, some of the most important struggles of the ’60s and ’70s are still underway, notably the fights for civil rights, equal rights and proactive environmental stewardship. An estimated 40,000 people marched in New York City in 2014 to call for federal climate action. Dedicated climate activists including celebrities have engaged in civil disobedience and gone to jail.Things seemed to be going well pretty until last January when Donald Trump assumed the presidency. As though driven by a strange compulsion to destroy everything Barack Obama accomplished, Trump immediately began laying waste to Obama’s climate action plan, federal climate science and the Environmental Protection Agency. In response, tens of thousands turned out across the country last April to oppose what Trump was doing. Hundreds of climate activists, scientists and trade union members protested outside the White House after Trump announced his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.These demonstrations have caused more than a few flashbacks among those who were gassed, beaten and jailed in the 1960s. Today’s protests have affirmed that the spirit of justified rebellion is still alive in America. However, the climate rebellion needs to reach the intensity we experienced back when hardly a day went by without demonstrations in the streets and on campus nationwide. There is a critical difference between occasional rebellion and relentless rebellion.Voters have to be enlisted, too. The carbon cartel would not have so much influence over Congress and the White House if more Americans voted the convictions they express to pollsters. Virtually every survey finds that although Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support environmental protection, a decisive majority of all voters wants a cleaner environment, renewable energy and climate leadership. But so far, voters have not punished the leaders who remain silent about climate change or who actively shill for the carbon cartel. The tipping point in government policy will come when politicians are more afraid of their constituents than they are afraid of the cartel.For an effective climate rebellion, it’s also important to understand that the contemporary environmental challenge has more than one dimension. It involves taking back control of democracy. It has been subverted by unprincipled partisanship and the special interests empowered by the Supreme Court’s mind-boggling ruling that corporations are people and have the right to shower political campaigns with cash. It involves a deliberate transition to an economy powered mostly, if not entirely, by carbon-free renewable energy. And it involves a fundamental change in our understanding of our relationship with natural systems.In a study published by the National Academy of Sciences two years ago, a group of researchers drilled into the core of this last challenge. They noted a “a fundamental asymmetry” in which our focus on short-term production and consumption leads to a loss of the natural capital necessary for our long-term well-being.“The central challenge of the 21st century,” they wrote,is to develop economic, social, and governance systems capable of ending poverty and achieving sustainable levels of population and consumption while securing the life-support systems underpinning current and future human well-being...Sustainable development in the 21st century requires explicit recognition that social and economic development are part of—and dependent upon—a stable and resilient biosphere.We know today that material progress and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive. A growing number of nations and communities are proving it by decoupling economic development from energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.To sum up, there is no shortage of important social, economic and political issues to work on today, but none is more important than minimizing the likelihood of irreversible climate disruption. There is no mystery about what we must do. We must stop putting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by transitioning to a clean energy economy. Instead, we are witnessing a profound tragedy in the United States as Trump and Congress reverse years, perhaps generations, of environmental progress.We need citizen rebellion to be relentless again and to maintain its moral authority with disciplined nonviolence. The ’60s and ’70s showed that rebellion succeeds only when leaders are convinced it won’t go away. A half century ago, there was rarely a day when demonstrations were not underway in the streets and on campuses around the country. Protests against the Vietnam war persisted for nine years before the war ended.We don’t have a military draft today to drive people into the streets, but everyone alive and yet to be born is being conscripted by the carbon cartel into an ugly future. In the final analysis, it makes little difference what Congress and its laws say; moral law requires that we rise up against the people who are profiting from the pollution that’s changing the climate and against the people like Trump and his team who are aiding and abetting this crime.We need to ask ourselves on this and other injustices whether we are still capable of the sustained moral force and momentum that changed the course of government in the 1960s. Or did the spirit of bell-bottom pants and turtleneck sweaters?"
26,BLACK VOICES,Black Women on TV Are Living Their Best Selves and We're Here For It,"Agunda Okeyo, ContributorWriter, Producer & Activist, Creator of ""Sisters of Comedy""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-women-on-tv-are-living-their-best-self-and-were_us_5989d204e4b0f25bdfb31fb2,"Originally posted on Afropunk.com Up until several years ago, the daily rhythms and inner life of black women were rarely",2017-08-08,<p>HBO’s <em>Insecure </em>stars Issa Rae and Yvonne Orji on the red carpet. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5989eb051400002500ecfbf4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Originally posted on Afropunk.com Up until several years ago, the daily rhythms and inner life of black women were rarely examined on television in the 21st Century. Thanks to the creative genius and tenacity of Oprah, Shonda Rhimes, Ava DuVernay, and now Issa Rae black women behind the scenes are sharing stories that finally do us justice. So after many years of one dimensional representation, we are living fully on the small screen again.Like every 30-something black woman I know, I was watching HBO’s Insecure Sunday night. I watch it so I can see myself living. How simple is that. White women never have to think: “Where can I see myself living?” For us, softer though still challenging subjects of friendship, companionship, therapy, office dynamics, or simply hanging out at a bar are rarely depicted. We’re often fighting, struggling, enduring, or transcending. To be fair some really good black television is shaped by the adversity of their principal characters like HBO’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks or ABC’s Scandal. And like the Henrietta Lacks story, which is true and very upsetting, there was and is real strife in being a black woman. Yet, there is something surprisingly radical in showing black women smiling freely or laughing at a joke or just hanging with her girls amidst life’s ups and downs.Growing up in the 1990s I used to see myself on screen more often thanks to Queen Latifah and Living Single (woot, woot!) or A Different World or even Sister Sister and Brandy’s Moesha. These shows were traditional television sitcoms, but they had some depth, plus a sense of responsibility in representing black women and girls. After the 1990s I rarely saw black girls or women reflected substantively, until recently. In the diversity desert of the early 2000s, shows like That’s So Raven are what passed for representation. A show helmed by a black woman, Raven Symone, who doesn’t even identify as black and says she wouldn’t hire anyone with a “black” sounding name. Please.As hip-hop became as mainstream as rock and roll, black men though not ubiquitous throughout the arts, were seen, their words were heard. But for us, like Lauryn Hill or the entire R&B industry, we were MIA for a cool minute. Well, there was Girlfriends, which was fun, but never really hit me in the gut perhaps because it was black womanhood in a very white Los Angeles. Kelsey Grammer executive produced the hit show starring the wonderful Tracee Ellis-Ross, but like many things black back then, there was always a feeling that blackness had to first, be accessible to whites and for us second. Only loose curls, brunch anecdotes and stilettos allowed.There’s something about black women living that irritates people and I’m not here for it because my joy is not yours to sanctify. I remember reading about a now viral saga involving ten black women in the same book club, taking a scenic trip on the Napa Valley Wine Train. The entire book club, 11 people total, were kicked off the three hour trip after two hours for laughing too loudly. They were paraded through 6 cars, left at the next train station and police were called. Less than a year later those sisters were laughing all the way to the bank reaching an $11 million dollar settlement. I mention this because these women, all professionals and poised, were literally criminalized for laughing. Just as I know white women feel no need to query about ‘living’ on screen, they would never imagine being criminalized for laughing.Consider that during the entire eight years of the Obama presidency through to today there is a concerted effort to demonize his daughters as “wild” and “out of control”, like many tried to paint Michelle Obama as “the angry black woman.” It’s seeing them live through stories and pictures of travel, college visits, work or formal events year after year that drives their detractors crazy. The former First Lady, recently expressed the hurt of racism and sexism she endured during her tenure, saying, “Women, we endure those cuts in so many ways that we don’t even notice we’re cut. We are living with small tiny cuts, and we are bleeding every single day. And we’re still getting up.” That’s what living as a black woman is like: you’re living your life, striving for your best self despite the haters, despite the sexism, despite the racism and so on; because for us these are constant obstructions that must be acknowledged, yet moved aside. When we think about Michelle Obama now, most people don’t think “angry black woman” because she kept living and laughing despite it all so what remains is the impression of an elegant woman who never minces words, but one that lives honestly and courageously.This is why black girls and women being seen as living and laughing is so important. This is why I produce comedy that centers black women’s stories through my ongoing stand up showcase Sisters of Comedy. Black women living trumps white supremacy one giggle at a time. Tonight there was a scene in Insecure with Issa (Issa Rae) and her best friend Molly (Yvonne Orji) out at a bar or lounge filled with black men and women of all types just hanging out. Issa is on the rebound and looking to hook up, very unsuccessfully because she has zero game and Molly is trying to help her. At one point they see two guys across the room and Molly suggests they approach. Issa is doing the absolute most (ehem, ZERO game) so walks in slow motion as if in a Michael Bay movie cooly escaping an explosion with plumes of smoke wafting in the background. They lose their prey to two women who walk normally. The scene is hilarious because it’s simple and it’s life.Like a MJ comeback in the 4th quarter (I’m shaped by the ’90s so back off) television is the the middle of a creative renaissance. Shows centering black women are artfully growing in number and no longer pandering to white America but embracing images black women make for each other, that most folks can relate to because, duh, we’re people too.Agunda Okeyo is a writer, producer and activist. She produces the ongoing showcase “Sisters of Comedy” housed at Carolines on Broadway that features a who’s who of black women comedy.

International headlines were mostly celebratory. Only a handful of reports, however, covered the story of 28-year-old Ulli Köppe, who asked German Chancellor Angela Merkel about marriage equality during a live panel at Berlin’s Maxim Gorki Theater just four days before the historic vote. At the time, Köppe, who is a journalist and events manager, asked the chancellor, “When will I be able to call my boyfriend my husband?”While Merkel had long been publicly opposed to same-sex marriage, she responded by dropping what some called a “political bombshell,” noting that she hoped the debate would shift “into the direction of a decision of conscience.” In the end, Merkel voted against marriage equality. Still, her unexpected response to Köppe’s question is believed to have sent a national message encouraging other German lawmakers, including members of her conservative Christian Democrats party, to support it. “Ulli Köppe didn’t realize he would change history with a simple question this week,” wrote USA Today at the time. On Thursday, Köppe looked back on his moment in the spotlight as part of an interview with Berlin-based journalists Clare Richardson and Rebecca Ritters for the new podcast “Europe to Date.”“I had no idea that I would stand up, and also not my boyfriend. He was really surprised when I got up,” Köppe said of the experience. “But then I said very simple and very easy words ... so that she had to answer something.”Listen to the “Europe to Date” interview with Köppe. Story continues below. Since then, Köppe has become a bit of a local celebrity in Berlin. “I was traveling around Germany for the gay prides, doing gay pride floats for the parades, and I got so many nice comments,” he said. “They recognized me ― lesbians, gays, literally everyone, they wanted to take pictures with me.”Köppe’s proudest moment came on Berlin’s Christopher Street Day on July 22. “My mom was here with my sister, and she was so proud because there was one big sign that was on the TV that said, ‘Thanks, Ulli,’” he said. Ritters and Richardson, who previously served as HuffPost’s World Editor, filter European news stories through an expat lens on “Europe to Date,” which launched last month.The podcast “aims to build news literacy for a plugged-in international audience,” Richardson said. “Each episode takes a deep dive into a specific topic ― such as Brexit and where Europe stands on Britain’s vote to leave the EU ― and brings in experts to provide context to the most important issues in the headlines.”Head here to hear more.

I do not have any information to share on the nature or timing of the process,” the cable advises.A U.S. State Department official declined to comment on the cable.(Click here for a link to the cable: http://live.reuters.com/Event/Live_US_Politics/1051797571)Trump, a Republican, had campaigned on a promise to “cancel” the Paris deal, saying he believed it would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars while leaving developing nations such as China unfettered. In a sharp difference with the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, Trump has several times called climate change a hoax.In June, Trump left the door open to re-engagement if terms improved. The United States will “start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” he said.The State Department guidance clarifies that right now, “there are no plans to seek to re-negotiate or amend the text of the Paris Agreement.” But it adds: “The President is sincere in his commitment to look for a path to re-engage that takes into account his concerns for U.S. economic growth and energy security.”The Paris accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit planetary warming by curbing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that scientists believe drive global warming. The United States, under the Obama administration, had promised to cut emissions as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.Separate from the diplomatic cable, the Trump administration is reviewing a draft report written by scientists across 13 federal government agencies that shows the effects of climate change pose dire, near-term threats to the United States.The Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on the draft, which The New York Times published on Monday.The report puts the White House in the awkward position of either clearing the report’s findings or editing them.“CLEAN AND EFFICIENT FOSSIL FUELS”The diplomatic guidance makes clear that the United States intends to attend global climate summits during the prolonged process of withdrawing from the Paris deal to protect U.S. interests. The next summit is in November.A U.S. official said a major priority in these talks would be to beat back attempts to have separate standards in the guidance on emissions cuts for rich and poor nations - long a sticking point in negotiations.“There’s certainly nothing in the policies of this administration that would make us think that we should be acting differently,” the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal memo.The cable also anticipates questions over why the United States has changed its policy to make it easier for global development banks such as the World Bank to finance coal-fired power projects. In 2013 the Obama administration said the United States would oppose most coal projects, guidance since altered by the Trump administration.“The new principles will allow the (United States) the flexibility to approve, as appropriate, a broad range of power projects, including the generation of power using clean and efficient fossil fuels and renewable energy,” the cable said.(Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Rich Valdmanis and Leslie Adler)"

31,WORLD NEWS,President Zuma's South Africa Is A Shadow Of Mandela's Rainbow,"By Ferial Haffajee, Editor-at-Large, HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/president-jacob-zuma-south-africa-mandela_us_598a18e3e4b0a66b8baf541e,"Though the president dodged a devastating loss, his people have not.",2017-08-08,"South African President Jacob Zuma addresses his supporters after surviving a no-confidence motion in Cape Town, South Africa, on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598a25da15000021008b5b17.jpeg?cache=ROikvYNXil&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JOHANNESBURG ― South Africa’s young democracy has gone from being led by someone revered as a saint to being run by a man many consider a hustler. And the country doesn’t seem to mind.President Jacob Zuma, in an administration of eight short years, has survived nine political scandals and six motions of no confidence in Parliament. On Tuesday, he defeated the sixth motion of no confidence on his leadership ability. The governing African National Congress defeated the motion brought by a coalition of opposition parties.Zuma is South Africa’s ultimate survivor. This former freedom fighter and intelligence operative is known as the country’s “Teflon man” for his ability to keep scandal from sticking to him.He does this through shrewdness and an ability to cast himself as a simple man of the people.In 1994, Nelson Mandela was sworn in as president in a Parliament that had been home to both the colonial administrators and the apartheid government. On that day, South African democracy’s first complement of Parliament members of all races and creeds, men and women, took their seats and blew life and civil rights into a place where systemic racial separation and oppression had been crafted. From there came the idea made popular by Archbishop Desmond Tutu that South Africa is a rainbow nation.Since then, Parliament has been the embodiment of the idea that democracy can replace authoritarianism as much as Mandela symbolized the idea that peaceful transition was possible in a 20th century mired in war and conflict.The ANC has done well by the people who have voted it back into power in five successive elections ― free, fair and peaceful elections. It has built a significant system of social solidarity, which pays grants to the old and infirm and provides free healthcare to the poor.Mandela’s party has extended electricity to areas left destitute by apartheid’s planners and put in water connections for millions who had had to draw their water from distant dams or rivers.The pace of credible and free elections is an unusual track record in postcolonial Africa, as is the fact that South Africa has changed its head of state four times since Mandela, who left office after a single term to spend time with a family who had sacrificed him to the struggle against apartheid and also to end the South African pattern of leaders for life.By changing its heads of state regularly, South Africa is bucking the trend of African leaders turning their backs on term limits to stay on for decades.But in other ways, we are sticking to type in modern emerging market economies. If there is one phrase on the lips of most South Africans, it is “state capture,” shorthand for the grip that one family has on key parts of the economy.The Gupta family is like the Corleones of “The Godfather” films: émigrés who have built an empire from connections with politicians. They are extraordinarily close to Zuma and are business partners with his son, Duduzane Zuma, who is like South Africa’s version of Ivanka Trump. He’s a young man who has benefited from his father’s power.The Gupta family wanted to expand out of India and first chose Singapore and China, where they did not meet with great success. Then they sent one of the four brothers to South Africa to see if it might serve as a base for expansion into the rest of the continent.Atul Gupta befriended Zuma before he became president, and it turned out to be a fruitful relationship.Now, 17 years later, the Gupta family owns holdings wherever the state has influence or a substantial budget. Atul Gupta is one of South Africa’s richest men.A set of leaked emails as seismic as the Panama Papers appear to reveal how this fortune was built by corrupt means, although Gupta disputes their authenticity.The story is long and complex, and it found its way into Parliament on Tuesday. Zuma’s victory over the no-confidence motion tells another story. Mandela’s rainbow nation has been replaced by Zuma’s crony nation.Ferial Haffajee is the editor-at-large for HuffPost South Africa."

Honestly, it’s been a tough year: more than a dozen of my friends died of overdoses. Hate, ignorance, fear, and greed killed them. They are only a few of the millions of people who will die, if we don’t make some dramatic changes to the way our country handles addiction. Why am I the survivor?The opioid crisis is a national emergency. It kills 142 Americans every day: every three weeks, the death toll is equal to the number of lives lost in the September 11 attacks. Yet, the White House is still not taking the threat seriously. My friends died for one simple reason: because we live in a system that is designed for failure, because the policymakers responsible for creating that system don’t invite people in recovery to the table.The opioid crisis is the direct result of our country’s unwillingness to face addiction and its consequences. Ignorance kills. Until people with substance use disorder have a significant role in shaping policy and building communities in recovery, we won’t be able to stop the epidemic.My friends lost their lives because substance use disorder, and the people who live with it every day, are misunderstood. We are subjected to policies that are written by people who are ignorant about addiction. People hate us: every day, I get messages from people who think it would be better for taxpayers if we just died and unburdened the system. But we pay taxes, too. We’re your neighbors. We teach your kids. We serve your food in restaurants and police your streets. People with substance use disorder are everywhere. So why are we being treated like we don’t exist?Silence and stigma cost my friends their chance at a better life. My friend Tyler died last week of an overdose in his sober living house. The facility didn’t have Narcan, an anti-overdose medication that essentially neutralizes the effects of heroin and immediately puts the person into withdrawal. My friend was alive when the sober living owner showed up, but she didn’t know what to do to save his life. His death was preventable. When I told the owner’s colleague that I couldn’t believe they didn’t have Narcan on site for emergencies, she just shrugged. She told me that if Tyler had really wanted to be sober, he’d still be alive.The same lie is told every day to grieving mothers, fathers, siblings, and friends. “If your son had tried harder, this wouldn’t have happened.”Nick. Greg. Jeff. Nicholas. Mica. Tyler. Chris. Brian. Justin. Kelsey. Jeremy. Holly. They all tried. And it’s not their fault that they failed. The help they needed simply wasn’t there.The White House’s new Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis needs to bring recovery support to scale and fund organizations that reach out to people who are newly in recovery, like my friends. If we continue with “business as usual,” we will only be feeding the epidemic. We need to focus on the critical time after detox, when people with substance use disorder need recovery support. We won’t get the results that treatment centers promise to deliver until we fund peer-to-peer support, community recovery organizations, and accessible housing, education, employment, and recovery assistance. This is where the system breaks down: it focuses on prevention through treatment and fails to build a bridge to long-term recovery.Thousands of people fall through the cracks. We are set up to fail, every step of the way. Treatment centers wash their hands of us as soon as we walk out their doors, saying that if we relapse, it’s because we “didn’t really want recovery.” Insurance companies refuse to help us by paying for outpatient and aftercare. Hospitals give us Narcan and then immediately put us back on the streets. There is no direct path to recovery because recovery is not the outcome of the system we have. Relapse is.People in recovery need to speak up and speak out. We must change this system: our community’s lives depend on it. We need support and funding for recovery, not just treatment for acute substance use. We won’t be ignored, refused, or diminished. We deserve a seat at the policymakers’ table. We need to talk about how we found recovery, and invest in the resources that supported our success. Otherwise, the system will continue to kill people like my friends, and the victims of this epidemic will continue being blamed for their own tragic, preventable deaths.It’s time to speak up: the change starts with us.

Over the last 20 years, some 90 percent of major recorded disaster events have been weather-related.The Emergency Events Database maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, based at the University of Louvain, Belgium, recorded 6,457 weather-related disasters between 1995 and 2015. There has been a doubling of such events yearly over the last decade.About 89 percent of the 606,000 lives lost in these events occurred not in Europe but in lower income countries where under-recording of disaster-related mortality remains an issue.Now comes research published in The Lancet, which focusses on the possible impact of climate change in Europe and finds that weather-related disasters could affect about two-thirds of the European population annually by the year 2100 leaving as many as 351 million people exposed per year compared with 25 million people exposed per year during the reference period of 1981 to 2010.It is a comprehensive investigation of climate and demographic changes focused on natural hazards which cause the most mortality and affect the highest numbers of people including heatwaves and cold waves, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal floods, and windstorms in a “business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gas emissions.”A key finding is that there could be a 50-fold increase in mortality annually, 3,000 deaths, by the year 2100. In southern Europe, currently suffering the ravages of the so-called Lucifer heatwave and associated wildfires, premature mortality linked to weather extremes could become the greatest environmental risk factor.According to The Lancet, “The projected changes are dominated by global warming (accounting for more than 90 percent of the risk to human beings), mainly through a rise in the frequency of heatwaves (about 2,700 heat-related fatalities per year during the reference period vs 151,500 during the period 2071-100).”Those numbers are quite staggering. The implications of the findings are profound for the rest of the world, particularly low and middle income countries which do not have access to the kind of resources which Europe has for adaptation to climate change and reducing the risk posed by extreme weather events.Many low-income countries are still struggling to put in place the most rudimentary of climate risk early warning systems that is now the objective of a global initiative backed by the World Meteorological Organization, the World Bank and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) in an effort to meet a key target of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction adopted two years by UN Member States.The Lancet findings underline the size of the challenge facing many countries in regions of the world where weather-related extreme events pose an even greater threat than in Europe. The Sendai Framework sets targets for substantial reductions in disaster mortality, the numbers of disaster affected people, economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure by 2030.This research throws into stark relief how difficult it will be to reduce disaster losses and alleviate the impact on human health if there is not a major ramping up of mitigation, climate adaptation and risk reduction efforts in the immediate future.As the authors point out the results are particularly relevant to a key priority for action in the Sendai Framework, “Understanding disaster risk.”A key element of developing this understanding at national and local level is the promotion of the collection, analysis, management and use of relevant data and to ensure its dissemination so that it can be acted on.As we move towards the Sendai Framework’s 2020 deadline for a substantial increase in the number of countries with national and local disaster risk reduction strategies, we need to have a much more developed understanding of what the implications are for disaster risk management of climate change and population growth.These latest research findings are a welcome addition to our understanding of disaster risk in Europe but should also encourage similar investigations of the consequences of climate change in other parts of the world likely to suffer the worsening impacts of weather-related disasters in the future.Robert Glasser is the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction"
34,MEDIA,Conservative Media Voices Line Up Against Trump-Friendly Sinclair’s Purchase Of Tribune,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-media-sinclair-trump_us_598a0a1be4b0d793738ac43d,The challenge from the right comes as progressive opponents fear ideology would be injected into more local newscasts.,2017-08-08,Sinclair's bid to buy Tribune is facing criticism from the left and right. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598a0b1115000021008b5abf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One America News CEO Charles Herring blasted the Federal Communications Commission’s recent decision to relax media ownership rules, a move that could pave the way for Sinclair’s $3.9 billion purchase of Tribune Media and allow the broadcast company to extend its reach into more than 70 percent of U.S. homes.“Utilizing the ‘UHF discount,’ which is an antiquated, irrelevant regulation, is really politics at its worst,” Herring said Monday, referring to a loophole around a federal cap limiting ownership to 39 percent of the national audience.There’s already been significant opposition to the nation’s largest owner of TV stations expanding its footprint to around 215 stations. The Maryland-based Sinclair operates local affiliates across the major networks ― ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox ― and has increasingly faced scrutiny over its practice of forcing stations to air “must-run” segments and conservative commentary on their local newscasts. After long flying under the radar, Sinclair has recently been the subject of two magazine cover stories, a nearly 20-minute John Oliver rant, and has faced accusations in the New York Times and Washington Post about tilting the newscasts on local stations it acquires to the right ― along with helping boost Donald Trump’s candidacy during the 2016 election.Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly said the Trump campaign struck a deal with Sinclair for better coverage, a characterization the company rejected. Politico reported Sunday how Trump-appointed FCC commissioner Ajit Pai “aided Sinclair’s expansion” by reinstating the so-called “UHF discount.” While the proposed deal has faced challenges from progressive groups, media consolidation critics and Democratic senators, it’s is also being opposed by conservative media voices, like Herring, who are typically aligned with the president. One America News was described in a recent profile as “one of President Trump’s favorite media outlets.”Christopher Ruddy, a Trump friend and CEO of conservative Newsmax, last month called for a delay in the government approval process of the Sinclair-Tribune deal. And Glenn Beck’s The Blaze joined several independent media outlets in a June letter to the chairs of the Senate Commerce and Judiciary committees. “Regardless of political affiliation, we should agree that robust democracy demands a variety of viewpoints from a myriad of sources; yet, the Sinclair/Tribune merger threatens this core value,” the letter read. The Sinclair deal has also rankled 21st Century Fox executive chairman and Trump friend Rupert Murdoch, who unsuccessfully vied for Tribune earlier this year. Bloomberg reported last week that 21st Century Fox has threatened to shift local Fox affiliates away from Sinclair and to Ion Media Networks, the latest dispute in a decades-long feud between Murdoch and Sinclair. Sinclair declined to comment on opposition from the right. Herring spoke to reporters Monday morning on a conference call with representatives from the American Cable Association, a trade organization, and public watchdog Common Cause.Michael Copps, a former FCC commissioner and now a special adviser to Common Cause, said Sinclair “is the most dangerous company most Americans haven’t heard of.” And Copps specifically questioned the ideological implications of the Maryland-based broadcast company imposing segments ― such as commentaries from former Trump White House official Boris Epshteyn ― onto local newscasts. “So much for community news. So much for real news. So much for journalism. So much for fair and open media,” Copps lamented. “No one company should have such power over the news and information that citizens must have.”The conservative case against the deal, however, hasn’t focused on Sinclair’s political leanings, but on the ramifications for competitors and consumers. “I think the Sinclair merger with Tribune raises very serious concerns about competition and media diversity,” Ruddy recently told Multichannel News. “President Trump himself warned about the ‘concentration of media power.’ The Commission and public need sufficient opportunity to carefully review this precedent-setting deal.”Networks like One America News and Newsmax have to hammer out deals with cable and satellite providers for distribution, a difficult and costly process, and currently reach tens of millions fewer homes than the likes of CNN and MSNBC. The proposed deal has fueled speculation that Sinclair, possibly through acquiring Tribune channel WGN, could launch a national network to rival the Murdoch-owned Fox News and that might lure current stars, like Sean Hannity, or former host Bill O’Reilly. Sinclair has tried to tamp down the speculation one of the company’s goals is to build a national conservative news channel. “Our strength is local news,” CEO David Shipley told Variety last month. “The market for national cable news is very well served.”Herring specifically expressed concerns on Monday about the 39 percent ownership rule being relaxed without public discussion, and argued that Sinclair would have too much leverage when making deals with cable and satellite providers. “The real concern here is if you have an entity with excessive, unbalanced power in the marketplace, which Sinclair arguably has now,” he said, “the market doesn’t work.”"
35,POLITICS,Purple Heart Vet 'Incredulous' Her Senate Colleagues Approved Trump Nominee Who Authored 'Torture Memos',Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/torture-memo-author-trump_us_5988aec7e4b0a66b8bad6edf,"Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who was shot down over Iraq, said Steven Bradbury's approval of torture methods put soldiers in danger.",2017-08-08,Steven G. Bradbury has been nominated for the position of general counsel of the Transportation Department.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5988b32f1400001f00ecf8e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) thinks about one of the authors of the Bush-era “torture memos” joining the Trump administration, her mind goes back to when she was flying missions to Abu Ghraib prison at the time that photos emerged of U.S. military personnel torturing prisoners. “When those pictures came out, pretty much almost universal reaction among my fellow soldiers and myself was utter disgust,” Duckworth said in an interview with HuffPost. “Our reaction, and pardon my language, was those fuckers just made it more dangerous for the rest of us to do our jobs.”Duckworth is a Purple Heart recipient who lost both her legs after the helicopter she was co-piloting was shot down in Iraq in 2004. Now, as she represents Illinois in the U.S. Senate, she said her experience in the military drives her opposition to President Donald Trump’s nomination of Steven Bradbury to an administration post.Bradbury was one of the Justice Department lawyers who signed off on methods of torture during the Bush administration. Bradbury authored four memos, one of which authorized the use of techniques like “dietary manipulation,” nudity, “walling,” “cramped confinement,” sleep deprivation of more than 48 hours and waterboarding. In another memo, Bradbury said detainees could be put in diapers so long as those diapers were “checked regularly and changed as necessary.” The Justice Department’s ethics office had “serious concerns” about parts of Bradbury’s analysis, though DOJ ethics attorneys did not conclude that Bradbury committed professional misconduct.HuffPost was the first to report back in March that Bradbury was in the running for a nomination. Trump nominated him to the position of general counsel of the Transportation Department in June. Duckworth had placed a hold on Bradbury’s nomination, but Republicans on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee voted last week to advance Bradbury’s nomination. Duckworth joined her Democratic colleagues in opposing his nomination. Bradbury’s nomination still must be confirmed by the Senate as a whole.Duckworth told HuffPost that, just like the U.S. soldiers who mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib, Bradbury’s actions at the Justice Department “made it more dangerous and harder” for members of the military to do their jobs.“It wasn’t just me, bleeding heart liberal, it was me in combat with my guys flying helicopters behind enemy lines thinking, ‘OK, now we don’t have the moral high ground,’” Duckworth said.Duckworth said she was “incredulous” that the Trump administration would nominate someone who previously failed to gain confirmation in 2008.“I could not believe that they would actually try to bring him up again,” Duckworth said.“I’m frankly disappointed in people who I thought were more reasonable, I guess. I just feel like President Trump and his administration have sunk to such new lows,” Duckworth said.Duckworth isn’t comforted by the fact that Bradbury, if confirmed, won’t be dealing with issues of torture in the Transportation Department. She says she doesn’t believe he’s “fit to serve in any capacity in government” and has shown he’s “willing to put loyalty to a single individual over loyalty to his nation.”“One of the things that people really have not touched on is that once he’s been confirmed and he’s in the DOT, it is relatively easy to move him over to Justice. This may be a backdoor way to get him into Justice later on if they ever wanted to do it,” Duckworth said. “I don’t know that they do, but once he’s confirmed it’s easier to lateral him because he’s already had confirmation.”Duckworth recalled her survival, escape, evasion and rescue training, and the importance of treating the enemy humanely.“Our humane treatment of our enemy, of our captured enemy, impacts how they treat our people if they were to capture our people,” she said. “That’s a fundamental tenet of military training, and that torture memo and the acts that it condoned put our men and women who wore the uniform of our country and those who were most likely to be captured behind enemy lines ― which in the kinetic type of warfare that we have now is just about everybody who wears the uniform ― it puts them in danger and in greater chance of them being tortured.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Considering oysters need certain conditions to stay safely edible, HuffPost reached out to a few oyster experts to ask about the safety of eating oysters from vending machine. “Provided these oysters are served alive and kept in a chilled state, below 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and rotated frequently (i.e. high turnover of inventory) then I see no reason why it wouldn’t be safe,” Davis Herron, director or the retail and restaurant division of the Lobster Place Seafood Market/Cull & Pistol Oyster Bar in New York, told HuffPost. “It’s hard to really judge the safety of this without seeing it in action and talking to the owner though.”  Robert Rheault, executive director of the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association, explained why it’s so important to make sure the temperature never exceeds 45 degrees F. “Below 45 degrees F there is essentially no bacterial growth (for the species of bacteria that we worry about) so the oyster should be as safe as it was coming out of the water ― as long as it has been held under constant temperature control,” Rheault said. He added, “Now if the machine could shuck the oyster ― that would be a trick.” Julie Qiu, oyster sommelier and oyster blogger for In A Half Shell, said that she would approve of eating shellfish from a vending machine, as long as there were a few conditions in place. “Oysters from a vending machine can be safe to eat as long as they are procured, handled and stored properly,” Qiu said. “There’s a ton of regulation around live shellfish harvest and processing, and the rules vary from state to state ― enough to make you go cross-eyed.” “Many things must go according to plan, and I would only feel good about using this system if I knew that a producer or seafood distributor was being held accountable (not just a retailer... they’re too far removed from the process).” Qiu also explained why she would want to try out something like an oyster vending machine, especially in New York City. “Right now, the options for buying fresh, unopened oysters to enjoy at home is pretty bleak,” she said. “I’ve given up on trying to find high quality oysters from traditional grocers. I usually have to get oysters shipped to me directly from the farm or place a pickup order from my wholesale friends if I wanted to shuck oysters at home. Generally, the oysters in retail have been out of the water for way too long and the store associates have no idea where they actually come from.”  “I do know a few companies are exploring direct to door services, but shipping oysters and keeping them cold during transit is both costly and not very environmentally-friendly yet. This vending system would be a great solution for both producers and end consumers.” Sounds like we need to head to France to bring one of these machines home. "

But as I celebrate my third American birthday, our country is doing the opposite of accepting the world as our nation. The life of 800,000 Americans are in the balance as DACA is under attack.The DACA program, which allows certain undocumented youth to work legally in the U.S., and provides protection from deportation, has made these immigrants feel safer in a country they consider home. These young people arrived in the U.S. with stories similar to mine. They came here as children with their families and have lived here most of their lives.I came to the United States in 1994 when I was 11 years old from Mexico to be reunited with my parents. I got here on a plane with a tourist visa and when I turned 14, my visa expired and I became undocumented. Forty percent of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country never crossed the border illegally. Yet the solution for fixing our immigration system is focused entirely on a wall meant to keep brown immigrants out of the country.In 2001, Texas became the first state to allow undocumented students to attend college, pay in-state tuition, and receive state financial aid. House Bill 1403 made it possible for me to attend college and reach my full potential. I went on to receive the prestigious Texas for Women Scholarship from then Texas Governor Rick Perry and graduated with honors from the University of Texas at Austin (UT). But now, my home state of Texas has taken the lead to end DACA, with state attorney general Ken Paxton calling on other states to demand the Trump administration terminates the DACA program by September 5th.DACA has allowed young Americans to reach their full potential, with recipients attaining higher levels of education, getting better jobs, and even buying homes. This means higher wages and more tax revenue for our country. A study by the Center for American Progress found ending DACA would reduce our GDP by $433 billion over the next decade. As Americans, we should be celebrating the accomplishments of these young people, not pushing them back into the shadows. Before DACA, many of these young people lived in constant fear of being torn from their families, like I did for 20 years, afraid that their dreams and aspirations could not be realized.I went on to become a vice-president at Goldman Sachs, and now I am living my American Dream by being a best-selling author and most importantly an American citizen. These young people are not any different from me, and to deny them the opportunity to thrive is to deny the spirit of this great country.Let’s stand together in protecting the dreams of these young people by calling on Texas to stop their attacks on DACA and calling on congress to pass a permanent legislative solution."

The Rev. Johnnie Moore, an author and public relations consultant, told HuffPost that the request is a response to an “incendiary” article written by two close friends of the pope that harshly criticized “evangelical fundamentalists” and conservative Catholics in America.Moore said he wrote the letter on behalf of a number of national evangelical leaders, including those closely affiliated with the Trump administration. He hopes that a group of American and Catholic evangelical leaders can meet with the pope and any other officials Francis designates. Moore said he’d also be happy to meet with the authors of the controversial article. “Rather than being offended, we’ve chosen to pursue peace and a space for dialogue. This is because we agree on countless issues with the Catholic community ― actually, we mainly agree ― and when we disagree we aim to do it within the context of friendship,” Moore wrote to HuffPost in an email.While Francis and Trump share similar views on topics like abortion and the need to protect persecuted Christians around the world, the president and pontiff haven’t seen eye to eye on a number of other crucial issues ― immigration, the refugee crisis, climate change and attitudes toward Islam, for example. An article published in July by two of the pope’s confidantes in the Jesuit journal La Civiltà Cattolica highlighted some of those differences. The article, which was vetted by the Vatican’s Secretariat of State, was written by Rev. Antonio Spadaro, the editor-in-chief of the journal, and Rev. Marcelo Figueroa, the editor-in-chief of an edition of the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano.The piece suggested that evangelical fundamentalists and conservative Catholics have been using the Bible to gain political influence. Spadaro and Figueroa explicitly mentioned President Donald Trump and his adviser Steve Bannon, who identifies as Catholic. At one point, the authors compared Bannon’s worldview to that of the so-called Islamic State.The article sparked heated debate in evangelical and Catholic circles, Time reports, especially because it was apparently reviewed by the Vatican. Under Spadaro’s leadership, La Civiltà Cattolica is considered to have become the “unofficial mouthpiece of the papacy.”Moore was an advisor for Trump before the election and has remained an advisor and guest at the White House in the months afterward. He’s become something of an informal spokesperson for a group of evangelical leaders that is close to the president. That group includes conservative Christians like Rev. Robert Jeffress, a Southern Baptist pastor who preached for Trump on his inauguration day, the televangelist Paula White, and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council.In his Aug. 3 letter to Francis, Moore called out efforts to “divide Catholics and evangelicals” during a period of “ongoing persecution, political division and global conflict.” “We think it would be of great benefit to sit together and to discuss these things,” reads the letter, which was first reported on by Time. “Then, when we disagree we can do it within the context of friendship. Though, I’m sure we will find once again that we agree far more than we disagree, and we can work together with diligence on those areas of agreement.”The request for a meeting was reportedly sent to the Archdiocese of Washington and other intermediaries, Time reports. Moore said that the Spadaro and Figueroa have an over simplified view of the alliance between Catholics and evangelicals in this country and in Europe, which he believes has “contributed to everything from the fall of communism to a resurgence in pro-life values in this country to the preservation of religious liberty here and abroad.”“Not to mention, Catholics and evangelicals continue to partner in service to the poor and persecuted all around the world, we’ve saved millions of lives together,” he said.Moore also wrote in the letter that he hoped to use the time to meet with other high level officials at the Vatican, “to find ways in which we can cooperate on matters of great concern to us all, especially as it relates to refugees, the poor and the persecuted. ”Since Trump’s election, evangelical leaders have enjoyed “unprecedented” access to the White House. Evangelical Christians, particularly white evangelicals, are strong supporters of Trump’s policies and positions on issues like immigration and refugee admissions to the United States. They are also concerned about extremist violence performed in the name of Islam and tend to believe ― more than other religious groups ― that Islam is inherently violent. These positions put many evangelicals at odds with the beliefs of Pope Francis, who has repeatedly refused to conflate Islam with violence and has advocated strongly for immigrants and refugees."

Her mother, Andrea Swift, was also present. The singer is expected to take the witness stand during the trial.The litigation centers on her allegations that Mueller slipped his hand under her dress and grabbed her bare buttocks as the two posed during a meet-and-greet session before a June 2013 concert in Denver.“It was not an accident, it was completely intentional, and I have never been so sure of anything in my life,” Swift said in a deposition.Mueller sued first, saying Swift fabricated the allegation and pressured station management to oust him from his $150,000-per-year job. His case cites tort claims of interference with contractual obligations and prospective business relations.His lawsuit denies anything inappropriate occurred during the brief backstage encounter in which he and his girlfriend stood on either side of the pop star.Swift countersued for assault and battery, and the two civil complaints were merged for trial. In court filings, Swift said her representatives informed KYGO management about the incident, but she did not demand Mueller be fired.Swift, one of the most successful contemporary music artists, earned $170 million between June 2015 and June 2016, following a world tour and her best-selling “1989” album, Forbes Magazine said.(Reporting by Keith Coffman in Denver; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"
47,HEALTHY LIVING,Your Instagram Photos May Reveal Whether Or Not You Have Depression,Lindsay Holmes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/instagram-depression-study_us_5989b9e9e4b0d793738a3074,The power of social media.,2017-08-08,The difference between photo filters healthy participants used in the study and what people with depression typically chose.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5989e81a1400002000ecfbe6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A picture may be worth a thousand words, as the saying goes, but it could also be worth a life-saving diagnosis. Your social media photos may reveal clues to the state of your mental health, according to a new study.In a small study of 166 people, researchers examined more than 43,000 pictures on Instagram on their subjects’ profiles. Researchers also asked questions about each participant’s mental health history. A little less than half of the participants had been diagnosed with depression within the past three years.The researchers then developed an algorithm that analyzed elements of the Instagram photos, including components like colors, the number of people in a picture and the number of comments and likes the photo received. Those who had depression typically posted images that contained bluer, darker hues and had fewer faces in the images.Participants with depression were also more likely not to use filters when they were editing and uploading a photo. When they did opt for an enhancement, they “disproportionately favored the ‘Inkwell’ filter, which converts color photographs to black-and-white images,” the authors wrote. Healthy participants tended to favor the “Valenica” filter, which makes the tint more vibrant.Ultimately, using their observations about photo selection and filtering, the researchers created an algorithm that accurately determined if the user had depression 70 percent of the time. The computer program even picked up on signs of depression in a person’s photos that were posted before they were officially diagnosed.The study is what’s known as “proof of concept,” which essentially means testing to see if a theory has a real-world application, so it shouldn’t be taken as gospel quite yet. For starters, the sample size was small and the volunteers had certain qualities in common: They were willing to submit surveys on their mental health and were relatively active on social media. All of this makes it difficult to know if the study’s outcomes can be applied to an average Instagram user, according to study author Chris Danforth, co-director at the University of Vermont’s Computational Story Lab.The researchers do hope that the results help encourage scientists to conduct more research on the intersection of technology and depression signs, which could possibly lead to better early detection for mental illness in the future.“It shows some promise to the idea that you might be able to build a tool like this to get individuals help sooner,” Danforth told HuffPost, adding that the program could have some utility for doctors when it comes to diagnosing patients who may only come in once every few years for a checkup.The results of the study also align with what mental health professionals have observed in the past, Danforth said. Those with depression tend to withdraw from social groups, so it makes sense that those participants in the study had fewer people in their photos. Their worldview is often darker, he added, which could explain the photo filters they tend to choose.Nearly 300 million people worldwide are affected by depression. Ideally, Danforth says the best outcome of technology like this is getting those individuals the medical support that they need. Especially when they may be unaware about what’s going on or hesitant to reach out on their own.“The end goal of this would be creating something that monitors a person’s voice, how they’re moving around and what their social network looks like ― all the stuff we already reveal to our phones,” Danforth said. “Then that could give doctors a ping to check in or at least some insight. Because maybe there’s something going on that even the individual doesn’t recognize about their behavior.”Increasingly, researchers are mining social media as a data-rich resource about how people live. Back in 2013, researchers at the University of Vermont released a comprehensive report on the happiest and least happiest states based on geotagged tweets. Social media isn’t going anywhere, so incorporating it into important health research is a win for everyone. The study was published in the journal EPJ Data Science."

50,POLITICS,Paul Ryan To Face Debt Ceiling Dilemma,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-speakership_us_59893fb2e4b0449ed504f52a,Some in the GOP are suggesting Ryan's job could be on the line.,2017-08-08,Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) will try to please several different factions within the House GOP when it comes to negotiating a debt ceiling increase later this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5989405b22000044001a4e60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Congress returns in early September, Republicans and Democrats will only have a few short weeks to raise the debt ceiling. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) faces a problem: The gap between what House conservatives want for raising the debt limit and what they can actually get is looking increasingly vast ― and Ryan may pay a price if he simply turns to Democrats and passes a clean raise to the government’s borrowing authority.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost this week that conservatives have proposed a menu of options to GOP leadership. Their ideas include adding debt prioritization language to a limit increase, which would prioritize Treasury debt payments ahead of other spending, and codifying the Trump administration’s informal rule ― one regulation in, two out. Freedom Caucus Republicans are also open to making around $250 billion in mandatory spending cuts, as well as attaching a debt ceiling raise to their health care bill.But none of those options are looking all that likely, with any borrowing limit increase needing the sign-off of at least eight Senate Democrats. And with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, there’s little incentive for Democrats to give Republicans any concession.If anything, Democratic aides insist, it’s Republicans who will have to give in to Democratic demands. One possible option would be to couple the debt ceiling with funds to reimburse health insurance companies serving poor customers. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold those funds, which were promised to insurance companies as part of the Affordable Care Act, but Congress could guarantee the payments.One senior Democratic aide told HuffPost that negotiations haven’t really begun at this point, but a lot of Democratic members are uneasy about approving more debt only to allow Republicans to cut taxes for the wealthy as a result. At this point, another senior aide said, Democrats are taking a “wait and see” approach.Ryan’s office said it’s too early to comment on the negotiations or his position on the debt ceiling. But there’s a growing sense among conservatives that Ryan’s position is more tenuous than he anticipates, especially if he passes a clean debt ceiling raise with the help of almost every Democrat and a small coalition of Republicans.“It would be extremely difficult for a Republican speaker to put forward a clean debt ceiling and look his conference in the face and believe he’s done a job well done,” Meadows told HuffPost.What exactly that means is unclear ― Meadows wouldn’t say more. But Republicans speaking on the condition of anonymity were more candid, with one member saying that if Ryan puts forward a clean debt ceiling raise, “it becomes the start of the end for the Ryan speakership.”Another conservative member summed up Ryan’s position this way: “He doesn’t get it. He’s not going to make it to tax reform if he doesn’t get through this.”If conservatives actually make the debt ceiling a litmus test for the speaker, Ryan may resist the pressure from Democrats ― and, potentially, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ― to simply raise the limit without changes. But taking a hard stance could have serious economic implications, calling into question the United States’ ability to pay its bills and raising interest rates for future government borrowing. In effect, playing a political game of chicken with the debt ceiling may end up costing the government, and taxpayers, more.But if you believe some Republicans, Ryan isn’t going to cave.“I would be surprised if Paul Ryan thinks we should do a clean debt ceiling increase,” former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told HuffPost. “Frankly, I can’t believe the speaker of the House is going to go along with a clean debt ceiling increase.”Jordan insisted that Republicans, with control of Congress and the White House, had to get some concession for raising the debt limit. “The idea that we’re going to raise the debt ceiling and not do anything structurally on the long-term debt concerns just makes no sense,” he said. Jordan pointed to other deals in the past to argue that Republicans had to get something.“Even if it was ‘no budget, no pay,’” Jordan said, referring to a gimmicky 2013 law that placed future restrictions on congressional salaries if lawmakers didn’t agree to a budget, “Republicans always get something.”But part of the problem for Republicans is they’re still negotiating with themselves. Based on conversations with conservatives this week, even if Republicans secured some small concessions, it seems unlikely they’d get the support of every conservative. Even if they did, it still wouldn’t be enough in the Senate. And some Republicans are just apt to vote against more debt.“It doesn’t make any difference to me whether it’s Barack Obama or John Boehner as president and speaker of the House; my position is unchanged,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who is running for Senate, told HuffPost. “I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless there is a serious effort to address the underlying cause of the problem.”Brooks said a “clean debt ceiling raise” was actually a “dirty debt ceiling raise,” because lawmakers would be putting the country on a path to insolvency and bankruptcy, leading to the gutting of Medicaid, food stamps and national security.“That seems like a pretty dirty thing to do to our kids and grandkids and our country,” Brooks said.Asked what increasing the limit without any concessions would mean for the speaker, Brooks danced around the topic, but he suggested that no reforms would be a problem for him.“I like Paul Ryan personally,” Brooks said. “I’m gonna limit this discussion to public policy, and an increase in the debt ceiling without any substantive effort to fix America’s deficit problem is a betrayal of America’s future and our children and grandchildren.”Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) had a similar thought.“It’s not about Paul Ryan,” he said. “It’s about the Republican brand and fiscal responsibility. Why would we put a clean debt ceiling increase without any reforms whatsoever on a Republican president’s desk?”Brat continued that he had not seen any provision in the Republican platform calling for “$600 billion deficits as far as the eye can see and the bankruptcy of America on the backs of our children.”Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) told HuffPost that lawmakers needed “some sort of Spend-aholics Anonymous, a 12-step plan, and possibly an intervention in order to end the Congress’ propensity to spend money that we don’t have.”But if Republicans can’t get Democrats to go along with the sort of sweeping ― or even more limited ― reforms they want in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, would Republicans actually let the government default?President Donald Trump has recently settled on stock market gains as a signature achievement.

51,POLITICS,Paul Ryan To Face Debt Ceiling Dilemma,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-speakership_us_59893fb2e4b0449ed504f52a,Some in the GOP are suggesting Ryan's job could be on the line.,2017-08-08,"Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said a “clean debt ceiling raise” was actually a “dirty debt ceiling raise.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5989ebfd22000044001a4fda.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Congress returns in early September, Republicans and Democrats will only have a few short weeks to raise the debt ceiling. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) faces a problem: The gap between what House conservatives want for raising the debt limit and what they can actually get is looking increasingly vast ― and Ryan may pay a price if he simply turns to Democrats and passes a clean raise to the government’s borrowing authority.House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost this week that conservatives have proposed a menu of options to GOP leadership. Their ideas include adding debt prioritization language to a limit increase, which would prioritize Treasury debt payments ahead of other spending, and codifying the Trump administration’s informal rule ― one regulation in, two out. Freedom Caucus Republicans are also open to making around $250 billion in mandatory spending cuts, as well as attaching a debt ceiling raise to their health care bill.But none of those options are looking all that likely, with any borrowing limit increase needing the sign-off of at least eight Senate Democrats. And with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, there’s little incentive for Democrats to give Republicans any concession.If anything, Democratic aides insist, it’s Republicans who will have to give in to Democratic demands. One possible option would be to couple the debt ceiling with funds to reimburse health insurance companies serving poor customers. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold those funds, which were promised to insurance companies as part of the Affordable Care Act, but Congress could guarantee the payments.One senior Democratic aide told HuffPost that negotiations haven’t really begun at this point, but a lot of Democratic members are uneasy about approving more debt only to allow Republicans to cut taxes for the wealthy as a result. At this point, another senior aide said, Democrats are taking a “wait and see” approach.Ryan’s office said it’s too early to comment on the negotiations or his position on the debt ceiling. But there’s a growing sense among conservatives that Ryan’s position is more tenuous than he anticipates, especially if he passes a clean debt ceiling raise with the help of almost every Democrat and a small coalition of Republicans.“It would be extremely difficult for a Republican speaker to put forward a clean debt ceiling and look his conference in the face and believe he’s done a job well done,” Meadows told HuffPost.What exactly that means is unclear ― Meadows wouldn’t say more. But Republicans speaking on the condition of anonymity were more candid, with one member saying that if Ryan puts forward a clean debt ceiling raise, “it becomes the start of the end for the Ryan speakership.”Another conservative member summed up Ryan’s position this way: “He doesn’t get it. He’s not going to make it to tax reform if he doesn’t get through this.”If conservatives actually make the debt ceiling a litmus test for the speaker, Ryan may resist the pressure from Democrats ― and, potentially, the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ― to simply raise the limit without changes. But taking a hard stance could have serious economic implications, calling into question the United States’ ability to pay its bills and raising interest rates for future government borrowing. In effect, playing a political game of chicken with the debt ceiling may end up costing the government, and taxpayers, more.But if you believe some Republicans, Ryan isn’t going to cave.“I would be surprised if Paul Ryan thinks we should do a clean debt ceiling increase,” former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told HuffPost. “Frankly, I can’t believe the speaker of the House is going to go along with a clean debt ceiling increase.”Jordan insisted that Republicans, with control of Congress and the White House, had to get some concession for raising the debt limit. “The idea that we’re going to raise the debt ceiling and not do anything structurally on the long-term debt concerns just makes no sense,” he said. Jordan pointed to other deals in the past to argue that Republicans had to get something.“Even if it was ‘no budget, no pay,’” Jordan said, referring to a gimmicky 2013 law that placed future restrictions on congressional salaries if lawmakers didn’t agree to a budget, “Republicans always get something.”But part of the problem for Republicans is they’re still negotiating with themselves. Based on conversations with conservatives this week, even if Republicans secured some small concessions, it seems unlikely they’d get the support of every conservative. Even if they did, it still wouldn’t be enough in the Senate. And some Republicans are just apt to vote against more debt.“It doesn’t make any difference to me whether it’s Barack Obama or John Boehner as president and speaker of the House; my position is unchanged,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who is running for Senate, told HuffPost. “I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless there is a serious effort to address the underlying cause of the problem.”Brooks said a “clean debt ceiling raise” was actually a “dirty debt ceiling raise,” because lawmakers would be putting the country on a path to insolvency and bankruptcy, leading to the gutting of Medicaid, food stamps and national security.“That seems like a pretty dirty thing to do to our kids and grandkids and our country,” Brooks said.Asked what increasing the limit without any concessions would mean for the speaker, Brooks danced around the topic, but he suggested that no reforms would be a problem for him.“I like Paul Ryan personally,” Brooks said. “I’m gonna limit this discussion to public policy, and an increase in the debt ceiling without any substantive effort to fix America’s deficit problem is a betrayal of America’s future and our children and grandchildren.”Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) had a similar thought.“It’s not about Paul Ryan,” he said. “It’s about the Republican brand and fiscal responsibility. Why would we put a clean debt ceiling increase without any reforms whatsoever on a Republican president’s desk?”Brat continued that he had not seen any provision in the Republican platform calling for “$600 billion deficits as far as the eye can see and the bankruptcy of America on the backs of our children.”Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) told HuffPost that lawmakers needed “some sort of Spend-aholics Anonymous, a 12-step plan, and possibly an intervention in order to end the Congress’ propensity to spend money that we don’t have.”But if Republicans can’t get Democrats to go along with the sort of sweeping ― or even more limited ― reforms they want in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, would Republicans actually let the government default?President Donald Trump has recently settled on stock market gains as a signature achievement. The pressure to raise the debt ceiling would intensify quickly once markets start reacting to a default crisis. Already, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says Congress ought to just pass a clean bill.That message, however, has been muddled elsewhere in the administration. For one, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney ― himself once a fierce Freedom Caucus member who has voted against raising the debt ceiling ― has said he’d like to see spending cuts or debt prioritization changes before Congress raises the borrowing limit.Trump hasn’t weighed in himself, but it’s easy to imagine him refusing to sign a bill that, say, continues government funding, raises the debt ceiling, excludes money for his wall along the southern border, and includes Obamacare-related funding.

The firm is the Maryland-based arm of Shenzhen Salubris Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., the Chinese drugmaker valued at roughly $5 billion and run by former Shenzhen mayor and billionaire Ye Chenghai, who with his family controls about 66 percent of the company.The proposal comes amid growing public backlash to deals that give pharmaceutical companies monopolies on drugs and vaccines developed through taxpayer-funded research without requiring them to sell the drugs back to Americans at a reasonable price.Last week, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) proposed a new rule that would require federal agencies and federally funded nonprofits, such as research universities, to secure a reasonable pricing agreement from a manufacturer before granting it exclusive rights to drugs, vaccines or other health care products.Sanders’ proposal aims to stop the Department of Defense from awarding drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur an exclusive license and $173 million in research funding to produce a Zika vaccine developed over the past year by the U.S. Army. Zika virus, a tropical, mosquito-borne disease also spread through sexual transmission, causes devastating birth defects. The French pharmaceutical giant demanded a license that would prevent other drugmakers from competing to manufacture the vaccine at a lower cost, then refused to agree to sell the vaccine back to taxpayers at a fair price. The company has a history of charging up to eight times more for its drugs in the U.S. than in France or the United Kingdom. Less is known about Salubris Biotherapeutics.

Neither Salubris Biotherapeutics nor Shenzen Salubris responded to multiple requests for comment on Tuesday.The National Institutes of Health defended its decision in a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday, arguing “an exclusive license incentivizes companies to invest in the development of early stage ... technologies so they can benefit public health.”“NIH considers carefully when a technology should have an exclusive or non-exclusive license,” a spokesman said in the statement. The treatment developed by the NIH uses therapeutic antibodies to target the harmful protein on cancerous cells. The two patents described in the license could be engineered to make the drug more precise and inhibit the growth of the cancer cells, according to Diane Singhroy, scientific and technical advisor to the Knowledge Ecology International.The Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, which spearheaded research into Sanofi’s proposed Zika license, submitted a letter on Tuesday to the NIH requesting more information about the deal with Salubris. “Is anyone in the White House paying any attention to these NIH patent licenses?” Jamie Love, the director of KEI, asked in an email to HuffPost on Tuesday. “The NIH wants to turn this over, life of patent, with zero agreements on the price, to Ye Chenghai, the former mayor of Shenzhen, in total secrecy as regards every important element of the license.”Love added: “It’s time to hold hearings on the NIH licensing practices, so people have a better understanding of what is going on.”That seems unlikely to happen.

The Senate Armed Services Committee unanimously approved the directive. Nine days later, Rep.

As 11-year-old Wrangler, 7-year-old Emmy and 4-year-old Sykes posed looking less than pleased about heading back to their classrooms (except for Sykes, who looks excited if a tad nervous), Willingham also put her feelings on display ― by relaxing in the pool with a drink and a huge smile on her face.Willingham told HuffPost her husband took the photo at her cousin’s house in Beulah, Alabama. She said she’s joked with the kids all summer that she couldn’t wait to have a day to herself.“My kids have been fighting all summer, so I kept telling them I was counting down to the first day so I could have a pool day alone,” she said. “Since my youngest was starting this year, it would be the first time in 11 years I didn’t have a baby at home.”The mom of three, who is also a USPS mail carrier, said she’s known to do “silly stuff like this all the time.” On Monday, she posted the photo on Facebook where it has been shared more than 10,000 times in a day. Despite the photo, it turns out she wasn’t able to have a relaxing day at the pool on Monday while her kids were at school after all. “I didn’t actually get to have a pool day today because I was babysitting my cousin’s 2-month-old,” she said. “But I plan to on one of my upcoming off days!”"

Your brand ― and especially the realm of Evangelicalism ― has been hi-jacked by extremists who are using it to advance political theories that have nothing to do with your beliefs. You may not have had anything to do with it personally, but this thievery has taken place right in front of you. It has been sinister and systematic, and we’ve arrived at a confused place today where the brand is now interchangeable with the extreme political right. I played a role in this maneuvering during the 1980s as the executive producer of Pat Robertson’s flagship TV program The 700 Club. Please bear with me as I attempt to explain.The 1980s was the era that launched Christianity as a Republican political force. It has grown over the subsequent years and eventually energized the election of Donald Trump. Noted theologian Roger Olsen recalled for a blog commenter the very moment he realized what was happening.For me the “tipping point” (almost driving me insane) was when television talk show hosts began inviting Jerry Falwell and his ilk onto their programs to speak for all evangelicals. Donahue, King, et al. Why didn’t they have moderate-to-progressive evangelicals on their shows to speak for evangelicalism? Because moderate-to-progressive evangelicals didn’t interest them. We speak with too many syllables and too much ambiguity. They wanted demagoguery, bluster, extremism. The fundamentalists calling themselves evangelicals provided it. Many evangelicals fell into line with this trend as did many fundamentalists. I am one of the few “hold outs” from the older, truer evangelicalism that refused and still refuses to go along with that narrative.So the initial hijacking of the brand was the work of a powerful few, but it was aided in great part by a news media in search of cultural “sides” to explain conflicts between the right and the left. And this, of course, had to be done in a manner that would produce ratings or enhance readership. Hence, Dr. Olsen’s “tipping point.” Denominational Christianity was shoved aside by those who taught their flocks that political participation was a major tenet of living the Christian life. It didn’t matter that the GOP was the party of the wealthy, their “traditional values” synced so well with the faith that it was easy to convince Christian voters to support them - in fact, “become” them - and in so doing move conservatism even farther to the right through fundamentalist extremes.They preach what I call the Gospel of Self, a self-betterment, self-improvement theology that can’t help but produce behavior contrary to the faith. Let’s face it: self is the very thing that must be overcome in the Christian tradition, not the building up of ourselves, so that we can run the world around us. That is called “idolatry,” and we all know the warnings about that. In terms of tonal quality and rationalization, the corporate voice of this group reminds me of the voice who said to Jesus, “tell these stones to become loaves of bread.” After all, He was hungry, and so are these extremists, hungry for what they believe has been taken from them by those evil liberals. We need to restore the brand to its rightful place, or Christian evangelism will become nothing more than a useless attempt to protect our own asses from a future of hellfire and damnation. We will continue to push people away and lose those from our flocks that are weary of what they see as hypocrisy. We need to let God be God, and put a stop to this damnable crusade for power and influence within the culture. I believe there are a great many who see this as contrary to the Great Commission but don’t know what to do about it.Chris Hedges is a long-time critic of this behavior and speaks to it once again in a piece called “Trump and the Christian Fascists:”“These believers ... detest the reality-based world. They condemn it as contaminated, decayed and immoral. This world took their jobs. It destroyed their future. It ruined their communities. It doomed their children. It flooded their lives with alcohol, opioids, pornography, sexual abuse, jail sentences, domestic violence, deprivation and despair. And then, from the depths of suicidal despair, they suddenly discovered that God has a plan for them. God will save them. God will intervene in their lives to promote and protect them. God has called them to carry out his holy mission in the world and to be rich, powerful and happy.”It is the Gospel of Self. How to create satisfaction for yourself and your family in this life while fighting the battles of God in the political arena. This is the antithesis of what Jesus taught in the gospels, and it brings about the paradox of prosperity ― that discontent increases with opportunities for acting on it.“The just shall live by faith” is the very foundation of protestantism. God is not mocked, and all who call themselves “Christian” know in their hearts that faith doesn’t include what’s in front of us in our culture. Life judges these things and acts upon them as the natural has always done the unnatural, and we need faith in order to let that happen without trying to move things along under our own power. The truth is we have no power to manipulate life. God’s usual method of dealing with our dissatisfaction is to keep pouring it on until we learn to truly trust Him, not our ability to do battle ourselves in hopes of “winning” a more comfortable living in this life. Don’t think that’s the way it works? Start praying for patience and watch what happens. We simply aren’t promised a peaceful neighborhood, a sinless, well-managed, and questionless society, or any other utopian fantasy that is trouble free for those of us supposedly in the know. What happened to our understanding that the corrupt nature of humankind is a trap for those who believe we have control over anything? We were promised that the poor would always be with us, and it’s by our reaction to and our treatment of those who live under poverty’s harsh taskmaster that we are judged. We cannot earn ourselves a rose garden no matter how badly we want one. That kind of justification would not be of faith anyway, so why do we try so hard to make ourselves feel so very special. Moreover, why do we attempt to force others to embrace that specialness?“The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch,” the Bible tells us. There is no reference to denomination, doctrine, or dogma, because the term referred to the way those pioneers lived and taught others to live, their overriding behavior being the piety they displayed. They loved one another.In all things as Christians, Jesus is our model, our example, our Lord, and the author of grace. If we have questions about any issue or behavior, we can look to Him for ourselves and not be dependent on what the preacher says or any so-called expert. This was the great cultural disruption in the West brought about by Gutenberg’s printing of the Bible with the first printing press. That invention ― along with common English translations of the book ― decimated the unquestioned power of Rome and spread that power across the land. So began the enlightenment, protestantism, and ultimately colonialism and a modern world governed by logic and reason.Christians are still a great throng in the world, one represented as a tapestry of different practices and branches with no one granted the authority to proclaim themselves or anyone else the “real” Christians. Various creeds have been written to help better define our specific beliefs, although we cannot escape the truth that these were written by men. Some will insist that these men were guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore sanctified in God’s eyes, but fallen man is fallen man, and if we really believe that, it’s hard to blindly trust any such reasoning. I would argue, in fact, that we’ve used those creeds and such to create neat boxes within which we can place people who disagree with us, and that is not piety, not even close.The natural inclination of children to love others is relentlessly “cleansed” by “Christian” parents eager to bring them into their separatist, nationalist folds, and the harm done in so doing is incalculable. Even within families, members who refuse to walk according to the beliefs of the patriarch or matriarch are privately and even publicly ostracized. Children grow up and become adults, and in many denominations, that means they leave, and, according to Pew, the “unchurched” population is growing at a pace unexperienced in times past. These young people are deeply turned off, and yet their antagonizers continue to loudly profess the very moral hypocrisy they see as they’re growing up. Lectures and disapproval are often tied to sexual activities and thoughts, thought to be immoral in the profession of many churches.However, morality doesn’t begin and end with sex. It just doesn’t, yet these extremists argue morality entirely around the sex act. Abortion isn’t about killing babies; it’s about sex. If it were not, then why don’t these vocal Christians support birth control? The churches don’t talk about the statistics. Did you know that the abortion rate in the U.S. is back to where it was before Roe v Wade? It’s not a legal issue, and it never was. It’s about sex and the extremist view that the act is evil unless somehow made clean by the church’s sanctification through marriage. Gay marriage. Homosexuality. Transgenderism. They’re all about sex. We think it makes God angry, and we don’t want to get caught up in that anger, so we rail against any sexual practice outside marriage between a man and a woman. We claim God is judging the world for this, and yet the Bible points out that Sodom wasn’t destroyed for its sexual sins but rather for its failure to take care of the poor and the afflicted. One is free, therefore, to ask that if God is indeed judging today, who exactly is He judging? Perhaps the very church attendees who plead the morality message at every turn.That’s a very dangerous practice, because morality is a much, much broader matter. It includes, among other things, obscene CEO salaries, oppression of workers through poor wages and conditions, opposition to welfare, insider trading, tax loopholes, flouting avarice, and removing government programs that protect the poor and the afflicted. How Christian people can side with such immorality is the great mystery of the Twenty-First Century, but it begins with those who have seized the brand and run with it.I use the words “Christian brand,” because it’s a marketing problem. We need to see it as such, if there’s to be any hope of correcting the extreme shifting of Christianity far to the political right. And if this is to be, then we need to create faith-based arguments about it and spread those far and wide. Political debates today are required to be entertaining, and that means extremes going at each other. Let’s take that debate into the church, for debating in the public square is quite useless. Let’s not be afraid to confront questions of mixing theology and politics from the pulpit, in our Bible studies, and in our homes.The only thing wrong with error, after all, is the contempt it breeds for those who would disagree, usually without investigation. We’re better than that, aren’t we?Thank you very much for hearing me out. I am, your servant,Terry"

Over the weekend, Venezuela saw more cracks in its political stability. The country’s attorney general and prominent Maduro critic Luisa Ortega was ousted from her position on Saturday. A day later, authorities announced they had put down a rebellion in the city of Valencia after a group of men in military uniforms posted a video online announcing an uprising against the government.The latest developments in Venezuela’s long-running decline in political stability and economic growth have pushed the crisis into a new phase, with the ruling party inching closer to complete control over the country’s politics following the election of a new all-powerful legislative body.Here is a timeline of the major events from Venezuela’s tumultuous past few months, which have left at least 125 people dead.March 29 ― Supreme Court Aims To Strip Congress Of PowerVenezuela’s pro-Maduro Supreme Court takes action to strip the country’s opposition-controlled Congress, the National Assembly, of its legislative abilities. The move sparks mass protests and furthers the divide between Maduro’s ruling party and the political opposition over leadership of the country.In removing the National Assembly of its powers, the Supreme Court gives itself the power to write laws.April 1 ― The Court BacktracksFollowing days of protest and subsequent police crackdowns, the Supreme Court announces that it is reversing parts of its decision to take over the powers of the National Assembly.

The new body will have the ability to dissolve the opposition-led National Assembly and make its own laws.Maduro’s announcement sparks days of rallies against the planned changes, as well as deadly crackdowns from security forces as the cumulative death toll from protests reaches into the dozens.May 18 ― U.S. Sanctions JudgesThe U.S. announces sanctions on members of Venezuela’s Supreme Court in retaliation for their attempt to seize power from the National Assembly.

The candidates include many Maduro loyalists, including the president’s own wife Cilia Flores.Deadly clashes between protesters and security forces occur throughout the day, including one incident in which a roadside bomb injures several motorcycle police in the capital of Caracas.

Maduro hails the vote as a victory and vows to press ahead with the Constituent Assembly.July 31 ― U.S. Sanctions MaduroThe United States announces sanctions on Maduro, calling him a “dictator” and barring Americans from doing business with him.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Hiroshima Mayor Kazumi Matsui attended an annual ceremony at Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park to observe the 72nd anniversary of the nuclear attack on the city. Some sources estimate that the bombing of Hiroshima eventually killed 150,000 people, while the strike on Nagasaki killed an estimated 75,000, but the numbers have long been the subject of debate.At Sunday’s event, Abe stressed the international community’s responsibility to end the use of nuclear weapons. “For us to truly realize a ‘world without nuclear weapons,’ the participation of both nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states is necessary,” Abe said, according to The Japan Times.Some 50,000 people from 80 nations and the European Union attended the ceremony, the outlet reported.Hiroshima’s mayor praised the countries that have adopted the U.N.’s recent Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons for demonstrating “their unequivocal determination to achieve abolition,” according to a transcript of his speech.However, Japan is currently under the U.S. nuclear umbrella ― a security arrangement in which participating countries consent to the potential use of nuclear weapons in their defense ― and thus is not part of the treaty.In a joint statement with the delegations of United Kingdom and France last month, the U.S. called the treaty “incompatible with the policy of nuclear deterrence, which has been essential to keeping the peace in Europe and North Asia for over 70 years.” Abe himself has argued that such disarmament would benefit North Korea and China, The New York Times noted. “This hell is not a thing of the past,” Matsui warned at the ceremony. “As long as nuclear weapons exist and policymakers threaten their use, their horror could leap into our present at any moment. You could find yourself suffering their cruelty.”Afterward, Abe addressed reporters at a press conference. Though the event has typically centered on reflections about the past, a reporter did ask whether Japan would pre-emptively strike North Korea if an attack from that country seemed imminent. North Korea conducted its most recent intercontinental ballistic missile test late last month, and experts believe a nuclear ICBM is in the works. Abe responded by asserting the importance of strengthening Japan’s overall defenses and said the Japanese government was “not planning any specific deliberations” about a pre-emptive attack. The comments stirred up controversy on Japanese social media, with many criticizing Abe’s stance at an event promoting peace, The New York Times reported. While some U.S. cities held memorials to observe the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, U.S. President Donald Trump made no mention of the historic date. Last year, then-President Barack Obama became the first U.S. leader to visit Hiroshima. “We come to mourn the dead, including over 100,000 Japanese men, women and children, thousands of Koreans and a dozen Americans held prisoner. Their souls speak to us,” Obama said at the peace memorial, according to Reuters.Trump had criticized the visit, bringing up Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. “Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he’s in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost,” he tweeted.Abe and Obama held a ceremony in Hawaii in December 2016 to commemorate the lives lost during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor."

Israeli police on Thursday confirmed Netanyahu is a suspect in two cases involving fraud and corruption. One day later, authorities said the prime minister’s former chief of staff, Ari Harow, had turned state’s witness. There’s no indication that Netanyahu’s leadership is immediately in jeopardy, but the new legal twists put the fourth-term prime minister in a precarious position and greatly increase the chances he eventually will face charges.Netanyahu has attempted to dismiss the probes as baseless distractions of no concern to him. In a video posted to his official Facebook page on Friday, he referred to the investigations as “background noise.” But it’s unclear how much longer Netanyahu will be able to casually dismiss the allegations. A multitude of fraud, bribery and graft investigations have swept up members of Netanyahu’s inner circle, but the two that directly involve the prime minister appear to be ramping up. One of the investigations, known as File 2000, is looking into whether the prime minister sought to make a deal with one of Israel’s largest newspapers for positive coverage. Netanyahu is accused of trying to negotiate favorable treatment from Arnon Mozes of the powerful Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, offering to damage rival publication Israel Hayom.On Monday, Israel’s Supreme Court ordered Netanyahu to disclose the dates of his phone calls with Mozes and with American billionaire and media mogul Sheldon Adelson, the publisher and financial backer of Israel Hayom. Israel Hayom and Adelson are both seen as supportive of Netanyahu.Harow’s deal with prosecutors may be a bigger blow to Netanyahu. The deal will allow Harow to avoid jail time in his own fraud case in exchange for his cooperation against Netanyahu.Harow is also presumed to be a witness in the other major corruption case involving Netanyahu, File 1000, which is probing whether the Israeli leader and his family improperly accepted luxury gifts, including cigars, holiday getaways and jewelry, from wealthy backers. Police announced in March that they were seeking to question billionaires Arnon Milchan and James Packer in the probe. Packer was formerly engaged to singer Mariah Carey.“I don’t know where that motherfucker is,” Carey said of Packer, when asked about his whereabouts during a June press conference in Israel. Packer agreed to be interviewed by authorities later that month.Police last week questioned Netanyahu, along with his 25-year-old son Yair and wife Sara. Reports circulated in Israeli media Monday that the country’s attorney general was preparing to indict Sara Netanyahu on a corruption charges, including accepting goods under false pretenses.Corruption scandals aren’t unusual in Israeli government. Former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert last month was freed from prison after serving almost 18 months behind bars for bribery and obstruction of justice.Despite the investigations, it’s unlikely Netanyahu will willingly resign from office in the near future. The probe could drag on for months longer before it’s clear whether he will face charges. There is no law requiring him to step down if he is indicted or convicted.Nevertheless, Netanyahu is now faced with the task of defending himself and his family, and more revelations may be on their way. He’s on track to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister if he completes his term. But whether he reaches that record is now in question. "

Note: this article originally appeared in the East-West",2017-08-07,<p> The new survey reflects Southeast Asian feelings about foreign engagement in the region. [Image: ISEAS] </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5988771a2200003a001a4c11.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Peter Valente, Project Assistant, East-West Center in Washington.Note: this article originally appeared in the East-West Center’s Asia Matters for America/America Matters for Asia initiative on May 8, 2017. The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies – Yusof Ishak Institute (ISEAS) in Singapore recently conducted a survey on U.S. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) relations under the Trump administration as part of its programming to celebrate the 50th anniversary of ASEAN’s founding. As a research center dedicated to studying economic, strategic, and development trends in Southeast Asia, ISEAS keeps a close read on public opinion in the region, and how it is shaped by political and social change. ASEAN, which was founded to strengthen the bonds of solidarity and cooperation between the countries of the organization, plays an important role in regional security and boasts close ties with China, Korea, Japan, the United States, and the European Union.The survey highlights Southeast Asians’ desire for U.S. engagement with the region, but also a lot of concern about the direction that engagement is headed. Under the Trump administration, 72 percent of Southeast Asians believe that the U.S.’ global image has deteriorated, whereas only 15 percent see it as having improved. 70 percent of Southeast Asians indicated that the region is more stable and secure with active U.S. engagement, but only 17 percent expect to see an increase in U.S. engagement under the Trump administration. A more troubling finding is that 51 percent of Southeast Asians agreed that the United States has lost strategic ground to China since Donald Trump took over the presidency, while only a third disagreed. Interestingly, when asked which country they trust to “do the right thing” in contributing to global peace, security, prosperity, and governance, the big winner was Japan, with 62 percent of respondents indicating confidence in Japan’s goodwill, with the U.S., China, and India all garnering between 20 percent and 30 percent confidence from respondents.Although the survey indicates strong support for U.S. engagement, there is a concern about the direction of current policies. The United States is still viewed as the most powerful player in the region, and potential U.S. engagement is seen very positively. Additionally, two-thirds of Southeast Asians expect that the United States will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.ASEAN and the U.S. remain important strategic and economic partners. While the U.S. exported more than $100 billion in goods and services to ASEAN in 2015, it also invested more in the organization than in China, India, Japan, and South Korea combined. The ISEAS survey was conducted from April 10-23, 2017, during which time Vice President Mike Pence traveled to Indonesia, but before the announcement by President Trump that he will attend the ASEAN summit in Manila this November. U.S.-ASEAN relations under Trump are still developing, and ISEAS and Asia Matters for America will continue to conduct comprehensive, unbiased analysis as they do."

Boochani said the man had been battling a long illness, and blamed the Australian government for not giving the man medical treatment. Manus police chief David Yapu on Monday confirmed the man’s death and said it appeared he had died by suicide, the New York Times reports. Authorities did not release the man’s full identity. For the past few years, Australia has sent asylum-seekers intercepted while trying to reach the country by sea to processing camps on two islands ― the Pacific island of Nauru, and Manus Island, which is part of Papua New Guinea. Even when recognized as refugees, Australia does not allow the new arrivals to resettle in the country. Australia says the policy is an effort to deter human smugglers. However, the government has faced intense criticism for conditions in the centers. Refugee advocates have long called for the government to bring the asylum-seekers to Australia.Sen. Nick McKim, a member of the Australian Greens political party, said on Monday that the death of the man represented an “abhorrent” failure by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s government, and pointed to the country’s immigration minister, Peter Dutton.“This man repeatedly sought Australia’s help,” McKim said. “The [Liberal party] ignored his pleas and now must bear responsibility for what happened.”He continued: “Enough is enough.

He deserved a chance to rebuild his life in freedom and safety. Instead, our government chose to be cruel, imprisoning him indefinitely on a remote island in truly awful conditions. He lost his freedom, his hope and ultimately his life. It’s an absolute tragedy.”Monday’s report is the latest in a series of turbulent events on Manus Island.Last week, robbers broke into a guesthouse and reportedly cut a 27-year-old Sudanese man in the leg with a bush knife.That same week, asylum-seekers confronted guards and police who were trying to lock gates and clear one of the accommodation compounds ahead of the center’s planned shutdown on Oct. 31.That confrontation capped days of protests inside the center, as residents feared violence from locals if they were to be pushed from the center into the wider Papua New Guinean community without hope of ever reaching Australia.This story was first published on HuffPost Australia and was adapted for a global audience.

But at the same time, BOP has failed to clearly define standards for what it calls “restrictive housing” and “extended placement.”In 2014, the BOP announced policy changes, which it said would boost mental health care. The bureau currently neither uses the term “solitary confinement” nor admits its existence in BOP-run facilities. But the DOJ watchdog’s report said its investigation “found inmates, including those with mental illness” housed in single-cell confinement, isolated from other prisoners and with limited other opportunities for human contact.The report also noted several other deficiencies in BOP mental health care beyond housing. These included frequent failures by BOP mental health staff to document inmate mental health conditions, large shortages of mental health staff, and the fact that since BOP announced its 2014 policy changes that were intended to improve mental health care, the number of inmates actually receiving regular mental health treatments declined by about 30 percent, and by about 60 percent for inmates with the most serious conditions.Almost 10,000 inmates in BOP institutions – roughly 7 percent of the total population – are housed in various forms of restrictive housing. In addition to the Florence Administrative Maximum (ADX) facility, there is also a Special Management Unit (SMU) in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and Special Housing Units (SHU) in 111 facilities.At the “Supermax” facility in Florence, Colorado, DOJ investigators found a pair of mentally ill inmates who were confined to individual cells for 22 hours a day, and for the remaining two hours of the day, were prevented from having contact with any other inmates. Mentally ill inmates at Florence, the report added, spent an average of 69 months in near-isolation, even though many states limit confinement in such conditions to a maximum of 30 days.Over the period between fiscal years 2008 and 2015, the DOJ investigation also found, inmates with mental illness in a SMU spent an average of about 29 months there. Another concern the report found was, of those inmates with mental illness who spent nearly 2.5 years on average in an SMU, 13 percent were released directly into their communities. The report further pointed out that the BOP does not keep statistics on recidivism rates.Part of the problem, the IG’s report noted, was that while BOP acknowledges solitary confinement can contribute to inmates’ mental deterioration, the agency neither keeps track of how long a mentally ill inmate has been kept in solitary conditions, nor has reliable data of how many inmates suffer from mental illness.BOP’s acting director Thomas Kane responded by saying the agency would implement all 15 of the report’s recommendations on ways to improve the screening, treatment and monitoring of inmates with mental illnesses who are in restrictive housing.Christopher Zoukis is the author of Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Federal Bureau of Prisons, College for Convicts: The Case for Higher Education in American Prisons (McFarland & Co., 2014) and Prison Education Guide (Prison Legal News Publishing, 2016).

In an interview with the Associated Press last year, Brouillard, now 96, said other priests on the island who he confided in advised him to pray and “do better.”Brouillard, who currently lives in Minnesota, still receives a monthly stipend of $550 from the Archdiocese of Agana, reported Pacific Daily News.Also named in the suits is Archbishop Anthony Apuron, who was accused of assaulting numerous boys during the 1970s. Pope Francis suspended Apuron in June of 2016 after allegations of sex abuse emerged, and the Pacific Daily News investigation reported that the Vatican is conducting a discreet trial that could lead to his removal from the clergy.Apuron has denied the charges. William Payne, who is among Agana’s accusers, said that his parents “raised him to honor and respect the priest, and told him that he had to do what the priest told him to do,” according to his suit, obtained by Pacific Daily News. Payne said he was “instilled with the belief that clergy are never wrong, and that the clergy were like Jesus.”Last year, Guam lawmakers passed a bill that retroactively eliminated the statute of limitations for civil suits involving child sexual abuse. Lawyers representing the archdiocese, Apuron, the Boy Scouts and two other accused clergy members have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuits, claiming that the bill was unconstitutional. Apuron, who still holds the title of archbishop, can not be tried criminally due to the statute of limitations on criminal prosecution.The lawsuits rocking Guam come as another prominent Catholic leader ― top-ranking Vatican official Cardinal George Pell ― stands for “historical sexual assault offenses” in Australia, where there is no statute of limitations for such cases. Like Apuron, Pell has denied the charges against him.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated the lawsuits allege abuses spanning 40 decades. In fact, they span 40 years."

With a premise that revolves around a world that is perpetually terrible, Julie and Billy band together to call spades “spades” and throw terrible back at the world. But in Season 3, which debuts August 8 on Hulu, Donald Trump is president. And instead of ignoring his administration as some others shows have done, Klausner and her team have steered right into the maelstrom.“I think it is a, ‘How could you not?’ sort of situation, and I think it’s almost less about the man than it is about the world that this man could have risen in,” Klausner explained. “It does fit in well with Billy and Julie’s worldview that the world is garbage and it’s their fault, not ours. In some ways, Billy and Julie are completely justified by that opinion, and that’s one way of it. We are miserable, unhappy people on the show, and this is a really good justification of why we are.”A notable plot point early in the new season involves Vice President Mike Pence offering money to every gay person who agrees to conversion therapy. An absolutely dark (and fictional) timeline on the surface, it’s one that has roots in reality: Pence has an ambiguous stance when it comes to the controversial treatment, and a contentious history with LGBTQ issues overall.Still, the premise is played for laughs when Billy (who identifies as gay on the show and off) decides to fake his way through conversion therapy for the money and subsequently gets a ridiculous box of anti-gay items ― a “conversion therapy kit” ― from Pence in the mail.“In a way, [our show is] sort of the opposite of ‘The Handmaid’s Tale,’” Klausner noted, referencing a dystopian Hulu show that tells the story of a future America taken over by a far-right government. “It’s kind of like an upbeat version of the way things could be.”Amid a sea of TV shows that have yet to tackle the president head-on, Julie and Billy are his perfect foes. They’re fellow New Yorkers who have spent a lifetime resisting and complaining. “They totally live in this liberal New York bubble, proudly so,” said Klausner. “They are sort of constantly, perpetually harangued, stressed out New Yorkers.”Despite the stress, though, they’re here to show viewers survival is possible.“We want to set an example that, in a way, hopefully seeing people on our show that aren’t ordinarily represented on television is a political statement in its own right,” Klausner explained. “So hopefully what they go through on the show will serve as sort of inspiration to resist the horror show that’s going around us politically right now.”Klausner wants it to be clear these characters can “stick it to him” ― “him” being Trump. “We’re really good at insulting people that we think are garbage and who could be more garbage-y?” she added.As our conversation was winding down, Klausner concluded that she really just wants this new season to have a balance of mocking Trump while also providing a much needed form of escapism.“I hope that people can take comfort in the fact that they’re not alone, just by seeing people who also feel incredibly disenfranchised and disgusted by the notion that the country would elect somebody so hateful on television, and feel a sense of camaraderie or company or kind of relation,” said Klausner. “But at the same time, I hope that the show is universal enough that it’ll just get your mind off of the world for 25 minutes.”“Difficult People” premieres on Hulu on August 8.

68,HEALTHY LIVING,It’s Time To Look Beyond Bullying: Youth Suicide Rates Rising While Bullying Rates Drop,"Deborah Temkin, ContributorDirector, Education Research, Child Trends",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-time-to-look-beyond-bullying-youth-suicide-rates_us_5988baa3e4b08a4c247f24e0,The continued narrative that youth suicide is caused by bullying may divert schools’ focus from solutions that would target more prevalent risk factors for suicide.,2017-08-07,"<p>By approaching youth suicide prevention holistically, we may be able to stem the tide. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5988c1621400002600ecf92b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this week, another story of a young person who died by suicide made headlines. As with the majority of articles covering youth suicides over the last decade, the story heavily focused on the role bullying may have played in precipitating the young girl’s death. While bullying could certainly have been a factor in this case (as an outside observer lacking all the facts, I can’t comment on this specific case), the same cannot be said about many incidents of youth suicide. Schools’ bullying prevention efforts are critically important. However, the continued narrative that youth suicide is caused by bullying may divert schools’ focus from solutions that would target more prevalent risk factors for suicide.From 2007 to 2014, rates of deaths due to suicide among children ages 10 to 14 more than doubled, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is consistent with a more recent study of children’s hospital admissions of children ages 5 to 17 from 2008 to 2015, which found a similar increase. However, over the same time period, rates of bullying for youth ages 12 to 18 significantly declined, from 32 percent in 2007 reporting having been bullied, to 21 percent in 2015. While comparing these two data trends cannot negate a connection between bullying and suicide—and indeed recent data show that youth who have been bullied report higher rates of suicidal ideation—it does suggest that many cases of youth suicide are not a result of bullying.An analysis of data for youth ages 11 to 15 from the National Violent Death Reporting System, which collects information from 18 states about all reported suicides including precipitating circumstances, found that in 2003 through 2014, only around 9 percent of cases specifically indicated that bullying was a factor leading to the suicide. The same number of cases reported school disciplinary problems (e.g., being suspended from school). However, over half the cases (56 percent) listed relationship issues, primarily with family or intimate dating partners, as a precipitating factor, and a similar percentage (52 percent) of youth were reported to have had mental health problems. The majority of youth suicides (60 percent) involved multiple precipitating factors.We cannot prevent all incidents of youth suicide by only focusing on bullying. Instead, we must target the many potential risk factors involved. For many schools, this might seem like a daunting task considering the variety of potential issues involved – from bullying to school discipline, to mental and physical health supports, to family engagement. These issues, however, are interconnected.By approaching suicide prevention holistically—the whole child—instead of focusing solely on a single risk factor such as bullying, we may be better able to stem the tide of youth suicide. Schools can help promote positive relationships between and among students and teachers. They can recognize the contribution of physical wellness to mental wellness. And, they can actively engage families with the school community. In doing so, schools will target many suicide risk factors at once and, by extension, create healthy, safe, nurturing environments where youth suicides may be less likely.

Williams while flying over Detroit, observing the lingering effects of the Detroit Rebellion of 1967. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5988accb1400002700ecf8c4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I saw the movie DETROIT at a private screening hosted by Reverend Al Sharpton in New York at the Tribeca Film Center last week. I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed its clear depiction of what that time period in Detroit looked like. I've seen pictures, read books, watched documentaries, but nothing I've ever seen gave me a clearer depiction of why our city seems to be riddled with blight and divestment. Now, more than ever, I realize that as I look at Detroit and its more than 80 percent African American population today, whether at the church I pastor or the community I reside in, the rebellion’s stench of smoldering businesses, decimated neighborhoods, and that Detroit resiliency that speaks through a t-shirt slogan: Detroit vs. Everybody, were all born from the 1967 rebellion.The movie was tough. And when I say tough, I mean that it hit pretty hard. The booms of the gun shots, the slap of the billy clubs, and the use of the language made you feel like you were standing there in the corner hoping that one of the officers didn’t call you out. For this exchange of great theatrics and acting, some I believe have wrongly criticized the movie because of their own inability to come to terms with the reasons why the movie had to be made. Too many, I believe, would like to bask in the glory of the shadow of Dan Gilbert’s downtown building revitalization and talk about the Detroit ”come back” while turning their heads from the nastiness of poverty and inequities that existed then and now. Many have a hard time coming to terms with the reality that the movie only gave a snapshot of what policing, housing, and the environment was like for blacks that led to the rebellion. It hit hard and snubbed those who want to believe that “the riot,” as they call it, was based off of some overly sensitive black folks who decided to tear up their own neighborhoods. Meanwhile, neglecting the fact that the film’s producer, a white woman, depicted the truth about why this happened. What more can you ask for? When we ask whites to confront racism in its purest, rawest, and vulgar form-- this movie did just that. For years I have heard whites and suburbanites talk about the rebellion as if it was some masochist movement that blacks inflicted upon themselves and nobody really knows why they were so violent. Well, let me be the one to say it if no one else does--thank you, Kathryn Bigelow for addressing racism head on and bringing the memories of that rebellion to life.Now, as I watched the movie, I saw striking parallels to 2017 and they most certainly set off alarms in my head when I begin to think about Detroit life. I’m not talking about the cool downtown/midtown hipsters Detroit, but the real Detroit dwellers. That don’t give a damn about your sensitive nature to violence.POVERTYThe movie talks about the poverty-laced communities of that time. Well, a Brooking Report released in 2016 speaks to the high numbers of poverty that Detroiters are faced with today, with more than 60 percent of Detroit children in poverty, and by some other accounts, up to 80 percent. If you don’t believe that violence is an outgrowth of poverty, just go anywhere in the world, and where you see poverty, you see violence. Some inflicted on others and some violence inflicted on themselves and their own communities.The Great MigrationI am a third generation Detroiter. My Great Grand Parents came from Desoto County, Mississippi. Now the story is pretty consistent with most blacks who live in the Midwest, and Northeast. Virginia, Georgia, Florida and Carolina Blacks moved up to DC, Philly, Newark, and New York. Blacks from Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Arkansas moved to Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Cleveland. Jobs were a great part of the migration. This led to most industrialists in the North employing folks for far better wages than the ridiculous price of share cropping. The South at the time of the great migration was maladapted to the abolishment of Jim Crow Laws and strange fruit hung from trees by the thousands. This of course drove many blacks from the South. But this journey, although not as tumultuous as the underground railroad, should not be understated simply because many who left the south didn't just want to leave but had to leave. Many left with warrants from local sheriffs for something as small as what caused an Emmitt Till’s death. It wasn't “let’s hop in the Uhaul and move to the north.” It was more like “grab what you got, we leaving now”. Like many in Detroit, this type of departure is the story of how I became a Detroiter. Understanding that story, would help you understand why someone would live in a house with one or two houses on the block and won’t leave no matter how bad some developer wants their home. Or no matter how much the city says that they cannot adequately provide public services to the area because there isn't enough population density. More than likely, generations have paid for and lived in that house, and let’s just be frank, some blacks have made up in their mind that they ain’t running no more. So the attitude that you found in many who were apart of this rebellion and live in today’s Detroit is a resiliency and toughness that intensely says “Hell No, We Won’t Go.”The National Tone: Black Lives MatterMichael Brown, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, and the list goes on and on. These names are those that if I go to any young person in the city and ask who they are, they can tell you which city and what happened. They also can also tell you that they did not get justice and they aren’t CNN, MSNBC, or FOX NEWS junkies. After the movie “Get Out” released there was a song that became a hit called “Stay Woke”. It moved from a song to a hash tag #staywoke. This term #staywoke says very clearly, be conscious. and not just be conscious but also be ready to act. This brings to mind a place in the movie when Congressman John Conyers was trying quell the crowd and one of the kids said “we need Stokely Carmicheal to come to Detroit”. Young people during the Detroit Rebellion were keenly aware of why they were protesting, looting and aggressing police and all of those reasons were not just about Detroit. In fact, Malcolm X, just a few years before ’67, gave “The Message to the Grassroots” speech as he was departing from the “white devil” philosophy that he held under the Honorable Elijah Muhammed. In this speech that was given at the church that I pastor currently, he did not mince words or shift on his philosophy of revolution which is wrapped in the words “By Any Means Necessary”. Sort of like how we have Black Lives Matter that has been non-violent, but has not minded interrupting the status quo and destabilizing the landscape in politics and culture.Then and NowRacial turmoil in the city of Detroit had been brewing, especially since the federal highway act of 1956 ran an expressway thru Black Bottom, killing a self-sufficient black community. However, by the time Mayor Jerome Cavanaugh came on the scene, the tolerance for police brutality, poverty conditions and racism had come to a boiling point. This was somewhat known throughout the community, but in traditional fashion, somehow the message continued to get muted. It has been said that when the mayor at that time, Mayor Cavanaugh, asked for advisement from the black leaders by whom he was surrounded, they usually sang a song that did more to quail the fears that something could or would happen than to sound the alarm. I say ‘traditional fashion’ because since the beginning of the black existence in this country, there have always been blacks that have sought to position themselves in a high place with white leadership by acting as if they have everything under control.The Message is in the MovieOverall, I would agree with others that there is so much to tell about what happened in that time period. However like most art forms, you have a limited canvas or time frame to tell the whole story, but the brevity should not discount the message. It’s like an album you have to listen to over and over again to appreciate, or a piece of art that you have sit and stare at for a while. Nevertheless it has a message—it can happen again. So #staywoke or if you are sleeping, you better catch what I believe to be one of the most important themes in the movie and #wakeup. "

His essay suggests that the company encourage ideological rather than gender diversity and argues that Silicon Valley is a meritocracy where brilliance alone should be enough to get ahead.This comes on the heels of a report highlighting the lack of diversity at Google. About 69 percent of its total workforce is male.The one thing he got right: The unnamed blogger is correct on one point ― that most diversity and unconscious bias training doesn’t work. The reason being is most make no effort to discuss why diversity is critical for white men. In fact, many diversity practitioners say that inclusion is the key, yet as an older white male, I rarely see myself talked about in diversity initiatives. In fact, you can look at Google’s free online Unconscious Bias training program, you see no reference to white men being mentioned. In a very simple manner, I have to ask myself ‘what’s in it for me?’ If a majority of your workforce is white men company programming and solutions need to integrate and involve them in diversity and inclusion initiatives.The three things he got wrong:1) Meritocracies:The belief that meritocracies work. The manifesto writer talks about the fact that meritocracies work. The problem is meritocracies are defined by the majority group, and thereby do not value diverse work-styles, whether they are made by other men, minorities or women. Additionally, we have all seen leaders who value results at the expense of long-term vision and strategy. While meritocracies may work for short-term projects, they are not long-term business strategies for success.2) Diversity and Inclusion: In fact, many men actually support diversity and inclusion. For diversity and unconscious bias training to be effective we must be able to talk about our differences and we must be able to talk about what is in this for the majority group, (typically white men in the organization). In my work to find and create male champions to advocate for advancing women, I have found it’s a combination of 75% business case and 25% personal connection. This personal connection piece is the most critical element to move people from merely understanding diversity to understanding and becoming an advocate.3) Unconscious Bias: Unconscious bias training must take a deep dive into cultural differences. An online course or even a program facilitated by the instructor without proper knowledge and expertise will not work. The reason unconscious bias training doesn’t work is that it doesn’t go deep enough. Companies today must offer unconscious bias sessions with deep dives into gender, race, age, and specifically white male culture.The one final key point:Social media is transforming what is going on in the workplace. Consider the Google engineer’s anti –diversity manifesto going viral, the blog written by a former Uber employee about sexual harassment and gender bias that brought down the CEO or allegations against FOX cable commentators prompting advertisers to pull away from shows. Senior leadership must be proactive, today, in being vigilantly visible and vocal supporters of diversity and inclusion. It is simply a matter of time before your company could be on the front page of USA Today.Jeffery Tobias Halter is a corporate gender strategist, the country’s leading expert on engaging men to advance women. Jeffery is the President of YWomen, a strategic consulting company and the author of two books, including WHY WOMEN: The Leadership Imperative to Advancing Women and Engaging Men."

Sign up for the newsletter.GREENVILLE, Miss. — In March, President Trump revealed his “skinny budget,” a rough sketch of the nascent administration’s fiscal priorities and objectives that included deep cuts to education and nutrition programs. Budget chief Mick Mulvaney defended the move. “[The programs] are supposed to help kids who don’t get fed at home so they do better in school,” Mulvaney said at a press conference on the day of the announcement. “Guess what? There’s no demonstrable evidence they’re actually doing that. There’s no demonstrable evidence they’re actually helping results, helping kids do better in school.”In Greenville, Mississippi, a town on the Blues Highway in the Mississippi Delta where every public school student receives free breakfast and lunch, Joan Rowe, director of the local Boys and Girls Club, heard that comment and immediately thought: “They should come down here.”Rowe and her colleagues across the Delta are watching with keen attention as the federal government aims to slash vital programs and relax school meal standards that have helped combat pervasive community health concerns and poor academic performance in one of the nation’s neediest states.The Trump administration’s proposed budget would nix the Greenville afterschool program and impose deep cuts in other areas that impact school meals and nutrition. The USDA, which administers numerous grants and programs that help feed needy children, is facing a budget cut of $4.7 billion, or 21 percent of its discretionary spending, while the Department of Education’s budget could fall by more than $9 billion. Even if Trump’s budget never passes, the administration has already put its stamp on school meals. Newly installed Department of Agriculture chief, Sonny Perdue, is rolling back school lunch nutrition standards.The moves befuddle researchers, who cite a growing body of evidence demonstrating that more meals for school children, and specifically more nutritious meals, benefit kids in a myriad of ways, not only in the short term, but throughout their lives. Recent studies indicate the impact of healthier meals is even greater on low-income children.Related: Report finds ‘significant’ decreases in state’s achievement gap“I think there is a disconnect between the policy makers and the reality in many places,” said Michele Leardo, assistant director of the Institute for Education and Social Policy at New York University. “They haven’t experienced what it’s like to go home and not get a meal. Some of these students are getting all three meals of the day at school — free breakfast, free lunch and an afterschool meal. I think they are out of touch with what these kids face, and how vital these programs really are.”Many communities in the Mississippi Delta have better access to casinos, convenience stores and fast food than to grocery stores selling fresh fruits and vegetables. Sherry Jackson, who runs federal programs for the Greenville School District in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, views the proposed cuts with dismay. “[They] make me feel sick to my stomach,” she said.“There is nowhere else for parents to turn; we are the safety net,” she added.In Greenville, the people stitching that net together are loath to imagine what will happen if holes develop.On a humid Wednesday afternoon in April, children wearing khaki pants and polo shirts color-coded to their grade level trickled into the Boys and Girls Club of Greenville, one of five sites for Greenville’s 21st Century Community Learning Centers, an afterschool program. The center faces closure if the Trump budget passes.Inside, tutor Louise Cox helped a group of 16 elementary and middle school students with their homework and ran them through math and language exercises. In another room, an instructor directed high school students in computer and career placement lessons. A forest green pennant from Delta State University, a school in nearby Cleveland, was tacked to the wall alongside motivational posters, alphabet charts and multiplication tables. Rowe, the director, who was born and raised in Greenville, repeatedly reminds the children how important it is to graduate high school and move on to college, just as she did.Rowe would also like to offer a lesson to the federal budget experts like Mulvaney. “I’d tell them to come out here and see what the children are faced with,” Rowe said “Not everyone is privileged. I remember I walked the kids over to the bank a while back to give them a lesson on banking. We walked in and the kids were amazed by the elevator — they’d never seen one before.”Mississippi’s graduation rates and test scores have lagged behind the national average for years, but recently started to catch up. The four-year graduation rate was up to 82 percent in 2016, an improvement from 74 percent in 2012 and close to the national average of 83 percent. But in Greenville, where about 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, the high school graduation rate is just 62 percent, one of the lowest in the state.Greenville was once a prosperous and progressive city, but industry, including barge building and factory work, has slowly abandoned the area. Today the population is roughly 32,000, down from a high of 45,000 in 1990. The school district is shrinking with the community, and funding continues to decline. The district, held up as a model of integration when it became the first in the state to desegregate back in the 1960s, has become largely segregated again, with black children in public schools and white children in private ones. Today, 94 percent of Greenville’s public school students live in poverty.Related: How does Mississippi really compare when it comes to graduation rates?“A lot of them are latchkey kids. They eat a lot of fast food and some of their parents don’t cook at all,” said Patricia Allen, nutrition director for Greenville School District. “It’s not like when I was a kid and you were taught how to cook, and maybe had fried chicken once a week as a treat. There is nobody at home for them. Nobody is providing food for them, period. They look forward to coming to school to get that meal. I see a lot of children that I’m sure are not getting the proper nutrition at home.”Good nutrition is vital for kids, who have a high metabolic rate and are growing. The effects of hunger and malnutrition go far beyond a grumbling stomach and daydreams of pepperoni pizza during algebra class, potentially causing lasting physiological damage and reduced brain development. Low levels of iron and long-term food insecurity are linked to cognitive delays. When blood glucose levels are low, adrenalin, cortisol and other hormones are released, leading to feelings of agitation and irritability. When a child is hungry the body prioritizes vital needs, dedicating scarce calories to organ function and growth. Hunger in school children is linked to an inability to focus, lower grades, higher rates of absenteeism, and often leads to grade repetition.An array of new research has reinforced previous studies showing school meals have a profound impact on students’ academic outcomes, attendance, and overall health. Initiatives that help the most needy, either through direct financial means or programs like free school lunch, have benefits that last decades — boosting income, health and other life outcomes. The federally funded 21st Century Community Learning Centers is one such program, offering academic help and an evening meal to mostly low-income children enrolled in underperforming schools. Under the president’s proposed 2018 budget, the program, which currently serves 1.8 million children through a $1.1 billion federal grant, would be eliminated.Annual reports from the U.S. Department of Education have consistently found 21st Century improves grades, test scores, class participation and student behavior.“The data and performance indicate that this broad-reaching program touches students’ lives in ways that will have far reaching impact,” report author Sylvia Lyles, director of the USED’s Office of Academic Improvement, concluded in the 2016 report.During the 2014-15 school year, approximately half the students who regularly attend the 21st Century program improved their math and English grades. In Mississippi, more than one third of program participants increased their math and reading assessment scores, according to the report.While the USED study did not compare 21st Century participants to those not enrolled in the program, a 2013 Texas study did. That report found significant benefits, particularly for high school students: After school participation was associated with higher test scores, and led to much higher rates of grade level progression for students in grades nine to 12. Middle school students enrolled in the program missed fewer days of school and had fewer disciplinary incidents.In Greenville, after the homework session with Cox, the kids slurped up spaghetti and meatballs and a fruit cup around 5:30 p.m. Then they ran outside for recess while they waited for their evening pickup. Rowe and the Greenville Boys and Girls staff feed, tutor and provide recreation for 50 students.Brenda Birkhead is one parent who leans on Rowe and the 21st Century Program. The single mother of 10-year-old LaNiya Birkhead, a fourth grader at Greenville’s Weddington Elementary School, works at a local clothing store.“The 21st Century program really boosts the children,” she said. “I know my daughter is safe. I know when I pick her up she has been fed dinner, she’s had some exercise, and her homework is done.”Related: Chronic absences, poverty impacting outcomes for Mississippi’s children, report saysBirkhead makes $8.50 an hour, slightly above the federal hourly minimum wage of $7.25. Mississippi has no state minimum wage. She works more than 30 hours per week, and often has to close the store at 8 p.m. and work weekend shifts.“Without the Boys and Girls Club and programs like 21st Century, my back would be up against the wall,” she said.Up the road in Cleveland, Mississippi, Shenika Maiden carefully observed the lunch time assembly line at Bell Academy, inspecting for waste and other inefficiencies. The nutrition and food services director for Cleveland School District, Maiden has overseen the recent evolution in the district’s school lunches. In single file, children grab their trays, choose between a banana and a fruit cup, and then receive green beans, mashed potatoes with gravy, a whole wheat roll, and hamburger steak.“Shhhhhh. Listen. You hear that?” she asks. “They’re not talking. They’re not playing around. That means they’re eating.”It’s a reassuring sound. Since the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act went into effect in 2012 with new nutrition standards for school meals, Maiden has been working to cut sodium and fried foods, and add whole grains, fruits and vegetables to the lunch trays.Less than 10 years ago Bell Academy, an elementary school, was failing and facing a state takeover. In 2010, it was completely revamped with a new magnet math, science and health curriculum, a direct response to rising childhood obesity rates. Recently, the school has been getting B’s and C’s on its state report cards. Principal Sonya Swafford says the magnet program, particularly the health portion, which is backed by a patchwork of federal grants, has brought the school a sense of purpose and community. “It’s given us our own little limelight,” she said.“In general, nutrition in the community is poor. There are high rates of poverty in the Delta, and many of our families receive SNAP benefits,” Maiden said, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. “It’s a big issue. Many of the people who get SNAP buy the cheapest food items, junk food ... hot dogs.”Related: Are Mississippi’s students prepared for college?In the Mississippi Delta, where many of the communities have little access to affordable, fresh ingredients, the school meal program serves multiple purposes. Children who do not get enough nutrition at home get the food they need to learn and thrive, but the hope is that teaching healthy eating habits will also reverse a troubling trend. Mississippi has one of the highest childhood obesity rates in the country, with almost 40 percent of the state’s children considered obese or overweight.“Change was necessary. Maybe Michelle Obama went a little far with it, and it was a lot at one time, but it was needed.” Maiden said, referring to the former first lady’s championing of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. “Now we’re seeing a big jump in the quality of school meals. These children will be healthier in the future, if we continue the course. If they get used to eating this way at a young age, they’ll make that choice on their own when they’re older.”The standards required by the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act were recently dialed back by new USDA director Sonny Perdue, who referenced the need to add flexibility and reduce food waste.“This announcement is the result of years of feedback from students, schools, and food service experts about the challenges they are facing in meeting the final regulations for school meals,” Perdue stated when he announced the change in May. “If kids aren’t eating the food, and it’s ending up in the trash, they aren’t getting any nutrition — thus undermining the intent of the program.”After the implementation of the new rules, some states complained of waste and declining school lunch participation, but those figures have since rebounded. A 2016 Journal of the American Medical Association study assessing the Healthy Hungry-Free Kids Act found the new standards significantly improved meal quality in school cafeterias and had only a negligible impact on participation.The nation’s public schools feed a lot of children — 30 million — and companies are willing to meet their needs. “The manufacturers have been great. Schools buy a lot of food, so they’ll accommodate us,” Maiden said.Since the school meal standards went into effect, there have been significant increases in the amount of fruits and vegetables children are eating, coupled with an increase in fiber consumption and reductions in sodium and saturated fat intake, the JAMA study found. Another study, showed the percentage of calories from saturated fat in the average lunch fell from 9 percent to 6 percent after the changes.“There’s definitely a lot of variance, but since 2012 the average nutritional floor of school lunches has moved up,” said Michael Anderson, an associate professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of a recent study on nutrition in school lunches.Kids can still find junk food at school, but it comes with more limitations and alternative ingredients. Some schools are installing filtered, cooled water fountains and turning off soda machines until after the school day. Snacks at Bell Academy, available for an extra 50 cents, included whole grain brown rice crispy treats or reduced-fat Doritos. Next year, the district is partnering with Pizza Hut, which is using a new school-approved recipe incorporating low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust.Although the new standards have shown results, making nutritious meals that the children will eat, while also staying on budget, remains a challenge. The same study that lauded the lower levels of saturated fat and sodium raised concerns regarding lower amounts of calcium and Vitamin C.“The hope is kids will take the [health] information home and share it with their families,” said Leardo, of NYU’s Institute for Education and Social Policy. “There are a lot of needy families that aren’t exposed to the best options and information for healthy eating. They live near bodegas and fast food restaurants, and don’t have easy access in their communities to healthy ingredients.”Five years into the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, research shows kids at schools serving more nutritious meals are doing better academically. Anderson’s study found the California schools with healthier school lunches scored, on average, four percent higher on standardized tests. Also, the poorest students saw the most impact, with academic gains 40 percent higher for those who qualify for free and reduced-price lunches. The study determined healthier meals cost approximately $80 more per year per student; to achieve similar testing improvements through reducing class sizes by hiring more teachers would cost five times as much.“As an education policymaker you have multiple levers you can pull to improve performance,” Anderson said. “If you’re looking for the most return for dollars spent, school meals is a good place to start.”Sherry Jackson, the Greenville director for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers and other federal programs, has already had a glimpse of what would happen under the proposed cuts. During the 2016-17 school year the district lost nearly half its after school sites, representing spots for 250 children, due to a state accounting error that forced Mississippi to severely curtail participation in the program.“I had parents calling me frantic, in tears,” Jackson said. “They had nowhere else to turn, and were very worried about what they would do. I think they felt punched in the gut after seeing their kids thrive in the program.”It is communities like Greenville, with very few local resources to fall back on, that will see the deepest impact from any changes. “If it closes, I don’t know what I would do,” said Brenda Birkhead, LaNiya’s mom. “It would be devastating.”"

In 2010, it was completely revamped with a new magnet math, science and health curriculum, a direct response to rising childhood obesity rates. Recently, the school has been getting B’s and C’s on its state report cards. Principal Sonya Swafford says the magnet program, particularly the health portion, which is backed by a patchwork of federal grants, has brought the school a sense of purpose and community. “It’s given us our own little limelight,” she said.“In general, nutrition in the community is poor. There are high rates of poverty in the Delta, and many of our families receive SNAP benefits,” Maiden said, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. “It’s a big issue. Many of the people who get SNAP buy the cheapest food items, junk food ... hot dogs.”Related: Are Mississippi’s students prepared for college?In the Mississippi Delta, where many of the communities have little access to affordable, fresh ingredients, the school meal program serves multiple purposes. Children who do not get enough nutrition at home get the food they need to learn and thrive, but the hope is that teaching healthy eating habits will also reverse a troubling trend. Mississippi has one of the highest childhood obesity rates in the country, with almost 40 percent of the state’s children considered obese or overweight.“Change was necessary. Maybe Michelle Obama went a little far with it, and it was a lot at one time, but it was needed.” Maiden said, referring to the former first lady’s championing of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act. “Now we’re seeing a big jump in the quality of school meals. These children will be healthier in the future, if we continue the course. If they get used to eating this way at a young age, they’ll make that choice on their own when they’re older.”The standards required by the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act were recently dialed back by new USDA director Sonny Perdue, who referenced the need to add flexibility and reduce food waste.“This announcement is the result of years of feedback from students, schools, and food service experts about the challenges they are facing in meeting the final regulations for school meals,” Perdue stated when he announced the change in May. “If kids aren’t eating the food, and it’s ending up in the trash, they aren’t getting any nutrition — thus undermining the intent of the program.”After the implementation of the new rules, some states complained of waste and declining school lunch participation, but those figures have since rebounded. A 2016 Journal of the American Medical Association study assessing the Healthy Hungry-Free Kids Act found the new standards significantly improved meal quality in school cafeterias and had only a negligible impact on participation.The nation’s public schools feed a lot of children — 30 million — and companies are willing to meet their needs. “The manufacturers have been great. Schools buy a lot of food, so they’ll accommodate us,” Maiden said.Since the school meal standards went into effect, there have been significant increases in the amount of fruits and vegetables children are eating, coupled with an increase in fiber consumption and reductions in sodium and saturated fat intake, the JAMA study found. Another study, showed the percentage of calories from saturated fat in the average lunch fell from 9 percent to 6 percent after the changes.“There’s definitely a lot of variance, but since 2012 the average nutritional floor of school lunches has moved up,” said Michael Anderson, an associate professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of a recent study on nutrition in school lunches.Kids can still find junk food at school, but it comes with more limitations and alternative ingredients. Some schools are installing filtered, cooled water fountains and turning off soda machines until after the school day. Snacks at Bell Academy, available for an extra 50 cents, included whole grain brown rice crispy treats or reduced-fat Doritos. Next year, the district is partnering with Pizza Hut, which is using a new school-approved recipe incorporating low-fat cheese and a whole wheat crust.Although the new standards have shown results, making nutritious meals that the children will eat, while also staying on budget, remains a challenge. The same study that lauded the lower levels of saturated fat and sodium raised concerns regarding lower amounts of calcium and Vitamin C.“The hope is kids will take the [health] information home and share it with their families,” said Leardo, of NYU’s Institute for Education and Social Policy. “There are a lot of needy families that aren’t exposed to the best options and information for healthy eating. They live near bodegas and fast food restaurants, and don’t have easy access in their communities to healthy ingredients.”Five years into the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, research shows kids at schools serving more nutritious meals are doing better academically. Anderson’s study found the California schools with healthier school lunches scored, on average, four percent higher on standardized tests. Also, the poorest students saw the most impact, with academic gains 40 percent higher for those who qualify for free and reduced-price lunches. The study determined healthier meals cost approximately $80 more per year per student; to achieve similar testing improvements through reducing class sizes by hiring more teachers would cost five times as much.“As an education policymaker you have multiple levers you can pull to improve performance,” Anderson said. “If you’re looking for the most return for dollars spent, school meals is a good place to start.”Sherry Jackson, the Greenville director for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers and other federal programs, has already had a glimpse of what would happen under the proposed cuts. During the 2016-17 school year the district lost nearly half its after school sites, representing spots for 250 children, due to a state accounting error that forced Mississippi to severely curtail participation in the program.“I had parents calling me frantic, in tears,” Jackson said. “They had nowhere else to turn, and were very worried about what they would do. I think they felt punched in the gut after seeing their kids thrive in the program.”It is communities like Greenville, with very few local resources to fall back on, that will see the deepest impact from any changes. “If it closes, I don’t know what I would do,” said Brenda Birkhead, LaNiya’s mom. “It would be devastating.”"

Another man, in a red baseball cap and sunglasses, shoots the shark twice and appears to laugh.Russ Rector, an animal activist, told The Bradenton Herald that he was given the footage by the person who shot it. He was told that it was filmed off of Siesta Key, Florida, where MTV’s new reality show “Siesta Key” is based, and where hammerheads are protected.Animal activists claim the shooter is Alex Kompothecras, a cast member on “Siesta Key,” according to CBS News.Photos on social media ― including on Facebook pages for “Siesta Key” and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission ― show a man who resembles Kompothecras, wearing a red cap and sunglasses and posing with a bloody hammerhead shark. The photos appear to be screen shots taken from Kompothecras’ Instagram account.Kompothecras on Friday admitted to People that there were some upsetting photos of him posing with wildlife on his Instagram account. Those photos have been deleted.“There are images of me and I feel horrible,” he told People. “I am embarrassed and it won’t happen again.”Kompothecras did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Kompothecras was previously criticized after being linked to several men who are suspected of violently dragging a shark behind a speedboat, the Miami Herald reported last week. Kompothecras said that he was friends with one of the men in that video but did not “agree with what he did.” MTV subsequently canceled a “Siesta Key” screening party after protesters threatened to demonstrate outside.A “Boycott Siesta Key MTV” Facebook page had accrued more than 13,500 followers as of Monday afternoon ― about 2,000 more followers than the Facebook page of the show itself.An MTV spokesperson told HuffPost that Kompothecras was not involved in the shark-dragging video, but declined to comment on the shark-shooting video and Kompothecras’ suspected involvement.The spokesperson expressed hope that threats being “unfairly made” against Kompothecras, as well as the other “Siesta Key” cast members, stop.A spokesman for the Florida FWCC told HuffPost that the agency is investigating the shark-shooting video, along with other reported instances of abuse ― including the shark-dragging incident and a video of a man funneling beer through a hammerhead shark’s gills and into a person’s mouth.The spokesman added that shooting or using explosives or chemicals to kill or harvest marine life is illegal in state waters."

Critics mostly panned the movie, leading to its current 18 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.Meanwhile, Annapurna’s “Detroit” is not faring as well as expected. Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal’s latest collaboration should end up with $7.3 million from 3,007 locations this weekend. Combined with a week of limited release grosses, its total should stand at $7.8 million. An awards-season push could end up helping its bottom line. So far, critics are on board, earning the tale of the Motor City’s 1967 riots a 96 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie is toplined by “Star Wars” breakout John Boyega, as well as Will Poulter, and Algee Smith.That leaves “Kidnap” ― from David Dinerstein’s recently-launched Aviron, and Lotus ― which is racing to $10.2 million from 2,378 locations. The movie stars Halle Berry as a mother attempting to rescue her son after he is taken. Aviron acquired the film from a bankrupt Relativity, but the distributor declined to release the thriller’s acquisition cost, making it difficult to judge its performance.“Dunkirk,” the box office winner the past two weekends, is sliding comfortably into second with $17.6 million from 4,014 locations. Christopher Nolan’s World War II movie crossed the $300 million mark on Saturday, and by the end of the weekend should tally a $133.6 million domestic total. This weekend it looks to make about $4 million from Imax screens alone, which will count for $29.8 million of the movie’s domestic grosses. Warner Bros. also continues to see profits from “Wonder Woman,” which will land right up against the $400 million domestic milestone by the end of this weekend.In limited release, TWC’s “Wind River” should make $164,167 from four locations. The film stars Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen, and marks Taylor Sheridan’s directorial debut. Sheridan conceived the movie as part of a loose trilogy that also includes two recent releases that he wrote, but did not direct, “Sicario” and “Hell or High Water.”All this on the calendar spot that last year’s “Suicide Squad” bucked conventional release date wisdom with a record-breaking $133.7 million domestic opening. This summer has lagged overall due to a number of big-budget movies flopping or underperforming, and this latest showing will only put the business farther behind."

So her admission on Sunday that Trump’s approval rating needed improvement was an unusual deviation for the president’s counselor.Conway told ABC’s “This Week” that Trump’s “approval rating among Republicans, conservatives and Trump voters is down slightly. It needs to go up.”She added that voters were urging Trump to focus on fulfilling his campaign promises rather than worrying about a squabbling Congress. “They are telling him just enact your program,” Conway said. “Don’t worry about a Congress that isn’t supporting legislation to get big-ticket items done. And don’t worry about all the distractions, diversions and discouragement that others who are still trying to throw logs in your path are throwing your way. Focus on the agenda and he’s doing that. Nobody can deny these economic numbers.”According to a HuffPost Pollster aggregate of publicly available surveys, Trump’s average approval rating plummeted to a new low of less than 38 percent last week despite a positive economic outlook for the country. More than 58 percent said they disapproved of the way Trump was doing his job."

Monday, in fact, is his 44th day at one of his golf courses ― meaning Trump has spent nearly one of every four days of his presidency thus far at his clubs in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.Whatever the rationale for the secrecy, it has left his press staff to repeatedly refuse to confirm that Trump is partaking in a golf-related activity even as the paying members of his clubs post photos online of Trump doing exactly that.On Saturday, for example, as he began a two-and-a-half-week stay at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump tweeted, “This is not a vacation - meetings and calls!”But that same day, a visitor to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster took a video showing the president wearing golf clothes in front of some golf carts.“I suspect it’s because the staff doesn’t know,” said Ari Fleischer, a press secretary to then-President George W. Bush, of the Trump press office’s golf quandary. “I bet Trump doesn’t tell them.”The Trump White House also refuses to disclose his golf partners, something that staffers for presidents Bush and Barack Obama typically did. So if a golf partner has hours with Trump to lobby for or against a particular regulation or policy proposal, the public won’t know.“Obviously it would be far more transparent if they said who he’s playing golf with,” said Mack Mackowiak, a GOP consultant from Texas.Trump may be attempting to keep his golfing secret because of how often and savagely he attacked Obama for hitting the links, Mackowiak noted. On Aug. 11, 2015, for example, Trump tweeted, “@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha’s Vineyard. Nice work ethic.”While campaigning, Trump promised voters he would be too busy for vacations or golf. “I’m going to be working for you. I’m not going to have time to go play golf,” he said on Aug. 8, 2016, in Virginia.“The more they admit that he’s doing it [golfing], the more they play into that line of attack,” Mackowiak said.As it happens, Trump is on track to spend far more time at golf courses than his predecessor did. It took Obama until August 2010 ― a year and a half into his presidency ― before he had reached 44 golf course visits, the mark Trump hit Monday. At this point in Obama’s first term, he had a total of 11 golf course visits.What’s more, Obama’s weekend golf was typically played at the course at Joint Base Andrews a few miles outside Washington, D.C. The location on a military installation made security easier, and it was only a short motorcade ride from the White House.Trump’s golf habit has been dramatically more expensive for Americans because he has often traveled to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida ― which is close to two Trump golf clubs ― and, in the late spring and summer, to his course in Bedminster. Both trips involve flights aboard Air Force One. In the case of Palm Beach, the plane used is a modified Boeing 747 that costs taxpayers $228,000 per flight hour.Those costs notwithstanding, Kasich aide Weaver suggested there is an underappreciated upside to Trump’s golfing: It subtracts from time he would otherwise be making poor decisions.“I actually think it would help the country if he played golf every day,” Weaver said. “I think the republic would be better off. So we should encourage that.”"

86,CRIME,Weekend Sailing Trip Leaves 3 Texas Boy Scouts Dead,Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boy-scouts-sailing-electrocuted_us_59885e74e4b0cb15b1bf9a9f,"The boat may have hit a power line stretching across the lake, electrocuting the Scouts.",2017-08-07,Power lines stretch across an East Texas lake where the three Boy Scouts were sailing.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598872402200002d001a4bfc.png?cache=GFup7K8N67&ops=crop_0_3_1843_1009%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Authorities say they are investigating a fatal boating accident in East Texas that killed three Boy Scouts. Members of Troop 620 in Hallsville were out on the water of Lake O’ the Pines on Saturday when their catamaran sailboat collided with an overhead transmission power line, possibly electrocuting those on board, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said in a release.Game wardens, responding just before 2 p.m., reported finding the boat’s sails in flames, the department said.The wardens discovered the bodies of an 18-year-old and 16-year-old, both Eagle Scouts, in the boat and surrounding water. An 11-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital in critical condition died Monday. Good Samaritans found the youngest victim and performed CPR on him in a nearby boat. All three boys were wearing life vests, authorities said.Though authorities have yet to publicly identify the victims, one of the teens was the son of the troop’s scoutmaster and the other was the son of the troop’s assistant scoutmaster, the Longview News-Journal reported.“You’re talking about great young men, men of integrity,” Hallsville Independent School District Band Director Sherri Morgan told a crowd that gathered for a vigil on Sunday night, according to the News-Journal. “We’re heartbroken, we’re devastated.”Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s statewide boating accident reconstruction and mapping team is investigating the accident.Video taken at the scene by local station KETK shows power lines stretching across the lake, from one shore to another. Upshur Rural Electric, which supplies power to the lake, was reportedly investigating a low-hanging line on Sunday.“We are working to determine what happened, and we are gathering facts as they become available,” company spokesman Rob Walker said in a statement obtained by KETK. “We are cooperating in the investigation and will assist in the process as it goes forward.”"
