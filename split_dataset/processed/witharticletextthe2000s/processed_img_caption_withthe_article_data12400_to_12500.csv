0,POLITICS,Study Shows Federal Prison Population Dropped 13 Percent Over 4 Years,"Christopher Zoukis, ContributorAuthor and Prisoners' Rights Advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sentencing-project-study-federal-prison-population_us_5953e5dfe4b0f078efd986b3,"A new analysis released by the nonprofit Sentencing Project is a classic case of good news and bad news. On one hand, it",2017-06-28,"<p>The Federal Bureau of Prison housed 13% fewer inmates at the end of 2016 than it did in its peak year of 2013, but the trend is unlikely to continue under the Trump administration. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5953e84c15000025009008c4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new analysis released by the nonprofit Sentencing Project is a classic case of good news and bad news.On one hand, it finds a widespread trend toward lower incarceration levels: the combined state and federal total number of inmates has declined by 4.9 percent since hitting its peak in 2009, and the Federal Bureau of Prison housed 13 percent fewer inmates at the end of 2016 than it did in its peak year of 2013.The report attributes the decline to several factors, among them sentencing reform by Congress in such areas as the retroactive reduction of disproportionately harsh sentences for crack cocaine as compared with powder cocaine; similar changes by the U.S. Sentencing Commission in federal sentencing guidelines; and Department of Justice directives cutting back on the share of drug cases bringing mandatory minimum sentences.Despite the reduction in the federal prison population – the average annual decline of 12.5 percent between 2013 and 2016 was double the rate by which total state incarceration fell – it was not accompanied by any increase threat to public safety. In fact, violent crime rates now stand at nearly 40-year lows.But at the same time, the group says, policy changes being pushed by the new team at the Department of Justice and by some on Capitol Hill could cause those numbers to increase. The report, Federal Prisons at a Crossroads, cautions that policy changes being pushed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions and some members of Congress threaten to reverse recent progress in trimming the federal prison population. In fact, it notes in an aside, DOJ’s budget request for 2018 foresees a 2 percent hike in the number of federal inmates.Specifically, the report points to the directive sent by the Attorney General to all federal prosecutors stressing the need to make greater use of mandatory minimum sentences even for minor-level drug offenders. It also views with alarm Sessions’ support for increased prosecution of immigration offenses and his policy shift away from the Obama administration’s decision to phase out the use of privately-run prisons for federal offenders. The Sentencing Project further warns against varied proposals in Congress to create new—or expand existing—mandatory minimum sentences.A large part of the problem, the report says, lies in what it sees as the federal prison system’s overemphasis on stiff sentences for drug offenses, regardless of the level of threat inmates actually pose. It notes 11.3 years is the average prison term for federal inmates convicted on drug offenses, even though almost half (48 percent) of those sent to federal prisons on drug charges in 2009 were no higher than street dealers.For those sentenced on federal drug offenses last year, a weapon played no part in 82 percent of the cases. Fully half of those drawing a federal sentence for drug offenses last year had little or no previous criminal history.The report contrasts the federal prison system with those in the states, noting the federal system alone imprisons large numbers for non-violent convictions. Even so, it argues, increased incarceration and longer sentence terms will impose substantial human and government costs, without bringing a significant improvement in public safety.Christopher Zoukis is the author of Federal Prison Handbook: The Definitive Guide to Surviving the Federal Bureau of Prisons, College for Convicts: The Case for Higher Education in American Prisons (McFarland & Co., 2014) and Prison Education Guide (Prison Legal News Publishing, 2016).

According to the National Science Foundation, women are more under-represented in computer science than in any other scientific field. Only 18 percent of the bachelor’s degrees in computer science were awarded to women in 2014, up slightly from the previous year but down from 37 percent in 1985. And in the workplace, only 24 percent of the country’s computer scientists are women, according to the National Science Foundation.Technovation is sponsored by a Los Angeles nonprofit and backed by the United Nations, Peace Corps and several tech companies. But the girls’ apps aren’t intended to make them the next generation of tech millionaires; they’re meant to improve the quality of life in their communities.The apps, based on simple coding language and completed in just a few months, address some of the world’s most urgent problems: clean drinking water in the developing world, environmental degradation, access to health care, education for women, poverty and other issues. Previous years’ winning apps have matched disabled people in India with jobs, taught women in Afghanistan to drive, provided a video platform for refugees to tell their stories to the world, and alerted drivers if they were too close to a bicyclist, among other innovations.“Sometimes it takes a 12-year-old girl to see what’s cool,” said Tara Chklovski, chief executive of Iridescent, the nonprofit that oversees Technovation. “These girls are so ahead of their time, it’s very inspiring.”TechBridge, Girls in Tech, Girls Who Code and the Girl Scouts are among the other organizations that offer after-school and summer tech classes for girls, with hopes of increasing girls’ interest and confidence in the field.

Most of the camps and classes are free.Extracurricular STEM — science, technology, engineering and math — programs for girls have been shown to be effective at increasing the number of females in math and science, and improving girls' achievement levels generally, said Laura Adolfie, chair of the Florida STEM chapter of the American Association of University Women and a former director of the U.S. Department of Defense STEM development office. Even if the girls choose not to pursue math or science in college, the skills and self-confidence can help them excel in other fields, she said.

For starters, there should be more of these camps, enough so every girl who's interested can attend, she said.

""If we do more work on the front end, when girls are very young, maybe we won't need to do as much later.""Chklovski, an India native who studied aerospace engineering at the University of Southern California, started Iridescent 12 years ago to change the way girls around the world perceive technology. Iridescent runs the Technovation competition as well as another program called Curiosity Machine, a K-12 engineering curriculum for schools and clubs. Combined, the programs have served 63,000 students and their families and trained 3,500 volunteer mentors since 2010.“When I came to this country, I couldn’t believe I’d hear so many girls say, proudly, ‘I don’t like math, I’m not good at math,” she said. “Technology is the great equalizer, right? I thought that by improving girls’ computer and entrepreneur skills and the way they view technology, we could really have a big impact globally.”Technovation is based loosely on the Girl Scouts model. Girls — ranging in age from 10 to 18 — meet after school, usually on campus, with a volunteer female mentor who’s either a mom, a teacher or local tech worker. Technovation provides online training for the mentors, so they can help even if they don’t have a tech background.Technovation also provides a 100-hour coding curriculum. Working in teams of five, the girls are tasked with creating an app that addresses one of the United Nation’s sustainable development goals, such as education, equality, health or environment.The girls also create business plans to accompany their apps, which include customer surveys, revenue models, competition research and brand development.In the spring, the teams have a chance to show off their apps and pitch their business plans at regional conferences held throughout the world. Judges are women investors, computer engineers and other workers from the tech sector.Of the thousands who enter, 12 teams are chosen for the final round. Technovation pays for the girls and their chaperones to visit the Bay Area for the week, tour tech companies, meet women computer engineers and entrepreneurs and, of course, socialize with each other.The girls come from almost every continent. Last year’s finalists hailed from Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, Cameroon, Canada, India and the United States.“What this program changed for me is that before, I didn’t know how to code,” said Flora, a girl from Cameroon, on a video posted on the Technovation website. “And now I know how to code.

Now, oh my gosh, I can actually build projects on my own.”It’s not unusual for investors to want to purchase the girls’ apps, or for the girls to want to see their apps used on a widespread scale, Chklovski said. But apps take a certain amount of time, energy and skill to maintain and market, which can be a challenge for girls still in school.“We’re still looking at the best way to move forward about the future of these apps. Money — and time — can be a tricky thing to handle, especially for children,” she said. “Right now it’s a gray zone.”Currently, the apps are not available for purchase, although that could change, she said.But Technovation has seen impacts in other ways. Twenty-six percent of alumnae have gone on to major in computer science in college, and 58 percent have taken at least one computer science class. Nearly all said they have an increased interest in business, leadership and technology.But the more important impacts might be subtler, Chklovski said. Educating women, especially in developing countries, can decrease poverty, improve community health, lower the rate of child marriage and overpopulation, and generally improve a community’s overall stability, according to the World Bank and United Nations.“If you’re wondering what we should invest in, it’s women,” Chklovski said. “If you educate a woman, the whole community benefits.”This story originally appeared on EdSource"

3,POLITICS,There's No Consensus On 'Sensible' Gun Policies,"Mike Weisser, ContributorMike the Gun Guy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theres-no-consensus-on-sensible-gun-policies_us_5953f3fee4b02734df2f7c39,A new Pew report on guns simply tells advocates what they want to hear.,2017-06-28,"An AR-15 sits on a display case as Willy Ludlow, owner of the ""Ready Gunner"" gun store, talks on the phone in Provo, Utah, U.S., June 21, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5953f7e11500004b1f90092e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week I posted a column on the new Pew gun report that was exceedingly polite. I spent the weekend thinking about the report, re-reading every word of it twice more and now I am withdrawing my previous column because I cannot, in good conscience, say anything positive about what Pew has produced. In fact, the report is incorrect in many of its assumptions, and as a guide to developing gun violence prevention (GVP) messaging, it’s basically a useless document that should be discounted or ignored.But it won’t be ignored because when Pew speaks about how Americans think about guns, what they say is what people who want to reduce gun violence are hoping to hear, namely, that many if not most gun owners out there are willing to support all those sensible, responsible solutions that the GVP community believes will sooner or later be implemented and finally begin to work. So, for example, gun owners and non-gun owners appear to be in agreement over ‘preventing the mentally ill from purchasing guns;’ ‘background checks for private sales and at gun shows;’ and ‘barring gun purchases by people on no-fly or watch lists.’ One of the major gun-control organizations reacted to these findings by issuing a press release which said: “New Pew Research Provides Further Evidence that Gun Owners Support Solutions to Make Gun Laws Safer.” So that takes care of that.But what Pew reported doesn’t take care of anything at all. And the reason it doesn’t is that the proposals which had virtual agreement between the two sides were then followed by several other proposals, including expanding gun-free zones and ‘constitutional’ (non-license) carry, where the gap between gun owners and non-gun owners was 20 points or even more. In and of itself these results aren’t surprising, we have seen them in survey after survey over the years. What is surprising is that Pew would lump all the ‘gun proposals’ together, as if they have anything to do with each other at all. And in fact, they don’t. The proposals which gain the greatest support from non-gun owners are all crafted to keep guns from getting into the ‘wrong hands,’ which are watchwords for the GVP community because, after all, you can’t say (out loud) that you don’t want guns in anyone’s hands. On the other hand, the gun proposals which show a significant opinion gap between the two sides have nothing to do with reducing gun violence, they simply promote the idea that Americans should own more, not less guns.If you honestly believe there’s some kind of trade-off between these proposals – we’ll trade you a CCW for a background check – you’re smoking dope. There’s simply no way that anyone who gives a hoot about 2nd-Amendment “rights” is going to line up in favor of expanded background checks when the NRA tells them that such a proposal is a “slippery slope.” Know what it means when a gun owner tells someone over the telephone that they favor keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill? It means they said something over the phone. That’s it.I have sold guns to over 7,000 people in my retail store. I never heard a single customer ever tell me he was happy to be filling out a 4473 background check form. And if GVP doesn’t stop trying to develop messaging based on some questions about “sensible” gun solutions that are considered sensible only by the GVP, all the Pew polling won’t change the ultimate result one bit. Want to find out what gun owners really believe will reduce gun violence? Tell your friends at Pew to ask gun owners how they feel about mandatory prison sentences for anyone caught with an illegal gun. What’s not sensible about that? The Attorney General of the United States thinks it’s a great idea. And in case you haven’t noticed, lots of folks out there agree."

If that is indeed the case, American democracy is seriously faltering. The increasing hyper-partisanship and petty politicking coming out of Washington D.C. has effectively undermined the legislative process and ability of both parties to come together in the interest of the people they claim to represent.The GOP Senate health care bill is an example of how the American people pay the price for the degrading of our political institutions. Crafted in secret without any hearings or input from Democratic legislators, the Senate bill would take health care away from 22 million Americans and would result in higher costs for health care for those left with health insurance. Breaking with a recurring campaign promise by Donald Trump, the Senate bill would actually expand cuts to Medicaid already proposed by the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA).Of course none of the money taken from the cuts to Medicaid and financial assistance programs that aim to make health insurance affordable would end up being spent to help low or middle-income Americans. The Senate bill's proposed tax cuts are similar to the House version in that they would steal from the poor to give to the rich. The Senate bill would create more than $600 billion in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans over the next ten years. These tax cuts for the wealthy are so egregious that the richest 0.1% would benefit from a tax cut of around $200,000 a year.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to rush the process and have the Senate vote on the bill this week, but only to be stymied by members of his own party with clearly more sense. So far McConnell met resistance from at least five Republican senators and several healthcare advocacy groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and AARP.It's not difficult to see why some Republican legislators would be hesitant to vote for this bill. Its draconian proposals have led even Trump to describe its sister bill in the House as “mean.” The Senate and House bills eliminates the requirement that people be insured, creating the incentive for people to avoid coverage until they are sick and they need it. With less people buying insurance in the market, this will inevitably lead to less choices and higher premiums.Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, an estimated twenty more million people can see doctors, receive medicine and get the medical treatment they need. The national uninsured rate fell to a record low. The GOP now seeks to turn back the clock on those gains, all to redistribute capital to the wealthiest Americans in the form of tax cuts. The Democratic Party should not only use this moment to fight against healthcare repeal, but also to present their vision of what healthcare can look like in America.Americans who can't afford healthcare coverage have to live with the anxiety that any illness or accident can result in a lifetime of hospital bills. Republicans often talk about the idea of “freedom,” but are Americans truly free when a majority cannot afford to see a doctor or pay for medicine. This is the impact when our political institutions collapse. We get a lot of rhetoric and no action to protect the most vulnerable among us.

5,POLITICS,Director Of Media Company Donated To Journalist-Slamming GOP Candidate,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sinclair-gianforte-donation_us_5952e0eee4b0da2c731f7aef,The donation raises serious ethical questions.,2017-06-28,"Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte (R) delivers his victory speech on May 25, the day a Sinclair Broadcasting Group exec donated $1,000 to his campaign. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952edc6290000cc0f3b16fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A top executive of a conservative-leaning broadcast company donated money to the campaign of Montana Rep. Greg Gianforte (R) the day after the then-candidate was charged with assaulting a reporter, federal elections records show.Frederick G. Smith, the vice president and director of Sinclair Broadcasting Group, donated $1,000 to Gianforte’s campaign the day of his May 25 election victory, according to Federal Elections Commission data first reported by Politico on Tuesday. He also donated $1,000 to Gianforte’s campaign in March.The May donation came just one day after Gianforte was accused of “body-slamming” Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs and breaking his glasses after Jacobs asked the then-candidate a question about Republican health care legislation. Jacobs captured the incident on audio.Gianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault earlier this month and was sentenced to perform 40 hours of community service, complete 20 hours of anger management training and pay $385 in fines and fees. Smith’s donations raise serious questions over the ethics of media employees making financial connections with political candidates. While many news outlets ban editorial employees from making such donations and endorsements in order to preserve fair and balanced reporting, a Sinclair spokesperson said that “campaign contributions made by our board members are personal to them and do not reflect company policy or support.”Smith’s donation to Gianforte in the wake of the attack, in particular, raises even more questions about the value Sinclair’s leaders place on the role of a free press and reporter access to politicians. While Sinclair largely flies under the radar, the company’s acquisition of Tribune Media last month morphed it into an even bigger media giant. The deal will give Sinclair ownership of more than 200 TV stations, with a reach into more than 70 percent of American households. Across its stations, the conglomerate strongly tilted toward friendly coverage of then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 election.“News stories and features favorable to Trump or that challenged Clinton were distributed to Sinclair stations on a ‘must-run’ basis — that is, the stations were required by managers in Washington to make room in their evening newscasts or morning programs for them,” The Washington Post’s Paul Farhi found in a December report. Smith wasn’t the only donor apparently energized by Gianforte’s attack on Jacobs. The day after the incident, Gianforte collected more than more than $116,000 ― more money than the campaign had collected in the five days prior, combined. "
6,POLITICS,The European Union Just Showed Democrats How To Take On Monopolies,Alexander C. Kaufman and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/european-union-google-antitrust-democrats_us_59529c3fe4b02734df2dda82,U.S. Democrats have been soft on Big Tech.,2017-06-28,The Google logo adorns the entrance of Google's Germany headquarters in Hamburg.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952c435290000bc0f3b1697.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― European antitrust officials slapped Google with a record $2.7 billion fine on Tuesday for manipulating search results to favor its own services. The ruling, which came after a seven-year investigation, exposes what critics described as the failure of U.S. regulators to rein in monopolies at home, forcing their victims to seek recourse in the European Union. “The U.S. does not do antitrust regulation,” Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert at the nonpartisan New America Foundation’s Open Markets program, told HuffPost. “That’s the key difference. [Europeans] actually do antitrust.” But what is most surprising about America’s kid-gloves approach to antitrust policy is that it is not limited to Republicans, who are often open about their philosophical objections to regulating monopolistic behavior. In recent decades, influential Democrats have proved just as, if not more, willing to let companies with concentrated financial power off the hook, experts told HuffPost.“It would be hard to be worse than the [Obama] administration on this,” Stoller said. “The failure of leadership was incredibly profound. That said, it could always get worse, but I don’t think we know enough.” A monopoly is a company that controls such a large share of an industry that it has the power to dictate prices or engage in other behavior that limits competition. Sometimes companies without sole monopoly power conspire to control prices, forming what are known as cartels.For many Americans, the word “monopoly” conjures images of robber baron-owned railroad and steel conglomerates from the turn of the 20th century. The trust-busting policies of former President Theodore Roosevelt put an end to them, a certain popular wisdom goes, giving us the thriving, competitive economy we have today.In reality, as Stoller laid out in a lengthy essay in The Atlantic in October, cutting monopoly business and financial power down to size was the product of constant battles with big money interests that picked up significantly during the New Deal of the 1930s.Responding to the banking abuses that led to the Great Depression, populist Democrats, often from rural parts of the country, battled the monopolies of their era in order to protect their constituent farmers and local businesses. Antitrust legislation allowed for companies that grew too large or abused their size to be fined or broken up, and Congress, together with the executive branch’s Federal Trade Commission, often put those laws to work.For several decades, their policing paid off: There were no major financial crises, small towns thrived and the typical worker’s pay climbed steadily.But by the mid-1970s, a new generation of Democrats concluded that the tight regulation of the New Deal era was outdated, or at least in need of less vigilant enforcement, according to Stoller.Monopolies swelled once again, leading to the present day, when concentrated wealth and anticompetitive behavior are just as often the province of socially liberal tech giants as that of Wall Street or traditional industry.Google and Facebook, for example, together now rake in some 85 percent of all internet advertising dollars. It’s that kind of power that companies can use to prevent new players from entering the market and cripple those that manage to rear their heads. In one infamous case, Google drove the small website CelebrityNetWorth.com to the brink of extinction in 2016 by offering the site’s data in its search results without consent, effectively depriving the upstart company of most of its traffic, the lifeblood of its business.The divergent U.S. and European approaches to Google’s behavior in recent years exemplify the transatlantic divide on antitrust policy and the key role Democrats have played in lax enforcement in the U.S.The Obama administration opted not to sue the tech giant, against the advice of its own antitrust division, according to The Wall Street Journal. In 2012, FTC officials reckoned that Google abused and relied on anticompetitive strategies in ways that unfairly disadvantaged both internet users and rival businesses, according to an unredacted report accidentally sent to the Journal in 2015. The agency report recommended bringing a lawsuit against Google in what would easily have been the biggest antitrust case since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the 1990s for abusing its dominance in the hardware market to sell its software.The FTC disputed the Journal’s report, claiming the “Commission’s decision on the search allegations was in accord with the recommendations of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Economics, and Office of General Counsel. “Some of the FTC’s staff attorneys on the search investigation raised concerns about several other Google practices. In response, the Commission obtained commitments from Google regarding certain of those practices. Over the last two years, Google has abided by those commitments.”Indeed, in 2013, FTC commissioners voted unanimously to end the investigation after Google agreed to make some minor tweaks, giving advertisers more control over data from ad campaigns and websites the choice to opt out of search results. Then-Chairman Jon Leibowitz said the voluntary changes provided “more relief for American consumers faster than any other option.”Leibowitz, who now represents corporate clients, including cable giant Comcast, on antitrust matters, declined to comment on the record for this article. A spokesman for former President Barack Obama did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But as part of the agreement with the U.S. government, Google made no commitments to stop promoting its own e-commerce, food reviews and other services over competitors or to halt deals with websites that publish its search results to ice out rival search engines. So companies such as Yelp, Expedia and News Corp. turned to regulators at the European Commission, an EU governing body, to take action. “In Europe, they’re more aggressive about dominance,” Robert Lande, a law professor at the University of Baltimore, told HuffPost. “In the U.S., there’s a really strong presumption that you got your dominance by efficiency, by something that’s good for consumers, and you maintain it by efficiency. Only once in a blue moon do we step over the line and say you got your dominance through something anticompetitive.” Part of the problem may be that U.S. laws set a higher bar for what constitutes unfair market dominance, according to Harry First, a law professor at New York University.“In the U.S., you have to show that Google used its position in one market to get a monopoly in the other market, so they’d have to acquire a monopoly or be getting close to getting a monopoly,” First told HuffPost. “In Europe, you don’t have to show that. You just have to show that you are gaining some sort of advantage in that other market.” Critics accuse the EU of a bias against U.S. companies and point to the dominance of U.S. giants across Europe as evidence that the continent’s regulatory regimes stifle its tech sectors. Last August, EU antitrust officials ordered Apple to pay Ireland up to $14.5 billion in taxes. In May, the commission fined Facebook about $122 million for providing regulators with misleading statements during the social networking behemoth’s $19 billion acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp. Those critics include several Democratic House members, particularly from districts where large tech companies reside. In November 2014, six House Democrats joined six Republican colleagues in a letter to top EU parliamentarians arguing against a resolution supportive of breaking up part of Google into separate companies. Ten of the 12 members of Congress received donations from Google.In the run-up to the EU’s recent decision against Google, lobbyists were soliciting signatures from members of Congress for a letter condemning the EU’s antitrust policies that alleged anti-American discrimination. The letter, published by Politico on Tuesday without signatures, inveighed against the EU’s “aggressive and heavy-handed antitrust enforcement action against American companies.”HuffPost asked the five remaining House Democrats who had signed the 2014 letter ― California Reps. Anna Eshoo, Zoe Lofgren, Eric Swalwell, Tony Cardenas and Colorado Rep. Jared Polis ― if they had signed the more recent missive making the rounds and whether they had a reaction to the final ruling. We posed the same question to Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who unseated Mike Honda, the sixth Democrat on the 2014 letter.Of those who responded, the offices of Eshoo and Lofgren said they were not familiar with the letter obtained by Politico, and a staff member for Khanna said simply that he had not signed it.Lofgren, whose third-largest campaign contributor last election cycle was Google’s parent company, Alphabet, chose to comment on the ruling.“Rather than offering consumers a truly competitive marketplace with European companies rivaling their American counterparts, the European Commission is attempting to regulate innovation and competition into existence,” Lofgren said in a statement. “This is unfair to European consumers, and unfair to the U.S. companies participating in European markets.”But evidence suggests the EU deals equally harshly with its own companies. Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s top antitrust official, has hit major European firms with similar penalties for anticompetitive behavior, including a fine of more than $3 billion on major European truck makers in July. Niamh Dunne, an assistant professor of competition law at the London School of Economics, said European regulators don’t apply the same kid-gloves approach to intervening in markets as their U.S. counterparts.“It’s received wisdom in the U.S. you don’t want to intervene in the digital economy partly because it’s too new and partly because it’s too innovative, so you don’t want to replace beneficial market competition with inefficient government regulation,” Dunne told HuffPost. “As the digital economy becomes more established … maybe there needs to be recognition that, in these markets, competition problems can and might arise.” For progressives eager to use the grassroot momentum unleashed by Sen. Bernie Sanders’ insurgent bid for the Democratic nomination last year to push the party leftward, antitrust policy could be a flag to rally around. Despite being out of power in Washington, the party could turn to state attorneys general. Tom Miller, the Democratic top cop in Iowa currently serving his ninth consecutive term, successfully led the antitrust battle against Microsoft in the late 1990s.But the Democratic attorneys general best positioned to take on monopolies have shrunk from the fight, Stoller said. New York’s Eric Schneiderman vowed to become the new sheriff of Wall Street after winning election in 2010 amid the Great Recession, but he has failed to prosecute any significant antitrust case since taking office in 2010, Stoller said. “He’s done nothing, literally nothing,” he said. “It is totally pathetic.”Schneiderman’s office pointed out that the attorney general has brought several cases against corporations, including health insurers, pharmaceutical companies and tech companies, over mergers, price-fixing and other anti-competitive practices.For example, his office said, the attorney general joined with the Justice Department and several other states to block the merger of Anthem and Cigna earlier this year. His office also sued in 2014 to block a pharmaceutical company from switching patients to a new Alzheimer’s drug formula to prevent competition from a new generic version, despite federal regulators declining to step in.“The Attorney General has been a national leader in tackling some of the toughest antitrust challenges, with a focus on cases that have the biggest impact on New Yorkers,” the New York attorney general’s office spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick said in a statement. “We have ― and will continue to ― do what it takes to ensure New York’s residents and businesses can benefit from truly competitive markets ― no matter what happens on the federal level.”Stoller was unimpressed with examples from the A.G.’s office of its antitrust wins, noting that many are cases in which New York has merely collaborated with other states or the federal government. Stoller also said that former California Attorney General Kamala Harris, now a Democratic U.S. senator and frequent topic of 2020 presidential speculation, ignored the breeding ground for modern monopolies in her state’s Silicon Valley.“She certainly didn’t do anything when she was there,” Stoller said. A spokeswoman for Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, antitrust policy has slowly crept its way back into the liberal discourse, thanks to the scholarship of figures like Barry Lynn, a former business journalist who directs the program at the New America Foundation think tank, where Stoller hangs his hat.In the Senate, Wall Street nemesis Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has taken up the antitrust banner ― or “stick,” as she dubbed it in a May speech to Democratic donors and activists at the Four Seasons hotel in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.“It is time to do what Teddy Roosevelt did: Pick up the antitrust stick again. The stick has collected some dust, but the laws are still on the books,” she said.Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) responded to the EU’s fine by calling on the FTC to investigate Google. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said she would be keeping a closer eye on “dominant internet platforms” in her capacity as ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition and Consumer Rights.Other congressional antitrust advocates include Khanna, whose district is squarely in Silicon Valley. He was the only member of Congress to publicly express concerns about the implications of Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods earlier this month.“Technology companies are starting to take center stage,” Yong Chao, an antitrust expert and associate economics professor at the University of Louisville, told HuffPost. “In the future, we should see more and more digital giants being investigated under antitrust laws.”And energy behind the antitrust movement has come from an unexpected source: President Donald Trump. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to block AT&T’s proposed acquisition of CNN-owner Time Warner, claiming “it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.”As with so many of Trump’s populist campaign vows, he is unlikely to follow through. Makan Delrahim, his pick to head the Department of Justice’s antitrust division, has indicated he would greenlight the mega-merger.Still, there is nothing like a successful presidential run to show politicians from both parties which ideas resonate with broad swaths of the public. And based on Trump’s performance, antitrust policy sells.“Trump paid more attention to antitrust than any major presidential candidate since William Jennings Bryan in 1896 to 1900,” law professor Lande said of the three-time Democratic presidential nominee from Nebraska. “Trump made it an issue, many times he rallied his base and found popular support for what I might call an old-fashioned populist antitrust position.” "

In a statement, Church World Service, a Christian resettlement organization, said that enabling any variation of Trump’s travel ban is an “imprudent, devastating blow to our fundamental values of justice and humanity.”“We will continue to use all measures at our disposal to fully rescind this un-American ban and urge our elected officials to exercise political courage in the face of this legal and humanitarian setback,” the organization stated.On Monday, the Supreme Court decided that when its next term begins in October, it would review a series of court rulings against Trump’s executive order on immigration. In the meantime, the court partially unblocked injunctions placed on the order by federal courts in Maryland and Hawaii. The government could begin to implement these changes after a 72-hour waiting period.In the Supreme Court’s version of the order, people from the six countries affected by the ban ― Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ―who have a “bona fide” relationship with a person or entity in the United States would be allowed to enter the country. That includes people with a “close familial relationship,” students admitted to an American university, employees who have accepted an offer from an American company, or lecturers invited to the U.S. by an organization.These same rules apply to refugees from around the world seeking to come to the United States. Refugees who have already established some connection to the United States may still enter the country, and those who don’t have this relationship may be blocked. About four out of 10 refugees entering the U.S. typically don’t have family ties, according estimates obtained by the New York Times.The news about the Supreme Court’s announcement has caused concern among religious resettlement agencies, who play an important role in helping refugees adjust to life in America. Six of the nine federally funded domestic resettlement agencies are faith-based groups.These organizations have many lingering questions about how the government will interpret what exactly qualifies as a “bona fide” relationship with a United States entity. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’s Migration and Refugee Services claims to help resettle approximately 30 percent of the refugees that arrive in the U.S. each year. Ashley Feasley, the USCCB/MRS’s director of policy, told HuffPost that her organization is immediately concerned about the well-being of refugee families who are arriving in the short-term or who are already scheduled to travel to the U.S.“We note deep concern for certain groups like unaccompanied refugee children and those individuals facing religious persecution who may not be able to access protection in the United States at this time due to the decision,” Feasley told HuffPost in an email. “These people are truly the most vulnerable and need protection ― regardless of whether they have relationships in the United States. They are fleeing persecution and have been determined to be eligible for refugee protection.”Other refugee organizations claimed that the parts of the order that were allowed to go into effect are actually incredibly narrow. HIAS, a Jewish resettlement organization and one of the plaintiffs in the case against the ban in Maryland, said that it welcomed the announcement as an affirmation that Trump doesn’t have “unfettered unchecked authority” to bar refugees from entering the United States. The group noted that many of the refugees selected by the U.S. government for resettlement already have family members in the country. HIAS also claimed refugees who don’t have a family relationship may still qualify for entry ― since they have a connection to U.S.-based resettlement organizations who begin working with refugees long before they arrive in the country.The group asserted that the two-year long vetting process refugees undergo with the U.S. government could count as an established connection to a U.S. entity. HIAS said it plans to monitor how the government applies the Supreme Court’s announcement, and is ready to challenge the government in court if needed.“We are pleased that those with family and other ties to the United States, including refugees fleeing violence and persecution, will not be subject to the arbitrary exclusion of the Executive Order,” HIAS President and CEO Mark Hetfield said in a statement. “The Fourth and Ninth Circuit courts recognized that neither the Constitution nor the laws of this country permit the President to exercise such potentially harmful authority without evidence to justify preventing refugees from finding safety and freedom here. We have confidence that, in the fall, the Supreme Court will recognize the same.”In a statement, World Relief, a Christian organization that helps resettle refugees in the U.S., said that it is still evaluating the impact this announcement will have on its program. Nevertheless, World Relief leaders continue to believe that the United States should allow vulnerable people to be resettled in the country ― “including, but not limited to, those with family relationships.”“As an organization that has resettled refugees for over 35 years, we remain unrelenting in our commitment to refugees and our conviction that refugees have made—and will continue to make—an invaluable contribution to American life,” Scott Arbeiter, World Relief’s president, said in a statement. “We are hopeful that upon the Supreme Court’s full review this fall, the court will rule in favor of continuing the refugee resettlement program in full, and in so doing, reinforce this traditional American value.”The Reverend Canon E. Mark Stevenson, director of Episcopal Migration Ministries, said that his organization is awaiting an official “sorting” of how Monday’s announcement will be implemented practically. Stevenson challenged one particular phrase in the Supreme Court’s announcement ― the claim that temporarily excluding people without close family or professional ties “does not burden any American party.”“While that may or may not be true from a legal standpoint, it most certainly is not true from where this American, this Christian, sits and reflects,” Stevenson told HuffPost. “I feel the burden tremendously, as our country says to those who are ‘other’ that their suffering is less important than is mine. That seems to me to be decidedly un-Christ-like.”“Even if the government ultimately decides that we ‘may’ discriminate against a person, the question for me is, ‘Should we?’” Stevenson asked."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952c6521500001f00900660.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Unable to find enough support to advance their health care bill, Senate Republicans are delaying a vote on the proposal this week as they try to cut new deals that will bring conservative and moderate holdouts on board.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was forced to put off the vote on Tuesday after a small but dedicated cross section of his GOP conference expressed discomfort with moving ahead. McConnell can only lose two Republicans in his 52-member conference, and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) have both strongly suggested they will vote against the bill. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has also announced his opposition, but leaders still consider him gettable, two senior GOP aides said. Lee has teamed up with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in trashing the bill for not lowering premiums or repealing enough of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. With only two votes to lose, McConnell knows he needs all three to support the bill; otherwise, he’s stuck trying to flip Heller or Collins ― not an impossible task, but an unlikely one, given their statements on the bill at this point.The problem for McConnell is that Paul seems just as dedicated to opposing the bill, calling it “terrible” Monday night and saying it would be worse to pass a bad bill than no bill at all.That opposition ― coupled with concerns from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who has expressed reservations about moving so fast, and from a number of other senators whose support for the legislation appears shaky at best ― forced McConnell to take more time to whip the bill and work out deals.“Every time you get one bullfrog in the wheelbarrow, another one jumps out,” Senate GOP Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters Tuesday.McConnell met with one of those holdouts, Cruz, on Tuesday morning to discuss two proposals ― one that would allow insurers to offer plans that don’t comply with Obamacare regulations, and another that would expand the use of health savings accounts.That first proposal, which Cruz and other conservatives see as the path toward lower premiums, would effectively let insurers discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and charge people more for services like maternity care. It’s an amendment that moderates would almost certainly oppose. But McConnell is hoping he can use some of the extra money that the Congressional Budget Office said his bill would save and put it toward a different amendment to shore up Medicaid slightly, after the CBO said the program would suffer a $772 billion cut over the next 10 years.The bill’s Medicaid cuts alone are giving some senators more pause. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who seemed to be on board with the legislation after months of opposition, is again sounding unsettled.He told reporters on Tuesday that he wants more help for middle-income seniors who would face huge premium increases under the bill. (The CBO predicted that a 64-year-old making $56,800 who has a standard plan would see his or her premiums jump from $6,800 to $20,500.) And Cassidy said he had some specific concerns related to how the Medicaid expansion had affected his state’s baseline budget that he needs clarity on.Cassidy wouldn’t say how he would vote on a motion to proceed if McConnell were to schedule one.But McConnell didn’t schedule one. Instead, he announced that the Senate wouldn’t take action, as promised, before the July Fourth recess.“It’s an ongoing discussion,” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. “And members want ― several of them want ― more time. We have a number of different discussions going on. They’ve been going on for 6 weeks now. They continue.”After McConnell announced the delay, Republicans began immediately jockeying for a better negotiating position. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) tweeted that the bill did not have his support and that he looked forward to taking a step back and letting “the full legislative process” work. Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) issued a joint statement opposing the bill because it didn’t do enough to address the nation’s opioid epidemic. And Paul, who had met with President Donald Trump earlier in the day, tweeted that Trump was open to making the bill better. “Is Senate leadership?” he asked.With McConnell unable to hit his own deadline, the Kentucky Republican was asked Tuesday if Trump would now be taking a larger role.“We always anticipated the president would be very important in getting us to a conclusion,” McConnell answered. “After all, under our system, he’s the man with a signature.”But McConnell continued to say that engaging Trump in the early stages would have “candidly, kind of been a waste of his time,” and he said Republicans needed to get farther down the path so Trump could help close the deal. “And we’re delaying the process so that we can close those remaining issues,” he said.With or without those remaining issues, Trump is clearly taking a larger role. After meeting with Paul, Trump dispatched his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, to meet with Republicans. Vice President Mike Pence is also meeting with senators later Tuesday night. And the hammer may soon be coming down, too. A pro-Trump super PAC has already been hitting Heller for his announced opposition, whileTrump has shown a willingness to knock Republican lawmakers on Twitter ― much like he did when the House version of the bill stalled.That pressure could eventually motivate senators, particularly Republicans like Cruz who need the GOP base’s support in the upcoming 2018 elections.But it could also backfire.Later in the afternoon, Trump hosted a group of Republican senators at the White House. Flanked by critics like Collins and Heller, Trump urged senators to repeal Obamacare, which he said was experiencing a “meltdown.” He claimed the conference was “close” to passing a bill, and asserted that Republicans had as many as “52 or 50” votes ― a characterization directly contradicted by the decision to delay the vote this week, and by common sense.“If we don’t get it done, it’s just going to be something that we’re not going to like and that’s OK,” the president added.Trump appears to have little handle on the policy or political situation, and he’s trying to convince senators to take a leap of faith when most evidence suggests it’s not in the interests of many states or voters to pass this legislation.That’s particularly true in Alaska, where Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) continues to sit on the fence.Murkowski has very specific concerns about how Alaska would be affected by the bill, and she isn’t up for re-election until 2022. Trying to pressure her into voting for the health care plan isn’t likely to work ― not when she has such specific and major issues. And forcing her to draw a line on the bill or against Trump may end up sinking the legislation.One easy fault line would be Planned Parenthood funding. Murkowski is already working with Collins on crafting an amendment that would restore funding for Planned Parenthood, which the GOP bill would cut off for one year. Forcing her to make her support conditional on that amendment would likely either cost Republicans her support, or cost the support of a handful of conservatives. The same could be said of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which Murkowski wants to keep and conservatives want to gut.And again, that is McConnell’s struggle. Every concession he accepts from moderates could imperil the support of conservatives, and vice-versa. Ultimately, one or both sides of the conference will be unhappy with the legislation, and McConnell (with the help of Trump, perhaps) will have to convince Republicans to just accept the compromise.As for the delay, hardly anyone took it to mean the bill was dead. House GOP leadership already showed how quickly these proposals can come back to life ― and how delays can even be useful. Part of the reason House Republicans were successful in passing their bill was that opposition cooled the month after House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called off a vote, with Democrats blindsided that moderates and conservatives had actually struck a deal.In that spirit, Senate Democrats stopped short of taking a victory lap on Tuesday after the delay was announced. Instead, they continued rallies on the Capitol steps, holding up photos of constituents who would be adversely affected by the GOP proposal.“We’re going to fight this bill tooth and nail, and we have a darned good chance of defeating it,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. “The Republicans cannot excise the rotten core at the center of their health care bill.” "

It’s how we help give our children the best possible start in life,” Clinton said, pointing to a study that suggests children in low-income families hear 30 million fewer words by the age of 4 than their affluent counterparts.The former first lady added that libraries are critical to the well-being of rural communities and provide invaluable resources to help immigrants and refugees learn English and “know their rights.”“Sparking someone’s love of learning, changing the course of a life, standing up for the freedom to read, to learn ― nothing is more important than that in a free society,” Clinton said."

18,POLITICS,Trump's Legal Apologists Advocate Autocracy,"Richard North Patterson, ColumnistColumnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-legal-apologists-advocate-autocracy_us_59522a89e4b0c85b96c65c64,"Faced with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, President Trump’s enablers strive to place him beyond the rule of law",2017-06-27,"Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions talks with National Security Advisor Michael Flynn inside of the inaugural parade reviewing stand in front of the White House on January 20, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595256b5290000cc0f3b14e5.jpeg?ops=crop_0_52_3000_1731%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Faced with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, President Trump’s enablers strive to place him beyond the rule of law.Start with Trump and the FBI. No matter that, by his own admission, Trump fired James Comey to stop the Russia investigation, or that he attempted to protect Michael Flynn — and, most likely, himself — by intimidating the FBI director. As a matter of law, they insist, these actions cannot further an obstruction of justice.This proposition is spurious — one bullet in a fusillade of sophistry aimed at our constitutional democracy.For good reason, federal obstruction statutes are interpreted broadly. They include anyone who “corruptly ... endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice” or “otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding.”So what legal principles insulate Trump from charges of obstruction? None. Instead, advocates offer a patchwork of discrete and legally insufficient assertions divorced from their factual and legal context.First, apologists claim, Trump can lawfully fire an FBI director at will. True. But an otherwise lawful act can constitute obstruction if done with a corrupt intent. A president is no different than a local district attorney legally empowered to terminate an investigation — but who does so to prevent discovery of his own misconduct. Authority does not confer immunity.Next, Trump’s advocates assert that an FBI investigation is not a “proceeding” covered by the obstruction statutes. Even were this so, one cannot lawfully obstruct an investigation connected to a grand jury — which is likely the case with Flynn.Beyond that, courts are divided on whether impeding an FBI investigation, by itself, constitutes obstruction. Again, logic is Trump’s enemy — lying to the FBI, which is unlawful, serves the same purpose as obstruction: frustrating the search for truth. Further, the FBI is conducting a counterintelligence investigation of Russia which, precedent suggests, serves purposes which prioritize protecting its integrity.Finally, Trump’s apologists isolate a single conversation, then cherry pick one word — Trump’s “hope” that Comey would stop investigating Flynn, they tell us, is not enough to support obstruction. But the courts have upheld obstruction charges based on expressions of “hope” when combined with leverage. Trump’s advocates conveniently, and selectively, ask us to forget that he was Comey’s superior — and America’s chief executive.Shifting ground, Trump’s enablers complain that it is unfair to charge obstruction of an investigation into whether Trump colluded with Russia to influence an American election. Why? Because such collusion, they insist, is not a crime at all — instead Trump’s vicious persecutors are trying to politicize the law.Skip the tricky question of treason. The federal law governing bribery of public officials — “either before or after such person has qualified” — covers those who “receive or accept anything of value” in return for “being influenced in the performance of any official act.” That certainly seems to include, as one example, a promise to reduce sanctions against Russia in return for releasing stolen e-mails to help Trump win election, or financial aid to his businesses.Still another statute, the Logan Act, covers “any citizen of the United States” who intends to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government ... to defeat the measures of the United States.” As Trump’s defenders correctly note, this venerable law, long unenforced, is subject to abuse. However, we are dealing with a potential breach of national security: a presidential candidate who accepts favors from a foreign adversary in exchange for secretly promising favorable treatment. If there ever was a case for the Logan Act, this is it. We should not foreclose investigation before the facts are known.Finally, foreign nationals are barred from making any contributions or expenditures in connection with an American election. This not only covers money, but “anything of value.” Logically, that includes hacking and releasing stolen e-mails to assist a presidential campaign, or — as Russia has in Europe — buying advertising or promulgating fake news.In sum, federal criminal statutes support the obvious and necessary conclusion: that colluding with Russia to influence our presidential election violates American law. In this regard, Trump’s defenders notwithstanding, it is vital to know whether Trump’s business empire was financially entangled with interests directed by the Putin regime.This brings us to Trump’s strongest, if most unsettling, argument: that even were his conduct criminal, a president cannot be indicted while in office. Though this question is unresolved, Justice Department guidelines and a body of scholarly opinion hold that criminal proceedings would unduly impede a president in executing his duties.To this rationale his defenders add, remarkably and dubiously, that Trump’s pardoning power includes the power to pardon himself, rendering indictment pointless and placing America’s president completely beyond the reach of American law. So, too, would another step many are encouraging Trump to take — contriving to fire Robert Mueller or attempting to suppress any report of his findings. All of which, they propose, is perfectly lawful.But this, ultimately, is where Trump’s defense consumes itself. For the sole alternative to indictment is impeachment.Pass over a signal irony — that impeachment would impede a president at least as much as indictment. Or another: that a successful impeachment would permit indictment. Richer inconsistencies abound.For one, the grounds for impeachment — “high crimes and misdemeanors” — are clearly broader than the criminal law. By common legal consent they cover any dereliction of presidential duty defined by Congress — including, as in the case of Richard Nixon, obstruction of justice. Yet Trump’s apologists, having placed him beyond indictment, argue that he cannot be impeached for conduct as to which he was not indicted. This is the apotheosis of self-serving circularity.Undeterred, they further insist that the emoluments clause of the Constitution — meant to foreclose corruption of public officials by foreign governments — does not provide a criminal penalty. Pursued to its logical cul-de-sac, this means that the constitutional bar against a president taking foreign money is without a legal or constitutional remedy, freeing Trump to enrich himself with impunity by leveraging the power of his office.Taking their arguments together, his advocates would immunize Trump from all legal or constitutional constraints. Only such unprecedented empowerment, they assure us, can prevent Trump’s persecution for crass political purposes, rescuing the world’s most powerful man from malign forces bent on his victimization. And so, in the end, American law would mirror Trump’s own narcissism.This is the gateway to autocracy and corruption. And it would leave Americans defenseless against a president who may have committed the highest of crimes, colluding with a foreign power to attack our democracy. Of all the ways that Trump has degraded our moral and political life, his legal enablers seek to further what is, perhaps, the worst.Richard North Patterson’s column appears regularly in the Boston Globe.

I covered FBI Director James Comey’s shocking dismissal in last month’s column, and since then, the news out of Washington, D.C., has mostly been a steady buildup of dread. Basically, it feels like the U.S. government is a massive cyst waiting to burst. Since there’s not a whole lot to say about that, I figured I’d maybe just hang out at the beach a bit, stock up on canned goods and ammo, and save my strength so I’m fresh when the time comes to chronicle the political and social cataclysm that feels imminent in America today.But I couldn’t take the month off once I learned that the theme of this month’s Wild Word was “Filth.” That particular word is one of the few signifiers of foulness that hasn’t been dancing in my thoughts since Trump moved his outer-borough carnie show from New York to Washington. (I’m perpetually finding notes, both typed on my phone and scrawled on scraps of paper, saying things like “Donald Trump is a man-sized hemorrhoid.”) And filth is the perfect descriptor for the oversized shit-stain currently defacing the White House. (That’s another scatological image dictated into my iPhone during a restless night. And yes, that’s how I roll: crude enough to use a term like “shit-stain,” prissy enough to hyphenate it.)You might ask, Hey girl, why all the potty talk?—especially if you’re a circa 2010 Ryan Gosling Internet meme. Really, it’s unlike me: I embrace a good Anglo-Saxon curse now and again, but I generally don’t go in for scatological ickyness. But “President” Trump, rumored to be a golden-shower aficionado, doesn’t always afford us that luxury.That’s because underneath all the bronzer and pomade, Donald Trump is filthy—unmistakably, rankly, stomach-churningly filthy. Absolutely nothing is clean about the man: not his language; his thought process; nor his policies of rolling back protections for the environment, tearing away safety nets for the poor, and stripping healthcare from the less fortunate to provide massive tax cuts for the richest Americans.I won’t spend much time commenting on the misshapen and apparently irradiated vessel that houses Trump’s atrophied brain and shriveled soul. But I would like to remark on the hubris of walking around looking like that while calling others “fat pigs” and “disgusting animals.” There are mirrors on nearly every surface in Trump Tower, so it’s hard to fathom how the man could be oblivious to the displeasing particulars of his own embodiment. And now that I’m being bitchy, I’ll also ask this: How is it that a man who apparently prizes all things ritzy secures the undersides of his oversized silk neckties with Scotch tape?Moving from the petty to the more substantial (something Trump is incapable of), I’ll say this: The current president is going down, and pretty much everyone knows it. However, since the dimwitted Narcissist-in-Chief is one of the few who can’t see the inevitable, it’s likely that a whole lot more filth will be spewed before America can start mopping and disinfecting the White House. (And let’s face it, a place built by slaves and often inhabited by men of dubious values ain’t exactly pristine.)From JFK to Tony SopranoFilth flies off the Trump administration like spatter from a mud-wrestling contest—and the dreck comes from many sources. For starters, there’s the nepotism that has Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner filling official roles in the administration—despite having zero government experience and dubious qualifications. Then there’s the Trump family’s likely violations of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which was designed to ensure that government officials, including the president, won’t be corrupted by foreign influence or put their own financial interests over the national interest. And of course, there’s the motherlode of murk surrounding the administration and Russia, from the possibility that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian meddling designed to throw the election its way to the intrigue surrounding the Trump organization’s financial dealings with banks and other businesses with close ties to Putin. And of course there’s the little fact that Trump basically admitted to obstruction of justice when he confessed that he was thinking about the investigation into his administration’s ties to Russia when he fired FBI Director Comey.I’m no Reagan-deluded subscriber to the America-as-shining-city-on-a-hill metaphor. I’m woke enough to understand in many areas, both domestic and international, the U.S. government’s role has been closer to knave than knight. But it’s only under Trump—and he brought us this low in a matter of mere months—that the country has become unapologetically synonymous with a cynical, transactional, and morally dead worldview. If Obama aspired to become an idealistic and uplifting leader in the model of John F. Kennedy, Trump is aiming to be a shady wise guy like Tony Soprano. But he sucks at it, so America is well and truly fucked.The United State’s swift decline was blindingly evident during Trump’s recent meeting with European leaders, when he chose to go it alone on matters great (being the only defector from the Paris Climate Accord) and small (riding in a golf cart looking like an obese potentate, as opposed to walking with the other world leaders, who seemed to be literally striding into a future that will have far less room for the United States). Trump’s maladroit boorishness was on full display when he shoved the prime minister of Montenegro out of the way to position himself in the center of the front row for a photo. At least he got his comeuppance (also caught on camera) when French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a coup de grace: swerving away from an expectant Trump to instead embrace German Chancellor Angela Merkel—effectively crowning her the new leader of the free world.There is so much that’s distressing about a person as debased and dopey as Trump ascending to America’s highest office, it’s hard to know where to start. On a psychological level, for some Americans (including this American), one of the shocks is the realization that in just a few months, our country has gone from arguably the most consequential nation in the world to one that is increasingly beside the point. Sure, we’d likely be on that trajectory anyway. But last year, at least it looked like a major power like China would be the instrument bringing our nation low. We didn’t think it’d be a grubby wrestling and beauty-pageant promoter from Queens.Previously published as ‘Slimed’ in Maria’s SPOTLIGHT column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:Why the Morality in Wonder Woman Matters by Reverend Rachel KesslerLet’s Stop Shaming and Start Supporting Moms by Jami IngledueMy S&M Marriage by James Prenatt"

Machines replace humans at every step of the ongoing Industrial Revolution. We generally find new things to do, but, as artificial intelligence and robotics continue to grow, millions and millions of people worldwide won’t be needed at a surgical table, in a law office, pharmacy, a taxi or truck, preparing people’s taxes, or checking out customers.49M unemployed now. 80M by mid-century. We have a glut of consumers who won’t “earn” because their labors aren’t needed. The wealthy will own the machines that produce goods and services.Really THINK about it, Hero. You’ve just learned the beast’s secret: If they’re taking the time and trouble to take you off their books, not have to pay out overtime, sick leave, pension money, union compensation, why, oh why, would they want to have to foot the bill to keep millions of you without a job alive?You’re a drag on their resources, earnings.Now, Hero, look around you. What do you see?The GOP doesn’t believe in minimal government. They believe in government attached to the beast. Shred the social safety net. Make health care unaffordable. End Medicaid. Put Medicare into the hands of Wall Street to suck it dry.Vulnerable people die.No more immigration? Forcibly deport “the ones” that are “here.”Vulnerable people die.Fewer workers who don’t produce produce fewer consumers who consume.The machines aren’t evil. It’s just a question of their place in society. Do a small number of people who own the means of production have responsibility only to themselves, or do the machines serve all mankind for its betterment?Hollywood could not write something this legit, and heroes like you will have to have an adult conversation about that in the halls of power around the globe.Right now, you may be sitting on the bed, at a Starbucks, in the subway, at your desk, at lunch, reading away, perhaps tweeting your outrage into the pointless partisan soup of the Internet.What are you doing, though, to stop it, Hero?Do you march? Do you vote? Do you get your family and friends out to the polls?Around the world, hundreds of thousands of people turn out to the streets to protest. In Russia, Romania, and so many other countries around the world, citizens, hundreds of thousands of them, are risking their lives, and their freedom, taking to the streets to oppose the Randian selfishness and autocratic power grabs of people like Vladmir Putin and Robert Mercer’s puppet, Donald J. Trump. In America? Crickets.Sure, the shock of a Trump win woke you up... A bit. You marched in outrage for women’s rights, and a few other causes, but by the time we got to march for science, you were tired of venting your outrage outdoors. The spin machines of the right minimalized it as kooks and pros. The media became bored covering it. Protests don’t win ratings weeks. Now it’s summer. Too hot to go out. “House of Cards” just released on Netflix, “Transformers,” fake control for the planet, hit the theaters. You have that vacation coming up.Don’t be apathetic. Don’t be the distracted ones ignoring that bulge in the political wall. Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their nation, their planet, Hero. Brave the heat.Start by calling every elected representative you have and opposing Trumpcare, which is pulling the “life” from “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” out of the hands of 22-23M Americans.Organize people to vote in 2018. Get them to the polls. OR... Be a real American patriot and run for office...Run."
21,POLITICS,"Of Caesar, Guns And Trolls: The Evil That Men Do","Michael Winship, ContributorFormer senior writer, BillMoyers.com. President, Writers Guild...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/of-caesar-guns-and-trolls-the-evil-that-men-do_us_5951a664e4b0326c0a8d0acd,"Over in New York’s Central Park, just a short distance from our offices, the curtain came down last week on The Public Theater’s",2017-06-27,"The Delacorte Theater on the 'Julius Caesar' opening night on June 12, 2017 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59526b88290000bc0f3b152f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over in New York’s Central Park, just a short distance from our offices, the curtain came down last week on The Public Theater’s controversial production of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Controversial because the actor playing the assassinated Caesar looked and sounded like Donald Trump, right down to the overlong red necktie and clownish orange-blond nimbus of hair.But the curtain didn’t fall because of the outrage that came tumbling from the right ― including protesters heckling at a couple of the performances and death threats directed at the production’s director (not to mention feverish tweets and emails from confused trolls hurled at any theatre company with the word “Shakespeare” in its name).Nor did it occur because two of The Public Theatre’s corporate donors, Bank of America and Delta Air Lines, pulled their sponsorship of the show, a gutless move of appeasement from two businesses, banking and air travel, so well known these days for their dazzling records of customer satisfaction.(Another company, American Express, didn’t yank its cash from The Public but tweeted that its money doesn’t fund Shakespeare in the Park “nor do we condone the interpretation of the Julius Caesar play.”)No, the fact is, Julius Caesar always was scheduled to end the night that it did. That was to make way for the summer’s second Shakespeare in the Park production — A Midsummer Night’s Dream.Gentle readers will recall that this is the Shakespeare play in which, among a great many other things, a knavish sprite named Puck turns a man into an ass. Such an act once seemed like magic, but given today’s political climate, the turning of men into asses has become the rule rather than the exception.Witness the aforementioned kneejerk reaction of the right, so quick to accuse the left of behaving like snowflakes but themselves so hypersensitive to even the mildest heat that they melt as fast as Frosty the Snowman — that is, if he was a whiny Fox or talk radio host instead of a jolly happy soul.We’ve established before that this is not a crowd that embraces a thoroughgoing knowledge of history in general, and it’s probably fair to assume a knowledge of theatrical history not at all. Elsewise they might realize that Julius Caesar is not a play that celebrates political violence but loudly condemns it.In an email, The Public’s artistic director (and director of Julius Caesar) Oskar Eustis wrote:Those who attempt to defend democracy by undemocratic means pay a terrible price and destroy the very thing they are fighting to save. For over 400 years, Shakespeare’s play has told this story and we are proud to be telling it again in Central Park.Back in the day, Queen Elizabeth I herself recognized that the playwright’s scripts often were thinly veiled depictions of the current political scene in Britain and even of herself. Apparently, she had a thicker skin than the gang at Delta Air Lines or Bank of America — she kept encouraging Shakespeare with money from the royal purse.Julius Caesar in particular has always been a play lending itself to parallels with contemporary politics. George Washington hosted an amateur production in Philadelphia during the first full year of his presidency. He didn’t seem to take offense. Orson Welles directed and played Brutus in a 1937 staging that drew parallels with the rise of fascism in Europe, even recreating the infamous “Cathedral of Light” at Hitler’s Nuremburg rallies.For the last few years, The Acting Company has been touring the country with a version in which Caesar bears a close resemblance to Barack Obama — no one has protested. And ever since Trump started to dominate the electoral landscape, several productions have used Julius Caesar as a metaphor for the debilitating illness that pervades our body politic.Shakespeare scholar James Shapiro recently wrote:As long as politicians resemble Caesar and as long as their opponents seek to justify their overthrow, ‘Julius Caesar’ will continue to matter…But none of this stopped the trolls of the right from throwing a major-league hissy about the show, even if very few of them actually attended a performance. Much of the consternation was based on a video of the play’s assassination scene that went viral.Some, Sean Hannity among them, even suggested that the recent wounding of House majority whip Steve Scalise and four others at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, somehow was linked to the production of Julius Caesar. “The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands!” screamed one of those who disrupted a performance. And the president’s son, Donald Jr., retweeted conservative commentator Harlan Hill’s comment that the shootings were “EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our president.”This was and is opportunistic sophistry, an attempt to use tragedy to distract by aiming a fallacious attack at “elites” and the left. The production of Julius Caesar should no more be condemned for its alleged connection to an act of senseless violence than The Catcher in the Rye should be banned because John Lennon’s assassin Mark David Chapman was obsessed with the book.The attack on Scalise and the others was the act of a deeply disturbed man who had made anti-Trump statements on Facebook and elsewhere. And there’s no denying that it took place in an atmosphere of elevated hate speech from right and left — but face it, mostly from the right — and violence that has only gotten worse since the election, aggravated by the man now president who egged on his supporters at splenetic campaign rallies.But let’s talk about what also really needs discussing. Not just a production of a classic play that offended some, or the unreasoned words and actions of far too many, including men and women in Congress and the White House.Since we’re talking about the freedom to speak out, let’s speak out about guns.For one, given the mental state of the man accused with the Scalise shooting why was he allowed to have weapons? As my colleague Michael Hiltzik at the Los Angeles Times wrote:In a country with sensible and intelligent firearms laws, there’s no way a person with the history of domestic violence of James Hodgkinson, who has been identified as the shooter, would be permitted anywhere near the weapons he was carrying on June 14 ― and which reportedly he obtained legally.Too soon? Let’s pray for Steve Scalise’s continued recovery but not forget his A+ rating from the National Rifle Association or, say, his opposition to stricter gun laws after 26 died in the Sandy Hook shootings of 2014. Hiltzik noted:To say Scalise deserves to share blame for this situation is not to say that he deserves the punishment of a grave injury. But nor is this an occasion to ignore the policies he espouses and their relationship to the June 14 event and its aftermath…Counting the Scalise incident, according to the website Mass Shooting Tracker, as of June 25, 2017, so far this year there have been 211 mass shootings in the United States. Guns have killed more than 6,800 in America this year; 13,500 have been wounded, according to Chelsea Parsons, vice president of guns and crime policy at the Center for American Progress. In a recent op-ed, Parsons pointed out out the gun fatality rate in this country is 25 times greater than in other high-income countries.And yes, as the argument goes, more people might have died in Alexandria if Scalise had not had armed police protection with him, but they were trained professionals, not the amateurs — including members of Congress — who want to run around with concealed carry permits and handguns wherever they choose.But that’s what the GOP wants. Jonathan Martin reported at The New York Times:The Republican majorities on Capitol Hill have blocked every attempt to enact significant gun control legislation, most recently after the massacre of 49 people in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub last June. Measures to block people on the federal terrorism watch list from buying weapons and to close background-check loopholes failed in the Senate.The counterintuitive argument that the answer to guns is more guns is madness. As Marc Antony says in Julius Caesar, during his famous oration at the funeral of the murdered leader, “O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their reason.”Too soon?"

But there was no paneer in the house and it was too hot to walk to the nearest place that sells it. Since we were now looking forward to a warm mouth-buzz of spices, devising a cheese-free tomato-and-pea curry seemed the right thing to do. The cooking was easy, and the outcome delicious. If you use vegetable oil rather than butter, it is a good vegan option too.I began with the simple spice mix, which I based on one in Julie Sahni’s excellent Classic Indian Cooking: For this quantity, I combined 2 teaspoons black cardamom, pods and all (green would be fine), and 1/4 teaspoon each of dried chili flakes and black peppercorns, and ground it in my spice-specific coffee mill along with a teaspoon of pre-ground turmeric. I also checked my store-bought garam masala mixture and found that it had faded with time. It was a minute’s work to make a small batch of my own (also based on Ms. Sahni’s recipe): 1/2 tablespoon cardamom, a 1.5-inch (3.5 cm) piece of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cloves, 1 tablespoon black peppercorns and 2 tablespoons each cumin and coriander seed, the spices briefly toasted in a small, heavy skillet (with no fat) and ground once they’d cooled a little. But, believe me, I’d have used the one from the shop if it hadn’t lost its aroma. I shall keep the rest of my fresh garam masala in the freezer, where it will retain its power longer.This was going to be a mostly farmers’-markety curry, and I began by quartering the cherry tomatoes and setting them aside. Next, I halved and thinly sliced three small new-season onions around an inch and a half (just under 4 cm) in diameter. I sweated these in clarified butter (because I had some: vegetable oil would be fine – or whole butter, come to that) along with salt and a heaping tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger (not from the farmers’ market, though that wouldn’t be beyond the realm of possibility at certain times of the year), and when they were tender added most of the first spice mixture and continued to cook for a minute or so before adding the tomatoes, whose juices deglazed the pan. As the juice continued to flow, it also generated a sauce to which, after a couple of minutes, I added the peas and simmered until tender. Depending on your tomatoes (and you could certainly use a couple of full-size ones, diced, instead of the cherry tomatoes), you might need to loosen the sauce with a little water.Finally, I stirred in a generous teaspoonful of garam masala and checked carefully for salt: the spices demand sufficient salt to balance them. Another possible addition to ensure balance might be a tablespoon of whole butter stirred in at the last minute; on this day, with these tomatoes and spices, it wasn’t needed.We ate our curry with basmati rice lightly scented with fennel seed and shards from a cinnamon stick; yogurt mixed with fresh mint and a small cucumber that had been sliced thin and salted 20 minutes in advance; and a couple of new-season potatoes, boiled, halved, sprinkled with whole mustard seeds and a little garam masala (curry powder would be good here if it’s something you keep in the house) and slowly browned in butter, cut-side down.Although the flavor was similar to that of mattar paneer, the dish seemed entirely new.

That’s more than four times the number of girls in the United States generally who identify as LGBTQ―and 85% LGBTQ youth who are incarcerated are youth of color.As outlined in a report released today, incarcerated LGBTQ youth face alarming rates of discrimination, harassment, and sexual assault. Incarcerated gay and bisexual boys are more than 10 times more likely to report being sexually assaulted than their peers. And despite laws like the Prison Rape Elimination Act, LGBTQ youth continue to report grossly unsafe conditions.All youth, including LGBTQ youth, deserve fair treatment within the juvenile justice system. Safety, dignity, respect and support are critical components of successful reentry and reducing recidivism rates. However, abuse, bias and mistreatment in these facilities are all-too common.That’s why the Movement Advancement Project and the Center for American Progress are teaming with up with Youth First and advocates in five states to find community-based alternatives to youth prisons, which are not only unsafe places for youth, but also do nothing to help youth build the skills needed to succeed as adults."

It has not yet fully recovered.In 2008, with the economic recession, America’s sense of economic stability was shattered. It has not yet fully recovered.And in 2016, with the presidential election, America’s sense of political normalcy was shattered. It may be a long time before the country recovers.This short century has witnessed the United States fall from the heights of its post-Cold War supremacy ― from an “indispensable nation” with unquestioned faith in its invulnerability, inevitable progress and ultimate primacy ― to one teetering on the edge. Distrust and dissatisfaction with the government have reached near-record highs. Faith in a broad swath of critical institutions ― from business to media to religion ― has declined to near-record lows. Political polarization has spiked to levels not seen in generations; indeed, by some measurements, it now surpasses traditional social cleavages like race and religion. Political violence has become not just a specter but a reality.If this sounds stark or alarmist, that’s because it is. The challenges we face cannot be met with pablum about “American exceptionalism.” They cannot be hidden by our many advantages ― our talented people, our innovative private sector, our supreme military or our enviable geography. Nor can they be hidden behind the very real — if imperfect — progress we have made on a whole host of critical issues, including race and gender.The stark reality is that despite all the progress we’ve made and all the assets we’ve accumulated, the social contract is no longer working. It can no longer provide for a baseline of stability and progress for society. The future of the American dream is at stake. The viability of democracy is being called into question. We are going to have to rethink what we’re doing. And we are not the only ones.We are in the midst of a global crisis in democracy and governance. In 2016, political upheaval rocked democracies on both sides of the Atlantic — the Brexit vote, the failure of government-sponsored referendums in Italy and Colombia, the strengthening of far-right and separatist movements across Europe and the election of President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, democracy is in retreat around the world. According to Freedom House, 2016 was the 11th consecutive year that freedom declined worldwide. Political rights and the rule of law diminished in 67 countries last year; only about half that many countries registered a net improvement.The advent of the digital age is bringing about a historical transformation as momentous as that which accompanied the Industrial Revolution. In the 21st century, technology and globalization are challenging our institutions of government, which were designed to operate on a national scale or in cooperation with a few allies. For much of the 20th century, these institutions were capable of maintaining stability and delivering progress.But, today, the old order is ineffective at managing the networked age and its challenges. An onslaught of crises — the financial crisis, the Arab Spring, the Euro crisis, the emerging market crunch, the rise of global terror networks, state-sponsored election hacking — are all evidence that state responses to technological, generational, economic and political upheaval are falling short.And the disruptions we now confront will only grow more severe. Take the challenge of job loss due to technology or outsourcing. In America and around the world, millions of jobs have been lost to technology in the last few decades. Advances in robotics may soon threaten not only manufacturing jobs but also service ones as well — even in “low wage” countries like China. This will put downward pressure on wages, exacerbating income inequality as capital and talent — particularly at the highest echelons — receive ever-greater returns. The global middle class — and those aspiring to join its ranks — may stagnate or recede.These challenges threaten the American dream and its global counterparts. At home and abroad, the ability to live a dignified life seems increasingly under threat. Communities are fragmenting as diverging explanations for how to cope with change exacerbate pre-existing societal cleavages. This is a recipe for disaster. In countries as varied as Thailand, Brazil, Turkey, Israel and Spain, there have been large-scale protest movements driven in part by inequality. But these movements have shown little ability to resolve their underlying grievances. In severe cases, such as parts of the Arab world, Africa and Ukraine, societies are dividing to the point of state fragmentation and civil war.These vast challenges require new thinking — and more than that, they require action. Around the world, democracies must prove the viability and desirability of their system to their own populations who are looking for a better path forward. The tasks are clear: to restore credibility and integrity to the democratic process, to rebuild vibrancy and truth into the public square, to enable governments to effectively operate with all the tools and capabilities of the 21 century and, above all else, to rebuild the social contract to meet the needs of citizens.The road ahead will be long, but it must begin now with the type of hard work that has always determined the future of democracy: conversation, engagement, service and sacrifice for the greater good.Ari Ratner is the project manager of the Berggruen Institute’s Renovating Democracy for the Digital Age project."

Many of my female friends were moved to tears seeing the grace and power of the Amazonian warriors who dominated the first act of the film. Others, myself included, simply felt inspired seeing a female protagonist entrusted with the weight of a large studio superhero franchise.I cannot deny I loved seeing Diana, princess of the Amazons, confounding the expectations of the men around her and dominating the battlefield. That said, I found myself particularly moved by what I can only describe as the profound spiritual message at the heart of the film. This may not be an obvious connection to make, but it can be hard to turn off a priest’s brain, even at the movies. Is humanity worth fighting for, despite all of our faults and cruelty and, for lack of a better word, the collective filth that can seem to pollute our souls?Without giving too much away for those who have yet to see this latest summer blockbuster, the central conflict of the film rests on Diana’s (Wonder Woman’s) conception of humanity. It is easy for her to come to the aid of the human race when she embraces the bedtime story she was told as a child: people are inherently good, though we may be corrupted by forces beyond our control. As with any coming-of-age story, however, Diana’s increasingly complicated experiences interacting with human beings lead her to an increasingly complicated view of humanity. She must come to terms with the reality that even the friends she has come to know, love, and respect, harbor within them the potential for violence and evil. This is not an easy realization for Diana to grasp, leading her briefly to turn her back on the people she has sworn to defend.The profound emotional moment for me came when Diana realizes her commitment to the service of humanity has nothing to do with whether these human creatures she has sworn to protect “deserve” her compassion. They probably do not. And yet, she sees the human capacity for love, for self-sacrifice, and chooses a path of compassion for these flawed creatures.That may sound like a rather pessimistic view of humanity for a light-hearted summer popcorn flick to embrace. And yet it is a worldview that I find refreshingly honest for the mainstream entertainment media. So often, it feels like the entertainment industry wants to shy away from any indication that there is something fundamentally corrupt at times in the heart of our human condition. After all, we want to feel good about ourselves most of the time, don’t we?And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we know that the worldview presented in a film like Wonder Woman touches on an uncomfortable truth that we may not want to admit most of the time. It is hard to look at ourselves in a collective human mirror and look at all of the deep flaws that claim us—both individually and collectively. However, even the movie Wonder Woman itself illustrates how broken our human condition can be. Despite Wonder Woman being a major step forward for representation of women in big-budget Hollywood action films, the movie has not been without controversy. Numerous voices online have pointed out that the film falls far from presenting an “intersectional” understanding of feminism—it is still very much an example of “white” feminism, continuing to marginalize (at best) women of color. Other would-be Wonder Woman fans have opted to boycott the film on account of actress Gal Gadot’s seeming complicity in the persecution of the Palestinian people.In my tradition, we would name such issues “sin.” We might just as easily use language of systemic oppression and injustice of various marginalized groups. We do not have to look hard in our world to find examples of systemic racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, and economic inequality—not to mention everyday examples of greed or pettiness. When we think about the work that needs to be accomplished in our world in order to build a society that is genuinely founded on principles of justice and inclusiveness—especially when we think of all the impediments that stand against such a vision for society—it can feel as though the task is not worth perusing. Are we really worth saving? Is it really worth trying to do the work to fight for justice when so many powers that be seem committed to defending injustice in every way possible?Wonder Woman, flimsy summer blockbuster though it may be, answered that question with an emphatic yes. Absolutely, it is worthwhile to continue fighting for the sake of what is right and for the defense of those who need defending, even when the world seems stacked against us. Moreover, we engage in that fight not primarily with our superhuman physical strength but through a commitment to love. Not an idealized version of love, but a deeply embodied love that is born out in our willingness to sacrifice ourselves and our own well-being for one another. Nothing is as radical or as powerful as that.Previously published as ‘The Wisdom of Wonder Woman’ in Reverend Rachel’s SOUL MATTERS column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:The Stain That Trump Has Left on America by Maria BehanLet’s Stop Shaming and Start Supporting Moms by Jami IngledueMy S&M Marriage by James Prenatt"

We tend to think that every small action we take with them, every word we say, will hugely affect their growth. Am I talking to my baby enough? Is her brain growing enough? Does my toddler have enough sensory stimulation? Do I have my preschooler in all the right lessons and sports? Am I going to completely screw this kid up?So maybe it’s understandable, with that weight of responsibility, that we get a little defensive about our choices. And maybe that is why people, especially moms, are awfully quick to point out what other moms are doing “wrong.” It seems Mommy-shaming has become an entire sub-culture—moms pointing out what other moms are messing up, that they’re not using the right carrier or the right discipline methods or they are (god forbid) formula feeding, and their children will be irrevocably damaged as a result and it’s ALL OUR FAULT.But here’s the thing: we’re not carpenters, building our kids from scratch with careful planning and execution and skill, completely responsible for every cut, every joint, its stability and strength. We are gardeners. We provide fertile soil, access to sunshine, and water. We can see that tomatoes need different things than cucumbers, so we might adjust the soil and the water and the kind of support. But a tomato will never be a cucumber. No matter what we do, how much effort we put into it. We can never change that tomato into a cucumber.My son, aka “Little Dictator,” is generally the worst-behaved kid at any event. I have carried him in a barrel-hold, kicking and screaming, out of more places than I care to recall. He is the one who sniffs out the weakness of any situation and then strikes without mercy. He is the one who dashes for the street, who wants to touch the fire, who tries to climb the gorilla enclosure. He craves confrontation and drama like a WWF wrestler, and he basks in the attention of his audience.Sometimes I wish he was a docile, obedient kid. But this is who he is. I can’t change a tomato into a cucumber, no matter what I do. And I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE for him being a tomato, for his personality. (Clearly he gets this from his father, anyway). I did not create him this way, it is not because of anything I did. I’m doing my level best to turn him from feral animal to decent human. But telling him to be different is like telling the wind not to blow: good luck with that. And the truth is these traits—persistence, tenacity, energy, relentless curiosity, creativity—will serve him very well as an adult. If we can all just survive that long.I can sometimes feel the judgement rolling off of other parents. I have been embarrassed and frustrated to the point of tears in public settings many, many times. Most parents are sympathetic.But then there are the Mommy-shamers. The disdainful looks, the whispers, the unsolicited advice.An advantage of having kids when I’m older is that I just don’t care what other people think. Or maybe I’ve grown a thick skin from the years of embarrassment. But now I can see mommy shaming for what it so often is: insecurity. They feel so much pressure to be the “perfect mom” that they have to shame other moms who make different parenting decisions. That they have to cling SO strongly to their parenting style and cannot tolerate the thought that a different approach might also be perfectly acceptable. After all, cultures all around the world raise kids successfully in wildly, shockingly different ways.But I think there’s something else at play: a deeper lack of understanding and support. So many of us don’t have real community, and we seem to have lost the sense of shared responsibility, the understanding that it really does take a village. We seem to have forgotten the true nature of kids—that they throw fits at inconvenient times, that they melt down, that their job is to test boundaries (my son’s specialty). We have no tolerance for their developmentally normal behavior. Which, at times, is absolutely horrific and crazy-making. And so we hold parents solely responsible for all of the actions of their children, and blame them when accidents happen and kids do normal (awful) kid stuff.How can we turn this culture of mommy-shaming around? Maybe we should start by setting healthy boundaries: in other words, just telling the mommy-shamers to fuck off. (In your own words.) They aren’t the experts on your kids; you are. Prioritize your own self-care by putting up a boundary and holding it firm. I just don’t allow judgmental types into my life. I don’t have time or energy for that. Only allowing positive people in my life is, to me, one of my most important forms of self-care.But we have to go beyond defending our healthy boundaries; we have to actively build our own culture of support. I think we can do this by being more active in our support of other parents, not just passive. In other words, step up. Say something when you see a mom struggling. Offer to help, even if it’s just walking with them to their car, distracting one kid for a minute so they can deal with the other kid, or sharing your own hard-won battle stories. Even just a few words of sympathy and solidarity can make a huge difference and can make parents feel so much less alone. Because when our kids are acting like little monsters or having horrific meltdowns, and everybody is looking at us, we might feel like they’re judging. But so often they’re just thinking, oh man, I’ve been there, THANK GOD it’s not my kid today. So if we’re thinking it, we need to SAY IT. It means the world to the other mom to feel support instead of judgement.I truly believe that most of us are more sympathetic than judgmental. It’s just that the judgmental bossypants of the world are more vocal. We need to drown them out. We should make it our personal goal to have a positive effect on our community of families, to work toward building that culture of support. If we all do that in our own little circles, we can have a real impact on “mom culture.”And for those who really are being judgmental and think they know everything—I don’t have room in my life for that, and I will hold firm to that boundary.And hey, maybe if we get lucky, that judgmental parent will have a kid JUST LIKE MINE.Previously published as ‘The Shame of Mommy-Shaming’ in Jami’s BEHIND DOMESTIC LINES column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comCome join our “Behind Domestic Lines” Facebook group, a safe community for parents to share their experiences and support each other.SUPPORT JAMI’S WRITING BY BECOMING A PATRONFor more great Wild Word essays see:The Stain That Trump Has Left on America by Maria BehanWhy the Morality in Wonder Woman Matters by Reverend Rachel KesslerMy S&M Marriage by James Prenatt"
29,ENTERTAINMENT,You Can Like Sofia Coppola And Ana Lily Amirpour Without Dismissing Their Critics' Concerns,"Michael Darer, ContributorStudent, Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/you-can-like-sofia-coppola-or-ana-lily-amirpour-without_us_5952b895e4b0f078efd9858b,"Recently, filmmakers Sofia Coppola and Ana Lily Amirpour have both come under fire for their most recent films’ (The Beguiled",2017-06-27,"<p>Responses to critiques of problematic whiteness in the work of Sofia Coppola, Patty Jenkins, and others, too often look to invalidate the concerns of the critic in service of lazy fandom.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952bd3217000026001030c4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Recently, filmmakers Sofia Coppola and Ana Lily Amirpour have both come under fire for their most recent films’ (The Beguiled and The Bad Batch, respectively) treatment of Black women. In Coppola’s case, the critique notes that her picture (a remake of the 1971 Don Siegel movie starring Clint Eastwood as a wounded Union soldier taking refuge in an all-girls boarding school in Mississippi during the American Civil War) excludes Black women entirely, going so far as to excise a character from the original film. That the picture takes place in the South, during a conflict fought over the issue of Black enslavement, and that the character who was removed was a female slave makes Coppola’s choices all the more suspect, despite her claim that she felt inclusion of such characters and the issues associated with them would complicate the story she trying to tell. For Amirpour, critics have pointed out the disproportionately gruesome violence The Bad Batch delivers unto its Black characters, further noting the filmmaker’s defensive and dismissive response to a Black woman who asked about this issue during a recent post-screening Q&A, as well as an incident in which the filmmaker was photographed in blackface. Similar criticisms have been lobbed at Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman, which upon release was heralded as a much-needed breath of inclusionary air for the superhero genre, and a welcome escape from the onanistic grim-darkness of DC Comics’ developing cinematic universe. Writers of color, particularly Black women, noted that while Jenkins’ film did include a number of women of color in the picture’s, their roles were relatively minor, and often haunted by the deeply problematic tropes that have long limited portrayals of Black women in media.Response to these critiques has been unsurprisingly quick and predictably fierce, as is often the case when white film fans feel as though Black critics have somehow stepped out of line by daring to note flaws in the work of a filmmaker these fans cherish. In many of these retorts, there’s been a familiar sort of sanctimony—the haphazard argument that not only should artists not be told who and what to include in their art, but that the choices to exclude or include should then be spared criticism once enacted.So far, there seem to be two major ways in which defenders of these directors (and most artists who have come under such criticism) frame their objections, and paint themselves as protectors of whatever artistic integrity they claim to be staning for. As with so many drawn out scuffles about making space for noxious speech in the so-called “marketplace of ideas” (not that any of these filmmakers are equivalent to a Milo Yiannopoulos or a Richard Spencer; that’s not the point), those opposed to the charges leveled against Jenkins, Amirpour, and Coppola have painted them as a sort of censorship—the enactment of some insidious agenda to shape art into a “politically correct” homogenous whole, governed by a set of moral principles that, if violated, disqualify the art’s existence. This, of course, is absurd. The equation of artistic and political critique with crackdown on expression seems to neglect the fact that Wonder Woman is currently available in theaters worldwide, The Beguiled is in limited release, and The Bad Batch is available to watch in theaters or stream online. No one’s being stifled.The second argument against critiques of these filmmakers is less outright unhinged, but markedly grosser: that those who have chosen to gesture towards deficiencies in these filmmakers’ work have shown themselves to be critically myopic, and unable to appreciate the work of talented creators. The logic, here, contends that, in missing the forest for the misogynoir trees, these critics are being unappreciative or dense. In a particularly wrongheaded piece for the website Birth.Movies.Death entitled “Support Female Filmmakers (As Long As They ‘Behave’)” (don’t worry—we will get to that title), writer Jacob Knight even goes so far as to depict these critics as working against the cause of women in cinema.Put as gently as possible, the essay is a masterclass in condescension and apologism, repeatedly downplaying the actions of the directors it’s defending (Amirpour’s mistreatment of the woman who asked her a question is blatantly mischaracterized and then lumped in with all other criticisms of her, blackface included, under the label “perceived bad behavior”), and misrepresenting the critics from whom it’s defending them (at one point Knight argues that there’s some sort of hypocrisy at play when Coppola is criticized but Jenkins is not, apparently missing the fact that both were discussed, often by the exact same critics). On the whole, the piece is about as concerned about the societal opportunities afforded to women as thinkpieces claiming that liberal women who refuse to support a bigot like Marine Le Pen are not truly feminist. It’s the equivalent of Taylor Swift saying that Tina Fey shouldn’t make fun of her, because women have to stick together. That’s what it is, at best.At worst, it’s a privileging of white women over Black women, arguing that opportunities afforded the former should be celebrated unconditionally by the latter, even when the fruits those opportunities yield contribute to the further erasure of Black women, thus continuing to limit their own opportunities and avenues for storytelling. It’s difficult, then, not to sneer at the title, which introduces the piece as a defense of a vulnerable group’s right to act outside of an oppressive norm, but fails to recognize that the actual content reveals Knight has something quite different on his mind. In truth, he is contesting the right of People of Color to have a say in their representation, and delegitimizing the means by which they choose to protect that, while defending filmmakers―who, by benefit of their platform, have more privilege than the people their elected narratives choose to erase and desiccate―from any sort of accountability or criticism.None of this is helped by the fact that the article often reads as though the author feels it is his duty to defend fragile white artists from the overreactions of Black women, whose reasonable critiques now constitute some inane form of violence. This, troublingly, echoes the history of racist rhetoric across disciplines, particularly in its association of Black women with irrationality and unreasonable anger. While it’s, most likely, safe to say this was not Mr. Knight’s intentions, the presence of this sort of characterization of Black women as unhinged (for simply asking that their experience be emotionally and artistically acknowledged and validated, no less) is important to recognize because it gestures towards the general problem of putting your love for an artist over someone else’s concern regarding that artist’s work, and the implications of how that work depicts and characterizes the world.Before diving further into this, it’s important to establish something up front: none of the critics who have discussed Sofia Coppola, Ana Lily Amirpour, or Patty Jenkins have said anything about their critiques making the films in question valueless. In fact, many of these critics found things they liked, whether in the directors’ most recent films or their filmography prior. You might not get that from reading the work of those who came to these artists’ defense, because most of those rebuttals seem to suggest that, embedded in the argument that the films in question have issues with representation and depiction of Black women, is the belief that we must never watch a Coppola picture, a Jenkins picture, or an Amirpour picture ever again.No one is saying that. It’s absolutely crucial to acknowledge this. No one is saying that Coppola, Jenkins, and Amirpour are suddenly worthless irredeemable artists.This seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding when it comes to critiquing problematic aspects of an author’s work, whether they be an actor, a filmmaker, a musician, an author, or a painter. To call out facets of a film that reflect ugly racial ideas, outmoded ideas about gender and sexuality, or troubling political structures is not an attempt to align those who enjoy those films with their unsavory components, but to provide an understanding of the ways that racism, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, ableism, and other such problems are embedded in our culture. Consider film critic Angelica Jade Bastien’s review of The Bad Batch, in which she writes: “That there is continuous, grisly violence isn’t surprising considering the dystopian setting the characters find themselves trapped in. But how this violence is shot proves telling. Amirpour and Vincent are never more gruesome or detailed than when it comes to the deaths of two black characters.”The point of this observation is not to accuse viewers who leave Amirpour’s film satisfied of sanctioning or enjoying the excessively voyeuristic murder of Black characters on screen. It’s not to automatically align the audience with the disturbing undertones of these scenes. Rather, observations like these serve to problematize our blind acceptance of certain features of the art we consume. Why did Amirpour amplify the violence in these instances? Did she do so intentionally? If she didn’t, what does that say about how numb we are to violence against People of Color, specifically Black people? Did you as an audience member notice the discrepancy in violence? Did the violence as it was inflicted upon different characters of different races affect you or the film in different ways?In considering questions like these, we are asked to confront the implications of the problematic aspects of film, and how their proliferation in art and society influences the way we interact with those most affected by them. Critics such as Ms. Bastien are not asking you to disavow your enjoyment of the film, some of which you might not even connect to a specific facet that grabbed you. They are simply providing a more holistic vision of the ideas on display, and suggesting that it’s important to recognize the destructive and negative ideas that persist in art, especially in the art we love.This is what people mean when they say that a film is problematic, an artist is problematic, “your fave is problematic.” They are not demanding that you disavow what moves you, but that you responsibly recognize the unpleasant aspects of that art, that you simply don’t consume the art you love blindly, lazily, or unquestioningly. Often times, what you love about an artist and what makes them problematic may be two disconnected elements; other times, they are linked in ways you might not have realized. In either case, conscious and mindful consumption of that artist demands that we use our passion for them to examine rather than excuse their failings as creators and as people.It’s often said that, when you get down to it, every single person loves an artist with sizable faults. This is most likely true. But, it’s important not to use this as an excuse to shy away from uncomfortable engagement with critique, on the pretense that whoever leveled those critiques is some sort of a hypocrite. If everyone has strong connections with problematic art, then that level of engagement is even more necessary, ensuring that everyone doesn’t simply retreat into excusing what they love, simply because they love it.Really, the main issue with the consumption of problematic art is when those problems are treated as unimportant, invalid, or petty, when we choose to ignore the legitimate concern or pain of another because it interferes with our enjoyment of a song or a film. This is where things become truly toxic. Looking back momentarily to Jacob Knight’s essay, one can see this attitude of full display. At its core, the piece is less interested in engaging with the issues raised by critics, than painting them as silly or naïve or destructive, anything but legitimate. Despite the fact that most voices in the debate made no attempts to bar Mr. Knight from enjoying the work of his choice of directors or even punish him for doing so, he felt the need to write a piece as if they did. The argument was never about the legitimacy of one’s enjoyment of a director, but retorts such as Mr. Knight’s decided it was necessary to frame the entire issue around the legitimacy of a historically underrepresented population speaking to their ongoing representational struggle. What began as a conversation about a specific failing of a specific filmmaker, was misrepresented by defenders of said filmmaker as a conversation about artistic integrity and then transformed and weaponized by those same defenders into an assault on Black women for having the gall to speak about their own experiences.This is not a unique trend, nor is it a benign one. The refusal to acknowledge minority critiques of art and the reflex to run to the defense of the artist by undercutting the critique and the experience of the critic, is, at its core, a tactic for dehumanization. While, perhaps, not always consciously employed as such, this pattern is ultimately about asserting that the appropriate, dignified, and honest representation of Black individuals, their history, and personal complexity is secondary to the preservation of white comfort, and entrenched artistic norms.Neither art nor its creation exist in a vacuum; that much borders on cliché. But, embedded in that, is something just as important, if perhaps less spoken: if we want to valorize art as something truly powerful, something honest and human and remarkable for its capabilities, then we must take it seriously enough to level truthful, sometimes harsh critiques. We must recognize its potential for toxicity as much as we recognize its potential for transcendence. We must admit to ourselves that the power of art is not governed by what we see and enjoy alone, that dismissal of critiques that threaten our comfort and status are not defenses of the art, but of our right to be solipsistic, selfish, and lazy. Assuming we genuinely subscribe to the notion that art is redemptive, transformative, and elemental, we cannot suddenly demand criticism that treats the problems in the medium as trivial or manufactured for the purpose of “outrage culture.”If we refuse this, and choose to settle on blind and dangerous apologism, then the supposed power of art is wasted on us."

They smiled and joked as negotiators from both sides, the DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson and the Conservatives’ Gavin Williamson signed the deal.The details of the deal were not immediately released.A deal would allow May to pass legislation with the backing of the DUP in the 650-seat parliament, and stay in power as she attempts to negotiate Britain’s exit from the European Union.But May’s position remains insecure. Her Brexit strategy is under scrutiny and her future as prime minister is the subject of public debate.Some senior Conservatives have voiced unease at a deal with the DUP, saying it could put at risk the 1998 peace settlement in Northern Ireland, known as the Good Friday Agreement. Foster said a deal with May could help drive a second deal on power sharing in the province.Northern Ireland has been in crisis since Sinn Fein pulled out of government in January, prompting an election in March and a series of missed deadlines to restore the compulsory coalition between Irish Catholic nationalists and pro-British Protestant unionists.“I think that this agreement will bring the prospects of doing a deal at (the Belfast parliament) Stormont closer because this will have a positive impact in relation to Northern Ireland,” Foster told Sky earlier, adding that a second deal on power sharing in the province could be reached this week too.“I very much hope that this week we will be able to conclude on two agreements.”The latest deadline set by the British government for the parties in Northern Ireland to reach an agreement is Thursday. Sinn Fein said last week that “time was running out” given the lack of knowledge about the impact of any Conservative/DUP deal."

But they warn that support may wane if congressmen are forced to vote several times to protect Temer - whose popularity is languishing in single-digits - from trial.Temer’s office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, did not respond to requests for comment. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of any wrongdoing.Temer was charged in connection with a graft scheme involving the world’s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. Executives said in plea-bargain testimony the president took nearly $5 million in bribes for resolving tax matters, freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters.Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, recorded a conversation with Temer in which the president appears to condone bribing a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal donations for his Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB).For more than three years, investigators in Brazil have uncovered stunning levels of corruption enveloping the political class and business elites. Much of it centered on companies paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run enterprises for lucrative contracts.Temer and one-third of his cabinet, as well as four former presidents and dozens of lawmakers are under investigation or already charged in the schemes.The scandals reduce the chances that Temer can push through reforms crucial for Latin America’s biggest economy to rebound from its worst recession on record.Key lawmakers in Temer’s alliance told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, they will halt work on proposed labor reforms if forced to vote on charges against the president.Temer’s supporters say they have between 250 and 300 votes in the 513 seat lower house to block a trial. But the president is expected to soon face charges of racketeering and obstruction of justice, each requiring a separate vote.On Monday, the federal police recommended charging Temer with obstruction of justice - the first step toward a new round of charges.(Additional reporting by Lisandra Paraguassu; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Tom Brown)"
33,POLITICS,Supreme Court Tosses Case On Cross-Border Shootings Back To Lower Court,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hernandez-mesa-ruling_us_594d6333e4b02734df2a4cad,The question of whether the family of a 15-year-old Mexican national killed near the border can sue the agent who shot him will return to the 5th Circuit.,2017-06-26,"The place where in 2010 Mexican 15-year-old Sergio Hernandez was killed by a police officer from the United States on the Mexican bank of the Rio Grande in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594d626f1700001f0010284d.jpeg?cache=RSnmNcw0Dd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Monday declined to decide on whether non-citizens have constitutional rights at the border, and ordered the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to reconsider the question of whether the families of Mexican nationals killed by U.S. border authorities can sue in federal court.The lower court will again decide whether the family of Sergio Hernandez, a 15-year-old Mexican national fatally shot by a U.S. border patrol agent near the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010, has the right to sue the agent. Previously, the 5th Circuit found that Hernandez didn’t have constitutional protections.On Monday, the Supreme Court vacated that ruling and ordered the lower court to reconsider the case. “The facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life. Whether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions that are best answered by the Court of Appeals in the first instance,” reads the ruling. Three justices dissented: Clarence Thomas, who was in favor of upholding the lower court ruling, and Steven Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who in a joint dissent penned by Breyer said they would reverse the lower court ruling with regards to the Fourth Amendment question and allow the Hernandez family to seek damages.Because oral arguments were heard prior to Justice Neil Gorsuch joining the Supreme Court, just eight justices considered the case.On July 7, 2010, Hernandez was playing with friends along the Rio Grande, between the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas, and the Mexican city of Ciudad Juárez. A U.S. Border Patrol agent, Jesús Mesa Jr, saw the boys and assumed they were attempting to illegally cross the border. Mesa grabbed one boy, but others fled. A Justice Department investigation found that some of the boys began to “hurl rocks” at Mesa. (There is no evidence that Hernandez threw anything at Mesa.) Mesa then saw Hernandez, who was taking cover behind a bridge on the Mexican side of the river, and shot him in the face, killing him.The Justice Department declined to prosecute Mesa in 2012, arguing that he acted in self-defense. The U.S. government declined to extradite him to Mexico for prosecution.A civil liability claim is the family’s last option in seeking justice for the killing. Hernandez’s parents, María Guadalupe Güereca and Jesús Hernandez, sued Mesa in federal court with the help of a Texas law firm, arguing that the agent violated their son’s constitutional rights.Federal judges repeatedly rejected the family’s claims, saying the Constitution does not apply to a non-citizen not on U.S. soil. Those rejections relied on a 1990 Supreme Court ruling, United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, that found non-citizens must have a “substantial connection” to the U.S. in order to be granted constitutional protections while in a foreign country. (Another key Supreme Court decision, Boumediene v. Bush, found in 2007 that foreign-born detainees held at Guantanmo Bay have due-process rights to challenge their detentions.)There was no specific legal standard, however, for whether constitutional rights apply in cross-border situations involving non-citizens. If Hernandez was a U.S. citizen, his constitutional rights would be assured, no matter where he was at the time of the shooting. And he would have been afforded those same rights had the shooting occurred on the U.S. side of the river.But because the shooting took place in what lawyers representing Hernandez’s family described as “a unique no-man’s land—a law-free zone in which U.S. agents can kill innocent civilians with impunity,” Hernandez’s rights were murky.In 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Mesa, concluding that because Hernandez was on Mexican soil and was “a Mexican citizen who had no significant voluntary connection,” he had no U.S. constitutional protections.Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to take on the case. The court heard oral arguments in February, appearing split over whether the Constitution should apply in cross-border situations.Justice Department lawyers argued that the matter shouldn’t be for courts to decide, due to foreign-policy implications.“You have a cross-border incident, which necessarily gives rise to foreign-relations problems, which are committed to the political branches,” Justice Department lawyer Edwin Kneedler argued.The justices, meanwhile, grappled with how to establish a standard narrow enough to not open up the U.S. government to civil liability for other incidents on foreign soil.“How do you analyze the case of a drone strike in Iraq, where the plane is piloted from Nevada?” Chief Justice John Roberts asked Hilliard during arguments. “Why wouldn’t the same analysis apply in that case?”But Hilliard, the attorney representing Hernandez’s parents, argued that the standard could be specific enough to not apply to military operations. Domestic law enforcement officers, such as Border Patrol agents, should be subject to the Constitution, he argued.“Right now, while they’re in the United States, their boots never leave the country, and it’s the government’s position that the Constitution turns off like a light switch at the border, and they are unconstrained by our U.S. Constitution,” Hilliard said.Read more background of the case here."

China and Norway normalized ties in December last year.Shang Baojun, Liu’s lawyer, confirmed the news of Liu’s treatment in the city of Shenyang, and said the medical parole had been approved, in messages seen by Reuters.When asked about Liu, China’s foreign ministry, the only government body that will regularly answer questions from the foreign media, said it was not aware of the situation.The public security ministry and justice ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment.Liu Xia, Liu’s wife who has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize, is suffering from depression but has been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month, a source close to the dissident told Reuters.Liu was not allowed to attend his father-in-law’s funeral last year and his mother-in-law’s funeral this year, said the source who asked not to be identified.Liu had been incarcerated at Jinzhou Penitentiary in Liaoning, his home province in northeast China, before being moved to the hospital for treatment.A man who answered the telephone at the Shenyang hospital where Liu is being treated said he could not check information on individual cases as there were too many patients in the hospital.Rights group Amnesty International also confirmed the news of Liu’s illness in a tweet.Amnesty International’s China Researcher, William Nee, said authorities should ensure Liu was receiving adequate medical care and he called for the immediate and unconditional release of Liu and his wife.“Obviously, it’s a shameful situation and it’s incredibly sad to see one of China’s most prominent intellectuals suffer from such a terrible illness when he never should’ve been detained in the first place,” Nee said.He also called for the Nobel Committee and the international community to speak up “forcefully” for Liu now.Tibetan writer and family friend Tsering Woeser said she had been in tears after reading reports of Liu’s illness online.“I’m shocked and deeply saddened,” she told Reuters. “All we can do now is pray for him.”In Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which oversees the Nobel Peace Prize, declined to comment on reports of Liu’s hospitalization. “Our policy is that we do not comment on individual laureates,” an official said."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595145dc1500004b1f9002f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Is Charles Koch a climate change denier? Charles Koch would say you’re asking the wrong question.“Obviously, if the temperature continues to go up, at some point it can be harmful or even very harmful,” the billionaire Republican megadonor said during an interview last week on Freakonomics Radio. “But the question is, ‘What do we do about it, about whatever risk there is?’ And to me, the answer is innovation.” “There are natural causes and then there are causes due to increase in greenhouse gases ― such as CO2, being the biggest one,” he added. On the face of it, that admission may seem like a shift coming from a man who, with his brother David, bankrolled a conservative movement bent on hacking away environmental regulations and helped transform the GOP into the only major political party in the developed world to deny the overwhelming evidence of manmade global warming. But, to scientists, Koch remains a climate pariah who has learned how to temper his message for audiences who don’t buy into the view that industry players are somehow more credible than impartial researchers. “It’s just no longer credible to deny out of hand that climate change is happening or even that it’s human-caused,” Michael Mann, a climatologist at Penn State University and co-author of a new book on climate change denialism, told HuffPost on Monday. “So the forces of denial ― the special interests, the polluting interests ― have instead turned to a new talking point that they think they might be able to get away with.”Freedom Partners, the Koch brothers’ political arm, did not respond to a request for comment. The basics of scientists’ understanding of climate change can be communicated in five key points: It’s real, it’s caused by humans, it’s bad, the experts agree, and there’s still hope for fixing it, according to John Cook, a research assistant professor at George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. “When you look at all the climate denial arguments, they’re basically the flip of all that: It’s not real, it’s not us, it’s not bad, the experts disagree or the experts are unreliable, and there’s no hope, we can’t fix it,” Cook told HuffPost. “You expect them to be moving along that spectrum.” Faced with the third-consecutive hottest year on record, historic deadly flooding, and increasingly abnormal weather, you might expect a strategic retreat of sorts, wherein people who once denied climate change outright now acknowledge its existence but cast doubt over its causes. That has happened to some extent. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Energy Secretary Rick Perry argue that climate change is real, but burning fossil fuels has little to no effect. But that reasoning ― which sounds measured compared to outright denial of observable phenomena ― has been employed for years to undermine climate science, and does not represent an evolution on the issue. The spectrum of climate science denialism, that argument included, has not changed much over the past two decades, according to a 2015 U.K. study analyzing 16,000 documents from conservative think tanks. “They’re doubling down on their science denial,” Cook said, citing the study. “The reason why is that what drives climate science denial is ideology, and that’s not changed.”The philosophical belief that, left alone, the free market will produce industries and technologies to curb climate change before it becomes catastrophic is flawed. Economist Milton Friedman, the so-called patron saint of laissez faire capitalism who popularized the belief that corporations should pursue profit and shareholder value above all, argued there is little incentive to preserve the environment without some form of government intervention.“You need a price on the emission of carbon if you’re going to level the playing field,” Mann said. “Even Milton Friedman understood the existence of market externalities, the fact that damage to our environment is not accounted for in the free market without placing some sort of price signal.”The most popular solution among economists is putting a tax on carbon emissions. In February, a group of Republican elder statesmen introduced a plan for a $40 carbon tax that would be returned to taxpayers in the form of a carbon dividend. A cadre of oil and gas giants, including Exxon Mobil Corp., endorsed the proposal earlier this month. But the proposition faces dim prospects of becoming law under the Trump administration, which has vowed to pump up the oil, gas and coal industries. Booming U.S. oil production ― bolstered by advancements in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology ― has helped keep oil prices low since they plummeted in mid-2014. The price per barrel now hovers just above $40. Without some incentive from policymakers to invest in zero-emissions energy such as wind, solar or hydropower, the world is likely to warm well past 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century. That temperature rise would drastically alter the climate, submerge coastal communities and could create up to 2 billion refugees. “Both government policy and low-carbon technological innovations are going to be critical to keeping warming within 2C,” James Leaton, research director at the U.K.-based financial think tank Carbon Tracker, told HuffPost by email. “Obviously policy and technology interact and cannot be seen in isolation ― with policy stimulating technological deployment, and rapid roll-out reducing the future level of policy required. Both can impact the relative financial attractiveness of future energy options.”That is, unless you’re a Koch brother, whose eponymous company, Koch Industries, earns much of its $115 billion annual revenue from pipelines, chemicals and oil refinement.  “These policies that the U.S. government has, others have proposed or promulgated, have been just symbolic,” Koch said in the interview. “We oppose all of these because they end up being cronyism. They end up helping certain wealthy people to the disadvantage of the less fortunate.”Sometimes, the pot calls the kettle black. But in this case, the kettle is filled with a solution to clean up the greasy mess left behind by the pot. And the pot is a fossil fuel tycoon with a net worth roughly the size of Bulgaria’s gross domestic product. “It’s one thing to be an ignorant fool, but it’s quite something else to allow one’s malicious ignorance to potentially threaten the entire planet,” Mann said. “That is what is so pernicious about [Koch’s] continued denial of the threat of climate change, and the extent to which they have been able to pollute our entire political discourse by using their political wealth to confuse the public and policymakers about the reality of this existential threat.” "
38,POLITICS,Climate Change Could Threaten Up To 2 Billion Refugees By 2100,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-refugees_us_59506463e4b0da2c731c5e73,"""It's coming at us faster than we thought.""",2017-06-26,"In this August 2016 photo, a family on a raft approaches a boat in a flooded area of Jamalpur, Bangladesh.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5950653b1500004b1f9000ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Charles Geisler, a sociologist at Cornell University, spent much of his career researching where poor people go when rich corporations swoop in and buy the land out from under their feet. But his focus began to shift in 2005, after observing how storm surges tainted farmland in Bangladesh with salt water. Later that year, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, submerging communities once believed to be safe behind levees and dikes. As floodwaters inundated Vietnam’s Mekong Delta last year, Geisler’s new worldview came into sharp relief.The rising sea, he surmised, is the one displacement force more powerful than greed. Geisler began collating climate and demographic research, and came to a dire conclusion: By the year 2100, rising sea levels could force up to 2 billion people inland, creating a refugee crisis among one-fifth of the world’s population.Worse yet, there won’t be many places for those migrants to go.His findings appear in the July issue of the journal Land Use Policy. “We have a pending crisis,” Geisler, a professor emeritus of development sociology at Cornell, told HuffPost. “This relocation and huge mass migration from the coastal zone, it’s going to take place in this century and the next century.”To get the 2 billion figure, Geisler extrapolated from a 2015 study published in the journal PLOS One. That research predicted that by 2060, there would be some 1.4 billion people living in low-lying coastal regions at risk from sea level rise. Drawing from nearly a dozen other studies, Geisler and his co-author, the University of Kentucky climate researcher Ben Currens, modeled what he called a “rather extreme scenario.” “The paper is the worst-case scenario,” Geisler said. “We looked for estimates in these various barriers to entry that were coming from the most draconian changes that could hit us from climate change and sea level rise.” Geisler outlined three obstacles, or “barriers to entry,” to relocating people driven inland from their homes by rising seas. The first problem is that climate change isn’t just affecting coastal communities. Droughts and desertification could make areas safe from sea level rise uninhabitable at worst, and incapable of sustaining a large influx of migrants at best, Geisler said. The second issue is closely linked: If climate refugees flock to cities, increasing the urban sprawl into land once used to farm food, those metropoles could lose the ability to feed their inflated populations.The third issue involves physical and legal barriers, meaning regions and municipalities might erect walls and post guards to prevent climate migrants from entering and settling down. Geisler dubbed this phenomenon the “no-trespass zone.” Geisler warned that too much of the conversation around climate adaptation is focused on building sea walls, learning to live with regular flooding, and relocating communities inland, as has happened in Alaska. These limited ideas of “adaptation” could leave humanity woefully unprepared for a mass migration that Geisler said could dwarf the current refugee crisis in Europe, driven by war, poverty and drought-linked famine in regions south and east of the continent. At least 65.6 million people have fled their homes, and the United Nations estimates that 20 people are forcibly displaced every minute by war and persecution alone. Adding unfettered climate change to that mix threatens to yield human catastrophe on a scale that is difficult to describe without sounding bombastic.The U.S. is particularly at risk. Millions of mainland Americans could be forced to flee inland, sending the populations of at least nine coastal states downward, according a University of Georgia study released in April. Texas alone could have to take in as many as 2.5 million internal migrants.“My hope is that this paper will reorient planners and policymakers who use the term ‘adaptation’ in a very narrow way,” Geisler said. “It’s used either to mean fortifying coastal structures to keep the sea off the land, or it’s used to refer to moving a population from a coastal zone in some organized way.” There are better ways to prepare, he said. He pointed to four counties in South Florida that began sharing hydrological data and research on the rate of sea level rise, then drafted a joint evacuation plan. Dealing with the possible results of runaway climate change requires “transboundary” planning, he said.“Climate change is going to be with us for a long time, and the coastal zone population is going to be overwhelming as it moves inland,” Geisler said. “How are we going to employ these people? Where are we going to house them? What energy sources are they going to need?”“Bottom line: Far more people are going to be living on far less land, and land that is not as fertile and habitable and sustainable as the low-elevation coastal zone,” he added. “And it’s coming at us faster than we thought.” "

41,POLITICS,NY Assembly Passes Bill That Would Help Asian-Americans In Need Get Resources,Kimberly Yam,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/data-disaggregation-bill-new-york_us_594d5694e4b05c37bb7635dc,"""This bill would improve our understanding of New York’s Asian-American and Pacific Islander community,” one lawmaker says.",2017-06-26,A bill in the New York State Assembly could have an impact on issues like poverty and mental health among Asian-Americans. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59514c151700001f00102d71.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Legislators are one step closer to a big win for Asian-Americans. The New York State Assembly recently passed a bill that would require state agencies to collect data on specific ethnicities like Vietnamese, Laotian and Pakistani rather than broad groupings such as Asian-American.Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou (D), the bill’s sponsor, explained to HuffPost that the bill would help lawmakers better address the diverse experiences of Asian-American subgroups. “This bill would improve our understanding of New York’s Asian-American and Pacific Islander community,” said the legislator, who serves as the first person of Asian descent to represent New York City’s Chinatown in the state Assembly. “Right now, the data collected paints a very broad picture and suggests that Asian-American and Pacific Islanders are a homogeneous group.”The passage of the bill marks one of the first victories of the state’s task force on Asian-American issues, which launched in May. Niou noted last month that to garner support for the bill, she sent her colleagues a HuffPost report on the problems associated with treating Asians as a homogenous group. Shortly afterward, a legislative committee approved the legislation unanimously. The change, experts say, would make a huge difference. Currently, the data paints a misleading picture of Asian-Americans, ignoring the vastly different experiences of individual ethnic groups.People from Vietnamese or Pakistani communities, for example, are more likely to struggle economically compared to people from the Chinese or Indian communities, according to Christian E. Weller, a senior fellow at the Center For American Progress who co-penned a report on Asian-American wealth disparity.Essentially, averages don’t tell the full story, Jo-Ann Yoo, executive director of the social services nonprofit Asian American Federation, told HuffPost. “The needs of the refugee community may be different than a community that has been here for several generations,” Yoo said. “The Asian-American community ― or any other community ― cannot be painted with a single, broad brush stroke.”The bill has the potential to address several pressing issues, including poverty and mental health. Asian-Americans have the highest poverty rate in New York City compared to people of other races. Older Asian-Americans and refugees also have comparatively high rates of mental health issues.However, without the proper data to illustrate these challenges, along with the persistence of the “model minority” stereotype, the government has barely devoted any resources to tackling the issues, experts say. In fact, in New York City, Asian-Americans only received 1.4 percent of the city’s social service funds over a 13-year period. “For the Asian American community, we continue to be stymied by the ‘model minority’ myth that we can succeed without support,” Yoo said. “That is not reality!”The state Senate has yet to take action on the bill, but Niou said she’ll be working with Ron Kim (D), the only other Asian-American in the state Assembly, to advocate for the legislation. Niou is optimistic that with more awareness, her colleagues will place more importance on Asian-American issues. “I have had many more conversations with folks about this issue over time, and people’s views have started to change,” she said. “I think we all hope that as our conversations move forward, that our colleagues in the state Senate will also prioritize our community.”"

With resolution of the claims the family will continue to deal with their loss through the important work of the Philando Castile Relief Foundation.”The city said the settlement would avoid a federal wrongful death lawsuit and that taxpayer money would not be used to fund it.The announcement comes roughly a week after a jury found Jeronimo Yanez, the former St. Anthony Police Department officer who fatally shot Castile, not guilty of second-degree manslaughter. Yanez, who had been on leave and was asked to leave the city’s police force following the verdict, claimed he shot the 32-year-old school cafeteria worker because he feared for his life.Disturbing dashcam video released by law enforcement officials last week showed Castile clearly telling Yanez he was carrying a firearm. Yanez can be heard telling Castile to not pull out the gun to which Castile replied several times that he wasn’t. Yanez then fatally shot Castile in the chest.Castile’s slaying was also captured on video by his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, and sparked weeks of protests across St. Paul and Minneapolis last year.Last week, the family of Michael Brown, a black teenager whose fatal shooting by a white police officer in August 2014 also sparked large-scale protests, agreed on a settlement in a lawsuit against the city of Ferguson, Missouri.Brown’s parents will receive $1.5 million paid through the city’s insurance company, an attorney representing Ferguson announced Friday. A grand jury decided in November 2014 not to indict Darren Wilson, the former Ferguson police officer who shot and killed the unarmed 18-year-old.This article has been updated with more details about the settlement and video of the incident."
43,POLITICS,White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer Continues To Leave The Press And Public In The Dark,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-spicer-restricted-press-briefing_us_5950f2aee4b0da2c731cc51f,"On Monday, Spicer will again answer questions from reporters in a restricted setting.",2017-06-26,White House press secretary Sean Spicer has held fewer and fewer on-camera press briefings.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5950f3371700001f00102bfe.jpeg?cache=8W7iJRtjxo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Continuing an alarming pattern of the White House shutting out the press and the public and curtailing transparency, White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday will answer questions from reporters in a restricted setting. TV networks will not be allowed to broadcast Monday’s press briefing and will be able to air only audio of Spicer’s responses to reporters. Previously, the White House did not even allow audio of the off-camera “gaggles,” but relented last week after protest from the press.Spicer has given only two public briefings in the past two weeks. The last time Spicer briefed reporters on camera was Tuesday. That followed more than a week of no public briefings. Instead, he and deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders have increasingly opted for off-camera “gaggles,” answering questions from reporters in private — and leaving the public in the dark.“We have a tremendous respect for the First Amendment,” Spicer said during his last on-camera briefing last Tuesday. He then defended the decision to restrict press access, saying the daily briefing is just “one aspect of what we do.”Some reporters have called for greater pushback and more collective action from the press, such as boycotting the briefings.“It just doesn’t make any sense to me,” CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta said last week. “It just feels like we’re sort of slowly but surely being dragged into a new normal in this country where the president of the United States is allowed to insulate himself from answering hard questions.”Reuters’ Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said Friday that he had raised the issue with Spicer and Sanders.In a memo to WHCA members, Mason wrote that “gaggles are not a substitute for the open back-and-forth between reporters and administration officials that regular televised briefings allow” and that reporters “need video and sound to tell Americans what the government is doing in their name.”“We believe strongly that Americans should be able to watch and listen to senior government officials face questions from an independent news media,” Mason wrote. “We are not satisfied with the current state of play, and we will work hard to change it.”The White House’s restricted press briefings follow a broader pattern of hostility and reduced transparency toward the press. Trump himself has given relatively few press conferences and interviews while in office, mostly taking questions from friendly news outlets such as Fox News.In response to a question about the off-camera briefings, and amid reports that Spicer is searching for his own replacement, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon last week offered this explanation: “Sean got fatter.”"

Miller's Dad Told Him That 'Silicon Valley' Was Starting To Suck,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tj-miller-silicon-valley_us_5951164ee4b02734df2bdee7,The comedian just revealed why he left the show.,2017-06-26,"T.J. Miller (right) has given fans more than a few reasons why he decided to leave ""Silicon Valley.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595117e7290000cc0f3b123f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"About a month ago, HBO revealed that while its hit show “Silicon Valley” will be returning for another season, one of its foremost stars, T.J. Miller, will not. The news caused a mild uproar among the show’s dedicated fan base and led to questions about why Miller would not be coming back.In a lengthy new interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Miller gives more than a few reasons. While the comedian had kind words to say about many people on the show ― and said he felt he was leaving the show “at its height” to let other characters grow ― he also made it clear he thought “Silicon Valley” had some problems. “I just thought that what the show has suffered from, what’s bad about it, is that Richard is the CEO and then he isn’t but then he finds his way back to be CEO, and then once he finds his way back to being the CEO he says he doesn’t want to be the CEO, and it’s just the same thing over and over,” Miller said.He added: “And even my father when I told him that I was leaving was like, ‘Yeah, we watched three or four episodes in a row and it’s kind of one-note. I think it’s a good idea [to leave].’ So I had the perfect father-son moment with him going, “Yeah, it’s starting to kind of suck. It’s a little stale. You’re becoming a bit hack.”Miller clearly adores many of the other actors on the show, especially Zach Woods (Jared) and Jimmy O. Yang (Jian-Yang). But Miller also took some parting shots on his way out, saying things like, “I don’t like [‘Silicon Valley’ executive producer] Alec [Berg].”“He went to Harvard, and we all know those kids are f**king idiots. That Crimson trash. Those comedy writers in Hollywood are f**king Harvard graduates and that’s why they’re smug as a bug,” Miller said.Perhaps even more notably, Miller revealed some quiet tension with the show’s star, Thomas Middleditch, who plays Pied Piper CEO Richard Hendricks. When the reporter asked how the cast members responded to his departure, Miller began, “This is where the publicist is supposed to step in and go, ‘Next question.’”He said that Woods, Kumail Nanjiani (Dinesh) and Martin Starr (Gilfoyle) all took the news well. But Miller didn’t mention Middleditch until later, when he said, “A very good article was written that says that Erlich in the show is just this constant annoyance to Richard ... And I think in some ways, that is analogous to real life.”“We [Miller and Middleditch] have a contrarian relationship, like a big brother-little brother relationship. And this is also an opportunity for me to be like, ‘Let me just step off, dude. Like, just do your f**king thing. You’re amazing.’”Anyway, if you’re hoping that Miller will ever return for a cameo, the answer certainly sounds like “no.”“I will never be on ‘Silicon Valley’ again,” he said. “That character, as you have seen, disappeared into the ether.”"
45,BLACK VOICES,More Reasons Than Race In Why Cops Walk Free,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorEarl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-reasons-than-race-in-why-cops-walk-free_us_59509627e4b0f078efd982f0,Prosecutors know the odds are stacked against them in convicting cops who kill.,2017-06-26,"A still image captured from a dashcam video from Tulsa Police Department shows Terence Crutcher with his hands in the air followed by police officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S. on September 16, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59515a62290000cc0f3b1366.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Samuel DuBose, Sylville Smith, Philando Castile, and Terence Crutcher, Tulsa cop. Four black men slain by police in three cities at four different times. The circumstances in all four cases, though, were, eerily the same. The killings came after stops by the officers. The men apparently posed no physical threat to the officers. Two were shot while running away. The other two were shot in their cars. There was chilling video footage of the killings. The only twist in the shootings was that two of the officers who were not convicted, one was a mistrial, were not white cops. One was Black, the other Hispanic. All four were either acquitted or there was a mistrial. The non-convictions of the cops brought the recent scorecard on police shootings of black men, to 0 out of 4. This is just the latest grim count of unsuccessful prosecutions in dubious police shootings of blacks when the cops are hauled into a criminal courtroom.The police killings of black men, who in most of cases were unarmed, and the non-convictions of the cops who kill them has become not only commonplace, but expected. It makes no difference whether there’s a video that shows beyond any question that the victims posed no threat to the officers, had no weapon, or were shot from a distance, often in the back. The universal shout is that the killings and the acquittals of the police who kill them are simply more proof that the system is violent, racist, and hateful of black men whose lives have no value. That may be. But it doesn’t tell why cops have virtually a guaranteed walk free pass from judges, juries, and prosecutors the rare times that they do wind up in a court docket in the killing of a young black.The reason for that tells much about the way the over use of deadly force by officers is treated within the criminal justice system. The starting point is the decision to prosecute the officer. There are two absolute indispensable elements for that to happen. One, the video footage of the killing that appears to show beyond any doubt that the officer wantonly killed the suspect. The other is that there is mass public outrage, protests, or even the threat of violent disruptions, if there isn’t a prosecution. Even then, prosecutors tread very deliberately and warily, knowing that getting a conviction is a fierce uphill slog. The defense attorneys for the accused cops make that a certainty.They are among the best in the defense trial business with lots of experience defending police officers accused of misconduct. Police unions bankroll their defense and spare no expense. The officers are immediately bailed out and they will serve no actual pre-trial jail time. Their defense attorneys have three time-tested legal ploys. One is they play for time. They know that memories dim and passions cool, and the cases quickly drop from public and media focus. They file countless motions demanding the charges be dropped or reduced. They’ll occasionally demand a change of venue. In each case, the time clock is running in the case.They often seek a bench trial, but when that is denied, no matter, the clock is still running pending a decision. If the case goes to jury, defense attorneys seek to get as many middle-class people, whites and even blacks and Latinos, on the jury as possible. The presumption is that they are much more likely to believe the testimony of police and police defense witnesses than black witnesses, defendants, or even the victims.The negative perceptions of blacks, especially black males, by much of the public is one problem. The even more daunting problem is that there is no ironclad standard of what is or isn’t an acceptable use of force in police killings. It comes down to a judgment call by the officer. The time-tested standard that is virtually encoded in law is that “I feared for my life.” This will be stated, massaged, and repeated in every conceivable way by defense attorneys during their presentation. They’ll bolster that by painting a vivid and fearful picture of the defendant as violent and aggressive. The message being that the use of deadly force was both necessary and justified. The cases often hinge heavily on the video footage that will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the officer overused deadly force. It does no such thing. Defense attorneys twist, turn, dissect, re-dissect, analyze and reanalyze the footage from every earthly angle. They claim that it really doesn’t show what led up to the slaying, doesn’t fully show the danger to the officer, doesn’t show the officers giving instructions to him to comply, and is too limited in the angle that it was shot. They will have a use of force and a technical expert testify to the validity of that claim. It’s still a matter of what you see is not what you see in these cases.Prosecutors know the odds are stacked against them in convicting cops who kill because of those odds. The recent shut out in convicting them does nothing to change those odds.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst. He is an associate editor of New America Media.

Lisa Murkowski (R-AL) as she speaks to the media, January 27, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595121f41700001f00102cc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an era of hucksters and lies, the truth is hard to identify. So are political strategies. But its worth trying. The Senate health care bill is a case in point.There are traditional political tactics that have survived the test of time and are used by everyone because they’ve worked. If you apply them to the politics of the Senate bill, things clarify.The question arises because the bill is breathtakingly cruel, widely and deeply unpopular in the country and damages millions who live in states with Republican senators. Most senators, Republicans included, don’t casually embrace that kind of legislation. They had originally promised to substantially ameliorate the House bill, which was bad enough that even President Trump called it “mean.” Instead they produced something that was in many ways even meaner.The immediate result has been a flight to safety from hard-right ideologues and incumbents in swing states not anxious to jump off an electoral cliff. It appears that there are insufficient votes to pass the thing.This is not the kind of miscalculation that Majority Leader McConnell is prone to make. He knows his members and he can count.There is a method to his madness, or rather methods. Both are grounded in the new Republican reality. The Republican base is pro-Trump, anti-compromise, and anti-health care legislation. A Senate bill that retains the core of Obamacare will enrage the beast. Republican primary voters will not countenance such a thing.For dozens of Republican incumbents you can’t even begin to negotiate a substitute for the House bill until you’ve proved your reliability. By voting yes on the McConnell proposal, they are inoculated against charges of insufficient toughness and cruelty. Only then can something less devastating be considered. Advance the bill knowing it will be defeated.Fear of the base. Remember, primaries come before general elections. Both left and right are seeking tactics that protect them from the base and allow them to seriously address broader concerns. These strategies have been polled and focus-grouped. They are not new and they’ve worked. Think of the way many Democrats advanced a single-payer health care bill before negotiating Obamacare.The process can take two forms. Defeat the bill and withdraw it for serious discussions. Or, open the Senate floor to amendments from Senators looking for cover, and buy them back one amendment at a time. The amendment strategy is better for conservatives who want to slice Obamacare into oblivion. They can get to 51 with fewer concessions than what flows from full-throated negotiations. Look to how McConnell sets up the debate this week, especially how he manages floor amendments.There are limits to this analysis. The hard-right dissenters like Cruz and Paul could be brought back. Concessions could be quietly negotiated with the Heller-Collins-Portman wing. In any case what is going on will be scripted and controlled.And nobody knows how the House will react to any changes. Both the dwindling flock of moderate House Republicans who voted yes hoping for protection from the Senate, and the surging House firebrands who voted yes for the opposite reason, are not to be relied on for a final vote.This looming crisis is somewhat easier to explain in terms of traditional legislative political tactics. But the stakes are enormous as are the consequences to sick, and disabled, and poor, and vulnerable Americans. As a spectator sport, it’s fascinating. As an American, it’s sickening."
47,BLACK VOICES,Texas Gives The Green Light To Racial Profiling,"Jennifer Epps-Addison, ContributorNetwork President and Co-Executive Director, Center for Popula...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-gives-a-green-light-to-racial-profiling_us_59509915e4b0c85b96c65ac5,"Today, a judge in San Antonio will be hearing opening arguments on a lawsuit against Senate Bill 4, a law passed in Texas",2017-06-26,"<p>Protest against SB4 at Texas State Capitol, May 29</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59509b7229000025003b115e.jpg?ops=crop_0_736_3024_2246%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Today, a judge in San Antonio will be hearing opening arguments on a lawsuit against Senate Bill 4, a law passed in Texas last month that is the single biggest attack on immigrants this country has seen in decades. SB 4 commands police to search the papers of anyone who looks like an immigrant and levels hefty fines and even jail time for law enforcement officers who resist. Under SB 4, even campus police will have the power to do random searches, transforming college campuses, traditionally a site of sanctuary, into a source of terror.But SB 4 is not just an anti-immigrant law. At its core, it is a racial profiling law, meant to strike fear into any person of color anywhere in the state. It is a Jim Crow law, explicitly designed to submit black and brown Texans to a different code of law than their Caucasian counterparts.In that way, it is reflective of the national climate, where anti-immigrant rhetoric is simply code for attacks on people of color as a whole.SB 4 will force anybody who looks “like an immigrant” to carry extra documentation every time they walk out their front door or face the possibility of being arrested and detained – and in Texas, the vast majority of immigrants come from either Latin America, Asia, or Africa. It will mean black and Asian college students at Texas universities need to watch their backs every time a campus police officer comes near – after all, more than twenty percent of the state’s immigrants come from Asia, and nearly five percent from Africa.And it could turn a simple road trip into a one-way trip to prison for people of color in Texas. Similar laws passed in Arizona and Alabama led to a profusion of racially motivated traffic stops, triggering a cascade of court cases that struck down significant portions of the laws in both states.One thing gives me hope. The Texas law – and the constant stream of hate emanating from the White House – have brought together organizers from all ends of the spectrum in a way we have never seen before.In Texas, immigrant rights advocates weren’t the only ones who stood up against the law. They were joined by the NAACP, the National Black Justice Coalition, Black Lives Matter, and scores of black faith leaders.And nationally, immigrant rights champions are forming closer partnerships with their counterparts working on policing and criminal justice reform. These partnerships have proved particularly fruitful in challenging and expanding the concept of “sanctuary city” to encompass more than just policies that protect immigrants. Increasingly, the concept is being used to mean cities that respect the lives of all their communities, including an end to broken windows policing, discriminatory housing policies, and structural inequities that continue to suppress communities of color.The unity couldn’t come soon enough. The next stop for a Texas-style law is my home state of Wisconsin, where Republican legislators have been cooking up a bill that would compel law enforcement to carry out Trump’s deportation agenda. In Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, Wisconsin already has its own home-grown version of Joe Arpaio, the Arizona Sheriff who put a face on the abuses of the state’s own racial profiling law, SB 1070. Under Clarke’s watch, the Sheriff’s department has been implicated in a string of scandals and suspicious deaths in custody.We can defeat these laws. And we have defeated them before – in Arizona, in Alabama, and in scores of small towns across the country who have dared to attack their immigrant communities. Over and over again, when these discriminatory laws crop up, they are eventually struck down – even if it takes months or years.The Texas law will likely face the same fate – but until it does, it will bring communities in Texas and around the country together in a resistance like we have never seen before. We know that we are facing a moment that will define us forever, and we know that all we have to lose – what all of us have to lose - is our chains. "

ICE and GEO Group denied all our visits. In response to a peaceful 5-minute interfaith prayer outside the facility, ICE and GEO Group then put the entire facility on lockdown. Attorneys and family members who were not part of the pilgrimage and who had already been granted entrance to the facility were expelled from the facility by ICE and GEO Group in response to our prayer. This included young children clinging to their toys. They had driven for hours to visits their parents.This comes just days after ICE and GEO Group admitted to violating the First Amendment rights of 9 men detained at Adelanto who were brutally assaulted and attacked with pepper spray. The 9 men, who were later joined by 33 women, went on hunger strike at Adelanto to protest substandard medical care, unjustly high immigration bonds, lack of basic respect, and lack of opportunities to connect with family.When we see abuse in detention, it is our moral obligation to speak up and stand in solidarity with our friends in detention. By denying us access after a peaceful and short prayer, ICE has tried to make us choose between our First Amendment rights and visiting our friends and clients in immigration detention. This is not a choice our government can legally ask us to make.As an attorney in California, I also was denied visits with 14 of my clients on Tuesday who were detained at the Adelanto Detention Facility. I had received email approval from ICE in advance of Tuesday for four of my legal assistants to conduct legal visits at Adelanto with me. According to the Adelanto Detention Facility rules, attorneys are allowed 24 hour access to their clients in immigration detention. And federal standards require attorneys to have access to their clients seven days a week without pre-approval; only legal assistants require pre-approval by ICE. To visit at Adelanto through regular visitation hours as a family member, friend, or community member does not require pre-approval from ICE or GEO Group. On Tuesday, we were provided with no reason for why our visits were being denied. The warden of the Adelanto Detention Facility told us that ICE had denied our visits due to “the circumstances.” However, neither ICE nor GEO Group would define what were the circumstances. Could the visitation denials be retaliation for CIVIC’s role in passing a new California law just days before? The new law bans immigration detention expansion and ensures that our state Attorney General can monitor immigration detention facilities. There were already construction vehicles on the Adelanto Detention Facility’s property, and it looked like the facility was attempting to build an expansion. The new California law could prevent this expansion. The facility’s most recent expansion in 2015 resulted in $21 million in additional annualized revenue for GEO Group and its shareholders. While we are not certain why ICE and GEO Group locked us out of the facility, the timing is suspicious.On other occasions, GEO and ICE have arbitrarily and without valid grounds denied access to attorneys and visitor volunteers associated with CIVIC in retaliation for peaceful protest activities and public statements protected by the First Amendment. In November 2015, attorneys and legal assistants were denied visits with people on hunger strike. In May 2015, GEO Group and ICE prevented me from visiting my clients after I lawfully exercised my First Amendment rights. In August 2013, CIVIC visitor volunteers and I were barred from visiting for over a month at the Adelanto Detention Facility in retaliation again for exercising our First Amendment rights. The ACLU of SoCal and Sidley Austin LLP raised concerns about the 2013 and 2015 denials in a letter dated August 24, 2015, which to this day neither GEO nor ICE has responded to.Earlier this year, in January 2017, CIVIC filed a federal civil rights complaint about a general increase in family and community visitation denials at Adelanto. In March 2017, CIVIC filed a federal civil rights complaint, detailing access denials and restrictions in violation of federal policy at Adelanto and 13 other immigration detention facilities in Arizona, California, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Texas.While CIVIC and allies remain concerned about general visitation denials and these past First Amendment violations, Tuesday’s visitation denials marked a disturbing new Constitutional violation. ICE and GEO Group’s retaliation against the faith leaders violated their fundamental right to free exercise of religion.This denial of freedom of religion mirrors the type of abuse happening inside the Adelanto Detention Facility on a regular basis. Women who went on hunger strike last week explain that they often try to pray in circles, holding each other’s hands. But the GEO guards physically break up their prayer circles and threaten them with “the hole,” also known as solitary confinement. ICE has allowed this behavior by GEO Group to go unchecked, despite complaints by people in immigration detention directly to ICE.“When our prayers are stopped by GEO Group, it makes me feel like praying is something bad,” said one woman who was on hunger strike last week. “But what I say to them is that if being put in the hole is for God, then take me.”"

The new California law could prevent this expansion. The facility’s most recent expansion in 2015 resulted in $21 million in additional annualized revenue for GEO Group and its shareholders. While we are not certain why ICE and GEO Group locked us out of the facility, the timing is suspicious.On other occasions, GEO and ICE have arbitrarily and without valid grounds denied access to attorneys and visitor volunteers associated with CIVIC in retaliation for peaceful protest activities and public statements protected by the First Amendment. In November 2015, attorneys and legal assistants were denied visits with people on hunger strike. In May 2015, GEO Group and ICE prevented me from visiting my clients after I lawfully exercised my First Amendment rights. In August 2013, CIVIC visitor volunteers and I were barred from visiting for over a month at the Adelanto Detention Facility in retaliation again for exercising our First Amendment rights. The ACLU of SoCal and Sidley Austin LLP raised concerns about the 2013 and 2015 denials in a letter dated August 24, 2015, which to this day neither GEO nor ICE has responded to.Earlier this year, in January 2017, CIVIC filed a federal civil rights complaint about a general increase in family and community visitation denials at Adelanto. In March 2017, CIVIC filed a federal civil rights complaint, detailing access denials and restrictions in violation of federal policy at Adelanto and 13 other immigration detention facilities in Arizona, California, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Texas.While CIVIC and allies remain concerned about general visitation denials and these past First Amendment violations, Tuesday’s visitation denials marked a disturbing new Constitutional violation. ICE and GEO Group’s retaliation against the faith leaders violated their fundamental right to free exercise of religion.This denial of freedom of religion mirrors the type of abuse happening inside the Adelanto Detention Facility on a regular basis. Women who went on hunger strike last week explain that they often try to pray in circles, holding each other’s hands. But the GEO guards physically break up their prayer circles and threaten them with “the hole,” also known as solitary confinement. ICE has allowed this behavior by GEO Group to go unchecked, despite complaints by people in immigration detention directly to ICE.“When our prayers are stopped by GEO Group, it makes me feel like praying is something bad,” said one woman who was on hunger strike last week. “But what I say to them is that if being put in the hole is for God, then take me.”"

Trump has supported the two nations, and others, in their diplomatic war against Qatar. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5951491715000029009002f7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The decision by the Saudis and allied dictatorships to sever ties with Qatar and impose draconian sanctions on the tiny nation has precipitated a major regional crisis, and President Trump’s support for this provocative move has made matters even worse. This past week, the Saudis made a series of demands that Qatar essentially reorder its foreign policy to conform with the powerful kingdom’s priorities.The Saudis accuse Qatar, also a longstanding U.S. ally, of supporting terrorists and other Islamist extremists. But the blowback actually has more to do with the small but wealthy kingdom’s insistence on maintaining foreign-policy independence from regional hegemon Saudi Arabia.Qatar had been part of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, a military alliance and common market, and the fact that three other members—Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain—have all severed economic and military ties is significant.It’s true that the Qatar government is a conservative family dictatorship which tolerates little dissent and abuses foreign workers. There is little doubt it has provided support for hardline Islamist movements, some of which have engaged in terrorism, and failed to crack down sufficiently on individual Qataris financing terrorist groups.For example, Qatar has long provided aid and served as the external diplomatic base for Hamas. Indeed, in recent years, Qatar has been a far more significant supporter of the hardline Palestinian Islamist group than either Syria or Iran. But huge bipartisan majorities in Congress and both the Obama and Trump Administrations have grossly exaggerated Syria and Iran’s support while, until now, largely ignoring the role of Washington’s Qatari allies.In fact, a number of the governments accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism—particularly Saudi Arabia—have been far more significant supporters and funders of Islamist extremists and related terrorist organizations. Qatar is at most a minor player in this regard, but this hasn’t stopped President Trump from reacting to the Saudi-led pressure on Qatar by proclaiming, “Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!”Interestingly, while supporting the closure of all the borders, sea lanes and airspace to Qatar, Trump subsequently approved the sale of an additional $12 billion of U.S. arms to Qatar’s military.Many of the key demands by Saudi Arabia and its allies, apparently supported by Trump, have little to do with terrorism, such as the insistence that Qatar sever diplomatic relations with Iran, which would be difficult given that the two countries share the world’s largest reserves of natural gas along their maritime border. Another demand is for the expulsion of members of political groups and other individuals opposed to the policies of GCC countries, Egypt, and allied dictatorships, including those involved in the nonviolent pro-democracy movement in Bahrain, and turn over all files related to these individuals.Saudi Arabia and its allies are also calling for the shutdown of Al-Jazeera, the Qatari-funded but editorially independent news service based in Doha. The news source has allowed nonviolent dissidents opposed to these governments an opportunity to share their grievances. For example, the Al-Jazeera’s award-winning 2011 documentary “Shouting in the Dark” about the brutal repression by the regime in Bahrain against pro-democracy protesters angered that U.S.-backed monarchy, which was the first to join Saudi Arabia in cutting ties with Qatar.The United Arab Emirates praised Trump’s “leadership in challenging Qatar’s troubling support for extremism” and has declared anyone expressing “sympathy” with Qatar’s position could be imprisoned. Other governments joining the Saudi campaign against Qatar include the U.S.-backed military dictatorship in Egypt, the corrupt and repressive regime in the Maldives— which overthrew the country’s democratically elected environmentalist president in 2012—and the nominal governments of Yemen and Libya, which control only a minority of their respective countries’ territories.U.S. military and intelligence officials are understandably upset at President Trump’s uncritical embrace of the Saudi-led moves against Qatar, for which he has taken credit. Qatar is home to the United States’ largest military base in the Middle East, the regional command center coordinating operations in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and 11,000 U.S. military personnel.The kingdom has assisted the United States in freeing hostages, providing valuable intelligence, and strategic planning. Republican leaders in Congress and even members of Trump’s own Cabinet have been scrambling to minimize the damage and both the State Department and the Defense Department have made statements encouraging the Saudis to compromise.In short, this new crisis in the Persian Gulf is complex and requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach—something apparently beyond the capabilities of the current U.S. administration."

If they are successful, the GOP legislators may sign into law in the next few weeks that will lead to intense human suffering.This week Senate Republicans took a huge step toward ending health care as we know it. Last week, they unveiled their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For weeks they promised a complete rewrite of the bill passed by the House, which would lead to 23 million people losing health insurance. It turns out they came up with something entirely similar, and equally (if not more) cruel.The Senate bill, ludicrously called the “Better Care Act,” would kick millions of Americans off Medicaid, defund Planned Parenthood and the medical care it provides low-income women, abandon people with pre-existing conditions, allow insurance companies to stop covering basic benefits like maternity care or mental health services, and provide less assistance for people who need help buying insurance. Without access to health insurance, some people will die preventable deaths. Or watch their loved ones suffer terribly without access to life saving doctors and medicine. A new study estimates that if 23 million people lose health insurance, it would equate to 217,000 deaths over the next decade.We now understand why they wrote this bill in secret and planned no hearings to review it. What Republican Senator wants the public to know that they are about to vote on a bill that will harm everyone in order to further enrich a few? That millions of people will no longer be able to see a doctor when they need one in order to fund massive tax breaks to wealthy individuals and corporations?Both the House and the Senate bill would decimate Medicaid, our nation’s largest public health insurance program, which along with the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), covers approximately one out of five Americans. That is worth repeating – one out of five people are covered by Medicaid and CHIP. The Medicaid expansion is a cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have taken the option to expand their Medicaid coverage. The expansion brought medical care to 14 million more people. Eliminating it out would be a travesty and phasing federal funding for the Medicaid expansion more slowly (which is the Senate approach) does not make it any more acceptable. In addition to effectively ending the Medicaid expansion, both Republican proposals attack the fundamental structure of the Medicaid program. For the past 50 years, the federal government has paid for Medicaid by matching a state’s Medicaid spending. Both bills would end the long standing guarantee that federal funding expands with need and everyone who is eligible receives services. Instead there would be a maximum amount the federal government will receive for every beneficiary with only modest adjustments for inflation going forward. The Senate makes even lower adjustments for inflation than the House, which would lead to much deeper cuts over the long term and more suffering. Capped funding means that funding will no longer increase to meet need, including in a public health crisis, such as a Zika outbreak or the Opioid crisis. Republicans also want to give states the option to block grant their Medicaid programs and add work requirements. Block grants are nothing more than coded Republican speak for “Cuts to federal funding.” Since 2000, funding for 13 major housing, health and social services programs that use block grants has dropped by more than a third. These proposed changes in funding mean less for Medicaid at the state level, which is why so many Governors from both parties have raised concerns about the proposals. Taking millions of dollars of federal funding for Medicaid means that states will have little choice but to cut services or reduce the number of people who receive them. While Medicaid cuts will hurt everyone, the impact on women and people of color will be profound. Almost 40 million women rely on the long-term and maternity care and family planning services offered by Medicaid. Half of the people who need Medicaid are people of color. The Affordable Care Act took a huge step towards ensuring that no one in the richest country in the world dies because they do not have access to doctors or medicine. It would be a travesty if Republicans repeal it. Most Americans do not support efforts to take healthcare away from the people who need it, and are completely opposed to doing so in order to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. We must demand that Senators and House members keep their hands off our health care. And we must do so today.

From left, Martin Valasquez, Mara Wiesen, Gabriella Barbosa, Pamela Cohen, Wendy Feinberg, student Jocelyn, Sherry Rubalcava and Maria Daisy Ortiz.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595190651700002700102e3a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jane Meredith AdamsThe Los Angeles Unified school board jumped ahead of a new state law last week and instructed the school district to immediately create a plan to train teachers on the leading learning disability in California: a reading impairment known as dyslexia.The demand by the board of the second-largest school district in the U.S. was hailed by parent advocates as a signal that districts across the state, and potentially the nation, might finally provide interventions that help students with dyslexia learn to read. Effective interventions are available, but most school districts nationwide do not provide them widely, citing the cost of training, according to advocates for students with disabilities.“We know what works,” said Pamela Cohen, a teacher in the district and a member of Decoding Dyslexia California, a parent advocacy group that has led state and national efforts to improve services. “It’s time to put the pedal to the metal.” She described her child’s anguish at not being able to learn to read and her own frustration at not being able to get help from teachers or school specialists.Instead, her son received private tutoring for dyslexia starting in 2nd grade — $90 an hour, twice a week, for four years — because Los Angeles Unified did not provide assistance, she said. Few families can afford to hire an outside specialist. “This is a civil rights issue to me,” Cohen said. “We know that thousands of families in LAUSD cannot and should not have to pay out of their pockets so their children can learn to read.”Dyslexia is estimated to affect roughly 15 to 20 percent of the U.S. population, according to the International Dyslexia Association — which would mean about 1 million children in California schools. Once known as “word blindness,” dyslexia is a neurological disorder that makes it difficult to “sound out” words by matching letters with sounds. Brain imagery has shown that people with dyslexia process word identification differently. The disability is unrelated to intelligence.The board gave Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Michelle King 90 days to return with an action plan to provide staff and teacher training on the warning signs of dyslexia, interventions proven by research to be effective and appropriate assessments for identifying dyslexia. School board member Scott Schmerelson, who co-sponsored the resolution with board member Ref Rodriguez, said that increasing early identification and effective intervention will be “life-changing” for students with dyslexia and their families.Pressure on school districts in California to do more to help students with dyslexia increased with the passage of a 2015 law, Assembly Bill 1369, authored by Assemblyman Jim Frazier, D-Oakley. The law called for the California Department of Education to release new guidance for dyslexia services before the start of the 2017-18 school year — and the department has urged districts not to wait for the guidance to get started. In a traveling presentation to special education administrators around the state, the department said it is letting them know that both general education and special education departments need to make changes in how reading is taught.“It needs to be about effective literacy instruction for all students, modified instruction for some and specifically targeted instruction for students with intensive reading needs, such as dyslexia,” the department said in a summary of its presentations to county offices of education.And school districts are watching a class action lawsuit filed in May that charges the Berkeley Unified School District with not providing adequate diagnoses or interventions for students with dyslexia. Deborah Jacobson of Jacobson Education Law, who filed the lawsuit with the Disability Rights Defense & Education Fund and the Goodwin law firm, said, “This is potentially an entire population of children who will struggle needlessly and possibly enter society functionally illiterate, no matter how intelligent, driven and capable they are.”“I think what happens in L.A. Unified could be a model for other parts of the state and what happens in California could be a model for other states,” said Richard Wagner, associate director of the National Institute of Health’s Florida Center for Reading Research and a member of the California Department of Education’s Dyslexia Work Group, which was created to help form the new program guidelines.L.A. Unified’s plan is being developed by Beth Kauffman, associate superintendent for the division of special education, and Alison Towery, director of instructional operations. Asked how broadly the training will be spread, Kauffman said, “We certainly are going to train our resource teachers. We are probably going to have do some training of our general education teachers so they at least have awareness of what some of the signs are.”Warning signs include “reading errors that show no connection to the sounds of the letters on the page – will say ‘puppy’ instead of the written word ‘dog’ on an illustrated page with a dog shown,” according to the Yale Center for Dyslexia & Creativity.Kauffman pointed to the district’s Intensive Diagnostic Education Centers as a resource. Those centers house teachers trained in research-backed dyslexia interventions, most of them stemming from what’s known as the Orton-Gillingham approach, that explicitly teach students to identify and manipulate the sound of a letter or a group of letters, among other techniques.“We’d like to take the skills they have and see how we can expand those out to our general education classrooms and our special education program,” Kauffman said. Members of Decoding Dyslexia California praised the centers, but said there were far toofew of them and that interventions should be happening with students in kindergarten and 1st grade, not in middle school and high school. Center staff teach in 23 classrooms located in 10 elementary schools, 12 middle schools and 1 high school — out of more than 900 schools and 187 public charter schools in the district.“It really is about the money,” Sherry Rubalcava, who retired after 37 years of work in Los Angeles Unified as a teacher and administrator, said about the lack of training in dyslexia interventions that work.She tutors a 6th-grade student who is reading at a 2nd-grade level despite spending three years receiving special education services in the district, she said. “They are already offering an intervention, but that intervention is worthless,” she said.“What they don’t realize is that you spend money to save money,” she said of the district. “They’re spending all this money on worthless interventions. If you gave children the right intervention, you wouldn’t have to do it as long.”She ticked off other benefits for the district for helping students with dyslexia, including an increase in school reading test scores, a jump in the number of English learners who are able to move out of English learner status, and improvement in behavior and attendance. “When kids can’t read, who wants to be in school?” she asked.Mara Wiesen, president of the Los Angeles branch of the International Dyslexia Association, said of the teacher training, “I would argue it is ultimately cost effective to do so.”This story originally appeared on EdSource"

The position of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism was established by the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act in 2004 and was most recently filled by Ira Forman, former executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council. The envoy has historically provided input on anti-Semitism for State Department reports on human rights and religious freedom. Forman served as the special envoy from May 2013 until January 20, 2017 when, like all envoys appointed under President Obama, his post was not granted an extension.Hannah Rosenthal, who served as the special envoy before Forman, said the office does important work defining anti-Semitism for the State Department. The office also holds trainings for individuals getting ready to go out on foreign posts so that they know what anti-Semitism looks like and what to report to the State Department.“These are things that don’t happen unless someone is responsible in the State Department for making sure it happens,” Rosenthal said on a call with reporters Monday morning.Reports that the Trump administration was considering budget cuts to federal agencies, including the special envoy position on combatting anti-Semitism, first surfaced in February.“I can’t believe someone at the White House won’t have better sense than to realize that this is a disaster,” Forman told Jewish Insider at the time. “I just can’t believe that they would even think of this given the relatively small budget needed to run this office. The office exists by legislation. It’s just a matter of someone signing up to fund it. This is as bipartisan as an issue as you can get, and I just hope folks at the White House come to their senses.”The envoy position has been vacant since President Donald Trump took office, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said earlier this month he believed the role actually interferes with the government’s efforts to combat anti-Semitism.“Did we weaken our attention to those issues?” Tillerson said of special envoys in a testimony to the foreign operations subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee.“One of my experiences is, mission then says, ‘Oh, we’ve got somebody else that does that,’ and then they stop doing it,” he continued. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In the wake of Tillerson’s testimony, the Anti-Defamation League, a national human rights organization that works to combat anti-Semitism, recently launched an online petition to the White House to fill the position.On a call organized by the ADL on Monday, the organization’s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, as well as former special envoys Forman and Rosenthal expressed hope that Congress would step in to ensure a special envoy is appointed given the history of bipartisan support for efforts to combat anti-Semitism.“This would be a terrible loss if we don’t proceed and don’t continue the work that’seen done in a bipartisan manner through two administrations so far,” Forman said.Greenblatt described Tillerson’s hesitation to appoint a new special envoy “a serious mistake.” “The ADL is calling on Secretary Tillerson to take action, to make the right decision and to fill the position on the special envoy on anti-Semitism,” Greenblatt said."

I want to see a bill with heart.”Based on unnamed congressional sources, it had been reported earlier this month that Trump told GOP senators during a private meeting that the House bill was “mean,” and the Senate version should be “more generous.”In his latest comments, he again criticized Democrats for being “obstructionists” in the health care debate, saying the process for passing a new bill on the issue should be “so easy.”“It would be so great if the Democrats and Republicans could get together, wrap their arms around it, and come up with something that everybody’s happy with. It’s so easy!” he said. “But we won’t get one Democrat vote. Not one. And if it were the greatest bill ever proposed in mankind, we wouldn’t get a vote. And that’s a terrible thing.”Earlier this year, Trump lamented that “nobody knew health care could be so complicated.”The interview shown on Sunday’s “Fox and Friends” program was the second time within the last few days the Trump-friendly network has broadcast comments by him.During an interview that aired Friday, he discussed how he had falsely insinuated that he had “tapes” of his private conversations with FBI director James Comey before he fired him from that post. His interviewer, Ainsley Earhardt, praised the president’s subterfuge as “smart.”Trump’s last non-Fox interview was on May 11, with NBC’s Lester Holt, in which he all but admitted that he had fired Comey because of “this Russia thing.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594fea3e1500004b1f90008f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seventy-five samples of cladding used on tower blocks in the United Kingdom and sent for testing following the Grenfell Tower tragedy have failed fire safety tests, the British Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed on Monday. The samples from 75 buildings were the first of more than 600 to be tested following the deadly fire in London’s Kensington neighborhood 12 days ago. The fact that all of the samples failed the test is sure to raise new questions for regulators and authorities who allowed the use of the high-risk material on buildings across the country. The samples were taken in 26 local authority areas across England, including several London boroughs and neighborhoods in Manchester, Plymouth and Portsmouth. “The fact that all samples so far have failed the test underlines the value of the testing program and the vital importance of submitting samples urgently,” Communities and Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid told the House of Commons on Monday. Grenfell Tower, a 24-story housing block in London’s Kensington neighborhood, went up in flames early in the morning on June 14. The blaze claimed the lives of at least 79 people, although the death toll is still expected to rise. Analysts say the fire started when a fridge in an apartment on the fourth floor exploded. The fire rapidly spread through the outside of the building as panel after panel of the aluminum cladding covering the building caught flames. Since the role of the cladding in the intensity of the blaze has become clear, regulators and local authorities have faced intense pressure for their failure to restrict that type of material on high-rises and their decisions to use it in building projects across the country. Grenfell Tower underwent a massive renovation just last year that residents were told was to improve fire safety in the building. But the renovations didn’t include the installation of an automatic sprinkler system. The management organization also opted for the installation of aluminum cladding made with pure polyethylene, which is banned on tall buildings in the United States and other European countries because of its reputation as a fire hazard. The board of the management organization includes representatives of the local government.Arconic, the company that produced part of the cladding on Grenfell Tower, on Monday banned its material from being sold for use in high-rises, citing the divergence in building codes around the world, The Guardian reported. Arconic made the panels, but not the insulation, used on the London tower block. British authorities have not yet explained whether the samples from other apartment buildings that failed the recent fire hazard tests also used the company’s materials.Following the Grenfell Tower fire, local authorities across the U.K. have scrambled to identify other buildings that potentially have the same risk. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid has urged local authorities and housing associations to continue to submit samples for testing.On Friday night, thousands of people living in 650 apartments in North London were forced to evacuate from their buildings over safety fears. The residents face weeks in temporary accommodations, HuffPost UK reports.

The driver lost control when the vehicle blew a tire, a provincial government spokesman said.A large crowd of people gathered, many to collect fuel in containers, and thetanker exploded in a huge fireball about 45 minutes later. Rescue workers said that about 80 people had been injured.“People of the area and passers by had started gathering fuel when it exploded, burning everybody,” provincial government spokesman Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan told Reuters.An estimated 20 children were among the dead, he said.The accident happened the day before Pakistan celebrates the Eid al-Fitr festival, when families get together to celebrate the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.Many bodies were burned beyond recognition and television pictures showed piles of burnt out motorcycles, apparently those of people who were collecting fuel or watching events unfold.Police had tried to clear the area before the tanker exploded but people ignored them, Khan said, adding that the initial crash had blocked the road, causing a traffic tailback.The driver of the tanker survived the accident and was taken into police custody, he said.The explosion took place on a stretch of highway cutting through the village of Ramzan Joya.Khalil Ahmed, a 57-year-old former government employee who lives in the village, said he had lost 12 relatives in the fire, which firefighters extinguished in two hours.“One body has been recovered and 11 others are still missing,” Ahmed said.“After the spill, people began calling their relatives to come and gather the oil, and some showed up from nearby villages as well.

The ruling was in response to her lawyers’ arguments that Trump should be allowed to skip the deposition in part because of her “extraordinary circumstances” as a “high-ranking government employee.” In a statement filed with the court June 16, Trump said she had “no involvement in the conception, design, production or sale of the Hettie shoe,” the sandal at the center of the suit by Florence shoemaker Aquazzura. She said her only involvement was a “final sign-off of each season’s line after it was first reviewed and approved by the company’s design team.”But the judge wasn’t buying it.“Trump’s public statements regarding active and comprehensive brand management lead to a reasonable inference that the shoe at issue would not have been released without her approval,” U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest wrote in her decision Friday. “A deposition is appropriate.”Forrest ignored Trump’s claim that she was too busy for the deposition, but did say that questioning should be limited to two hours because of Trump’s “competing professional obligations.”Aquazzura Italia SRL filed the suit last June against Trump’s company IT Collection LLC. The action claims Trump’s Hettie sandal is “virtually identical” to Aquazzzura’s Wild Thing shoe.In demanding that Trump be deposed, Aquazzura’s attorneys quoted Trump as recently saying, “There’s not a shoe I’m not intimately involved with designing.” IT Collection shoemaker Marc Fisher Holdings is also named in the suit.Other shoes sold by Trump’s IT Collection and named in the suit also appear strikingly similar to those created by Aquazzura. The Italian company claims Trump can sell them at a fraction of the cost because she has dodged the costs of their original designs. The Hettie shoe sells for $130 while the Wild Thing has a pricetag of $785.The lawsuit accuses Trump and Fisher of “seeking the same success Aquazzura experienced, but without having to put in the hard creative work.”Trump stopped selling another shoe model similar to an Aquazzura design after the Italian company complained, according to the lawsuit.Aquazzura is seeking unspecified damages."

That’s a franchise low for the sequel from Paramount and Hasbro, behind the first in the modern series, which earned $70.5 million in 2007. “The Last Knight” carries an estimated $217 million production budget.This makes “Transformers: The Last Knight” the latest summer blockbuster to bank on overseas ticket sales to have a shot at turning a profit. In China, the big-budget action sequel made $41 million in its opening day alone. The projected international come through Sunday is $196.2 million, powered by $123.4 million in China.“The Last Knight” comes at a time when Paramount could have used an all-around hit, following recent misses “Baywatch” and “Ghost in the Shell.” While the latest “Transformers” movie has been advertised as “the final chapter” and Bay’s last go-around, the franchise will continue ― Paramount has at least two more movies slated, including a spinoff that could star Hailee Steinfeld. The franchise has historically been massively profitable and seen solid multiples for the studio. Together, the first four earned over $1.3 billion domestically and well over $3.5 billion worldwide.The latest take on the series centers on an alliance between Bumblebee, Cade Yeager ― who Mark Wahlberg also played in 2014′s “Age of Extinction” ― and roles played by franchise newcomers Anthony Hopkins and Laura Haddock. Together, the team works together to save the world. Audiences have earned the film a B+ CinemaScore, while critics have mostly dismissed it ― it currently holds a 15% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.“The Last Knight” was uncontested at the box office this weekend, but a few indie releases showed traction. Sofia Coppola’s “The Beguiled” remake from Focus Features played at four theaters this weekend, and should gross $240,545 with a strong per screen average before it expands to over 500 locations next weekend.“We’re thrilled by this opening,” said Lisa Bunnell, Focus Features’ distribution president. “This is Focus’ third collaboration with Sofia and she’s created an entertaining, atmospheric thriller featuring strong female representation in front of and behind the camera.”And Kumail Nanjiani’s critically adored romantic comedy “The Big Sick” should earn $435,000 during its opening weekend in five locations ― that would give the Lionsgate and Amazon Studios release the highest per screen average of any film that has opened this year so far.“Kumail and Emily’s true story provided audiences of all ages a much-needed alternative to the summer blockbusters,” said Bob Berney, Amazon Studios’ distribution chief.Otherwise, “Wonder Woman” continues to post impressive numbers, and holds onto second place during its fourth weekend in theaters. This weekend, it should earn an additional $25.2 million, bringing its domestic total to $318.4 million. Earlier this week, the film became the highest-grossing live-action movie to be directed by a woman ― a major distinction for Patty Jenkins.Disney and Pixar’s “Cars 3” also looks to earn $25.2 million domestically during its second weekend. Some estimates have the film slightly lower, just below $25 million. The family film, which won last weekend’s box office, is expected to pass the $100 million mark in North America by Monday.“Transformers: The Last Knight’s” performance is a tough break for the summer box office’s bottom line domestically. For the past two years, this weekend has seen monster grosses for “Jurassic World” and “Finding Dory.” Now, attention is turned toward a trio of releases next weekend, as the box office hopes for a shot in the arm from “Despicable Me 3,” “Baby Driver,” and “The House.”"

Most religious rites take place in the men’s section in accordance with centuries-old Orthodox standards that hold sway in Israel.The government has faced calls by more progressive Jewish movements in Israel and abroad to add an egalitarian section along the wall and in 2016 voted 15-5 to do so, over the objections of ultra-Orthodox cabinet members.But in the face of opposition from the two ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu’s coalition, the plan never got off the ground. Last week, the two parties proposed rescinding the 2016 decision.At its weekly meeting on Sunday, the cabinet voted to formally freeze its implementation, the officials said, and Netanyahu instructed a minister from his Likud party to formulate a new proposal.“Today’s decision signifies a retreat from that agreement and will make our work to bring Israeland the Jewish world together increasingly more difficult,” Natan Sharansky, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, a main outreach group to Jewish communities abroad.The mixed-gender section was to have been located at a separate expanse of the wall that, when seen from the plaza looking toward the wall, stands to the right of the current Orthodox-administered compound where men and women will still worship separately.More liberal streams of Judaism, which outside of Israel have larger followings than Orthodoxy, chafe at the restriction.The wall is officially administered by an ultra-Orthodox rabbi.(Reporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Gareth Jones)"

Growing up, I was often enlisted by my mother to help her with the upkeep of (or switch over from) the many styles she wore during the 80s and 90s: braids of all stripes (basket weave, box, micro), finger waves, the Salt ‘n’ Pepa asymmetrical bob, the Wave Nouveau curly perm, and, even, the trusty wig.Add to this a former girlfriend who marketed hair products for L’Oreal and I ended up as a man who can speak somewhat intelligently about the many ways Black women strive to keep their “butters whipped.” Should you ever find yourself on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire faced with a question about the follicular formations of Black hair, feel free to use your phone-a-friend option to reach me. I’ll pick up. (Hint: the answer will likely be Madam C.J. Walker or Luster’s Pink Oil Moisturizer. You’re welcome).But surprisingly, when it came time to do my daughter’s hair, I didn’t have a clue.I was intimidated. What moisturizer should I use? What type of brush or comb would I need? Would I have to do ponytails (because I never learned to braid)? And there were SO MANY accessories – a multitude of bands, barrettes, clips, scrunchies. Which ones do you use on a two-year-old?My wife knew I was daddy deficient in this area. So she did what moms do: she left instructions. In this case, it was a one-pager titled “Johnathon’s Guide to Doing Emmy’s Hair.” It included nine steps, including “do one section at a time”; “take a fingertip or two of the curling cream and massage into hair thoroughly”; “use the comb to detangle and the brush to smooth hair into a ponytail”; and last, but not least: “use the aloe vera gel to smooth down Emmy’s baby hairs along her hairline.” Edge control is a must.And so began my #DaddyDoesHair journey. Officially, it started in February when my wife returned to work full time. Every morning after getting my daughter fed and dressed, I spend 15 minutes doing her hair as she sits in her high chair clinging her blanket and singing along to Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Then we head out the door to daycare.Here are three things I’ve learned over the past four months in the role of Daddy the Hair Groomer:1. DOING MY DAUGHTER’S HAIR MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A BETTER DAD. I didn’t feel complete as a father until I learned how to tackle my daughter’s tangles. I wanted to know how to care for her, completely: feed her, bathe her, clothe her, and yes, do her hair. I was mortified by the idea that Emmy might skip out the house looking like Bushwick Bill if I couldn’t style her locks like mommy. (And what’s worse, it would have been a completely preventable tragedy).The aesthetics of my daughter’s hair are not as important to me as the pride I feel knowing that I helped her show up in the world looking like she’s being cared for by people who love her.2. #BLACKGIRLMAGIC CAN’T HAPPEN WITHOUT MOISTURE.As a guy with short, cropped hair, I simply brush and go. I put on a dab of pomade here and there, of course, but concern about moisture is not part of my hair routine. It’s different with my daughter.She has, according to my wife (and Google), hair type 4A: tightly coiled, very fragile, defined curly pattern. Before I even think about putting a comb through her hair, I have to spray her locks with a mix of water and Kinky-Curly Knot Today, comb, massage in some Cantu coconut curling cream, comb again until her hair darkens and curls, and then brush and pull into two Afro puffs that defy gravity. #BlackGirlMagic.Once, in a hurry, I tried to rush the moisturizing process, only to get the comb snagged in Emmy’s hair. She winced. #DadFail. This forced me to take my time and, in doing so, I took notice of the curve of her ears, the line of her jaw, the health of her scalp. Doing my daughter’s hair allows me to be present with her and see the small ways she’s growing and changing.3. “IT’S NOT ABOUT THE BRAID, IT’S ABOUT THE BOND.” So says Phil Morgese, a single dad, who with his daughter, Emma, started the Daddy Daughter Hair Factory in Daytona Beach, Florida. Its mission: “To give fathers and father figures the tools they need to handle hair properly, to encourage stronger bonds between them and their daughters, realizing that the most important aspect of doing hair is the bond behind it.” This rang true to me.After all, I may never be able to do my daughter’s hair with the beauty salon technique of my wife, but that’s OK. My satisfaction comes when Emmy leans in close, gives me a big hug and declares, “You’re the best!” #WinningThis post originally appeared on Johnathon’s blog, FatherhoodAtForty.net.

68,POLITICS,Retirement Rumors Ramp Up For Influential Supreme Court Justice,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-kennedy-retirement-rumors-supreme-court_us_594f0186e4b02734df2ac9ec,"Justice Anthony Kennedy, 80, was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and has served for nearly three decades.",2017-06-25,President Donald Trump listens as Justice Anthony Kennedy speaks during the swearing in ceremony for Judge Neil Gorsuch.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594f1d0b1500004b1f8ffffb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the end of the Supreme Court term approaches, rumors of retirement have ramped up around Justice Anthony Kennedy, a pivotal judge who often bridges a gap on the bench between conservatives and liberals.The Associated Press and CNN reported Saturday on rumors swirling around the 80-year-old Kennedy’s retirement after the Supreme Court’s final week before the bench breaks for summer.Sources close to Kennedy told CNN that the justice has been “seriously considering” retirement after nearly 30 years of service, though it’s not clear when exactly Kennedy would hang up his robe. Both conservatives and liberals have been gearing up to fill Kennedy’s spot when he retires, CNN reported in May.This new round of speculation was sparked by a private reunion of Kennedy’s former clerks in Washington, D.C, according to the reports. The reunion date was moved up one year, AP reported, sparking talk among former clerks that it would be the last time they see Kennedy while he is on the bench.Orin Kerr, law professor at George Washington University and a former clerk of the senior justice, tweeted on Friday that they would likely know soon “if rumors of Kennedy’s retirement are accurate, which makes this post on time limits timely again.”Kennedy, a conservative Republican, has become a breadwinner for the left by siding with liberal justices in pivotal Supreme Court decisions. Appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1988, Kennedy has cast swing votes for groundbreaking issues including the legalization of same-sex marriage ― for which he wrote the majority opinion ― protecting abortion rights and race-based affirmative action.Kennedy’s retirement would create an opportunity for President Donald Trump to push the Supreme Court and its future rulings in favor of conservatives. Trump’s first pick for the court, Justice Neil Gorusch, was a clerk under Kennedy and this year filled the spot of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. “As the court’s most important Justice ― at the center of the institution’s ideological balance ― Justice Kennedy’s ability to bridge the divide between left and right on critical issues such as the right to access abortion cannot be overstated,” Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, told CNN.“Replacing Justice Kennedy with a Trump nominee would almost certainly sound the death knell for Roe, just as candidate Trump promised during the 2016 campaign.”In April, Trump told the Washington Times that he would be using the same list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees he released while campaigning for presidency if any vacancies opened up on the bench.When asked of Kennedy’s potential retirement by the newspaper, Trump said he didn’t want to talk about it.“I don’t know. I have a lot of respect for Justice Kennedy, but I just don’t know,” he said. “I don’t like talking about it. I’ve heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard. And I have a lot of respect for that gentleman, a lot.”UPDATE: June 25 ― Politico reporter Eliana Johnson tweeted Sunday that there was no announcement of a pending Kennedy retirement at the clerk reunion."
69,ENTERTAINMENT,Tamra Judge On What's Ahead On 'Real Housewives Of Orange County',"Shira Hirschman Weiss, ContributorWriter, Blogger, Regular contributor to local newpapers in Ber...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tamra-judge-on-a-softer-side-of-kelly-dodd-shannons_us_594f0f66e4b0f078efd9823e,"Somehow, Tamra and Vicki always seemed to find their way back to being close friends and partying together despite swearing they would never speak again.",2017-06-25,<p>Veteran <em>Real Housewife</em> Tamra Judge (<em>Real Housewives of Orange County</em>)</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/594f139e1700006f07102a0a.png?ops=crop_25_38_359_333%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s hard to believe that Real Housewives of Orange County (RHOC), the oldest in Bravo’s Real Housewives franchise, has been on the air for over a decade. Although Tamra Judge joined the show during its third season in 2007, it feels like she was part of the introductory ensemble which included Vicki Gunvalson, often referred to as “The OG of the OC.” Vicki is still a part of the cast and has been integral to the show’s many and varied story lines from Seasons 1 through 11. Unsurprisingly, she rejoins the cast again in the upcoming Season 12. Back in Season 3, she bonded with then-newcomer Tamra and the two have been through the highest of ups and the lowest of downs. Tamra, like Vicki, has proven she too can maintain a committed relationship with a network and franchise through reality TV’s tests, tricks, twists, trials and tribulations. The show has seen Tamra through a bitter marital demise (she’s now remarried), being screamed at by all her cast mates to the point of having to flee a room, and the turbulent on-again off-again (currently off) dysfunctional relationship with Vicki.Somehow, Tamra and Vicki always seemed to find their way back to being close friends and partying together despite swearing they would never speak again. Last season however, it seemed that things were truly final, that there was no love left between the two ladies and there would be no reconciliation this time. Vicki had been spreading salacious rumors about Tamra’s husband Eddie, an understandable “last straw” for someone who cherishes her “third time’s a charm” marriage. What made matters worse was that Season 11 newcomer Kelly Dodd, outspoken to the point of verbal diarrhea, was Vicki’s partner in shit-talking crime.The Housewives were divided as things became contentious. After filming for Season 11 wrapped, rumors began to fly about Kelly’s marriage and an alleged adulterous paramour. The blogs had a field day. Watch What Happens Live had to screen out callers after a few went rogue dropping bombshells live on air. Luckily for Bravo and its leading ladies, the cast would soon stop doing any press interviews because the season was over. The ensuing hiatus would give everyone a chance to catch their breaths. We, the viewers, collectively held ours, unsure of who would return the following season to pick up the pieces, clean up the mess and attempt to (as Dorinda Medley of RHONY says) “make it nice.”I had the opportunity to speak with Tamra Judge to get a sense of how she feels going in to her tenth season, Season 12 of The Real Housewives of Orange County:There was a ton of drama at the end of last season with Kelly Dodd and Vicki Gunvalson. However, you all have to hang out together regardless when you start filming. What was it like going into this season when you hadn’t spoken to these ladies in months? It was scary!I had this uncomfortable feeling going into it and I didn’t know what to expect. The girls, Vicki and Kelly, had a lot to say about David Beador (cast mate Shannon’s husband) and Eddie (Tamra’s husband). It ended in a really ugly way last season and I was a little bit nervous because I didn’t want to rehash that stuff. Also, even though you’re on a show together with these people, you just don’t want these people in your life.That brings me to a question that my friend Megan T. has: If you weren’t filming RHOC, would you have anything to do with Vicki? NO. There’s no need for me to.Amy C. asks: Are there any particular Housewives that viewers will turn against this season?You know…I don’t know…I was actually just saying that it’s such a different season this year. The cast was a little bit split almost three quarters of the way through filming .I don’t know what Kelly and Vicki did most of the time because I was filming much more with Meghan and Shannon. Peggy is the new girl and I didn’t film with her all that much either. This season, there was lots of filming done individually and a focus on family stuff, whereas in the past there was lots of group stuff. I could be wrong but that’s how it felt. You’ll see that I am participating in a documentary about parents who have been unfairly estranged or separated from their kids called Erasing Family. (This is something that Tamra is personally passionate about – she has recently reconnected with her daughter and their relationship is a work in progress. In the first episode, she briefly mentions that she would regularly text her daughter and one day her daughter finally responded. Tamra says this relationship is on the mend with her ex-husband Simon’s cooperation).Shannon is struggling with her weight and that’s something that lots of people connect to. She’s in her 50s, there are all sorts of hormones and it’s not as easy to lose weight as it is to gain it. Shannon is very open and candid, which makes her the perfect housewife. She really lays it all out there and that takes balls. People will really just want to hug her.What did you think of Kelly Dodd’s return to the show after last season?I was a little surprised, however I think she’s good TV. There’s a fine line and Andy Cohen talks about this. When people love to hate you, it still makes for good TV, but when people hate to hate you, it’s uncomfortable to watch. Kelly was really close to that line and I didn’t know if she could redeem herself, but she really does this season. I mean, she’s still Kelly, but you see a softer side of Kelly. She said outrageous things last season and I honestly didn’t know if she was capable of changing but she did. She must have internalized: “I was a bit of a jerk” and reflected. She knew what she had to work on, and she is less abrasive this season. Last season she got in trouble for things that she said, but this season she really controlled her mouth. She is a great example of someone who learned from seeing her mistakes play back on TV and I was impressed by this softer side of Kelly Dodd.You are friends with both Lydia and Shannon and we see in the trailer that the two of them clash. How was it navigating things between these ladies who are both your friends?Actually, it was very stressful for me. You see that I try to be a peacemaker and I explain to Lydia that “Shannon is expressive, she’s not yelling at you” and I’m trying to tell Shannon that Lydia’s really sweet which Shannon wasn’t buying. The thing is, Shannon is intense and people take something she says in a way that she really doesn’t mean. You have to get to know Shannon and once you do, it’s easy. Shannon and I are extremely close and we didn’t start out that way when we first met.In the first episode, there’s a quick scene with you and your granddaughter. How does it feel to be a grandma?I haven’t gotten to use the word “grandma.” Someone brought me a baseball cap that says “Glamma “and even with that, I just can’t bring myself to wear it. I had Ryan when I was really young and my mom said at the time “I’m too young to be a grandma.” Now I know how she feels! Eddie sure gets a kick out of it and constantly says “Hi Grandma!”Jim Edmonds, the former professional baseball player and husband to Real Housewife Meghan King Edmonds, has gotten a really rough edit in prior seasons. He has seemed grumpy and not so interested in his wife, but in the first episode of Season 12 we see how amazing he is with their adorable newborn. Having met him in person, what do you think of him? Jim IS a really nice guy and I think he might be a little uncomfortable in front of the cameras. He’s very loving to Meghan and very supportive.. but he does travel a lot so that’s gotta be stressful. He is a great dad, a really great dad.Vicki’s new guy Steve seems to have it all together and he’s a former homicide detective!! Have you met him and what are your thoughts on this relationship? Even though Vicki and I are not the friends we once were, I have met him a couple of times. I don’t know him really well but he seems like a nice guy, also a very handsome one.Didn’t he do his detective work to find out more about Vicki? I didn’t say that! (laughs) You did. I was being nice, but seriously he is a good guy. Sometimes you’ll look for things…like ‘hmm what could possibly be wrong with this guy?’ when you’re in this situation and it’s very hurtful that people were talking about Eddie and spreading malicious lies…Steve was a police officer who seems to have it all together. He appears to be a solid guy.Amanda D. wants to know which Housewives you are closest with outside of the OC franchise.The ladies that you see me hang out with the most this season are the ones I am also closest with: Shannon is my girl. I had kept in touch with Lydia and you’ll see us together. I’m also close with Meghan.Why has Vicki’s daughter Briana never become a Housewife? We do see so much of her and what it’s like for her to be a mother now. Are you still close with Briana?I don’t know why she’s not a Housewife. I actually just got together with Briana’s designer and had a full conversation about her. I like Briana but have had to pull back because I don’t have a relationship with her mother. So, out of respect to Vicki, I don’t initiate conversations or really see her. Of course, if she writes me, I’ll write back but Vicki did say to me at one point that she would not like me to talk to her daughter. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I try to put myself in her shoes.Erica R. asks: Are there any surprising new friendships or friendships that fall apart in Season 12? There are some friendships that get strained, but that will occur towards the end of the season so I’m not going to spoil it for you. You will have to stay tuned. Me and Shannon and Meghan are all good friends and Shannon, Kelly and I have moved forward from where we were last season. As you know, Lydia who was on the show a few seasons ago returned for this season and we always maintained a friendship. It was nice to have Lydia back. It’s definitely a lot different this season. Lydia really has a voice this season and comparatively, she was quiet the last time she was on. Now she really stands up for what she believes in.Real Housewives of Orange County premieres July 10 at 9/8c on Bravo."

Truth is, you don’t have to throw a chair through a window or quit in the middle of a presentation to cause irreparable damage to your career. There are so many things that can kill the careers of good, hard-working people. Honest mistakes often carry hard-hitting consequences.“You can’t make the same mistake twice, the second time, it’s not a mistake, it’s a choice.” - AnonymousThere doesn’t have to be a single, sickening moment when you realize that you just shoved your foot firmly in your mouth, either. Little things can add up over time and undermine your career just as much as (or more than) one huge lapse in judgment.Self-awareness is a critical skill in the workplace. It’s the foundation of emotional intelligence, a skill set that TalentSmart research shows is responsible for 58 percent of your job performance. If you remain self-aware, these mistakes are all things that you can control before they creep up on you and damage your career.1. Over-promising and under-delivering. It’s tempting to promise the moon to your colleagues and your clients, especially when you’re honest and hardworking and believe that you can do it. The problem is that there’s no point in creating additional pressure that can make you look bad. If you promise to do something ridiculously fast and you miss the deadline by a little bit, you’ll likely think that you did a good job because you still delivered quickly. But the moment you promise something to someone, they expect nothing less. You end up looking terrible when you fall short, which is a shame, because you could have done the same quality work in the same amount of time with great results if you’d just set up realistic expectations from the beginning. This is one of those situations where perception matters more than reality. Don’t deliberately undershoot your goals; just be realistic about the results you can deliver so that you’re certain to create expectations that you will blow out of the water.2. Having an emotional hijacking. My company provides 360° feedback and executive coaching, and we come across far too many instances of people throwing things, screaming, making people cry, and other telltale signs of an emotional hijacking. An emotional hijacking demonstrates low emotional intelligence, and it’s an easy way to get fired. As soon as you show that level of instability, people will question whether or not you’re trustworthy and capable of keeping it together when it counts.Exploding at anyone, regardless of how much they might “deserve it,” turns a huge amount of negative attention your way. You’ll be labeled as unstable, unapproachable, and intimidating. Controlling your emotions keeps you in the driver’s seat (something you can develop through emotional intelligence training). When you are able to control your emotions around someone who wrongs you, they end up looking bad instead of you.3. Sucking up to your boss. Some people suck up to their boss and call it managing up, but that isn’t the case at all. Sucking up has nothing to do with a real relationship built on respect; it is sneaky and underhanded. Suck-ups try to get ahead by stroking the boss’s ego instead of earning his or her favor. That doesn’t go over well with colleagues who are trying to make it on merit. Yes, you want to bolster your relationship with your boss, but not by undermining your colleagues. That’s the key distinction here. For a boss-employee relationship to work, it has to be based on authenticity. There’s no substitute for merit.4. Eating smelly food. Unless you happen to work on a ship, your colleagues are going to mind if you make the entire place smell like day-old fish. The general rule of thumb when it comes to food at work is, anything with an odor that might waft beyond the kitchen door should be left at home. It might seem like a minor thing, but smelly food is inconsiderate and distracting—and so easily avoidable. When something that creates discomfort for other people is so easily avoided, it tends to build resentment quickly. Your pungent lunch tells everyone that you just don’t care about them, even when you do.5. Backstabbing. The name says it all. Stabbing your colleagues in the back, intentionally or otherwise, is a huge source of strife in the workplace. One of the most frequent forms of backstabbing is going over someone’s head to solve a problem. People typically do this in an attempt to avoid conflict, but they end up creating even more conflict as soon as the victim feels the blade. Anytime you make someone look bad in the eyes of their colleagues, it feels like a stab in the back, regardless of your intentions.6. Negativity. Sometimes when you’re feeling negative and down, your mood can leak out and affect other people, even if you don’t intend it to. You were hired to make your boss’s and your team’s jobs easier, not harder. People who spread negativity through their department and complain about the work or other people complicate things for everyone else. If people always have to tiptoe around you so as not to dislodge that massive chip on your shoulder, they are unlikely to be willing to do it for very long.7. Gossiping. People make themselves look terrible when they get carried away with gossiping about other people. Wallowing in talk of other people’s misdeeds or misfortunes may end up hurting their feelings if the gossip finds its way to them, but gossiping will make you look negative and spiteful every time, guaranteed.8. Bragging. When someone hits a home run and starts gloating as they run the bases, it’s safe to assume that they haven’t hit very many home runs. On the other hand, if they hit a home run and simply run the bases, it conveys a business-as-usual mentality, which is far more intimidating to the other team. Accomplishing great things without bragging about them demonstrates the same strong mentality—it shows people that succeeding isn’t unusual to you.9. Announcing that you hate your job. The last thing anyone wants to hear at work is someone complaining about how much they hate their job. Doing so labels you as a negative person and brings down the morale of the group. Bosses are quick to catch on to naysayers who drag down morale, and they know that there are always enthusiastic replacements waiting just around the corner.Bringing It All TogetherThese behaviors may sound extreme and highly inconsiderate, but they have a tendency to sneak up on you. A gentle reminder is a great way to avoid them completely.What other behaviors should I add to this list? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."

The old, blind, warty and hairless had all showed up to do their worst. But only one of them could emerge victorious, claiming the title of World’s Ugliest Dog.Martha, a 125-pound Neapolitan mastiff, was the “gassy” and droopy-eyed contestant who ended up clinching the top honor. She impressed the judges with her sweet nature, lumbering gait and dangly jowls that spread like melted butter on the stage whenever she’d plop down for a nap during the competition (which was often). According to The New York Times, Martha snoozed and snored when the judges named her the winner. “Do you know you just won the World’s Ugliest Dog Contest?” judge Kerry Sanders of NBC News asked of the sleepy pooch, per AP.“I’d gloat, but I need a nap,” Shirley Zindler, Martha’s handler, responded on her behalf.After Martha’s win was announced, the 3-year-old pooch quickly amassed a fan base on social media, some of whom weren’t too pleased with the “ugly” in her title.But organizers of the annual contest say it isn’t at all about mocking the participants. Instead, it’s about celebrating the unique beauty of all dogs ―including those that may not be considered Westminster-worthy.“We’re proud to celebrate all dogs and pets by showing that no matter their imperfections, they are adoptable, lovable and a great addition to any family,” Erin Post, CEO of the Sonoma-Marin Fair, told NPR. For almost 30 years, the World’s Ugliest Dog contest has been a crowd favorite at the fair. Many of the competitors this year were adopted. In Martha’s case, her previous owner had tried to sell her on Craigslist when Zindler, founder of the Dogwood Animal Rescue Project, intervened. Martha had been almost “blind from neglect,” according to the Times. Several surgeries later, Martha has regained some of her sight. She now lives on a sprawling property in Penngrove, California, with a new adopted family. Scroll down to see more pictures of Martha and her “ugly” competitors, each of them beloved and beautiful in their own way. Also remember to adopt and not shop if you’re thinking of welcoming a new animal into your home. You can visit Petfinder and Adopt-A-Pet, or your local SPCA or rescue shelter."
