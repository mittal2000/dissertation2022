0,POLITICS,Sad Inauguration Workers Prepare To Celebrate A Man They Despise,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-inauguration-workers-sad_us_586ea7bce4b02b5f8587d787,Some federal workers have no choice but to be at inauguration for Donald Trump.,2017-01-07,Not everyone who will be working or performing at inauguration this year is excited about it. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ea8bc170000250092856e.jpeg?cache=PE1agbvo6x&ops=crop_17_753_2823_1852%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As soon as she found out Donald Trump had won the presidential election, Diane* began applying for a new job. As a federal employee, she just couldn’t imagine sticking around and working for a man she worried would mistreat government workers and pursue dangerous, unethical policies.But she’s not quite done with the president-elect yet. Diane is also a member of the National Guard and has been assigned to work at inauguration. “Oh for heaven’s sake,” she sighed.“Hopefully we show our best for this inauguration, despite who is being inaugurated,” she added. “You’re no better than you are on your worst day, I guess I would say. We have a job to do, and I support our troops doing that job.”Plenty of federal workers, service members and others who come to to participate in the festivities always have to take part in an inauguration for a president for whom they may not have voted. But this year seems a bit different. The 2016 campaign was particularly acrimonious, and Trump has had trouble attracting entertainers to perform at his big day. At least one D.C.-area marching band has participated in the past five inaugural parades, but not a single one applied for this year’s.Federal employees or service members who have no choice but to be there are trying to make the best out of the uncomfortable situation. George* voted for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, but because he plays in one of the military bands, he will also have to be at inauguration. “It’s certainly going to be different,” he said, reflecting on the excitement and honor he felt performing in 2012 for President Barack Obama.“My first thought when the election results came out,” he continued, “was, ‘Should I look for new work? Am I going to be able to stomach this?’”He’s since decided that he’s not going to leave the band, but it’s just not going to be the same as it was over the past four years. “It’s going to be a job,” George added. “I don’t think I’m going to have any patriotic emotions like the ones that I experienced during Obama’s last inauguration.”For groups around the country who have decided to come to the nation’s capital to participate in the civic event ― which traditionally is an honor, remembered for a lifetime ― there’s considerable consternation for members about whether to join in.The Rockettes are one of the few big-name entertainment acts to agree to participate in Trump’s inauguration, which has upset many of its dancers.“I wouldn’t feel comfortable standing near a man like that in our costumes,” one dancer wrote in an email to her colleagues, according to Marie Claire magazine.One Rockette told the magazine that participation appeared mandatory at first, but management made clear it was optional after some backlash from the performers. Nevertheless, many dancers worry that if they refuse to go, they’ll face repercussions.A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, another group slated to perform at inauguration, has resigned from the group rather than sing for Trump. “I’ve tried to tell myself that it will be all right and that I can continue in good conscience before God and man,” wrote the member, Judy Chamberlin, in a Facebook post. “I only know I could never ‘throw roses to Hitler.’ And I certainly could never sing for him.”The Marist College marching band applied to perform at inauguration before it was clear who would win the election. When its application was accepted, the band director asked the members to privately let him know whether they wanted to march. A few people have decided to sit it out. One student who spoke with The Huffington Post said that although he doesn’t like Trump, he’s still going to march.“I don’t think it’s about him,” he said. “I think it’s a huge honor to be playing at the inauguration, no matter who it was.”The issue has been a hot topic at Marist, with an online petition from an alumna of the college asking the band to decline the inauguration invitation. “I just hope that people don’t end up turning on band members because of this,” the member, who will be marching, told HuffPost. “I just hope Marist doesn’t become more divided by this, and that people end up respecting our side of things and hopefully kind of respecting our decision to march and us respecting the people who obviously decided not to march.” * Names have been changed at the request of the individuals over fears of retribution.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

2,POLITICS,How Virginia Gubernatorial Hopeful Tom Perriello Evolved On Abortion Funding,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perriello-virginia-governor-abortion-rights-stupak-pitts_us_586ff6c8e4b02b5f8588c4db,The state contest is already turning bitter.,2017-01-07,"Tom Perriello, who is now running for governor of Virginia, had President Barack Obama's support for his 2010 congressional re-election but lost.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58701c4f1700008501928a38.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Tom Perriello, a former Democratic congressman from Charlottesville, announced his surprise bid for Virginia governor this week, progressives were of two minds, at once hailing the arrival of a candidate with strong populist credentials while worrying about his record on reproductive freedom. Perriello was an unusual member of Congress in that his politics were significantly to the left of those in his rural district, but rather than tack to the center, he laid out where he stood and defended his position, often in populist terms. “Part of the problem is that we often take this What’s The Matter With Kansas? approach that assumes that people are reactionary and stupid and that we just need to convince them that they’re going to make more money under our plan,” Perriello told The Huffington Post in 2010. “But the fact is people are good, decent, smart people, and we should treat them that way. ... People don’t have to agree with you on every issue, but they do have to believe that you are genuinely doing what you believe is right.”He lost his re-election bid anyway in the tea party wave of 2010, but his race was much closer than those of Democrats who’d gone full-blown Blue Dog. On abortion rights, though, he broke with the pro-choice movement and backed a 2009 amendment to the Affordable Care Act, known as Stupak-Pitts, which set back reproductive freedom by putting obstacles in the way of private insurance coverage of abortion ― meaning that with unified control of government, abortion rights were actually going backward under Democrats.Perriello at the time said that he backed the amendment in order to fulfill a pledge he’d made to constituents not to support any health care reform bill that allowed for public funding of abortions, which the White House had long said would be the case. He saw Stupak-Pitts as the only way to meet that pledge.Perriello, in an interview with The Huffington Post, said that he has not actually evolved on the issue of abortion rights and has always been pro-choice, but rather his evolution has come in his position on the use of federal funds for abortion services. “I’ve always believed in a woman’s constitutional right to choose and have marched for it when I was in college and in law school, but evolution came on the issue of the Hyde Amendment and access more broadly, with better understanding of the structural inequalities that it entailed,” Perriello said.In other words, for years the national compromise had been that abortion would be legal but taxpayer money would not go toward it. But that meant that the compromise making up the social contract was built on the backs of poor women. As Perriello came to understand the structural inequality required by the Hyde Amendment, he abandoned his support of it.The evolution didn’t come on the eve of his new bid for office. After leaving the House, he ran the political arm of the Center for American Progress, where he often advocated for reproductive rights. In 2013 he co-hosted an event in Washington, D.C., held by NARAL Pro-Choice America dubbed “Men for Choice.” Last year, in an interview for HuffPost’s Candidate Confessional podcast, he called Stupak the “worst vote of his career.”On Friday, he posted a lengthy statement on Facebook, saying that he regretted his vote. “I can’t change the vote I took six years ago, but I have committed myself in the years since and can commit here and now to be a staunch and committed defender of reproductive autonomy. As Governor, I will work to roll back harmful restrictions on the right to choose and on abortion providers here in Virginia, oppose a 20-week abortion ban, make contraception more readily available, and ensure abortion care is safe, compassionate and accessible for women when they need it,” he wrote.Perriello will be taking on Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam in the June 13 primary. Northam has been endorsed by most of the leading figures in the Virginia political establishment, including the governor and both sitting senators. Northam is a liberal-to-moderate Democrat whom Republicans considered conservative enough to try to woo him to switch sides. He has a strong record on abortion rights and is likely to pick up the endorsements of local reproductive freedom groups. The fight over Perriello’s abortion rights record comes in the wake of the bitter Democratic presidential primary contest between Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, in which Sanders backers were often accused of ignoring racism and sexism and focusing on the plight of the working classes, and Clinton supporters were accused of masking a corporate-friendly ideology behind a veil of identity politics. In the end, or course, neither went to the White House.The sharp reaction to Perriello’s candidacy suggests those intra-party wounds have not healed, even in the case of a candidate who is now fully on board with the agenda of the reproductive rights movement. The party itself has moved sharply on the issue even in the years since Perriello lost his House seat. When repealing the Hyde Amendment made it into the Democratic Party platform in 2016, it was a first, and Clinton herself had to be pressured hard to come out publicly against the Helms Amendment, which is the foreign aid version of Hyde.The tragedy of the Stupak-Pitts amendment, which President Barack Obama helped negotiate, is that it probably wasn’t even needed to get the votes for passage of Obamacare. Both Reps. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who were at the center of vote counting, told HuffPost at the time they probably could have whipped enough votes to offset the loss of Stupak. “I think we could have,” Clyburn said. “But I would much rather have 219 than try to eke out 216.” Hoyer agreed. “I think we could’ve done it,” he said. “We would’ve had to get more marginal members, the Blue Dog and other caucuses — I guess the Blue Dogs primarily.”Bart Stupak himself saw it, too. “Speakers never bring a bill to the floor unless they have the votes. And they always have a few in reserve,” Stupak explained to the Catholic News Agency in a post-vote interview. “I had a number of members who thanked us after, because they could vote no.” In other words, with the bill on the line, given the up-or-down choice of voting for Obamacare without the additional abortion restrictions, they’d have voted yes. Instead, Stupak enabled them to get enough votes that some vulnerable members could vote no to try to save their re-elections. Democrats were wiped out in 2010 anyway, so all the calculating and compromising was for naught. "

He paused for a second.“Perhaps I shouldn’t have used that phrase.”The crowd laughed.Left unsaid, though, was that the overwhelming dominance of American female athletes in international competitions during Obama’s two terms represented a major public policy victory for the United States, which more than four decades earlier had enshrined equal opportunity for girls and women in sports into federal law.Obama is not responsible for creating Title IX, the 1972 law meant to guarantee women and girls equal access to athletics and education. But the president has aggressively celebrated, enforced and expanded Title IX’s reach on issues from gender equity in sports to campus sexual assault to the rights of transgender students and athletes.Now, as President-elect Donald Trump sets out to reshape federal education policy, the question is whether that legacy can remain intact.A Reversal Of Bush-Era PolicyAlthough Title IX itself does not explicitly mention sports, it is most commonly associated with gender equality on the athletic field. And almost immediately after Obama took office, his administration set about reshaping how the law applied to female athletes.In 2005, President George W. Bush’s Department of Education walked back decades of Title IX practices by changing the rules for how to determine whether schools had violated female students’ rights to equal opportunity. The Bush administration’s move was seen as a setback for women and girls, who still faced massive gaps in access to sports at the primary and secondary school level. Activists pressured Obama and then-Education Secretary Arne Duncan to take action.The Education Department reversed the Bush administration’s guidance in 2010, reinstating earlier standards that increased the burden on schools to demonstrate their compliance with the law. Complaints under Title IX drastically increased in the following years: In the 2013-14 fiscal year, the department’s Office of Civil Rights received more than 3,600 official complaints alleging disparities in athletic opportunities — nearly triple the number that had been filed in the four years prior.Activists at the time said the rise in complaints were due at least in part to increased awareness about the law and the growing expectation that women and girls deserve equal footing on the field.A ‘Historic’ Move Against Campus Sexual AssaultA year later, an even bigger change — one that could become the defining legacy of how Obama and Vice President Joe Biden approached Title IX — arrived when the administration took on an issue activists and students had pressed them on for years: campus sexual assault.Federal officials had previously released recommendations on how to handle sexual assault and violence complaints under Title IX. But in 2011, the Office of Civil Rights issued what’s called a “Dear Colleague” letter — a means of outlining procedures and official departmental guidance under the law — that told school administrators at the collegiate and K-12 level that they were responsible for protecting women from sexual violence and outlined specific rules and procedures for how to handle claims of assault.“This was historic,” said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president who spearheaded much of the administration’s gender equity policy moves. “While Title IX had always protected students from sexual harassment and assault, this was the first time any federal administration called sexual violence a civil rights issue.”That change has had tangible effects, especially when coupled with awareness campaigns Biden and student activists launched in subsequent years: The Office of Civil Rights is currently investigating more than 400 sexual assault complaints at colleges and schools, Jarrett said. Those include complaints at some of America’s most prestigious universities — including Harvard, Yale and Stanford — and in school districts in some of its largest cities, including the nation’s capital.Several of the most high-profile cases involving Title IX and sexual assault came from the world of college sports. None, perhaps, made bigger news than the case of former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston, who was accused of rape by a female student in 2012. Winston wasn’t charged — Florida State settled a Title IX lawsuit with the accuser in January 2016, and Winston and his accuser ultimately settled lawsuits against each other in December.But his case became a national example of the myriad issues around sexual assault on college campuses. It had the effect of broadening the impact of the Obama administration’s efforts to change the way such cases are handled, said Scott Lewis, a partner at the NCHERM Group, which advises schools on Title IX compliance.“The Winston case, I think, took it to the broader audience in a fashion that had not been introduced to them before,” Lewis said. “That broadened the audience. Now you had ESPN talking about it in a different way [as well as] other people who before weren’t as open to that concept having more discussions about how schools should be doing this.”‘Concern’ For The Trump EraThe Obama administration took another major action on Title IX in May, when the Education and Justice departments reminded schools that the law guaranteed equal treatment for transgender students — something that will inevitably spill over into athletics, given the controversy over the ability of those students to access the bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity.However, activists and experts are worried that the Trump administration could roll back Obama’s expansive actions.Conservatives have already opposed the inclusion of transgender students under Title IX. The issue could soon be decided in court, after a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction requested by Texas and other states.There have also been concerns ― including from universities and legal scholars ― that the Obama administration applied Title IX to campus sexual assault and harassment issues in ways that hurt due process rights of accused students or lead to overzealous investigations.Betsy DeVos, Trump’s pick to head the Department of Education, supports major reforms for public education. And although her past suggests she will oppose the Obama administration’s inclusion of transgender students in Title IX, she has said little about her approach.“Obviously we’re concerned there will be a rollback in enforcement,” said Neena Chaudhry, director of education and senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center in Washington.“There’s a lot of understandable anxiety based on statements by the campaign and nominations that have been announced,” she said. “We’ve already seen an uptick in harassment and violence even since November, and I think it will be very important for the incoming administration to ... continue to vigorously enforce civil rights law.”But Chaudhry and others also see reasons to believe that big, swift changes might not come — especially when it comes to addressing campus sexual assault.There’s bipartisan support for Senate legislation that could force sweeping changes in how colleges handle sexual assault cases. And schools have begun to take action on their own. Florida State, for example, argued that it undertook major efforts to reshape its approach to sexual assault cases in the wake of the Winston case, and Lewis said the rash of investigations and complaints over the last five years have begun to shift attitudes on campuses across the country. Schools now believe they have the responsibility to address these issues, and those attitudes won’t be easy to change.At least on sexual assault issues, the Obama administration’s Title IX legacy is “pretty well-established in the fact that schools are really changing the way they address these issues, arguably in a fashion that should have been changed years ago,” Lewis said. “There’s an increase in reporting of incidents, an increase in adjudication, and an increase in accountability. I think their legacy is that schools are starting to realize that they have to do this better.”There is similar momentum in sports. During the Obama years, women have ascended to previously inaccessible roles and set milestones in the Olympics, Major League Baseball, the NFL, the NBA and the sports media.When the USWNT visited the White House, a 13-year-old girl named Ayla Ludlow introduced the president.That summer, Ayla’s brother had walked into the room where she was watching the Women’s World Cup.“Ayla,” she says he said, “boys are so much better than girls at soccer.”“It makes me mad that people do not treat girls equally,” Ayla wrote in a letter to the Obamas.“Plus,” she wrote, “a lot of girls are better at sports than boys.”"

5,POLITICS,Self-Proclaimed ‘Inventor Of Email’ Is Back With Another Defamation Lawsuit,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-masnick-shiva-ayyadurai_us_58702c7ce4b02b5f8588f8f1,"Having previously sued Gawker Media, Shiva Ayyadurai has sicced his lawyer on TechDirt’s Mike Masnick.",2017-01-07,Shiva Ayyadurai says he invented email and is suing a reporter who says he didn't.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587036841200002d00ad621c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shiva Ayyadurai hasn’t been entirely successful in presenting himself as the inventor of email, as numerous experts and critics have publicly contended his claims are untrue. But one way in which Ayyadurai has truly distinguished himself is in his single-minded determination to destroy anyone who points this out. And, according to The Hollywood Reporter’s Eriq Gardner, Ayyadurai has trained his attention toward TechDirt’s Mike Masnick, who has been especially relentless at asserting that Ayyaudurai’s claims are bogus. Per Gardner:Techdirt founder Mike Masnick will be going toe-to-toe in court with Charles Harder, the Hollywood attorney who famously represented Hulk Hogan in the sex tape lawsuit that brought down Gawker. On Wednesday, Harder’s client Shiva Ayyadurai filed a $15 million libel lawsuit in Massachusetts against Masnick, Leigh Beadon and Techdirt parent company Floor64 Inc. over articles that doubted Ayyadurai’s claim to have invented e-mail.[Read the full complaint here.]Yes, lest we forget, the real superstar in the campaign to extract money from media companies for reporting true things that Ayyadurai doesn’t like is the lawyer Charles Harder, who spent most of last year in the news for his role in scuttling Gawker Media at the behest of Peter Thiel — a billionaire tech investor who may not know who actually invented email. As Gardner notes, there’s no indication that Thiel is playing any role in Ayyadurai’s legal claims against Masnick. Ayyadurai has long claimed that he was the bona fide inventor of what we refer to as email. It’s true that he wrote code for an electronic messaging platform at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1978, and subsequently copyrighted that software, which he referred to as “EMAIL,” four years later. But Ray Tomlinson sent the very first email in 1971 on the U.S. Department of Defense’s ARPANET system. And, as computer scientist Larry Tesler has pointed out, researchers at Xerox PARC “were developing the Laurel email application” — which “had a modern-style paned-window user interface, an In-box and mail folders” at the same time Ayyadurai was coding his system. Ayyadurai’s talent is not lost on anyone — including Masnick. But Masnick, in one of the articles cited in Ayyadurai’s complaint, contends that the email-invention claim goes too far:For almost five years now, we’ve been among those explaining why Shiva Ayyadurai’s claim that he invented email is complete bullshit. It’s not true. Not even remotely. What does appear to be true is that as a fairly bright kid, Ayyadurai was working for a small college in New Jersey and he wrote an electronic messaging program for the school, which he named Email. It was not the first. It was not the last. It was nothing special. Nothing about what Ayyadurai did was new — even if he came up with the ideas entirely on his own. Basically every feature that he put in the application was previously discussed on open mailing lists and RFCs about the internet and the messaging systems that would be grafted onto it — sometimes many years earlier. Ayyadurai tries to rely on the fact that he got a copyright for his program as proof, hoping to confuse people who don’t understand the difference between a copyright and a patent. As we’ve noted in the past: Microsoft has a copyright on the “Windows” operating system. That doesn’t mean it invented windows-based graphical user interfaces (because it did not). Nevertheless, this appears to be the hill upon which Ayyadurai has chosen to die — perhaps taking with him a number of media organizations that may have done nothing more than report true things.Over at Fortune, Jeff John Roberts has gathered the opinion of media lawyer Ed Klaris, who said TechDirt would likely succeed if this case went to trial:“This is a classic scientific debate, which is a cornerstone of the First Amendment, second only to political debate. Theories of who invented something as basic as email software code need to be free and open and not constrained by claims of libel,” says Klaris. He adds that TechDirt’s comments about Ayyadurai amount to rhetoric and are part of the debate, and that the claims in question are not provable.However, as Roberts goes on to note, in order to win at trial, Masnick would have to mount a costly defense — and the cornerstone of Harder’s strategy in the Gawker cases was less about making a case at trial and more about breaking his opponents’ bank. “The expense of mounting a defense across the country may be prohibitive for [Masnick’s] small company,” Roberts writes, “while depositions and other aspects of the legal process would prove time-consuming and expensive.” (Roberts has previously written a thoroughly good explanation of the Thiel-Harder strategy.)So that’s what’s at stake for Masnick. But what of Ayyadurai? While Harder’s client may succeed in winning a settlement from Masnick, doing so will inevitably lead to more media accounts in which his claims to have been the inventor of email will be treated roughly. In theory, this could provide Ayyadurai with further targets for attempted self-enrichment. But it would come at a cost: increasing public awareness that he’s been making unsupported assertions.Sometimes, a legal action that seeks to keep a piece of information from the public ends up amplifying that information to such a degree that even more people find out about it. The popular name for this is “the Streisand Effect” — a reference to the singer’s 2003 lawsuit seeking to have a photo of her home removed from the internet, which of course only caused the photo to be distributed to an even wider audience. The term was coined in January 2005 — by Mike Masnick.~~~~~ Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

He watched the shooter calmly fire at people, including a man who was struck in the head just 10 feet from Frappier.“He never said anything the entire time,” Frappier said of the gunman, who police later as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago. “He was cool, calm and collected. He never grimaced.”Frappier stayed down, facing the floor “like a tortoise with the backpack on me” as shots continued to pop around him, he told CNN.The shooter turned to fire at Frappier and he felt something strike him in the back, but he thought it might have been luggage falling from the suitcase conveyor belt, he said to the Herald.It was only later when police had arrested Santiago that Frappier went to the bathroom to check himself that he discovered a bullet had entered his backpack and ripped through a corner of his laptop. When he turned over his backpack to the FBI, agents discovered a 9 mm bullet inside the pack, he told CNN. “It hit just so through the open backpack, exited, ran through the laptop and the casing and landed in an interior pocket of the backpack,” the Atlanta school counselor who was in town for an education conference, he added.His Apple MacBook sustained a jagged hole where the bullet struck the computer. An agent told him the laptop likely saved his life.“The way that it ricocheted and entered my bag. That would have been my back,” Frappier said to Anderson Cooper.He told the Herald that if he wasn’t wearing his backpack, “the bullet would have shot me between the shoulders.” “It still doesn’t feel real,” he added.After the flurry of shooting that also wounded eight people, airport police officers arrested Santiago as he fled toward a departure gate. A law enforcement official told The New York Times that Santiago had walked into an FBI office in November in his hometown of Anchorage, Alaska, saying that he was hearing voices urging him to commit violence and that a U.S. intelligence agency was controlling his mind. Officials had urged him to seek help."
7,THE WORLDPOST,Weekend Roundup: America’s Crisis Of Social Intelligence,"Nathan Gardels, ContributorEditor-in-chief, The WorldPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weekend-roundup-151_us_586fd09de4b043ad97e32ab5,Fake news and hacking highlight a troubled democratic discourse.,2017-01-07,"In a world where fact and fiction are increasingly overlapping, fake news and cybersecurity challenge Americans.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586fd8921200002e00ad6050.jpeg?cache=79ZVYn6Hay&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the recent U.S. presidential election campaign was about defining American reality, little has been decided. The ongoing inability to arrive at a shared worldview or even to agree on basic facts, abetted by a media that thrives on adversity to monetize attention, is deadly for the discourse in any democracy.This crisis of social intelligence in which the perception of reality is unmoored from objective observation is even more consequential than the highly damaging quarrel between the official U.S. intelligence agencies and President-elect Donald Trump over Russian influence meddling. But the two are linked.None of the intelligence professionals I know would ever consider themselves infallible. Yet they do strive mightily to establish the facts and resist partisan pressures to slant their findings. Professional intelligence analysis seeks to root out false signals, disinformation, unfounded rumor and subjective opinion. It is, in effect, the opposite of peer-driven social media which now has the most influence over American hearts and minds including, apparently, over the incoming commander-in-chief.While the joint report on the Russian hacks released last week by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security was scored by some as less than conclusive, former NATO commander James Stavridis and cybersecurity expert Dave Weinstein believe it was highly effective. “Publicly laying this level of detail out sets a dramatic precedent that could serve a significant blow to Russia’s current and future cyberoperations in the U.S. and elsewhere,” they write. “The technical details of the report constitute an intelligence windfall for ordinary network defenders who have been starving for rich real-time threat information from the federal government to protect their systems against sophisticated actors.” A further report released Friday by U.S. intelligence agencies concludes that Russia aimed “to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency” and that “Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Writing from Moscow, Maria Snegovaya reports that most commentators there have greeted President Barack Obama’s recently announced sanctions in response to Russian hacking with “mockery and derision.” Official Russia, she says, has offered the usual retort: deny then distort. If identifying and shutting down hackers has become a key task of intelligence agencies in these cyber times, the new challenge for education is to provide young people with the tools of social intelligence so they can tell fact from fabrication on social media. Stanford professor Sam Wineburg lays out the steps educators need to take to help students discern what is fake news or not. “The tools we’ve invented are handling us,“ he says, “not the other way around.” Teacher Lynn Kelley tells her students they fall victim to fake news when they lack the critical distance to be aware of their own biases and assumptions or when they are unable to evaluate claims without the relevant historical knowledge. Natalie Jackson reports on a poll that says most Americans think tweets are not the way a president should communicate. The scientific consensus on climate change is perhaps the most contested fact by the new powers to be in Washington. These stunning motion graphics compiled by James Warner illustrate the toll a warming climate took on the planet in 2016. Dominique Mosbergen reports that, indeed, 2016 was the hottest year on record. Nicolas Berggruen and I suggest how the incoming U.S. administration can promote renewable energy while creating jobs and security for Americans by jointly investing with China and Mexico in the infrastructure of a “solar border” instead of a wall. Guy Standing argues that a universal basic income would be a bulwark against far-right populism because it provides a secure economic base in people’s lives. “The response to these darkening times,” he writes, “must be to devise and rally support for a new income distribution system.”In other global developments, yet another terror attack hit Istanbul on New Year’s Eve at a fashionable nightclub on the banks of the Bosphorus. Turkish journalist Ilgin Yorulmaz reports that, despite the aims of the terrorists, the responses to the attack are serving to unite a divided country. Mercy Corps’ Michael Bowers looks ahead to the humanitarian crises that should garner more attention in 2017 – in Yemen, South Sudan and Lake Chad. Ali Rodriguez reports that the economic situation has become so dire in Venezuela that even talented artists committed to the opposition can’t afford to stay and are fleeing.Former Iranian National Security Council member Seyed Hossein Mousavian sees the potential for hope in the incoming U.S. administration. “While it might sound counterintuitive,” he writes, “Republican control of Congress and the presidency presents an opportunity for successful U.S.- Iran diplomacy. The U.S. government is now able to act in unison, enabling for novel approaches towards the region that may have previously been politically impossible.” In his piece, Mousavian also lists what he believes President-elect Donald Trump should know about Iran. One point is that America’s military presence in the Middle East has created instability there. Interestingly, while chaos gripping much of the Mideast is leading to disengagement by world powers, Eric Olander and Cobus van Staden explore why China is actually looking to invest more in the region.In recent years, China was also always the poster child for the worst pollution in the world that came along with rapid growth. Now that China is trying to clean up its act, and India has joined the club of rapid growth, it is facing its own challenges. Bhargav Krishna writes from New Delhi that, “India’s under-funded public health system is straining to cope with the increasing burden of pollution-driven illnesses.”Writing from Hong Kong Wang Xiangwei reports that President Xi Jinping, recently donned “a core leader,” denounced resistance to his reforms by local officials at a Politburo meeting this week after which his comments were splashed across national media. Former Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei argues that, despite Brexit and the Trump election, globalization is not doomed; it is just shifting East with China in a leading position. Taking a comprehensive strategic view of world events, Zbigniew Brzezinski proposes that the only effective response to the present crisis of global power is trilateral cooperation among the U.S., China and Russia. He warns that, “The U.S. should not act towards China as if it were already an enemy; significantly, it should not favor India as America’s principal ally in Asia. This would almost guarantee a closer connection between China and Russia. Nothing is more dangerous to the U.S. than such a close connection.”Our Singularity series this week looks at the technological developments to watch in 2017 – artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, decentralized peer-to-peer networks, biosynthetic labs and autonomous vehicles. Finally, our latest column by the Future of Life Institute reminds us that, in many ways, 2016 was a year of hope with advances in AI and health as well as new moves to reduce the global number of nuclear weapons.EDITORS: Nathan Gardels, Co-Founder and Executive Advisor to the Berggruen Institute, is the Editor-in-Chief of The WorldPost.

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think straight. I just wanted to collapse into my bed and never get out of it.From personal experience, I can tell you that I’m eight months into the loss and I still haven’t fully processed the whole thing. Every time I try, I push the feelings down deep into my toes because I’m just not ready to feel those emotions again.I see other people who have had similar losses (that of a parent, or close relative) and they seem to be doing well (or that could just be the social media fantasy they are showing) and I have to remind myself that we all grieve in our own ways.One thing to always keep in mind, and I’ll probably repeat this several times: Everyone grieves differently! AND THAT’S OK!The next time someone you know is dealing with a death of someone close to them, please keep these DOs and DON’Ts in mind! They’ll be happier for it and you’ll look less annoying.TRUST ME!1. DON’T SAY: They’re in a better place now.​I’m going to be extremely blunt. You ready? If that person isn’t religious, those words mean NOTHING.I’m not religious, like at ALL. So, when I hear that he’s in a better place, all I hear is that his cremated remains are sitting in my mother’s closet. I know you mean well, but just don’t.SAY: I can’t even begin to understand what you’re going through.Because unless you’ve actually lost someone really close to you, you really don’t know what that person is going through. Additionally, every person processes grief differently.2. DON’T SAY: I know how you feel.​Like I said above, it’s REALLY hard to know exactly what someone is feeling at the time of loss. By saying you know how you feel, you are, in a way, diminishing their own feelings.SAY: NOTHING!Sometimes silence is more comforting than words.3. DON’T SAY: Stay strong.​When someone passes, it’s perfectly normal to break down in tears, feel weakened by the loss, or even feel absolutely exhausted. When someone tells you to be strong, they mean well, but it just feels like they’re telling you not to process your feelings. And that’s not cool!SAY: I know this is a hard time, and I want you to know that I’m here if you need anything.Believe it or not, just knowing someone is there to pick you up when you can’t move a muscle can alleviate some of the pressure that person may feel.4. DON’T SAY: At least they lived a long life.No. No. No. A THOUSAND TIMES NO! It doesn’t matter if the person who passed was 110 years old, it’s NEVER enough time if it’s someone you love.SAY: Take your time with this and know I’m always here.One of the things I’m always afraid of is being accused of milking a situation. I have to remind myself that I lost an integral part of my life when my dad died and my heart likely won’t ever be the same. Just knowing that someone understands that means the world.5. DON’T SAY: You still have so much to be happy for.I, like the person you’re talking to, is mostly likely VERY aware that they still have good things going on in their life. Despite the great job, great spouse, and that awesome BMW, it still friggin’ hurts to lose someone. Let me grieve.SAY: Can I get you a tissue?Yes, you can get me a damn tissue because chances are, I’m going to be crying, A LOT! I don’t need to be reminded of all I have because all I can think about is the person I lost.This post is part of Common Grief, a Healthy Living editorial initiative. Grief is an inevitable part of life, but that doesn’t make navigating it any easier. The deep sorrow that accompanies the death of a loved one, the end of a marriage or even moving far away from home, is real. But while grief is universal, we all grievedifferently. So we started Common Grief to help learn from each other. Let’s talk about living with loss. If you have a story you’d like to share, email us at strongertogether@huffingtonpost.com."
9,PARENTS,Let Them Eat Peanuts -- Do You Really Understand What The New Guidelines Mean?,"Lianne Mandelbaum, ContributorFounder of No Nut Traveler",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/let-them-eat-peanuts-do-you-really-understand-what_us_5870ec6ee4b0eb9e49bfbbc8,Many of my friends and family truly thought that I could now somehow “fix” my 11-year-old son’s allergy.,2017-01-07,"<p>Dr. George Du Toit</p><p>LEAP Study Pro-Con Debate at FAAM, Rome, Italy</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5870f5ba1200003000ad62a5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On September 1st 2015, I was preparing to be interviewed by Fox News HQ with Elizabeth Prann to discuss the challenges of flying with a food allergy. I was quite nervous, as the show was live.The host was in Washington D.C., while I was in New York City with various staff members necessary for the shows production. I engaged in nervous chatter with those around me, mostly the cameraman.He began to tell me how his son, a pre-teen, had a peanut allergy but because of the new study that had been released a few months prior, he had begun to give him tiny bits of peanut. He said he was seeing mini-responses, which had been escalating. He told me that he believed this strategy would ultimately cure his child.As he said these words to me, the only response I was able to barely mutter was, “Oh no, that’s not what the study showed at all; that’s dangerous.” The live light went on and I looked like a deer in headlights as the camera panned around to my face.Several months prior to my FOX interview, the LEAP ( Learning Early About Peanut Allergy) study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The unbridled enthusiasm and coverage on the topic by the press and medical community was based on the findings that there did actually seem to be a way to prevent the development of peanut allergies by feeding your child peanuts at an early age.Unlike what the cameraman had thought, however, this study, concluded that there existed a narrow window between 4 and 11 months of age where consuming peanuts would be beneficial in the prevention of peanut allergies. For my son, age 11, and his son – this research was not talking about them. It was not referring to them at all.The science geek in me was also enthralled by this research. As I said in my Huff Post blog at the time titled “Let Them Eat Peanuts,” ”This is about as exciting as science gets, because there may be way to affect the path of the immune system, especially if it was heading down that dark alley towards developing a peanut allergy.” My encounter with the cameraman shows us, however, that it can be quite easy and dangerous to misinterpret the topic of peanut allergy prevention.This week, new peanut allergy prevention guidelines sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases were released and the media predictably has been flooded by titles such as “Feed Your Kids Peanuts, Early and Often, New Guidelines Urge.”I am truly worried that the coverage and suggestive titles that naturally abound will serve to confuse those who don’t take the time to read what the guidelines actually mean and to whom they are directed.I woke up this morning to receive multiple emails from friends and family asking me if I had read about the exciting news about prevention of peanut allergies. Many of my well intentioned intelligent friends and family truly thought that I could now somehow “fix” my 11-year-old son’s allergy.Let me be clear once more, these guidelines are for NEW parents of very young children ONLY. Many of the questions I posed in my blog at the time of LEAP study release have been answered, such as what is thought to be the optimum amount of peanuts one must consume to keep the allergy at bay, and what will happen if you discontinue eating peanuts?A 2016 follow-up study, LEAP-On (Persistence of Oral Tolerance to Peanut), demonstrated that peanut allergy protection gained by eating peanuts early in life persisted even after the children did not eat peanuts from ages 5 to 6.I also wondered how we would determine who needs to be tested before consumption of peanuts. An expert panel that was convened issued recommendations on such testing based upon your child being put into one of three risk categories to help new parents and doctors understand who needs supervision when being fed peanuts. Related resources, including a summary for Clinicians and summary for Parents and Caregivers, are also accessible on the NIAID food allergy guidelines webpage.I am so grateful for the work of everyone who participated in this study, and for those groups who sponsored this groundbreaking research.This past October, I met and was thrilled to hear Dr. George Du Toit, Co-Investigator of the LEAP and LEAP-On study at the FAAM (Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Meeting ) in Rome, Italy. He spoke so passionately of the opportunity to stem this epidemic by exposing young babies to peanuts.I was inspired by his zealous commitment, not only to his patients, but toward the world-wide food allergic population.My son was the classic LEAP baby; he had severe eczema and an egg allergy. While I cannot go back in time to know if he would have been excluded (meaning if he was already severely allergic to peanuts), I would have tested him and tried (under supervision) to feed him peanut butter.I hope in my heart that new parents, as a result of these guidelines, will not repeat our journey as a peanut allergic family.But I worry about misinterpretations that this study is a cure for older children and adults. Many people already complain about regulations and guidelines set to protect my food allergic son and others like him. Some people have even started to blame parents for creating their children’s peanut allergy because they did not feed their children peanuts early enough in life.Please know that the guidelines at the time instructed us to delay introducing peanuts to our young children. We simply followed our doctors advice.Most importantly, the public must realize that these prevention guidelines have the enormous potential to reduce the prevalence of food allergies, but not eliminate them.It may take years before we see significant changes in the numbers of the food allergic population. In the meantime, we need to keep the children and adults who have these allergies safe. We need to educate the public, and advocate for those people who suffer from this disease on the ground and in the air.Food allergies are unique, as they require the help of those around us to keep us safe. I truly hope and am optimistic that the prevalence of peanut allergies will decrease based upon parents following the new guidelines but I also hope to see the day when a cure for food allergies is celebrated to help people like my son whose window has passed."

The graphic illustrates predicted responses on surface temperature and precipitation.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587041ca1b00002c006e60a4.jpeg?cache=clD5mIpT6E&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Climate change could become so extreme that it might trigger the cataclysmic collapse of a vital Atlantic Ocean current and plunge parts of the Northern Hemisphere into a frigid new reality, a study warns.The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) transports warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic and helps regulate climate and weather patterns all over the world. As it releases the warmth into the air, the cooling water sinks and flows back to the tropics to repeat the process. But researchers fear that as the air in the north warms significantly due to climate change, the AMOC won’t be able to transfer its warmth to the atmosphere and the great circulatory engine of the ocean could stagnate and shut down. “It is a major player in the climate system, important for Europe and North America. So it’s a big deal,” Tom Delworth, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Verge.The doomsday scenario is chillingly like the plot of the sci-fi movie “The Day After Tomorrow,” in which the collapse of an ocean current turns North America and Europe into frigid wastelands in a matter of weeks.The risk was uncovered by Yale University scientist Wei Liu, who has calculated in a study published in Science Advances that the AMOC could collapse within 300 years once atmospheric carbon dioxide increases to 710 parts per million. Last week’s levels were 405 parts per million. There is already evidence that the AMOC has slowed, according to the paper. A shutdown would trigger “prominent cooling” of the northern North Atlantic and a “remarkable sea ice expansion,” according to Wei’s model. In addition, the normal rain belt of the temperate areas would be pushed significantly southward over the tropical Atlantic.The model also predicts disruptions in other parts of the world. Without cold water moving south again, the new scenario indicates a stronger warming pattern south of the equator, creating far more rain for places like northeastern Brazil and less rain for Central America. The model also predicts a greater reduction in Antarctic sea ice.Wei warns that this fragility in the life-sustaining AMOC has been overlooked in climate change models. “The significance of our study is to point out a systematic bias in current climate models that hinders a correct climate projection,” he said in a statement.The concern about AMOC “is a very provocative idea,” said study co-author Zhengyu Liu of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “For me, it’s a 180-degree turn because I had been thinking like everyone else,” he added, referring to his earlier perspective that the AMOC would remain relatively stable regardless of the effects of climate change."
11,THE WORLDPOST,Iranians Are Dissatisfied,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; Author, ""Arab Voices""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iranians-are-dissatisfied_us_5870fadde4b0a5e600a78b28,"In the lead-up to Iran's presidential elections, a new Zogby Research Services (ZRS) poll shows that the Iranian people are",2017-01-07,"Iranian voters, left, arrive at a polling station to vote for their country's parliamentary and Experts Assembly elections as election staff receive them in Tehran, Iran, Friday, Feb. 26, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5873a6a21b00008d016e65a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the lead-up to Iran's presidential elections, a new Zogby Research Services (ZRS) poll shows that the Iranian people are not happy with either their economic situation or their government's priorities and performance. The ZRS poll was conducted in the last quarter of 2016 for the Sir Bani Yas Forum (SBY) and involved face-to-face interviews with over 1,000 Iranians nationwide. The results of this year's survey established growing dissatisfaction among Iranians and stood in marked contrast to the findings of our 2014 and 2015 SBY surveys of public opinion in Iran. In the wake of the signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the P5+1 powers in April of 2015, Iranians had high expectations their lives would improve. When ZRS polled Iranians in September of that year, we found that they wanted a shift in their government's priorities with more attention paid to improving their economic and political situation and their country's relationships with the West and with their Arab neighbors. At least three-quarters said that investing in improving the economy and creating employment (81%) and advancing democracy and protecting personal and civil rights (75%) were the most important priorities.Iranians also told us that they wanted their government to focus on improving relations with Arab governments (60%) and with the US and the West (59%). Way down on their list of priorities was support for their government's continuing involvement in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. When we asked Iranians in the 2016 survey to rate their satisfaction with the government's performance in each of these areas, their displeasure comes through quite clearly. Fifty-one percent of Iranians gave their government a passing grade for investing in improving the economy and creating employment—the only policy area to receive a passing grade. Over 70% were dissatisfied with efforts to advance democracy and protect personal and civil rights. Hope for improvement in relations with the West and Arab neighbors also fared poorly—with 65% of Iranians saying they were dissatisfied with the progress their government has made in improving relations with Arab governments and 85% displeased with the efforts to improve ties with the US and the West. This year's SBY poll also establishes that more than one half (53%) of Iranians are dissatisfied that their government is still providing support for allies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Because we have been polling since 2014 on the importance Iranians attach to each of these foreign involvements, comparing responses over that time period reveals a sharp decline in support for all of them. In 2015, 90% of Iranians saw it important for their government to be involved in Syria. That dropped to 73% in 2015, and only 24% this year! In other words, over three-quarters of Iranians do not believe that it is important for their government to continue to be involved in Syria. The same disenchantment with foreign engagement can be seen with declining support for involvement in Iraq (87% in 2014, 64% in 2015, and 47% this year. Support for involvement in Lebanon went from 88% in 2014 to 43% this year; and from 62% for Yemen in 2014 to 29% in this year's survey.)It appears that while Iranians once took pride in the government's aggressive foreign policy, they have grown war-weary and want new priorities.Last month, the problems facing the Rouhani government became even clearer as Iran's Central Bank released the 2016 government revenue and expense data. It was not a pretty picture. Despite the lifting of some the economic sanctions that followed the JCPOA, the government's projected rise in revenues did not materialize—owing in part to declining oil prices and a sluggish economy. At the same time, expenditures increased making this year's deficit larger than the past two years. Debt grew for both the government and the private sector making it more difficult for either to make needed increased investments in development and infrastructure. All of this polling and economic data makes clear that Iran and President Rouhani have a problem. The policy priorities of the government are not in sync with those of the Iranian people.The polls show that the public wants a better economy and more jobs, more political freedom, and peaceful ties with their neighbors. What they're getting instead is deeper engagement, more money spent, and lives lost in foreign wars they want to end. And as the economic data demonstrates, the Rouhani government is facing the classic choice of ""guns or butter""—and with finite resources, more guns simply mean less butter. That is why the electorate that put him in office is now showing signs of deep discontent.All of this should make the May 2017 election a referendum on Rouhani job performance and on his government's policy priorities.

The bodies of Gonzalez and both dogs were found outside a tan sedan that had crashed 325 feet below the highway along the rugged Pacific coast in central California.There was no sign of Fernandez. The steep coast and heavy rains hampered the initial search. Dogs, a California Highway Patrol helicopter and an Underwater Search and Recovery Team resumed the hunt for hours Friday — but again found no sign of the missing man. With severe weather expected, the search was suspended until next week.It’s possible Fernandez’s body was “ejected into the water,” Tony Cipolla, a spokesman for the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff’s Office, told the Los Angeles Times. The car came to rest in rocks near the surf line.Police did recover the car, which is being examined by investigators, who described the case as suspicious to KABC-TV in Los Angeles. Police, however, told other media outlets that foul play was not suspected. Autopsy results on Gonzalez are pending.Fernandez, 21, and Gonzalez, 20, were last seen Dec. 23 when they left for their holiday trip, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. They were expected to return on Christmas Day.A passing driver on Highway 1 reported wreckage about 10 miles north of Hearst Castle, near San Simeon, to police Tuesday. The bodies of Gonzalez and the dogs were found outside the crashed car.Gonzalez’s sister Vanessa Guzman told KTLA-TV in Los Angeles that her husband had received a text from the missing woman the day the couple left, saying they were two hours away from Big Sur. Their phones were turned off or went dead soon after.Guzman told the Los Angeles Daily News that she had never met Fernandez but had heard from friends that his relationship with her sister was “rocky” and she was “concerned” that they were going on a road trip together.“The body they found on the rocks is that of my sister, Olivia. She was a beautiful soul,” Guzman wrote in a statement. “Prayers for my family at this time is greatly appreciated, we are grieving at this time.”"

It boasts the oldest winery in the New World and it is one of the largest growers of grapes in the Americas, but paradoxically makes only a tiny 20 million liters of wine a year. By comparison, the United States produces three billion liters. Mexico has over 100,000 acres of vineyards, but most of these are devoted to brandy production. Mexico, incidentally, is the third largest producer of brandy in the world.The origins of Mexico's wine industry go back to 1521 and the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. Legend has it that one of Hernán Cortéz's first orders in 1524, as governor of New Spain, was that each colonist was to plant 1,000 grapevines, for each 100 native employees, each year for five years. This was several decades before the planting of grapes in Chile (1548) and Argentina (1551).Early attempts to grow grapes in the more tropical areas of Mexico failed. Grapes were planted in the Parras Valley of Coahuila in 1593, followed by Puebla and Zacatecas. Lorenzo Garcia founded Casa Madero, the first Mexican winery, in Santa Maria de las Parras in Coahuila in 1597. It is today one of Mexico's largest wine producers and the oldest winery in the Americas. Ironically, vines from the Parras Valley were later exported to California's Napa Valley, as well as to Chile and Argentina. Generally speaking, grapes in the northern hemisphere are grown between 30 degrees and 50 degrees of latitude. Mexico is unusual in that most of the country lies south of the 30th parallel. The combination of high altitude vineyards and the cooling effects of winds and fogs from the Pacific, however, have allowed grapes to thrive. Initially, the Mexican wine industry flourished. Grapevines adapted readily to Mexico's Mediterranean climate. The Spanish emperor, Charles I, even ordered that all ships traveling to New Spain bring a quota of grapevines for cultivation. The first grape variety grown was the ubiquitous Mission grape of California known locally as Listan Prieto; the same variety is called Criolla in Argentina and Pais in Chile.The situation took a turn for the worse at the end of the 17th century, however. Rising French wine production began to cut in on European demand for Spanish wines. In an effort to protect the domestic wine industry, Charles II banned the production of wine in Spain's foreign colonies in 1699, and required them to import Spanish wine instead. The Catholic missions were exempt from the ban and allowed to make small quantities of wine for religious purposes. It was a Jesuit priest, Juan Jugarte, who established, in 1701, the first vineyards in Baja California at Loreto Mission. Jugarte, along with Father Juan Maria Salvatierra, were moving north to California, establishing missions along the way. The Santo Tomas Mission, founded by Jesuits in 1791, became Mexico's largest wine producer. The Dominicans followed in 1843, and established the first vineyards in Baja's Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe del Norte Valley. Today the Guadalupe Valley is the center of Mexico's fine wine production and the region boasts over 50 wineries.Despite being restricted to making only small quantities of wine for sacramental purposes, the Catholic missions became significant wine producers. Between 1699 and 1857, the various Catholic missions produced virtually all wine in Mexico. The industry remained small, but otherwise healthy.The Mexican government, following the War of Reform in 1857, seized all the land holdings of the Catholic Church. Some of the vineyards, like San Tomaso, were sold to Mexican investors. That winery has continued to operate to this day. Many of the mission vineyards, however, were simply abandoned.A winery in Mexico's Guadalupe ValleyThe arrival of the Molokans, pacifist Russian Christian refugees, in the late 19th century to the Guadalupe Valley, gave the Mexican wine industry a fresh start. The Molokans were farmers who were escaping persecution at the hands of the Czar's army. They purchased 100 acres of land and began growing wine grapes. They also introduced modern farming and winemaking practices to the region. The wine industry lost a huge part of its vineyards to Phylloxera at the turn of the century. The industry was further disrupted by the violence and domestic turmoil that accompanied the Mexican revolution of 1910. Many wine estates were destroyed or abandoned by their owners. The growth of the Mexican beer industry following the revolution also slowed the recovery of the wine industry as beer became more popular than wine. Mexicans also have the distinction of having the highest per capita consumption of Coca Cola. The wine industry recovered somewhat in the 1920s. In 1949 the National Association of Wine Producers was created with an initial membership of fifteen wineries. Fourteen more producers joined during the 1950s. During the 1970s production tripled through a combination of expanded vineyards and an increase in wine production capacity.High-end wine production in Mexico began in the 1970s. Casa Pedro Domecq began operations in the Guadalupe valley in 1972. Shortly after, Hugo D'Acosta organized La Escuelita to teach local growers modern methods for processing their grapes into wine. The school also functioned as a cooperative, providing the necessary equipment to growers for wine production. By the end of the decade, Mexican wine producers were selling four million cases a year. The decision of the Mexican government to open up its wine market to foreign producers, however, resulted in a significant drop in domestic production. Today Baja California, which is the epicenter of Mexico's fine wine industry, and responsible for 90 percent of production, only sells 1.6 million cases of wine a year. It is widely accepted, however, that the quality of Mexican wine has increased significantly over the last 40 years. There are approximately 100 wineries in Mexico, with over 50 of them headquartered in the Guadalupe Valley. Mexico is the 25th largest wine producer in the world, but ranks only 66th in wine consumption.In 2015, Mexican wine consumption was about four million cases. Roughly a third was from domestic production and the balance was from foreign imports. About two-thirds of those imports were from Europe and the balance from other wine producing regions, especially Chile, Argentina and Australia. Per capita wine consumption in Mexico is about .4 gallons per year compared to two gallons in the United States and 15 gallons in France. Per capita wine consumption has doubled in the last decade and has become the aspirational beverage of Mexico's growing middle class.Today, Mexico boasts two major grape growing areas. The northern area includes Baja and Sonora, as well as the Parras Valley in the La Laguna area astride Coahuila and Durango. These are the principal production zones for fine wines, with the overwhelming majority in Baja. Much of Sonora's wine production is slated for distillation into brandy. Aguascalientes, Zacatecas and Queretaro in central Mexico mostly produce grapes for brandy and sherry production, although there is also significant production of sparkling wines.Generally speaking these regions have climates ranging from Mediterranean to desert-like. Annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches to as little as three to four. Irrigation is unavoidable and relies on a combination of natural springs and ground water. Sparkling wine production at Cavas Freixenet in QuertaroBaja's vineyards have humid winters, dry warm summers, and cooling morning fogs and sea breezes. Average summer temperatures are 86 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures are 42 degrees Fahrenheit. The climate and many of the varietals grown are similar to California's Napa Valley, a similarity that has led many to label the region the next Napa Valley. Similarities notwithstanding, it is generally warmer and drier than Napa.This region produces around 90 percent of Mexico's fine wines from four principal areas in the San Antonio de las Minas zone around the port city of Ensenada: Valley of Guadalupe, Calafia Valley, San Vicente Valley, Santo Tomas Valley and, to a lesser extent, the San Rafael Valley. These valleys have a complex soil geology consisting of areas of decomposed granitic soils and others that are predominantly alluvial sands, gravels, sandy loam and some red clay.The principal wine producers here are L.A. Cetto, Vinos Pedro Domecq and Bodega de Santo Tomas. All three produce wines that have medaled in international competitions. L. A. Cetto and Pedro Domecq account for 80 percent of Mexico's wine production. The Ruta del Vino (Wine Route) connects approximately 50 wineries in the area between Ensenada and Tecate. It runs from the U.S. border city of Tijuana, about two hours to the north. The Parras Valley is the oldest wine making region of Mexico. The valley sits at an altitude of 4,500 feet in an otherwise desert area. Annual precipitation is between three and four inches a year. The low humidity inhibits fungal and insect damage, while the pronounced diurnal temperature variation, some 22 degrees Fahrenheit between day and night, promotes ripening while maintaining acidity. The valley produces Bordeaux blends as well as single varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Merlot and Tempranillo. In central Mexico, most vineyards are at altitudes of 6,500 feet. In addition to sparkling wines, ""vinos espumosos,"" the region also produces Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon and surprisingly Pinot Noir. Much of the regions grape production, however, is earmarked for brandy production. The area's soils are mostly clay and loam and retain moisture well. Climate wise, both summers and winters tend to be cool, and the high altitude produces a pronounced diurnal variation in temperatures. Spain's Freixenet is the largest producer in this region. Mexico grows a variety of grapes in the approximately 6,200 acres of vineyards earmarked for fine wine production. It lacks, however, a signature or defining grape variety or wine style. The principal grapes grown are the better-known international varieties. Whites include Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay, Palomino, Chasselas, Macabeo, Muscatel, Riesling, Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier. Reds include the principal Bordeaux varieties, Grenache, Tempranillo, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo, Barbera, Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Some of these varieties, like Chasselas, typically grown in Switzerland, and Italian varieties like Nebbiolo, Dolcetto and Barbera, seem wholly unsuited for Mexico's arid wine country. The three most widely planted varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo and Chardonnay.Vertical shoot positioning is the most common trellis system. Vineyard spacing varies from 3 x 3 feet to 6 x 9 feet, with vine density ranging from a low of around 2,500 vines per acre to a high of around 4,000 vines. Yields vary from two to three tons per acre. Many growers have started to restrict yields by green pruning to no more than two clusters per shoot and limiting each vine to between six and eight shoots. Harvest is generally from late July to early October.Cellar at the Adobe Quadalupe winery in Ensenada, Valle de GuadalupeMost wines are fermented in stainless steel with the length of maceration and fermentation varying depending on a producer's style. Red wines are typically aged in either French or American oak for periods ranging from a few months to as much as 24 months. One of the interesting features of Mexican wine production is that the arid climate tends to produce grapes with unusually thick skins. Baja Nebbiolo, for example, produce a dark, inky wine that is unlike any other Nebbiolo in the world and has more in common with Petite Sirah or warm climate Cabernet Sauvignon's than it does with its Italian Piedmont cousins. The origins of Baja's Nebbiolo remains something of a mystery. The vines arrived after World War II and are believed to be a number of different Nebbiolo clones, but the identification tags were lost in transit and no one is certain what those varieties might be.Specific wine appellations are only now beginning to be delineated. The first official Mexican wine appellation is the Parras Valley. Beyond imposing a 25 percent tax on wine sales, the Mexican government has given the wine industry a free rein.The result has been some unusual wines, including blends of vinifera and table grapes like Thompson, as well as blends consisting of Mexican and foreign grapes. The Casa di Piedra winery for example, produces a wine, Contraste, made from a blend of grape juice from the Valle de Guadalupe and juice imported from France. There are also some unusual blends like Cabernet Sauvignon blended with either Grenache or Nebbiolo. Baja wines tend to be deeply colored and full bodied-these are big, powerful, heavily extracted wines with a substantial weight and mouth feel and a propensity to taste jammy. Grapes here tend to be thicker skinned than normal, creating more intense flavors and aromas. One particular feature of Baja wines is a tendency for wines that are irrigated with ground water to occasionally have a noticeable saline element. This is sometimes described as minerality, stoniness or steeliness, as well as saltiness. Salinity is unusual but not unheard of in wines. Vineyards close to the sea often exhibit some saline notes. Soils or ground waters that have high levels of metallic salts, like Langhorne Creek in Australia, for example, can also impart a saline element to wines. Mexico's growing reputation as a wine producer has been attracting international wine companies. In addition to Freixenet and Pedro Domecq, new foreign investors include Chuck Wagner of Napa's Caymus Vineyards and Henri Lurton of Bordeaux's Chateau Brane-Cantenac. The Chalone Group and Wente Vineyards are also becoming more involved in the Mexican wine industry.Mexican wines are becoming more prevalent in the United States, especially in the larger urban wine markets. Below is a selection of Mexican wines worth trying.A. L. Cetto, Private Reserve Nebbiolo, 2009, 13.8% ABV (Average price $18)This is a deep ruby wine with hints of purple throughout. On the nose there are dried fruit aromas of dark cherry, prune and some indistinct tropical fruit elements, followed by notes of bittersweet chocolate and espresso. With a little time, some tobacco notes, followed by hints of wood smoke and old leather emerge. On the palate there are flavors of cooked/jammy red and black fruit, with a distinct dark cherry flavor and even a bit of cranberry. There are hints of smoke, but none of the tar typical of Piedmont's powerful Barolos. There is a pronounced acidity with well-integrated fine tannins and moderate alcohol. The body is medium weight with a supple, almost silky texture. The finish is mid-length with dried fruit flavors and notes of blood and red meat and a hint of a savory, saline note, at the end. This is an outstanding Nebbiolo, one unlike its Italian cousins. It tastes almost like a cross between the lighter Nebbiolo of the Valtellina and their more robust Piedmontese brethren; but one that combines very ripe fruit with moderate alcohol and fine well-integrated tannins, along with some uniquely Mexican characteristics. The L.A. Cetto winery in Ensenada in the Valle de GuadalupeA.L. Cetto, Sauvignon Blanc, 2014, 12% ABV (Average price $12)This wine received a commendation at the Decanter 2014 World Wine Awards. The color is a very pale lemon green; reminiscent of those almost clear and eminently forgettable, bulk produced Italian Pinot Grigios. On the nose, however, there is a veritable explosion of aromas. You can pick out citrus notes of lime, lemon zest and a bit of orange peel, followed by indistinct floral aromas and spicy fresh herbs like cilantro, lemon grass and ginger. As it warms up notes of stone fruit, tropical fruit and lychees emerge.On the palate there is a pronounced lime zest note followed by sweet mandarins, more stone fruit and tropical melon. The acidity is bright and crisp and is a perfect counterpoint for highlighting the fruit. It imparts a sensation of sweetness to what is otherwise a dry wine. The finish is long, featuring tropical fruit notes and a hint of ginger pepperiness. This is an interesting Sauvignon Blanc. It lacks the minerality and vegetal notes of its French counterparts but stops short of the over the top semi-dry, tropical fruit cocktail typical of many of New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc's. Definitely worth a try, especially if you hanker for a drier version of Cloudy Bay's SBs while retaining their fruity complexity.Bodega de San Tomas, Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon, 2013, 14% ABV (Average price $18)Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo blends are unusual but not unheard of. The combination is becoming increasingly popular among Spanish winemakers and many consider it Spain's answer to France's ubiquitous Bordeaux blend. The color is a deep ruby, bordering on opaque, and is typical of Cabernet-Tempranillo blends for warm climates.On the nose, there are pronounced ripe red and black fruit aromas of dark cherry, prune and cooked strawberry. There are hints of tobacco leaf, some dried herbs, some spice notes and a bit of bittersweet chocolate.On the palate the fruit tastes more cooked and jammy, especially on the mid-palate where pronounced cooked strawberry notes emerge. There are notes of dark chocolate, some cola and just a hint of licorice. The alcohol is high, typical of warm climate Cabernet, with fine well-integrated tannins and medium acidity. This is a substantial wine, with a pronounced body and a smooth seamless texture that makes it eminently quaffable. The finish is long, with pronounced ripe red and black fruit notes highlighted by notes of spice and dry tobacco leaf.Like most Cabernet Sauvignon blends, the Cab provides structure while the blending partner adds more complex aromas and tastes. Tempranillo, unlike Merlot and Shiraz, the other usual blending partners, adds more pronounced red fruit notes, a slight sensation of sweetness and adds a voluptuousness to what is otherwise an often dark, brooding, warm climate Cab. A Mexican wine brand that is growing rapidly in the U.S. is Pavo Real. Produced by Pedro Domecq, a division of Pernod Ricard, for U.S. wine distributor Turquoise Life. Pavo Real offers an entry-level red and white wine. The red is an unusual blend of 50 percent Grenache, 20 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 percent Ruby Cabernet and 10 percent Barbera. The white is a blend of 45 percent Sauvignon Blanc, 45 percent Chenin Blanc and 10 percent Chardonnay. Master Sommelier Ian Cauble blended both wines. Neither wine got any oak. (Average price $10.00)The Pavo Real red shows a deep ruby color. On the nose, it offers distinctive dried red and black fruit notes of cherry, plum with a bit of strawberry and raspberry, and a hint of black current and prune. Surprisingly, the fruit is dry rather than having the jamminess one would expect from a warm climate offering. There is a noticeable herbal note in the background, more dry herbs than green.On the palate, it is extremely smooth, with fine, well-integrated tannins and medium acidity. The alcohol is 13.6 percent. Dried fruit flavors dominate on the palate.The finish is short but satisfying. This is an eminently quaffable wine. The Pavo Real white shows a yellow color with a bit of a green tinge to it. On the nose, there is a pronounced green fruit aroma of apple and pear with hints of tropical fruit and dried grapefruit peel. There is a bit of a grassy/herbal note in the background reminiscent of cooler climate Sauvignon Blanc.On the palate there is a distinct creaminess punctuated by green apple and slightly bitter citric notes as well as some melon and indistinct tropical fruits. There is a notable acidity that sets off the fruit notes quite nicely. The alcohol is 12.8 percent. The finish is short with a slight bitter note. Properly chilled, on a hot summer day this is a very drinkable wine. Fajitas anyone? Mexico's wine industry may be almost 500-years old, but it is still in its infancy. It offers an unusual combination of terrain and climate that, with the possible exception of certain parts of Argentina and South Africa, is unique and presents a fresh take on international wine varieties and their blends. Although hard to find, these are wines that are definitely worth pursuing and will in time become important and notable additions to the international wine lexicon."

The decision of the Mexican government to open up its wine market to foreign producers, however, resulted in a significant drop in domestic production. Today Baja California, which is the epicenter of Mexico's fine wine industry, and responsible for 90 percent of production, only sells 1.6 million cases of wine a year. It is widely accepted, however, that the quality of Mexican wine has increased significantly over the last 40 years. There are approximately 100 wineries in Mexico, with over 50 of them headquartered in the Guadalupe Valley. Mexico is the 25th largest wine producer in the world, but ranks only 66th in wine consumption.In 2015, Mexican wine consumption was about four million cases. Roughly a third was from domestic production and the balance was from foreign imports. About two-thirds of those imports were from Europe and the balance from other wine producing regions, especially Chile, Argentina and Australia. Per capita wine consumption in Mexico is about .4 gallons per year compared to two gallons in the United States and 15 gallons in France. Per capita wine consumption has doubled in the last decade and has become the aspirational beverage of Mexico's growing middle class.Today, Mexico boasts two major grape growing areas. The northern area includes Baja and Sonora, as well as the Parras Valley in the La Laguna area astride Coahuila and Durango. These are the principal production zones for fine wines, with the overwhelming majority in Baja. Much of Sonora's wine production is slated for distillation into brandy. Aguascalientes, Zacatecas and Queretaro in central Mexico mostly produce grapes for brandy and sherry production, although there is also significant production of sparkling wines.Generally speaking these regions have climates ranging from Mediterranean to desert-like. Annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches to as little as three to four. Irrigation is unavoidable and relies on a combination of natural springs and ground water. Sparkling wine production at Cavas Freixenet in QuertaroBaja's vineyards have humid winters, dry warm summers, and cooling morning fogs and sea breezes. Average summer temperatures are 86 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures are 42 degrees Fahrenheit. The climate and many of the varietals grown are similar to California's Napa Valley, a similarity that has led many to label the region the next Napa Valley. Similarities notwithstanding, it is generally warmer and drier than Napa.This region produces around 90 percent of Mexico's fine wines from four principal areas in the San Antonio de las Minas zone around the port city of Ensenada: Valley of Guadalupe, Calafia Valley, San Vicente Valley, Santo Tomas Valley and, to a lesser extent, the San Rafael Valley. These valleys have a complex soil geology consisting of areas of decomposed granitic soils and others that are predominantly alluvial sands, gravels, sandy loam and some red clay.The principal wine producers here are L.A. Cetto, Vinos Pedro Domecq and Bodega de Santo Tomas. All three produce wines that have medaled in international competitions. L. A. Cetto and Pedro Domecq account for 80 percent of Mexico's wine production. The Ruta del Vino (Wine Route) connects approximately 50 wineries in the area between Ensenada and Tecate. It runs from the U.S. border city of Tijuana, about two hours to the north. The Parras Valley is the oldest wine making region of Mexico. The valley sits at an altitude of 4,500 feet in an otherwise desert area. Annual precipitation is between three and four inches a year. The low humidity inhibits fungal and insect damage, while the pronounced diurnal temperature variation, some 22 degrees Fahrenheit between day and night, promotes ripening while maintaining acidity. The valley produces Bordeaux blends as well as single varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Merlot and Tempranillo. In central Mexico, most vineyards are at altitudes of 6,500 feet. In addition to sparkling wines, ""vinos espumosos,"" the region also produces Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon and surprisingly Pinot Noir. Much of the regions grape production, however, is earmarked for brandy production. The area's soils are mostly clay and loam and retain moisture well. Climate wise, both summers and winters tend to be cool, and the high altitude produces a pronounced diurnal variation in temperatures. Spain's Freixenet is the largest producer in this region. Mexico grows a variety of grapes in the approximately 6,200 acres of vineyards earmarked for fine wine production. It lacks, however, a signature or defining grape variety or wine style. The principal grapes grown are the better-known international varieties. Whites include Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay, Palomino, Chasselas, Macabeo, Muscatel, Riesling, Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier. Reds include the principal Bordeaux varieties, Grenache, Tempranillo, Dolcetto, Nebbiolo, Barbera, Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Some of these varieties, like Chasselas, typically grown in Switzerland, and Italian varieties like Nebbiolo, Dolcetto and Barbera, seem wholly unsuited for Mexico's arid wine country. The three most widely planted varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo and Chardonnay.Vertical shoot positioning is the most common trellis system. Vineyard spacing varies from 3 x 3 feet to 6 x 9 feet, with vine density ranging from a low of around 2,500 vines per acre to a high of around 4,000 vines. Yields vary from two to three tons per acre. Many growers have started to restrict yields by green pruning to no more than two clusters per shoot and limiting each vine to between six and eight shoots. Harvest is generally from late July to early October.Cellar at the Adobe Quadalupe winery in Ensenada, Valle de GuadalupeMost wines are fermented in stainless steel with the length of maceration and fermentation varying depending on a producer's style. Red wines are typically aged in either French or American oak for periods ranging from a few months to as much as 24 months. One of the interesting features of Mexican wine production is that the arid climate tends to produce grapes with unusually thick skins. Baja Nebbiolo, for example, produce a dark, inky wine that is unlike any other Nebbiolo in the world and has more in common with Petite Sirah or warm climate Cabernet Sauvignon's than it does with its Italian Piedmont cousins. The origins of Baja's Nebbiolo remains something of a mystery. The vines arrived after World War II and are believed to be a number of different Nebbiolo clones, but the identification tags were lost in transit and no one is certain what those varieties might be.Specific wine appellations are only now beginning to be delineated. The first official Mexican wine appellation is the Parras Valley. Beyond imposing a 25 percent tax on wine sales, the Mexican government has given the wine industry a free rein.The result has been some unusual wines, including blends of vinifera and table grapes like Thompson, as well as blends consisting of Mexican and foreign grapes. The Casa di Piedra winery for example, produces a wine, Contraste, made from a blend of grape juice from the Valle de Guadalupe and juice imported from France. There are also some unusual blends like Cabernet Sauvignon blended with either Grenache or Nebbiolo. Baja wines tend to be deeply colored and full bodied-these are big, powerful, heavily extracted wines with a substantial weight and mouth feel and a propensity to taste jammy. Grapes here tend to be thicker skinned than normal, creating more intense flavors and aromas. One particular feature of Baja wines is a tendency for wines that are irrigated with ground water to occasionally have a noticeable saline element. This is sometimes described as minerality, stoniness or steeliness, as well as saltiness. Salinity is unusual but not unheard of in wines. Vineyards close to the sea often exhibit some saline notes. Soils or ground waters that have high levels of metallic salts, like Langhorne Creek in Australia, for example, can also impart a saline element to wines. Mexico's growing reputation as a wine producer has been attracting international wine companies. In addition to Freixenet and Pedro Domecq, new foreign investors include Chuck Wagner of Napa's Caymus Vineyards and Henri Lurton of Bordeaux's Chateau Brane-Cantenac. The Chalone Group and Wente Vineyards are also becoming more involved in the Mexican wine industry.Mexican wines are becoming more prevalent in the United States, especially in the larger urban wine markets. Below is a selection of Mexican wines worth trying.A. L. Cetto, Private Reserve Nebbiolo, 2009, 13.8% ABV (Average price $18)This is a deep ruby wine with hints of purple throughout. On the nose there are dried fruit aromas of dark cherry, prune and some indistinct tropical fruit elements, followed by notes of bittersweet chocolate and espresso. With a little time, some tobacco notes, followed by hints of wood smoke and old leather emerge. On the palate there are flavors of cooked/jammy red and black fruit, with a distinct dark cherry flavor and even a bit of cranberry. There are hints of smoke, but none of the tar typical of Piedmont's powerful Barolos. There is a pronounced acidity with well-integrated fine tannins and moderate alcohol. The body is medium weight with a supple, almost silky texture. The finish is mid-length with dried fruit flavors and notes of blood and red meat and a hint of a savory, saline note, at the end. This is an outstanding Nebbiolo, one unlike its Italian cousins. It tastes almost like a cross between the lighter Nebbiolo of the Valtellina and their more robust Piedmontese brethren; but one that combines very ripe fruit with moderate alcohol and fine well-integrated tannins, along with some uniquely Mexican characteristics. The L.A. Cetto winery in Ensenada in the Valle de GuadalupeA.L. Cetto, Sauvignon Blanc, 2014, 12% ABV (Average price $12)This wine received a commendation at the Decanter 2014 World Wine Awards. The color is a very pale lemon green; reminiscent of those almost clear and eminently forgettable, bulk produced Italian Pinot Grigios. On the nose, however, there is a veritable explosion of aromas. You can pick out citrus notes of lime, lemon zest and a bit of orange peel, followed by indistinct floral aromas and spicy fresh herbs like cilantro, lemon grass and ginger. As it warms up notes of stone fruit, tropical fruit and lychees emerge.On the palate there is a pronounced lime zest note followed by sweet mandarins, more stone fruit and tropical melon. The acidity is bright and crisp and is a perfect counterpoint for highlighting the fruit. It imparts a sensation of sweetness to what is otherwise a dry wine. The finish is long, featuring tropical fruit notes and a hint of ginger pepperiness. This is an interesting Sauvignon Blanc. It lacks the minerality and vegetal notes of its French counterparts but stops short of the over the top semi-dry, tropical fruit cocktail typical of many of New Zealand's Sauvignon Blanc's. Definitely worth a try, especially if you hanker for a drier version of Cloudy Bay's SBs while retaining their fruity complexity.Bodega de San Tomas, Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon, 2013, 14% ABV (Average price $18)Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo blends are unusual but not unheard of. The combination is becoming increasingly popular among Spanish winemakers and many consider it Spain's answer to France's ubiquitous Bordeaux blend. The color is a deep ruby, bordering on opaque, and is typical of Cabernet-Tempranillo blends for warm climates.On the nose, there are pronounced ripe red and black fruit aromas of dark cherry, prune and cooked strawberry. There are hints of tobacco leaf, some dried herbs, some spice notes and a bit of bittersweet chocolate.On the palate the fruit tastes more cooked and jammy, especially on the mid-palate where pronounced cooked strawberry notes emerge. There are notes of dark chocolate, some cola and just a hint of licorice. The alcohol is high, typical of warm climate Cabernet, with fine well-integrated tannins and medium acidity. This is a substantial wine, with a pronounced body and a smooth seamless texture that makes it eminently quaffable. The finish is long, with pronounced ripe red and black fruit notes highlighted by notes of spice and dry tobacco leaf.Like most Cabernet Sauvignon blends, the Cab provides structure while the blending partner adds more complex aromas and tastes. Tempranillo, unlike Merlot and Shiraz, the other usual blending partners, adds more pronounced red fruit notes, a slight sensation of sweetness and adds a voluptuousness to what is otherwise an often dark, brooding, warm climate Cab. A Mexican wine brand that is growing rapidly in the U.S. is Pavo Real. Produced by Pedro Domecq, a division of Pernod Ricard, for U.S. wine distributor Turquoise Life. Pavo Real offers an entry-level red and white wine. The red is an unusual blend of 50 percent Grenache, 20 percent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 percent Ruby Cabernet and 10 percent Barbera. The white is a blend of 45 percent Sauvignon Blanc, 45 percent Chenin Blanc and 10 percent Chardonnay. Master Sommelier Ian Cauble blended both wines. Neither wine got any oak. (Average price $10.00)The Pavo Real red shows a deep ruby color. On the nose, it offers distinctive dried red and black fruit notes of cherry, plum with a bit of strawberry and raspberry, and a hint of black current and prune. Surprisingly, the fruit is dry rather than having the jamminess one would expect from a warm climate offering. There is a noticeable herbal note in the background, more dry herbs than green.On the palate, it is extremely smooth, with fine, well-integrated tannins and medium acidity. The alcohol is 13.6 percent. Dried fruit flavors dominate on the palate.The finish is short but satisfying. This is an eminently quaffable wine. The Pavo Real white shows a yellow color with a bit of a green tinge to it. On the nose, there is a pronounced green fruit aroma of apple and pear with hints of tropical fruit and dried grapefruit peel. There is a bit of a grassy/herbal note in the background reminiscent of cooler climate Sauvignon Blanc.On the palate there is a distinct creaminess punctuated by green apple and slightly bitter citric notes as well as some melon and indistinct tropical fruits. There is a notable acidity that sets off the fruit notes quite nicely. The alcohol is 12.8 percent. The finish is short with a slight bitter note. Properly chilled, on a hot summer day this is a very drinkable wine. Fajitas anyone? Mexico's wine industry may be almost 500-years old, but it is still in its infancy. It offers an unusual combination of terrain and climate that, with the possible exception of certain parts of Argentina and South Africa, is unique and presents a fresh take on international wine varieties and their blends. Although hard to find, these are wines that are definitely worth pursuing and will in time become important and notable additions to the international wine lexicon."

It boasts the oldest winery in the New World and it is one of the largest growers of grapes in the Americas, but paradoxically makes only a tiny 20 million liters of wine a year. By comparison, the United States produces three billion liters. Mexico has over 100,000 acres of vineyards, but most of these are devoted to brandy production. Mexico, incidentally, is the third largest producer of brandy in the world.The origins of Mexico's wine industry go back to 1521 and the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. Legend has it that one of Hernán Cortéz's first orders in 1524, as governor of New Spain, was that each colonist was to plant 1,000 grapevines, for each 100 native employees, each year for five years. This was several decades before the planting of grapes in Chile (1548) and Argentina (1551).Early attempts to grow grapes in the more tropical areas of Mexico failed. Grapes were planted in the Parras Valley of Coahuila in 1593, followed by Puebla and Zacatecas. Lorenzo Garcia founded Casa Madero, the first Mexican winery, in Santa Maria de las Parras in Coahuila in 1597. It is today one of Mexico's largest wine producers and the oldest winery in the Americas. Ironically, vines from the Parras Valley were later exported to California's Napa Valley, as well as to Chile and Argentina. Generally speaking, grapes in the northern hemisphere are grown between 30 degrees and 50 degrees of latitude. Mexico is unusual in that most of the country lies south of the 30th parallel. The combination of high altitude vineyards and the cooling effects of winds and fogs from the Pacific, however, have allowed grapes to thrive. Initially, the Mexican wine industry flourished. Grapevines adapted readily to Mexico's Mediterranean climate. The Spanish emperor, Charles I, even ordered that all ships traveling to New Spain bring a quota of grapevines for cultivation. The first grape variety grown was the ubiquitous Mission grape of California known locally as Listan Prieto; the same variety is called Criolla in Argentina and Pais in Chile.The situation took a turn for the worse at the end of the 17th century, however. Rising French wine production began to cut in on European demand for Spanish wines. In an effort to protect the domestic wine industry, Charles II banned the production of wine in Spain's foreign colonies in 1699, and required them to import Spanish wine instead. The Catholic missions were exempt from the ban and allowed to make small quantities of wine for religious purposes. It was a Jesuit priest, Juan Jugarte, who established, in 1701, the first vineyards in Baja California at Loreto Mission. Jugarte, along with Father Juan Maria Salvatierra, were moving north to California, establishing missions along the way. The Santo Tomas Mission, founded by Jesuits in 1791, became Mexico's largest wine producer. The Dominicans followed in 1843, and established the first vineyards in Baja's Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe del Norte Valley. Today the Guadalupe Valley is the center of Mexico's fine wine production and the region boasts over 50 wineries.Despite being restricted to making only small quantities of wine for sacramental purposes, the Catholic missions became significant wine producers. Between 1699 and 1857, the various Catholic missions produced virtually all wine in Mexico. The industry remained small, but otherwise healthy.The Mexican government, following the War of Reform in 1857, seized all the land holdings of the Catholic Church. Some of the vineyards, like San Tomaso, were sold to Mexican investors. That winery has continued to operate to this day. Many of the mission vineyards, however, were simply abandoned.A winery in Mexico's Guadalupe ValleyThe arrival of the Molokans, pacifist Russian Christian refugees, in the late 19th century to the Guadalupe Valley, gave the Mexican wine industry a fresh start. The Molokans were farmers who were escaping persecution at the hands of the Czar's army. They purchased 100 acres of land and began growing wine grapes. They also introduced modern farming and winemaking practices to the region. The wine industry lost a huge part of its vineyards to Phylloxera at the turn of the century. The industry was further disrupted by the violence and domestic turmoil that accompanied the Mexican revolution of 1910. Many wine estates were destroyed or abandoned by their owners. The growth of the Mexican beer industry following the revolution also slowed the recovery of the wine industry as beer became more popular than wine. Mexicans also have the distinction of having the highest per capita consumption of Coca Cola. The wine industry recovered somewhat in the 1920s. In 1949 the National Association of Wine Producers was created with an initial membership of fifteen wineries. Fourteen more producers joined during the 1950s. During the 1970s production tripled through a combination of expanded vineyards and an increase in wine production capacity.High-end wine production in Mexico began in the 1970s. Casa Pedro Domecq began operations in the Guadalupe valley in 1972. Shortly after, Hugo D'Acosta organized La Escuelita to teach local growers modern methods for processing their grapes into wine. The school also functioned as a cooperative, providing the necessary equipment to growers for wine production. By the end of the decade, Mexican wine producers were selling four million cases a year. The decision of the Mexican government to open up its wine market to foreign producers, however, resulted in a significant drop in domestic production.

It offers an unusual combination of terrain and climate that, with the possible exception of certain parts of Argentina and South Africa, is unique and presents a fresh take on international wine varieties and their blends. Although hard to find, these are wines that are definitely worth pursuing and will in time become important and notable additions to the international wine lexicon."

Originally it was a political association. Following the onset of the Korean War it rapidly transformed itself into an alliance for mutual defense. Pursuant to Article 5 of the NATO charter, any member country attacked by a foreign entity could request assistance from the other members. The nature of that assistance was left to the discretion of each party. It did not necessarily need to be direct military assistance, although NATO's force structure was organized to facilitate a joint military response.NATO's strategic objective, in the words of Lord Ismay, its first Secretary General, was ""to keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down."" Those goals largely defined NATO's mission over its first 40 years. In 1955, West Germany was incorporated into the Alliance. That decision was largely prompted by the need to integrate German military forces into NATO to ensure that the Alliance's manpower would be sufficient to blunt a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. In response, the Soviet Union organized the Warsaw Pact as its own collective security organization consisting of itself and the communist countries in Eastern Europe.For the next 35-odd years, the two organizations defined the two-opposing sides of the Cold War in Europe. NATO's operational doctrines were designed to promote the standardization and interoperability of each nation's armaments as well as operating procedures. Its tactical and strategic doctrines, including a tacit agreement for the first use of theater nuclear weapons, were designed to counter the threat of a Soviet invasion by massed, highly mechanized infantry, spearheaded by rapidly moving armored divisions.Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, NATO's primary purpose has become largely obsolete. The Warsaw Pact has disintegrated. Indeed, many of its former members are now part of NATO. The prospect of a Russian invasion of Western Europe has largely vanished. Even if it wanted to, Russia simply lacks the force structure to execute such an invasion much less successfully occupy Western Europe. On the other hand, while Western Europe has little to fear from an armed Russian attack, NATO's newest members in Eastern Europe, especially those states that were once part of the Soviet Union, are particularly concerned about the Kremlin's attempts to intimidate and subvert them. US President Harry Truman signing the treaty creating NATOJudging by Russia's actions in Ukraine, and to a lesser extent Georgia, Russian security threats in the future are likely to consist of a combination of cyberwarfare, subversion and insurgency, especially among ethnic Russians living in targeted countries, and ongoing attempts at political and economic manipulation. By producing domestic chaos and instability, the Kremlin has a pretext to intervene with Russian military forces either in the guise of peace keepers to protect ethnic Russians or in an unofficial capacity as volunteers of unspecified origins. The latter also gives the Kremlin plausible deniability for its actions. This type of threat is very real and is completely different from the mission that NATO was originally designed to serve.Since 1989, NATO has been steadily expanding its membership across Eastern Europe, while at the same time accepting responsibilities well outside of its original mandate. These new responsibilities have ranged from directing the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan to ""training missions"" in Iraq, to operating no-fly zones over Libya to antipiracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden. At the same time, it has also expanded its deployment in Eastern Europe. The immediate consequences have been a significant mismatch between its military capabilities and many of its current activities with the external threats, either directly or indirectly, that its members now face.NATO's member expansion has taken two forms. In the Balkans, it has incorporated or put on a membership track many of the nations that emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia. Serbia, who has longstanding religious, ethnic and political ties to Russia, is the sole exception. Nonetheless, Serbia has been quietly inching toward NATO, expanding its cooperation while still officially maintaining its neutrality. Lately, however, the Kremlin has taken advantage of Belgrade's current dispute with the EU over the availability of Croatian language school textbooks for Serbia's Croatian minority to strengthen its relationship with that Balkan country. Serbia is a candidate for membership in the EU and relies on the economic bloc for the bulk of its foreign investment, external markets and foreign aid. Albania and Croatia joined NATO in 2009. The former Warsaw Pact members of Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia joined in 2004. Poland, who has been repeatedly invaded by Russia over its long history, Hungry, and the Czech Republic all joined in 1999. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro are all candidate members pending their satisfying the required preconditions for membership.The Kremlin poses less of a security threat to the Balkan nations then it does to its immediate neighbors in Eastern Europe. Russia has historically claimed that it had longstanding interests in the Balkans because of ethnic and religious ties. It was Russian support of Serbia in 1914, in its dispute with Austria-Hungary, after all, that triggered the chain of events that ultimately precipitated World War I. NATO's objectives in the area were, instead, motivated by two other concerns. First, a recognition that the economic wellbeing of the Balkan nations was contingent on closer integration with the EU and access to the bloc's markets and capital. Secondly, that integration of the region's military forces into NATO, along with EU membership, would make local outbreaks of violence less likely.NATO's eastern expansion was, in part, also motivated by the corresponding eastern expansion of the EU and the desire to incorporate those countries into a European-wide system of collective defense. There was also an element of atonement for the decision made at Yalta two generations ago to abandon the region to Soviet hegemony. NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe, and especially into some of the former states of the Soviet Union, was seen by the Kremlin as a provocation and ran counter to what Russia claimed was an unofficial agreement reached with the United States in 1990 to forego NATO's eastern expansion in return for Soviet acquiescence to German reunification.Of late, Russia has become increasingly provocative toward the nations that make up what the Kremlin calls the ""near abroad."" These are countries that were previously either part of the USSR or under Soviet control and which geographically Russia sees as essential to Russia's defense. Their participation in NATO is deemed by the Kremlin as threatening to Russia. These provocations have taken the form of frequent overflights of armed Russian fighter-bombers operating with their transponders turned off, numerous instances of cyber warfare, blackmail threats to interrupt Russian supplies of natural gas or electrical power, attempts to stir up organized dissent among ethnic Russian citizens in those countries, military intimidation and heavy handed attempts at political and economic manipulation. NATO's expansion since 1990 Photo courtesy of NATOIn the case of Georgia, once a candidate member to join NATO, but since shelved, this also involved an invasion by Russian special forces. In Ukraine's case, similar actions, including Russian seizure of the Crimea and portions of the Donbass Basin whose population was predominantly ethnic Russians, was organized to forestall any moves by Kiev to pursue NATO membership. Particularly worrisome is the fact that all three of the Baltic Republics, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, have been seeing an intensifying pattern of Russian provocation and attempts at political intimidation. In June 2016, NATO added cyberwarfare as an ""operational domain of war,"" no different than land, naval or aerial warfare. While cyberwarfare now qualifies as a form of attack that can trigger the Article V mutual defense provision, the nature of cyberattacks makes it difficult to always know who the antagonist is. These new types of Russian tactics, while no less threatening, are a lot more diffuse than an armed attack. More importantly, NATO doesn't have an offensive cyberwarfare capability, although there are persistent rumors that it is working on developing one. In the event of a cyberattack, even if its Russian origins were indisputable, NATO response options would be limited. There is little likelihood, that under such conditions there would be a consensus within NATO to respond militarily. The most likely response from NATO would be to do nothing while its member governments would respond with diplomatic and economic sanctions against Moscow. The Kremlin's new playbook includes provocations that do not explicitly come under the provisions of what constitutes an attack under Article V. They are a lot more subjective and open to interpretation or dispute. Ethnic unrest, for example, may result from legitimate domestic grievances as well as foreign manipulation or subversion. Many NATO members are reluctant to make what appear to be purely domestic issues a pretext for triggering the mutual defense clause.NATO needs to redefine the kinds of threats it is designed to oppose as well as how it can respond to the Kremlin's current tactics. To date there is no consensus within NATO on what this new threat definition should be or how the organization should, if at all, react. For NATO's Eastern European members in general, and for the Baltic Republics, in particular, this new redefinition of NATO's security mission can't come soon enough."

The gains, however, still remain above a level that is considered sufficient to absorb new entrants into the labor market.October and November’s data was revised to show 19,000 more jobs added than previously reported. The economy created 2.16 million jobs in 2016. Average hourly earnings increased 10 cents or 0.4 percent, benefiting from a calendar quirk, after slipping 0.1 percent in November. That pushed the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.9 percent, the largest increase since June 2009, from 2.5 percent in November.The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent from a nine-year low of 4.6 percent in November as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in the jobs market.The employment report added to data ranging from housing to manufacturing and auto sales in suggesting that President-elect Donald Trump is inheriting a strong economy from the Obama administration.Trump, who takes over from President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has pledged to increase spending on the country’s aging infrastructure, cut taxes and relax regulations. These measures are expected to boost growth this year.But the proposed expansionary fiscal policy stance could increase the budget deficit. That, together with faster economic growth and a labor market that is expected to hit full employment this year could raise concerns about the Fed falling behind the curve on interest rate increases.The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight interest rate last month by 25 basis points to a range of 0.50 percent to 0.75 percent. The Fed forecast three rate hikes this year.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls risingby 178,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticking up one tenth of a percentage point to 4.7 percent.Employment growth in 2016 averaged 180,000 jobs per month, down from an average gain of 229,000 per month in 2015. The slowdown in job growth is consistent with a labor market that is near full employment.There has been an increase in employers saying they cannot fill vacant positions because they cannot find qualified workers. The skills shortage has been prominent in the construction industry.Even as the labor market tightens, there still remains some slack, which is holding back wage growth. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose one-tenth of percentage point to 62.7 percent in December.The participation rate remains near multi-decade lows. Some of the decline reflects demographic changes.December’s job gains were broad, with manufacturing payrolls rising 17,000 after declining for four straight months. Construction payrolls fell 3,000 in December after three consecutive months of increases.Retail sector employment rose 6,300 after increasing 19,500 in November. Department store giants Macy’s (M.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) this week reported a drop in holiday sales. Macy’s said it planned to cut 10,000 jobs beginning this year.Department stores have suffered from stiff competition from online rivals including Amazon.com (AMZN.O).Government employment increased 12,000 in December.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)"

Elizabeth Warren announced she will seek a second term in 2018.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586fb7b217000025009287ff.jpeg?cache=TZ6HnLgoDV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced she will run for re-election in 2018. The outspoken populist-progressive and fierce advocate for campaign finance reform said in an email to supporters that she would seek a second term as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts.“I didn’t come to Washington to roll over and play dead while [President-elect] Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of Massachusetts and this country,” Warren wrote. “This is no time to quit.”Warren, 67, focused much of her statement on the need to grow the economy and combat “racism, sexism, bigotry and hate” during the coming Trump presidency.“We will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African-Americans, Muslims, immigrants, women, and LGBT Americans,” she wrote. “Our diversity is what makes our country strong ― and on this, there will be NO compromise.”Many of her enthusiastic supporters hope to see Warren on a 2020 presidential ticket, and this announcement doesn’t rule out that possibility. John Kerry was the Democratic nominee in the 2004 presidential election while he was a U.S. senator from Massachusetts. (Kerry lost to President George W. Bush, who was governor of Texas when he first won the White House in 2000.)The Federal Election Commission reported Warren raised over $38 million during her 2012 senate run, compared with the roughly $27 million raised by her opponent and incumbent Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.).But Warren warned against setting expectations for a quick and easy victory.“Representing Massachusetts in the US Senate and fighting for working families here and all across this country is the best job in the whole world and the greatest honor of my life,” Warren said. “But I also know this: We fought our hearts out to win in 2012, and I expect we’ll have an even bigger, more expensive fight in 2018.” Given the senator’s track record of calling out Wall Street crooks and taking on greedy CEOs, Warren seems ready as ever to roll up her sleeves and jump in the ring."

Wade. “They have to follow the law,” Schumer said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Thursday. “For instance, Roe v. Wade has been the law for a long time. If these people want to just repeal and rip out Roe v. Wade ― you have to look at the whole picture. I’m not going to have a litmus test. But that would be an indication.”Schumer also pointed to Lochner v. New York, a controversial 1905 case that barred the states from stepping in and regulating business practices, such as a ceiling on how long employees could work each day.“If they want to go back to the days of Lochner, when states couldn’t regulate businesses and protect employees, that would be something out of the mainstream,” he added. “There are lots of different criteria, but you know it when you see it.”On Tuesday, Schumer told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow that Democrats would oppose a Trump Supreme Court nominee “tooth and nail” if he puts forward an “out-of-the-mainstream nominee.”Schumer declined to say Thursday whether he would be willing to keep a Supreme Court vacancy open for four years but added, “If he puts one up out of the mainstream and gets voted down, and he puts another one up, we’ll still oppose that one.”A Supreme Court nominee still needs at least 60 votes for confirmation, which means that Trump will need some Democratic cooperation. Antonin Scalia died in February, and his seat on the court has been vacant ever since. President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, known as a moderate judge, on March 16, but Republicans refused to give him a committee hearing. They argued that the Senate should wait to see who won the 2016 election and let the next president pick ― hoping, of course, that it would be a Republican. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Democrats not to obstruct a Trump Supreme Court pick because it would be “something the American people simply will not tolerate” ― even though the American people seemed to tolerate it just fine when the GOP did it with Garland.”Just look at the last year. On that one, Mitch McConnell is rewriting history,” Schumer replied Thursday.“I think what they’ll care about is if Trump puts in one of these hard-right nominees and they start chipping away at people’s rights ― chipping away at their economic rights, chipping away at their political rights, voting rights,” he added.During the presidential debates, Trump said he would like to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade. “If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that will happen,” Trump said. “That will happen automatically in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.”During the campaign, Trump also said that if abortion were illegal, women should “face some sort of punishment” for having the procedure.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

25,POLITICS,How Paul Ryan Won Over Every House Republican (Except For One),Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-speaker-election_us_586e8161e4b099cdb0fbdf8d,Conservatives complained about the speaker for a year. Then they all voted for him.,2017-01-06,"Paul Ryan works in the speaker's ceremonial office, which is still his, on the first day of the 115th Congress.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ebf7d17000026009285ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In October 2015, with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) vowing that he would restore regular order and give members more control over the House, nine Republicans ― 10, if you count one member abstaining ― said no to Ryan becoming speaker.On Tuesday, only one Republican voted against him.When the House GOP held their internal elections behind closed doors in November, at least four conservative lawmakers left the room so they wouldn’t have to audibly register their discontent with the speaker. Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Walter Jones (R-N.C.), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) went into an antechamber of the sprawling Ways and Means Committee room and waited until the vote was over.But exactly seven weeks later, only Massie, who is not part of the Freedom Caucus, spoke out in public opposition to Ryan.“To drain the swamp, Daniel Webster,” Massie said, voting for the same Florida representative who ran for the speaker’s job in 2015. Webster didn’t win then either, but the desire to reform the closed procedures of the House that he ran on helped derail former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).A little more than a year since Webster’s bid, not much has changed in the House. Contrary to his promises, members of the House Freedom Caucus told The Huffington Post, Ryan hasn’t opened up the legislative process. He may have even clamped down on it further, with GOP leaders now restricting which amendments can get a vote on appropriations bills.That makes Ryan’s seemingly stronger position in the Republican conference just 14 months after his first speaker election all the more remarkable, especially when you consider the coup that Freedom Caucus members were plotting just before Election Day. The caucus chairman at the time, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), was supposed to run for speaker and prevent Ryan from rounding up the 218 votes necessary to keep his gavel. The thought was that the more-conservative lawmakers could at least negotiate for something if they blocked Ryan.Then Donald Trump won the presidency, and the conservatives fell in line.Members of the Freedom Caucus noted throughout 2016 that the procedural concerns they’d had with Boehner weren’t really improving. So if the conservatives was so concerned with process and regular order when they founded their group, and if those matters didn’t get better, why did every Freedom Caucus member vote for Speaker Ryan on Tuesday?The answer for most members seems to be that Trump’s victory has changed what’s important.“Right now, there’s a hope that we can all be unified and get some things accomplished in the first 100 days,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the caucus’ new chairman, told HuffPost this week.“We’ve been in a divided government. I think everybody was willing to look at the 115th Congress in a new light with the understanding that more conservative legislative solutions will be ruled in order,” Meadows said.Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said he felt it was reasonable to give Ryan some time with this new administration, and Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said the caucus wanted to give Ryan a chance “to prove that they can do the right thing.”Neither Amash nor Labrador tried to suggest that Ryan had actually restored regular order in the House, although some caucus members did note that Ryan had made more of an effort to communicate with them than Boehner did. But members of the Freedom Caucus generally pointed to the idea of supporting Ryan as a sign of unified government when asked why they backed the speaker.Of course, the other answer is that Ryan is actually stronger now. After Trump won the presidency and Republicans maintained a sizable majority in the House, it became much harder to argue that Ryan needed to go ― especially since Trump has seemingly made peace with the speaker, too. Voting against Ryan when there’s no real push to get rid of him risks isolating yourself, and self-preservation is one of the strongest motives for a politician.In the case of Walter Jones, an independent-minded Republican who has voted against his party’s choice for speaker in three elections, voting for Ryan this time around was a matter of political choice.“The price you pay if you don’t support the speaker of the House, and the speaker of the House has no real opposition, it’s not very politically wise,” Jones told HuffPost.“Get a strong vote, then that gives you some power,” he added. “But if you got one or two people voting no, it’s like a gnat,” he said.Jones knows well the price of being a gnat. He’s been skipped over for an Armed Services subcommittee chairmanship for years and was removed from the Financial Services Committee in 2012. But Jones has a mission this year: He is trying to get a debate on the House floor over withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.“So to me, I’d rather take my chances of at least asking the speaker to let me talk with him, and he looks at me and says, ‘Well, you know, Walter voted for me this time, so I might give him five minutes,’” Jones said.For other House members who walked out on the House GOP’s internal speaker vote in November, this week wasn’t the time to take a stand.“You had an election in November. You have a president that’s shown a willingness to try to get leadership here to coalesce and work together. And I think you got to give him a shot,” Gosar told HuffPost.Gosar, who is also part of the Freedom Caucus, didn’t pretend that Ryan had taken care of his procedural concerns, but he said he felt he had to give Ryan a chance.As for Gohmert, he actually had a conversation with Ryan on Tuesday, the day of the speaker vote, in which he said Ryan assured him that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was “dead” and that the House wouldn’t legalize any undocumented immigrants before Trump had a chance to build a wall.Gohmert said Ryan also threw in a commitment not to bring up any legislation that doesn’t have the support of a majority of Republicans. That’s the so-called Hastert rule, named after disgraced former Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) ― although Gohmert said Wednesday, “I’m not sure I want to call it the Hastert rule.”Either way, Ryan’s promises got Gohmert to yes, and that is perhaps a testament to Ryan’s open door policy. Ryan spent a significant part of September trying to bring in every Republican House member for a quick meeting.“On September the 29th, I had a meeting with Paul Ryan over what committees I was on and what committees I wanted to be on,” said Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas), one of the nine Republicans who voted against Ryan in 2015. “I told him at that time ... ‘I’m going to support you, Paul, for speaker.’ He said, ‘Well, I didn’t call you in here to ask you that.’ I said, ‘I know.’”“I’m going to tell you,” Weber continued, “this is the time for us to come together and do what the American people want us to do.”Weber also mentioned that in the 2015 election, he had made a commitment to Daniel Webster to vote for him and hadn’t wanted to go back on that ― which mirrored the explanation from another Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), who also voted against Ryan in October 2015.Yoho seems to have been won over by some of Ryan’s lighter touches, like the revolving dinners the speaker has hosted with congressional lawmakers and his attempts to meet regularly with Freedom Caucus leaders.Some Freedom Caucus members really do feel Ryan has taken strides to create a more open process. In October 2015, Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) laid out 10 principles for the next speaker that he said were essential to winning his vote. Even if some of those priorities remain unchecked ― like broadening opportunities for all lawmakers to offer amendments ― Brat feels good about changing his mind and voting for Ryan this time around.“The process stuff I’m less worried about now, because the process is unified, right? The president and Ryan, the Trump agenda coupled with [Ryan’s] Better Way agenda, is going through. Everyone’s in agreement on that,” Brat said.Still, if this detente feels a little forced, it probably should. Ryan has not truly resolved the most significant procedural issues that Freedom Caucus members have decried since their group was formed in early 2015. Massie, who’s keeping a low profile after being the single vote against Ryan this week, cited procedural concerns as his reason for standing against the speaker in November. And other House members who voted for Ryan acknowledge that things still need to change. “You’re always on a short leash,” Labrador said.The question is who’s holding the leash. Granted anonymity to discuss Ryan’s standing in the Republican conference, two House members independently said they would expect any anti-Ryan coup to originate with Trump. And if Trump isn’t asking for Ryan to go, it’s not his time."

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is wary of repealing the health reform law's revenue while maintaining subsidies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586fc9f6170000250092886a.jpeg?cache=9HEWIF3bLU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is worried that getting rid of the revenue increases in Obamacare while maintaining its subsidies will force the Republican Party to raise taxes later on.“Right now, the track we’re on, the repeal process is going to repeal all the revenues, but keep in place the subsidies for three years,” Corker said at breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday morning.That raises the prospect of increasing the annual budget deficit, he added, a result he would like to “overcome.” Corker estimated it would cost $116 billion to keep subsidies for three years without the law’s revenue increases.“You’re taking $116 billion, by our calculations, and just throwing it into a mud puddle by continuing subsidies without revenue,” he said. “So I hope that what is going to happen over time, over the next few weeks, is that people will deal with this on a fiscally sound basis, too.”Obamacare, otherwise known as the Affordable Care Act, provides subsidies to low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance on exchanges created by the law. It pays for those subsidies though a number of different taxes, including a tax on the investment income of wealthy individuals. Though Congressional Republicans have already begun drafting legislation to repeal the health care law, including its revenue increases, Corker is among a growing group of senators expressing doubts about the pace and nature of the legislative push. He’s also the first to frame it as a recipe for a tax increase down the line.Corker suggested that if subsidies were extended beyond the three-year period for which he expects Republicans to keep them in place, perhaps as part of replacement legislation, it would put Republicans in a “box canyon” where they “would have to vote for a tax increase” to pay for the subsidies. Several Republican politicians have said they are wary of repealing Obamacare without an adequate replacement. Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) expressed strong reservations about the so-called repeal and delay strategy favored by other GOP lawmakers.President-elect Donald Trump has also warned that repealing the law too quickly could prove politically dangerous.Corker said he supported Trump’s comments, but did not indicate he would vote against repeal unless there was a plan ready to replace it.“The President-elect’s position is the right position,” he said. “If you look at some of his quotes recently, he continues to offer caution. In fact, during the campaign, he said that the repeal and replacement should take place simultaneously.”“That, to me, is the prudent course of action,” he concluded.Jessica Schulberg contributed reporting."

A rift that threatens to shear the sheet away grew more than 10 miles in just a couple weeks in December, the BBC reported, and scientists have said it’s likely the crack will soon end a decades-long standoff.“If it doesn’t go in the next few months, I’ll be amazed,” Adrian Luckman, the lead researcher behind Project MIDAS, which monitors the ice shelf, told BBC News. “It’s so close to calving that I think it’s inevitable.”If and when the section of Larsen C breaks away, it’ll remove between 9 and 12 percent of the ice shelf area and leave the sheet at “its most retreated position ever,” Luckman and his team said last year. The ice shelf, which floats completely over the ocean off Antarctica, is about 350 meters thick and the rift cuts completely through the entire sheet, according to NASA.When the sheet breaks off, it’ll create one of the 10 largest icebergs ever recorded, Luckman told the BBC. The event could trigger the eventual collapse of the entire Larsen C, which spans some 21,000 square miles, Luckman continued, although he noted such models are hard to predict.“We would expect in the ensuing months to years further calving events, and maybe an eventual collapse ― but it’s a very hard thing to predict, and our models say it will be less stable; not that it will immediately collapse or anything like that,” he said.NASA reports that even if the shelf were to break away and melt, it wouldn’t contribute directly to sea level rise because the shelf is already floating. But the Larsen C helps hold back other glaciers on land that, if exposed to the ocean, could in turn melt and increase sea levels.Two other ice shelfs in the region, the Larsen A and Larsen B, have already collapsed in spectacular fashion, in 1995 and 2002 respectively. When Larsen B broke up, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said the world had lost an ice sheet that had “likely existed since the end of the last major glaciation 12,000 years ago,” The Washington Post reports.A video that NASA released shows the dramatic disintegration of Larsen B below."

Trump has rejected the broad intelligence community’s assessment that Russia staged cyber attacks during the election campaign to undermine Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Russia has rejected the hacking allegations.“By October, it had become clear that the Russians were trying to help the Trump campaign,” said one official familiar with the full report speaking on the condition of anonymity because the complete version is Top Secret.In some cases, one official said, the material followed what was called “a circuitous route” from the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, to WikiLeaks in an apparent attempt to make the origins of the material harder to trace, a common practice used by all intelligence agencies, including U.S. ones.These handoffs, the officials said, enabled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to say the Russian government or state agencies were not the source of the material published on his website.In an interview with Fox News this week, Assange said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and Clinton aide John Podesta from “a state party.” Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party.Details of the report emerged as the top U.S. intelligence official, James Clapper, said on Thursday he was “even more resolute” in his belief that Russia staged cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 election campaign.Not all 17 intelligence agencies participated in preparing the assessment. An unclassified version of the report is expected to be released on Friday morning, two officials said.The report contains some of what the officials called “minor footnotes” about open questions and other uncertainties, in part because some of the evidence supporting the conclusion is inferential.One such example, the officials said, was that intercepted messages and conversations among senior Russian officials in Putin’s inner circle indicated they were aware of the hacking campaign and celebrated Trump’s election as a victorious end to the campaign.The officials declined to discuss the nature of the communications, including whether they were domestic, international, or both.“People who knew what this was about were celebrating a victory over the United States,” said one official.Another example of inferential evidence, the officials said, was that as time passed and the early leaks attracted media attention that undermined or eclipsed Clinton’s campaign, the Russians increasingly focused their hacking “almost exclusively” on Democratic rather than Republican targets.There was also strong resemblance ― including the use of the same computer malware ― the Russians have used against targets in Europe and the marriage of traditional espionage tactics used by Soviet and Russian intelligence such as bribery, blackmail and internet vulnerabilities, which they said Putin has devoted increasing resources and attention to exploiting.For example, one official said, the Democratic databases and email servers the Russians hacked also contained personal information that WikiLeaks has not published.Such information could be used to search for financial, medical, browsing history and other records that can be used to target individuals for recruiting efforts by Russian spies.(Reporting by Washington newsroom; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"

But for many, the emotional and physical suffering they experience after their release is even worse.When Luna Watfa refused to reveal any information to her interrogators, they took her son, 17, and threatened to torture him. “They put my son’s hands behind his back, his T-shirt over his head and they took him,” she says.Watfa, now 35, was a law student when the popular uprising broke out in Syria in March 2011. But when she witnessed president Bashar al-Assad’s forces shooting at and beating protesters, she decided to devote herself to documenting what she saw. In January 2014, she was arrested on a Damascus street by a gang of men whom she quickly recognized as government officers. “There were three cars with 12 guards. They came only for me,” she says over Skype from her new home in Koblenz, Germany. The men escorted her to her home, demanded access to her laptop and detained her son, threatening him too. “I tried to say that [they] had no right to take him,” Watfa says. “The officer looked at me and laughed. ‘I am the law, I can do anything I want,’ he replied.”Mona Mohammed Aboud, 29, was a teacher at the start of the revolution and a vocal opponent of the regime. She has twice been a prisoner of Syria’s intelligence and security services network. During one 63-day period of detention, in 2014, she says she was subjected to torture including electrocution, beating and starvation – and she still suffers physical pain as a consequence.“There was no such thing as living. Just hell and hunger,” she says. “The security forces are not trying to kill you; they want to keep you alive – but only just.”Watfa and Aboud are among the thousands of women in Syria who have been detained by the regime since the beginning of the uprisings. There are no official figures on how many women have been held in government prisons, or by any other group in the country. But a report released in November by the Syrian Network for Human Rights said that more than 8,400 females, including 300 girls, are currently in government jails. Around 5,000 more are reportedly being held captive by militant groups such as the so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. Many of these women face brutality and sexual violence while in detention. But the struggles they face upon their release – ostracism, shame, broken relationships and health issues – can often be even harder to cope with.When she was in al-Khatib prison in Damascus, Watfa was once beaten so badly she could not walk for three days. She wasn’t raped, but she and others were the targets of sexual harassment, she says.“The guard started to put his hand on my breast and opened my shirt. I screamed at him and said I would tell the officer, so he left,” Watfa says. “When I did tell the officer, he did nothing, as usual.” She was later transferred to Adra Central Prison in northeast Damascus, where she stayed until her release in 2015.Aboud was imprisoned after being tricked into meeting regime security forces who befriended her on Facebook. She, too, was eventually transferred to Adra Central Prison. There, she says, the male guards would approach the prisoners for sex. “The warden would tell the detainee that he could secure her better food and send messages to her family provided that she slept with him,” says Aboud.But upon their release, both Watfa and Aboud discovered that some things are worse than the grinding horrors of detention.In part because of the presumption that female prisoners have been raped, many are ostracized by friends and family once they get out. “My family was torn over whether I had been raped or not,” says Aboud. “The first question asked by the lawyer who was assigned to my case when it appeared in front of the anti-terror court was whether or not I had been raped. My answer was a conclusive no,” she says.Aboud’s parents said they believed her, but limited her movements once she was back home. “Other relatives broke away from me and would not visit us in Damascus for a long period of time afterward,” she says.Fearing another arrest, she found support from a network of Syrian media activists (that she asks not to be named), who helped her escape across the border to Turkey. She lives there now, in the city of Gaziantep.Sakher Edris, from the Working Group for Syrian Detainees, says his team often sees female former prisoners suffer social rejection and the breakdown of relationships after they get out. “Many of the detained women are either divorced after their release, married forcibly to a person they do not like or, as a reaction to society, take off their hijab and travel to Europe, staying away from their parents and communities.”Often unable to discuss the perceived shame of imprisonment with friends or relatives, many female ex-detainees lack access to healthcare and support networks. “You feel that [the regime] did not take anything from you, but they took your soul,” says Watfa. “What hurt me the most was the fact that when I was released and saw my kids again, I did not feel anything. In prison, they [the guards] tortured me – OK – but this was not the worst thing. The worst thing was that they took my feelings.”For the first three months of her detention, Watfa did not know whether her son had really been arrested, as she had been led to believe. When she finally got the chance to ask her son what had happened to him that day, she says, “He told me that they put him in the bathroom [in our flat]. They said, if you breathe and your mother hears you, we will punish you hard. So keep silent and don’t breathe or move. For one month after, he couldn’t speak about what happened. It was very bad for him.”Civil society groups are helping women ex-prisoners from Syria access psychological help in places such as France, Turkey and Germany. But the need far outweighs the supply, and some experts say the possible consequences for the future of Syrian society are grave. Sema Nassar, author of a report on the subject for the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network, concluded that the detention of women in Syria is contributing to the “disintegration of society” in the country and forced migration. “It contributes to increasing the refugee flows to neighboring countries as well as to Europe, since many women, rejected by their family and community, see themselves forced to leave the country upon their release,” she says in the report.Among female former detainees there is determination to find a glimmer of light in the dark chapters of their past. Watfa and Aboud are both working to lessen the stigma for women who have been imprisoned, encouraging them to report their experiences. “For me, still the greatest aim – greater and more important than fear – is not betraying my friends in Adra prison,” says Aboud.In November, Watfa received the news that her children would be allowed to join her in Germany, under family reunification laws. “They are here,” she says in a recent WhatsApp message. “Everything is great. I can rest much better now.”With additional reporting by Mohammed Hassan al-Homsi.This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

After living in a refugee camp for two months, Nguyen arrived in Canada in 1975, where she and her family were able to build a new life.More than forty years later, Nguyen is paying it forward by taking care of others fleeing war in search of a stable home and a peaceful life. For the past year, she and her partner Michael Adams have been mentoring and supporting the Noumans, a family of nine from the embattled city of Homs, Syria.According to the UNHCR, Mohamed Nouman, his wife, and seven children arrived in Toronto in January 2016. Since then, Nguyen, Adams, and a small group of friends have stepped in to help the Syrian family adjust to Canadian life ― from finding the kids a good school in the area, to taking them to doctors’ appointments, and helping them learn a new language. Nguyen told The Huffington Post that her biggest dream for the new family is for them to be happy in their new country. “My father always said that it’s not often that you can have a big impact on somebody’s life. So when you have a chance to do it, you should try,” she told HuffPost.The Noumans came to Toronto as part of a Canada’s private sponsorship program ― the only one of its kind in the world, according to the UNHCR. The program was developed under the administrations of former Canadian prime ministers Joe Clark and Pierre Trudeau in the late 1970s, initially to help resettle refugees those uprooted by the Vietnam War.Under the program, citizen sponsors commit to providing basic financial support for the refugees’ first year in the country, or until the refugees become self-sufficient. The sponsors also help refugees with tasks like finding a job, learning English or French, and opening a bank account.Michael Casasola, a UNHCR Resettlement Officer in Canada, told The Huffington Post that more than 275,000 refugees have come to Canada through this program.Throughout the application process, Nguyen and Adams received help from Lifeline Syria, a Canadian nonprofit that helps sponsors resettle Syrian refugees in the Toronto area. Frank Palmay, chair of the organization, told The Huffington Post that the minimum requirement for sponsorship of a single refugee is $12,600. For a family of nine like the Noumans, it’s $40,000 ― an amount Nguyen and her partner raised with the help of about 130 friends and family.Palmay said that there was a surge in interest in sponsorships in the fall of 2015. He linked that uptick to the haunting photo of Alan Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian refugee whose body was found washed up on a beach in Turkey.But as the conflict in Syria continues on, with no foreseeable end in sight, Palmay said that the challenge now is to keep Canadians interested and motivated to help. “We’re trying to re-motivate people again, because the human tragedy of Syria is beyond imagination,” he told The Huffington Post.The Noumans’ lives have changed drastically since they left Syria. According to the UNHCR, the family was trapped inside their house in Homs for days, afraid to leave because of bombs. Mohamed Nouman, the family patriarch, told the UNHCR that he decided to flee for safety because “I didn’t want my kids to see death.”The Noumans fled to Lebanon and then Jordan. They lived in Amman for two years, the entire family sleeping in one room of an apartment. Now that they are in Canada, Narjes Nouman, the eldest of the family’s seven children, said she finally feels safe.“It is really wonderful to be with your family surrounded by safety,” Narjes said in a UNHCR video. “There is no one to attack you like in Syria. When we came to Canada we felt better.” For Nguyen, sponsoring the Noumans was a way to help people who are searching for the same opportunities her family longed for so many years ago. After settling in Canada, she and her 15 siblings went on to attend college, finding careers in medicine, architecture, and finance.Nguyen’s goal now is to give the Noumans a “safety net” as they adjust to life in Canada. “I’m sure there’s still anxiety, but it takes some of the anxiety out of the process, just knowing there’s another family there,” she said. “And if you need something, you can call and ask them.”She looks forward to seeing the children go to school. She wants to attend their graduation parties and their weddings. And she’s looking forward to witnessing their lives change for the better ― just like hers did.“There’s something about the process of coming to another country and having to rely on yourself, something about that process that really makes you more resilient.” "

Fisher, who first played the iconic princess in 1977, brought Leia back to the big screen as a general in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in 2015. The actress has apparently already filmed her scenes for the second installment in the latest trilogy, but was rumored to have an even larger role in the following film.Now, a “Star Wars” “braintrust,” including “Episode VIII” director Rian Johnson, “Episode IX” director Colin Trevorrow and Lucasfilm’s Kathleen Kennedy, has convened to decide how Leia will live on after Fisher’s death. Trevorrow is set to arrive in Los Angeles for a meeting about the issue next week. The team is reportedly concerned with two key scenes featuring Fisher that would bring her character and the film’s plot full circle: a much belated reunion between Leia and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and a faceoff with her son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who killed his father and her lover, Han Solo, in “The Force Awakens.”Shooting for “Star Wars: Episode IX” isn’t scheduled to begin until early 2018, so until then, those at the helm are pursuing a variety of options on how to proceed. Resurrecting Fisher with CGI effects is apparently one alternative in play, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Technological advances have allowed for actors like the late Peter Cushing to return to the screen in the latest “Star Wars” offering, “Rogue One,” so Fisher could continue to have a similar presence, however limited, in future films.The braintrust is also reportedly discussing writing the character out all together and reshooting certain scenes to lay the groundwork for her eventual exit from the franchise. Whatever they decide, those responsible are not only grappling with the character’s fate, but also with the very real grief of losing a longtime friend of the “Star Wars” universe. “People are still deeply mourning Carrie’s death over there,” a “Star Wars” source told The Hollywood Reporter. The only silver lining here is that the the team appears to have enough time to appropriately honor Fisher’s legacy and craft a satisfying conclusion to her character before Leia says her final goodbye. “Star Wars: Episode VIII” hits theaters Dec. 15, 2017."
36,POLITICS,How Barack Obama Changed The Rules Of The Workplace,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-workplace-rules_us_586bfbfbe4b0d9a5945cc204,And how Donald Trump can change them back.,2017-01-06,President Barack Obama is criticized for missing a chance to boost worker bargaining power with the Employee Free Choice Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586bfd0b1500002f00e9e333.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece is part of a series on Obama’s legacy that The Huffington Post will be publishing over the next week.WASHINGTON ― In early 2014, as his domestic agenda languished with a Republican Congress, President Barack Obama undertook what White House staffers called the “pen-and-phone” strategy. Unable to overcome GOP opposition on Capitol Hill, the president vowed to implement whatever reforms he could through executive action. “We’re not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we’re providing Americans the kind of help they need,” he told his Cabinet members. “I’ve got a pen, and I’ve got a phone.”In the months that followed, he unleashed a slew of new rules and executive actions meant to improve job conditions and boost paychecks. He signed an order raising the minimum wage for workers under federal contracts to $10.10 per hour. He signed another guaranteeing them paid sick days. He went after financial advisers who reap large fees from retirement plans. And most significantly, he reformed the country’s overtime rules to make them more generous to workers, potentially making millions of salaried employees eligible for time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours in a week.Now, in the last days of his presidency, those reforms exemplify Obama’s successes and shortcomings as he wrestled with Republicans over his economic agenda for six years. The White House genuinely believed those kinds of changes would improve the lives of poor and middle-class workers. They pursued them in the face of heavy lobbying from powerful business groups. And in carrying them out, they expected to burnish Obama’s legacy as a president who helped shape a fairer economy for the folks at the bottom, with or without cooperation from Congress.Those particular reforms might not survive even the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency. Just as Obama promised to use his pen and phone, so has the incoming president. Trump can wield his own to vacate much of what his predecessor did, underscoring the fragility of many of the outgoing president’s accomplishments. Try as he did to change the rules of the workplace, the economic system Obama inherited will end up largely intact as he exits.“I think Obama will go down in history as a great president. He did a lot of great things,” said Dan Schlademan, a longtime labor organizer who helped found the worker group OUR Walmart. “But transformational presidents shift power. He didn’t shift power. The people who had power in 2008 still have it. And those who didn’t still don’t.”Before Obama could even think about shifting structural power, he had to stop the country from hemorrhaging jobs. The Great Recession and its aftermath consumed his first term, and his priority was to keep as many people employed as possible. History will judge him well on this front, said Lawrence Mishel, an economist and president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group. With help from Congress, Obama extended unemployment benefits for laid-off workers. He pumped vast stimulus into the economy, both through infrastructure spending and aid to states. And he extended a crucial rescue of the auto industry that began under President George W. Bush.“That was over the resistance of his economic team,” Mishel said of the auto bailout. “It was brave, and it was politically unpopular, except in the Upper Midwest. That had a huge effect.”By mitigating unemployment early in his tenure, Obama’s actions helped maintain workers’ bargaining power in the short term. But he missed what was widely seen on the left as a chance to boost bargaining power in the long term, and perhaps permanently, through the Employee Free Choice Act. A holy grail for organized labor, the bill would have changed labor law to make it easier for workers to join unions, creating a potentially transformative power shift. It could have helped stem the decline of organized labor, which now represents less than 7 percent of private-sector workers.Democrats had their chance when they held both chambers of Congress and Obama occupied the White House. The president poured his efforts into what would turn out to be his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “He did ask that we put our efforts behind the health care fight and get it done,” recalled Bill Samuel, director of government affairs for the AFL-CIO labor federation. “With the momentum, he felt he would be with us in getting EFCA through Congress…. That would be a big change, maybe transformational.” Of course, Democrats ended up losing the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, making EFCA a non-starter for the rest of his presidency.Facing a GOP-controlled Congress for most of his tenure made progressive economic legislation all but impossible for Obama. Nothing demonstrates the pushback he faced quite like the fight over the minimum wage. The federal wage floor is $7.25 per hour, and it hasn’t been raised since 2009, after the last of a series of increases George W. Bush signed into law. Obama will leave office later this month with an awkward distinction: Barring a legislative miracle, he will be the first president of either party since Ronald Reagan to not sign a minimum wage package. That’s not for a lack of trying. Ever since his 2013 State of the Union speech, Obama has pressured Republicans for a minimum wage increase. And while Washington has stalled, cities and states around the country have continued to raise their minimum wages with broad approval from the electorate. Jim Manley, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on increases as a congressional staffer during the Bush and Clinton years, said the issue symbolizes the climate Obama faced on Capitol Hill. Opposing minimum wage hikes has become “a part of the Republican ideology,” Manley said. “In years past, there were moderate Republicans that would support a moderate increase. That’s just not the case these days. And we fall further and further behind.”The gridlock in Congress left Obama with reforms that were inherently limited but significant nonetheless. He and his Labor secretary, Tom Perez, used the federal government’s contracting power to raise standards in the workplace, taking up the mantle of Franklin D. Roosevelt and other liberal presidents. In addition to ensuring contract workers higher wages and paid leave, the Obama administration also proposed barring employers with a history of wage theft and documented workplace hazards from getting federal money. They also put new wage and safety regulations on the books to protect coal miners, construction workers and home care workers, reforms that had been decades in the making. And the appointments Obama made to the National Labor Relations Board have made it easier for many workers to organize.All those reforms are evidence Obama did what he could under the circumstances, argued Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. “He can always do more, but if you look at his record, he was really supportive of working families,” said Saunders. “Through executive action, he walked the walk.”But while Obama is considered one of the great orators of his office, he failed to convey the totality of his plan for improving jobs. Mishel said that the president had a bold and comprehensive agenda on wages ― but that wasn’t clear even to many of the workers who would benefit from it. “The administration was taking a lot of aggressive action,” Mishel said. “One disappointment to me [is] they didn’t really communicate that to the American people.”Obama was often selective in his use of the bully pulpit. While he would frequently proselytize for a higher minimum wage, the president didn’t talk often about the virtues of collective bargaining, at least not until late in his tenure. That sometimes frustrated labor leaders who knew the president supported their cause but usually reserved his union talk for union crowds, even at a time when organized labor was fighting battles around the country.“He was formidable, and history will view him very positively given the hand he was dealt. I think that today’s numbers make that clear,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union. “But he never conveyed to people effectively enough that he understood everybody’s pain…. People don’t feel better. They don’t see it and they don’t hear it.” Trump’s election has surely endangered much of Obama’s work, but some of his reforms in the U.S. workplace will live on regardless. For instance, even if Obama’s overtime rule is blocked in court or killed by the Trump administration, it will still have boosted wages for a number of salaried workers. A lot of companies have already given their workers raises in order to exempt them from overtime eligibility, which is exactly what the Obama administration hoped would happen. That includes Walmart, which raised its base salary several thousand dollars in anticipation of the legal changes. Perhaps, in the end, thousands of people benefit from the reform rather than the millions the White House had envisioned. Whoever they are, they’ll have Obama to thank for it."

38,BUSINESS,Chipotle Customers Haven’t Forgotten The Chain’s Food Safety Crisis,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chipotle-food-safety-sales-poll_us_586422b4e4b0eb58648801fd,A new poll shows why the fast-casual chain still might not be out of the woods.,2017-01-06,Chipotle struggled following multiple outbreaks of foodborne illnesses last year. The chain still hasn't fully recovered.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586423801900002a000e1e4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than a year has passed since Chipotle Mexican Grill was hit with a series of food safety scares, but the fast-casual chain has yet to bounce back from its problems.In 2015, Chipotle faced a series of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, including an E. coli outbreak that spread across nine states, a salmonella outbreak in Minnesota and two separate instances of norovirus. The crisis scared customers away and prompted big changes in the company’s approach to food safety in its restaurants.But many customers haven’t returned. In response to still-disappointing sales in the company’s most recent quarter, Chipotle executives claimed in a conference call with investors last month that its struggles have more to do with customer-service issues — long lines, messy dining rooms, ingredient shortages — than with lingering concerns over the safety of its food, according to a Washington Post report.A new HuffPost/YouGov poll complicates that narrative.The poll, conducted from Dec. 21-22, found that just 36 percent of respondents said they were confident that the food served at Chipotle is safe to eat, while 24 percent of respondents said they were not confident in the food’s safety. Another 40 percent said they were unsure.The lack of confidence in the safety of Chipotle’s food outpaced the 14 percent of respondents who said they were not confident that the food served in most restaurants is safe to eat.When respondents were specifically asked if they believed Chipotle was either safer or less safe to eat at than most other restaurants, 21 percent of respondents said they believed eating at Chipotle was less safe.That number remained consistent even when the sample was narrowed to include just respondents who say they are customers of the chain, 20 percent of whom also agreed that the food at Chipotle is less safe than food at other restaurants.These findings suggest that a significant number of Chipotle customers still have concerns connected to the company’s food safety scares.In a statement provided to HuffPost, Chipotle chief marketing and development officer Mark Crumpacker disputed that assessment, stating that the company’s extensive internal research has shown that brand trust and admiration have essentially recovered to pre-crisis levels.The lagging sales, Crumpacker reiterated, are due to customers’ less frequent visits — not an outright avoidance. The company believes subpar customer experiences at some of the chain’s locations is to blame.“The bottom line here is that there are many intertwined and complex reasons why we have not fully recovered our sales,” Crumpacker added, “but the main reason is that our customers are not yet as frequent as they once were, not because they are concerned about food safety.”For his part, food safety expert and frequent Chipotle critic Doug Powell said he believes the company is “grappling” as it places blame for its slow recovery away from its food safety struggles.“I’m not sure they’re focusing on the basics,” Powell, a former Kansas State University food safety professor and the publisher and editor of Barfblog, told HuffPost. “Whether it’s food safety or employee retention or whatever it is.”Though the cause of Chipotle’s slow rebound might be debatable, the chain’s feeble sales numbers are not.The restaurant’s sales have continued their sag over the past four quarters and shares of the stock tumbled 6 percent last month when Chipotle CEO and founder Steve Ells, who was named sole CEO of the restaurant in December, admitted he was “nervous” about whether the chain will achieve a previously forecast uptick in sales in 2017.Shares of the stock have since rebounded, but the chain’s outlook still remains uncertain. The company is set to announce its fourth quarter and full year 2016 sales numbers on Feb. 2.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Dec. 21-22 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Nobody has any idea who’s calling when I’m calling.” The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the president-elect screens incoming calls.Corker, who was floated as a potential Trump running mate and later as a secretary of state pick for the administration, shared the anecdote as proof of the accessibility of the president-elect and his team. “It’s an amazingly accessible group of people, it’s really beyond believable access,” Corker said.It’s “highly refreshing that you’re able to deal with people, get an answer, move on,” Corker continued. “I don’t think there’s likely been a White House like this maybe ever, but certainly in modern history.”That statement was greeted with a round of giggles from reporters in the room, who have a difficult time getting responses to inquiries from the Trump transition team. Trump has not held a press conference in over five months. At his last press conference in July, Trump asked Russia to “find the 30,000 emails that are missing” from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal server ― a statement that was widely interpreted as an invitation to the Kremlin to hack his opponent’s emails. Trump’s team later clarified that he was only asking Russia to turn over the emails to the FBI if they already had them in their possession. "

Capitol police held them up as they came in, and they had to have a Hill staffer come down and escort them to Ryan’s office, which is not normal. Once they got there, the office was locked and half a dozen officers stood guard in the hallway.It’s unclear if anyone was inside ― it wasn’t Ryan’s speaker office ― but the excessive security and the sign on the door that read, “Please knock, only scheduled appointments will be admitted,” at least gave the appearance that staffers were around. It was also early Friday afternoon.Advocates tweeted pictures as they stood in the hallway with their petitions.Eventually, the Planned Parenthood supporters headed to the nearby office of Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.), who supports their cause and let them in to hear their concerns. They left their boxes of petitions with her office to be delivered to Ryan later.“Paul Ryan may have locked his doors, but he can’t drown out our voices,” said Eric Carhart of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “Millions of women, men and young people, nearly half of whom are people of color, rely on Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care, including nearly 60,000 in Wisconsin. If Paul Ryan is going to take away our health care ― and the care of millions of people ― the least he can do is meet us face to face.”A spokeswoman for Ryan did not respond to a request for comment.Capitol police did not answer The Huffington Post’s question about why they stationed officers outside Ryan’s office.Republicans have routinely voted to defund Planned Parenthood over the years, but under President Barack Obama, their bills never had a chance of becoming law. That could change under President-elect Donald Trump.Some GOP lawmakers say Planned Parenthood shouldn’t get any federal money because it provides abortions. But that’s a misleading claim: The federal Hyde Amendment already bans federal spending on abortion, except in very rare cases. And abortion services comprise a tiny fraction of Planned Parenthood’s work anyway. The vast majority of its services include testing for and treating sexually transmitted diseases, providing birth control, offering cancer screenings and other health care.Planned Parenthood gets about one-third of its funding from the government, most of which comes through Medicaid reimbursements. So when Republicans talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, what they really mean is that many low-income women who rely on federal money to receive health care services at these clinics won’t be covered anymore. The organization won’t go away; it just won’t be able to serve as many people, particularly women who are economically disadvantaged."

Out of every 10 sexual assaults, seven are perpetrated by a person the victim knows, most commonly an acquaintance. But according to NYPD Captain Peter Rose, sexual assaults by acquaintances are not quite as “troubling” because victims aren’t “being dragged off the streets” by a dangerous stranger. His comments, first reported by DNAinfo, came in response to questions about a 62 percent increase in sexual assaults in the 94th Precinct in Brooklyn. In 2016, 13 rapes and attempted rapes were reported to NYPD in that precinct, up from 8 in 2015. Of those, 10 have yet to result in an arrest.“Some of them were Tinder, some of them were hookup sites, some of them were actually coworkers,” he said. “It’s not a trend that we’re too worried about because out of 13, only two were true stranger rapes.”Later, according to DNAinfo, he elaborated on his comments at a Community Council meeting on Wednesday.“They’re not total abomination rapes where strangers are being dragged off the streets,” he said. “If there’s a true stranger rape, a random guy picks up a stranger off the street, those are the troubling ones,” he continued. “That person has, like, no moral standards.”Stephen Davis, a spokesman for the NYPD, said Rose’s comments “did not properly explain the complexity of issues involved with investigating rape complaints,” and encouraged victims of rape to report incidents to police.“Every report of rape is thoroughly investigated by specially trained detectives in the NYPD’s Special Victims Unit,” he said. “All complaints of rape and other types of sexual crimes are taken seriously whether they are committed by domestic partners, acquaintances, or strangers.”Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of UltraViolet, a national women’s advocacy organization, called on the NYPD to immediately fire Rose for his comments.“Rape is a crime — whether you know the rapist or not, whether you are on Tinder or not — and it is the responsibility of law enforcement to investigate, prosecute and hold rapists accountable for their crimes — period, full stop,” she said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post.“An increase in rape should alarm the NYPD and cause them to redouble their efforts to arrest rapists,” she continued. “Instead, Captain Peter Rose and the NYPD are engaging in victim-blaming of the worst kind while judging which rapes they deem to be legitimate and which they do not.”The National Organization for Women announced plans to protest at the 94th Precinct on Tuesday Jan. 10 at 1 pm.“This is outrageous and unacceptable,” said Sonia Ossorio, president of NOW-NY. “We want to hear directly from the Police Commissioner about how he will ensure every commanding officer in every precinct takes every rape seriously.” Letitia James, public advocate for the city of New York, released a statement denouncing Rose’s comments.“Too often, victims of rape and sexual crimes do not come forward because of fear that their claims won’t be taken seriously, and these comments perpetuate those concerns,” she said. “I urge the NYPD to ensure that all officers are properly trained on how to handle sex crimes and how to engage with victims.”The New York City’s Mayor’s office also distanced itself from Rose’s comments, noting that “rape is rape,” no matter who commits it. UPDATE: Jan 9. ― Three days after Rose ignited a media firestorm with his comments, he issued a public apology on Twitter, stating that he “deeply” regrets the statements he made about rape. ______Related stories:Need help?

42,COLLEGE,Silencing Milo,"Bob Ostertag, ContributorComposer, Historian, Journalist, and Professor at UC Davis",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/silencing-milo_us_586f3975e4b0eb9e49bfba52,"Every time the left tries to silence Milo instead of debate him, Milo wins.",2017-01-06,"Milo Yiannopoulos speaks at the Young British Heritage Society launch event on August 17, 2016 in London, England.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586fa93e1b00002b006e5e15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Help! Donald Trump has been elected president! Jeff Sessions is going to be Attorney General! Steve Bannon is getting an office in the White House! Quick, let’s start banning books!Banning books is the iconic act of totalitarianism, from historical images of Nazi thugs burning books from Berlin’s Institute for Sexual Science to the fictional book burnings in Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451. So who in the world would think that a good response to the Trump moment in US politics would be to ban a book? As it turns out, a lot of people.The book in question is Milo Yiannopoulos’ Dangerous, set to be published in March by the Threshold Editions imprint of Simon & Schuster. The Chicago Review of Books announced they will not review any Simon and Schuster book for a year. Emily Hughes, Penguin Random House’s manager of content development and social media, tweeted “Don’t review. Don’t publicize.” Writing in Elle Magazine, Sady Doyle declared that “there is good reason to believe that publishing it will endanger human lives.” Teen Vogue went further, declaring that Milo had already put a student’s life in danger by mocking her in one of his many campus speeches. Not to be outdone, CNN compared the furor over Milo’s book to the tempest surrounding the reissue of Hitler’s Mein Kampf in Germany last year.This is all over a book, mind you, that has not even been written yet. We are talking about banning books that do not exist.One of the curious things about banning books is that the only way for you to have an opinion on whether the banning was a good idea or not is to read the book. Which you cannot do if it is banned. So you must delegate the reading of the banned book to someone else whose intellect and psyche is presumably less impressionable than yours, and then you must accept their opinion without question. This willing delegation of the power to police thought is the reason book banning and totalitarianism have appeared historically as two peas in a pod. Banning books that have not yet been written carries this logic a step further.Note that the same Simon and Schuster imprint published Dick Cheney, the man who did more than anyone to push the U.S. into invading Iraq on a phony premise, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. The publication of Cheney’s book encountered no protest. So who is this far more dangerous person Milo Yiannopoulos, whose mere words put people’s lives in danger?“Milo,” as he has come to be known in the media, is a provocateur, a smart guy, an in-your-face gay boy, a privileged prick, and a flaming jerk. He has become the face of the alt-right on campuses across the U.S. He is a senior editor at Breitbart News, which means his boss is going to be sitting at Trump’s right hand day-in, day-out.Milo is a voice we had not heard before in American politics: an outrageously gay man pushing a hard-right populist agenda. He calls Trump “daddy.” He says he cannot possibly be a white supremacist because of “the amount of black dick that has been in my mouth,” which would make him “the most self-loathing white supremacist in the world.”Gee, Milo, who says you can’t be the most self-loathing white supremacist in the world?Not surprisingly, Milo is not universally embraced on the alt-right. The explicitly fascist Daily Stormer dismisses him as a “Degenerate Homosexual and an Ethnic Mongrel.”There is reason to think Milo does not actually believe a lot of what he says, since he was saying the exact opposite just a few years ago. But he is clearly addicted to the fame and power being professionally offensive has brought him and he is moving ahead at max speed looking for more.Milo rose to prominence as one of the loudest voices in “gamergate,” an epically ugly virtual knife fight among hardcore computer gamers that became one of the first examples of how internet trolling can escalate to the point that people quit their jobs, move out of their homes, and are essentially forced into hiding to escape a deluge of digital hate. Milo arrived in the “gamergate” fray after it was already well underway.His second boost of internet fame came when he penned a scathing review of the Ghostbusters remake. The army of male internet trolls who had assembled through gamergate then turned their high-pressure hose of ugliness on Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. Things got so ugly that Twitter ended up banning Milo from using the social media service for “inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others.”Milo has never threatened anyone with anything. He insults people, in the most offensive way he can dream up. He frequently and unequivocally denounces those whose digital threats follow his lead, though he claims to doubt that the internet trolling that follows him like a toxic cloud threatens real-world violence. Much of the controversy around Milo thus centers on whether he is responsible only for his own speech and actions, or the speech and actions of others.Milo laid out his position to CNN:There is no question that some of the things that were sent to her were horrible… I am not going to endorse anything horrible that people said to her. Obviously there were some things that were said to her that were disgusting. But I am not in the business of language policing other people. I am only responsible for the things that I say.Writing in Vox, Aja Romano saw it differently:In the internet war of words, Yiannopoulos essentially took aim at Jones and fired thousands of eager, angry Twitter users in her direction.Holding a person responsible for the words of others is a thorny issue to say the least.Elle Magazine’s Sady Doyle wrote:If Yiannopoulos just gave speeches fulminating about “sociopathic feminist bitches” and claiming that “systemic racism and white privilege are bullshit,” he wouldn’t be much different than your standard men’s rights activist. Nor, for that matter, would the shock value of those quotes do much to differentiate him from Rush Limbaugh (”feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society”), Bill O’Reilly (”the left wants power taken away from the white establishment”), or Ann Coulter (”the same way virtually any immigrant to Finland makes it less white, almost any immigrant to America makes it less honest”), all of whom have published multiple books without attracting anywhere near this much protest…. he is not just another talking head. He’s younger, a creature of the Internet, well-versed in the medium’s interactive nature and permeable boundaries… Yiannopoulos is valuable to the right wing because he is a creature of the internet, well-versed in the medium’s interactive nature and permeable boundaries.Doyle appears to argue that there is speech which is permissible in speeches and books but is not permissible on the Internet. This, I very much fear, is the direction a lot of this is ultimately headed: in an age in which individual speech is instantly amplified by the internet, our culture will find “free speech” as it has been understood in recent decades to be intolerable. Over time, a very different regime of regulation of speech will replace it, and our world will become a very different place. Remember that it has become impossible to give a speech or write a book and keep it off the internet. So the way speech is regulated on the Internet will become the way speech is regulated everywhere.Amazingly, the Obama years seem to have convinced many on the left that as more restrictions are placed on speech, they will be the ones who get to decide what those restrictions are. One might think that the recent presidential election would have disabused them of this belief, but instead the calls for regulation of speech have only become louder.Getting banned from Twitter was, without doubt, the best thing that ever happened to Milo. He became an instant alt-right superstar. Seeking to broaden his appeal beyond the alt-right, he turned his attention to college campuses. Like so much of what Milo does, this was a smart move. Outside the alt-right bubble, Milo doesn’t do well in the big wide world. His offensiveness lacks context for all but the most alienated young males. He comes across as unhinged. He does much better on college campuses, where his message resonates.Every now and then Milo talks about trade, immigration, and Islamic terrorists. More often, he carries on about the rights of white men. But his assault on “political correctness” and his “free speech fundamentalism” is his core message. Sometimes it is his only message. Milo resonates on campuses because speech on college campuses in this country is, in fact, increasingly restricted, and students are very much aware of this.This is a big issue and a long story, which is not well-known outside of academia. I have lost count of how many conversations I have had with people outside of the academy who begin by pooh-poohing my complaints, and then, after hearing just a few anecdotes, are more incensed than I am.It is a difficult story to summarize in a few paragraphs. I will defer to Laura Kipnis, whose books include Bound and Gagged: Pornography and the Politics of Fantasy in America, which considers a wide range of non-mainstream sexualities as contributions to the human experience worthy of study. She has recently been writing about the politics of sex on campuses, and was shocked to find herself subjected to a year-long inquisition at Northwestern concerning the acceptability of her views. Her experience in this regard is not unique, but her reaction was: she wrote an extended analysis of her experience in a major academic journal. Courageous woman. Much of her critique of campus politics overlaps with Milo’s. Here is Kipnis:The more colleges devote themselves to creating “safe spaces” — that new watchword — for students, the more dangerous those campuses become for professors. It’s astounding how aggressive students’ assertions of vulnerability have gotten in the past few years. Emotional discomfort is regarded as equivalent to material injury, and all injuries have to be remediated.Here is Milo on CNN, explaining why he routinely engages in offensive speech:As long as there are people who think that “offense taking”… is equivalent to some genuine kind of injury, I am necessary.Oops. Which is the misogynist jerk and which is the radical feminist? Can we silence one and not the other. According to Kipnis, maybe not:Most academics I know — this includes feminists, progressives, minorities, and those who identify as gay or queer — now live in fear of some classroom incident spiraling into professional disaster…. professors around the country now routinely avoid discussing subjects in classes that might raise hackles.Milo makes a lot of hay challenging the idea that there is a “culture of rape” on college campuses. It is a focal point of every Milo speech, and of many critics, who contend that questioning the description of “rape culture” promoted by one sector of academia constitutes “hate speech.” Here is Kipnis, describing her experience running aground on this same reef:Ambivalent sex becomes coerced sex, with charges brought months or even years after the events in question. Title IX officers now adjudicate an increasing range of murky situations involving mutual drunkenness, conflicting stories, and relationships gone wrong. They pronounce on the thorniest of philosophical and psychological issues: What is consent? What is power? Should power differentials between romantic partners be proscribed? Should eliminating power differences in relationships even be a social goal — wouldn’t that risk eliminating heterosexuality itself?But then Milo and Kipnis part ways. Kipnis:Nothing I say here is meant to suggest that sexual assault on campuses isn’t a problem. It is.Milo aggressively ― offensively ― argues that sexual assault on campuses is vastly exaggerated (though he does not claim campus rape never happens). He goes on: “This isn’t about protecting women. It’s about man-hating. It’s a confected moral panic directed against young, male, mostly white American college students.”There you have it: Milo’s special trick. He begins with an assault of political correctness that resonates with many students, and uses that as a launch pad into a petty, ugly pandering and gloating which rallies the worst instincts of a large number of white men.Of course, students who do not get to actually read Milo will never learn how to think about these details. For them, Milo will simply be forbidden.Kipnis again:My concern is that debatable and ultimately conservative notions about sex, gender, and power are becoming embedded in these procedures [which govern sexual relations between students], without any public scrutiny or debate. But the climate on campuses is so accusatory and sanctimonious — so “chilling,” in fact — that open conversations are practically impossible.This chilling campus climate provides Milo with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of low-hanging fruit. He gets to be another borish and privileged, asshole berating all those less powerful than him, while nevertheless electrifying large and growing audiences on a scale that his critics can only dream about – all because open conversations are practically impossible.Julie Bindel is a well-known feminist writer in England. She is “second wave” feminism incarnate. She sees herself as fighting the patriarchy, which she has done tirelessly for decades. She is the co-founder of the law-reform group Justice for Women, which helps women who have been prosecuted for killing violent male partners.Like Milo, Bindel has recently been banned from campus appearances by transgender activists for, among other offenses, arguing that a male to female transsexual should not work as a counsellor of female rape victims.Last February, the University of Michigan did something extraordinary: they hosted an actual debate between these two dangerous pundits of the right and left. I suspect that very few of those denouncing Milo have read or heard much of anything he has actually said. I recommend that they give this debate a look. It is a real debate. How rare! Both participants are articulate in explaining their positions, listen carefully to their adversaries, and engage with the details of the other’s assertions. It is highly educational, and appropriate for a college campus. I will probably use it in a class I am teaching next quarter at the University of California at Davis.During the debate, the University of Michigan Spectrum Center (for queer students) provided a “safe space” to shelter students from the “incredible harm” this debate might inflict upon them:It has come to our attention that an event titled, “Does Feminism Have a Free Speech Problem?” is taking place this evening on our campus. We recognize that the rhetoric of the speakers featured in this event is incredibly harmful to many members of our campus community. The Spectrum Center will be providing a supportive alternative space this evening and holding extended staffed hours until 9pm. There will be no program; our intent is to offer a relaxing, positive space for students who want to gather in community.The assertion that students need protecting from an actual debate between left and right is just the sort of thing that makes Milo such a hot ticket on campuses.Milo also made sure that he got off some of his trademark offensive remarks during the debate. He always does. As he explained to CNN,In an outrage culture, I think the appropriate response is to be outrageous… I don’t want everyone to be like me, but I think that it is important that there are some people like me…. If I offended you that’s good, that’s me performing my function. You should grow a thicker skin and grow up.Milo is certainly not the first person to make an intelligent case for the social merit of offensive speech. Lenny Bruce and George Carlin come immediately to mind. But in this debate, Milo’s offensiveness did not come off well. It impressed no one. Beside the point. Who cared? It was amazing to see how engaging Milo intellectually, rather than attempting to silence him, disarmed his allegedly “weaponized” rhetoric.Milo hates it when he fails to incense. So as his “Dangerous Faggot” campus tour proceeds he has been upping the ante. He now insults people on campus by name, even putting their pictures up on the screen behind him. He calls them fat and ugly. He is horrible. He flails around, almost pathetically, stooping to seemingly anything in his rush for censure. These rants are most certainly difficult for the people Milo targets, but he does not put their “life in danger,” as TeenVogue claimed.Every time the left tries to silence Milo instead of debate him, Milo wins. Which means that Milo is winning an awful lot. Which is why he has multiple YouTube videos with nearly a million hits each. And why Simon and Shuster have given him a quarter of a million dollar advance for a book he has yet to write. The attempt to silence the book instead of debate it will only broaden the sphere in which Milo has an appeal.Don’t read the book? Don’t review it? Don’t debate it? Just silence it? REALLY?This is the world we live in now, folks. Trump is about to be sworn in as president. Milo’s boss, Steve Bannon, has a new position in the White House carved out just for him, right next to the President’s office. Milo has millions of YouTube hits, writes on Breitbart News, and is interviewed by cable television. You think you can “deny a platform” to Milo? What planet are you on?This is the world my students are growing up into. They need to know these arguments, and these people. They need to be able to digest the content of all of this. Which parts of Milo’s thought do they agree with? Where, precisely, does it run off the rails into bullshit and hate? I want my students to be able to debate Milo and win, not need the school to provide a safe space for them to cower in while Milo and his superiors take over the country.Addendum #1 Last month, a school district in Viriginia pulled copies of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” from classrooms and libraries while considering whether to permanently ban the books because they include racial slurs. The district was responding to a complaint from the parent of a biracial high school student. “I’m not disputing this is great literature,” the parent said. “But there is so much racial slurs in there and offensive wording… What are we teaching our children? We’re validating that these words are acceptable. They are not acceptable.”Addendum #2Yesterday, singer Rebecca Ferguson responded to an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration by saying she would do so on the condition that she could sing “Strange Fruit,” an extraordinary song about racist lynchings in the South originally recorded by Billie Holiday. Time magazine named it the “song of the century.” The Library of Congress put it in the National Recording Registry.Ferguson immediately became a hero of mine. Way better than merely saying no, her response highlighted the fact that hate crimes have been increasing since the presidential election, and fears that this trend will continue.I wonder if “Strange Fruit” could even be sung today on many college campuses. The lyrics describe a “Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,” with “bulging eyes and twisted mouth,” and “the sudden smell of burning flesh.” Would the school create a safe space for those who would be “incredibly harmed” by the words?"

In my over-active imagination, I conjured up idyllic ideas of hours upon hours of quality time together; going camping and climbing, playing educational games, and enjoying each others’ company. I thought about arranging playdates where she could giggle with friends in the snow or spend time doing team-building activities that would nurture her “I can do it” spirit. In my mind, her winter break was going to be perfect.Though my notion of “perfect kid holidays” could easily have been concocted by over-reading parenting blogs or a binge-run of some Hallmark-endorsed show, they weren’t. Instead, these ideas snuck into my thoughts mainly out of the desire for my daughter to have a healthy vacation time (which excluded being babysat by electronics).And then we all got a cold.Being sick meant changing many of our ideas, including nixing a desert climbing and camping trip in 13 degree Fahrenheit weather. Instead, burdened with sticky phlegm and some stubborn coughs, we opted for a cozy staycation to help nurture us back to health. This meant making more plan compromises which, to my initial dismay, included my daughter spending a lot of time playing Minecraft.I’ll be the first to say it: I am pretty hard on myself as a parent. I want my daughter to have the best and be supported to go after her dreams. But, then reality settles in. I work from home and am busy with ten thousands tasks I assign myself. And, despite all that my husband and I do with our daughter, we do have limited time and resources that prevents us from doing everything we would like to do.Yes, I still want my daughter to have the best and so I really try, try, try when I can. And, though we spend a lot of quality time together, eat healthy, exercise daily, as well as the fact that my daughter does extremely well in school, my vision of being a “good mom” doesn’t include a lot of time watching TV nor playing video games. But, after phlegm and exhaustion, that’s where I finally chose to give in to the pixelated seduction of Minecraft and electronic fun.Yes, we still played a ton of board and card games, read several books, did some fun science experiments, went sledding, as well as got to host a Christmas gathering and some fun playdates. But, despite my self-assigned “Perfect Mother” plan, spacing out online and in front of screens made its way into our holiday scene. And, after a bit, I too found myself starting a few of my own sentences with the familiar phrase known to parents worldwide: “In Minecraft…” Those two words slipping past my own lips showed me that my idealized winter break for my child was just that, an ideal, and that sometimes doing my best means allowing things to be as they are, Minecraft or not. Though I’m going to continue to aim for my parenting ideals, I’m going to work on enjoying whatever the realities of the circumstances bring."

Peter Shumlin (D) said his father used the state's aid-in-dying law to end his own life. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ebca11200002d00ad5d47.jpeg?ops=crop_0_178_4500_2614%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Outgoing Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin (D) revealed that his terminally sick father took advantage of the state’s aid-in-dying law about a year after he signed it.The legislation, passed nearly four years ago, allows patients who have been diagnosed with six months or less to live to choose to end their own lives with the help of their physician. Shumlin, who decided against seeking re-election in 2016, spoke about his father’s death while detailing his legislative accomplishments in his farewell address on Wednesday.“Terminally ill patients can now make their end-of-life choices as they should be able to,” Shumlin said. “In my wildest dreams when I signed that bill, I never thought that my own dad, who was suffering from a miserable terminal cancer, would be able to die with dignity in his own state, so thank you.”Shumlin’s father, George Shumlin, died in 2014 at age 88. While the governor previously said his father’s “decline was brief,” Shumlin had not publicly addressed his father’s choice to use the state’s death-with-dignity law. After his farewell address, Shumlin told Seven Days his father had esophagus cancer.“The way you die of cancer of the esophagus is you can no longer swallow,” Shumllin said. “It’s a very slow, painful and miserable death. He turned to his family when it got pretty advanced and said that he wanted to go out with dignity, and so we honored his wish.”Vermont’s aid-in-dying law, signed by Shumlin in May 2013, allows physicians to grant terminal patients’ requests for lethal medication. The law, like those in other states, has built-in safeguards against abuse. Vermont was the fourth state to pass a death-with-dignity law, following Oregon, Montana and Washington, and the first state to pass an aid-in-dying law via legislation. California, Colorado and Washington, D.C., have since adopted similar policies. "

For White House reporters, that could mean a lot of things. Spicer has recently talked about changing the seating arrangement in the briefing room, whereby television networks, top wire services and major newspapers currently occupy the front rows. He’s pondered bringing in more conservative news organizations and engaging more directly with the public. He’s also suggested the Trump team might stop televising daily briefings, a practice that began two decades ago.White House reporters remain in wait-and-see mode on such issues following Thursday’s meeting at Trump Tower with Spicer and a couple other key members of the president-elect’s communications team, Hope Hicks and Stephanie Grisham. “I think that they are just sort of informing themselves right now about how the press corps works at the White House and mulling over what kinds of changes they want to make,” White House Correspondents Association president Jeff Mason told The Huffington Post after the meeting.It’s unclear if any major decisions will be made before Inauguration Day, which is just over two weeks away. Mason said he and members of the WHCA board are planning to meet again with the White House communications team during the week Trump takes office. As a presidential candidate, Trump repeatedly assailed the “dishonest” press and even blacklisted nearly a dozen news outlets. He still routinely swipes at the media on Twitter and has not held a press conference since July. His two predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, held news conferences three days after being elected.  So reporters are understandably concerned about which traditions will be upheld in a Trump White House, especially as Spicer and incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus have said they’re reassessing customary dealings with the press. For decades, the WHCA has overseen the seating chart for the 49 spots in the briefing room, a point Mason said he reiterated in Thursday’s meeting.Mason said the Trump team “articulated a desire to open up the briefing and they asked a bunch of questions about that,” but deferred to Spicer as to what their motivation may be for seeking changes. Spicer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting. But Spicer has been open in criticizing the status quo. At a Politico event last month, Spicer said there has been a “very stale operation” at the White House in which television networks and outlets like the New York Times get the best spots. “What about some of the conservative media having some of the prized seats in there?” he asked. “What about having some of the top bloggers being able to come in?”Mason said the Trump team also still appears to be “mulling over” how to handle daily briefings and if they’ll remain televised.There was one significant development from the meeting: The Trump team assured reporters they can create a “protective pool” to cover the president.Trump had so far bucked tradition by not having a “protective pool,” a group of rotating reporters who chronicle the president and president-elect’s travels and are on hand to capture everything from insignificant to historical moments. He’d already broken precedent by not allowing reporters to fly with him while the Republican nominee and continued that practice as president-elect. But reporters were told Thursday that the pool will travel with the president aboard Air Force One. After the meeting, Mason told reporters huddled in Trump Tower that his group was “pleased about that assurance and we look forward to working with president-elect’s team.”"

Trump already met with Wintour last month at Trump Tower, on the same day he spoke to Kanye West.It’s the Carter meeting that will be watched most closely, given the pair’s decades-long feud. Carter dubbed Trump a “short-fingered vulgarian” in the pages of the late Spy magazine, an insult that has continued to rankle the businessman. Carter also took aim at Trump during his presidential campaign, and wrote after the election that “only in America could a man whose staff took away his Twitter account be given the nuclear codes.”New Yorker editor David Remnick, who called Trump’s victory “nothing less than a tragedy for the American republic,” will also attend. Politico first reported on Trump’s upcoming visit to Condé Nast, details of which The Huffington Post confirmed through a company source. Condé Nast has held similar off-the-record meetings between major newsmakers and its top editors and design directors. During the campaign, the company invited both Trump and Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton to such meetings, but only Clinton attended.Trump routinely blasts the media, but he’s also a creature of it. His desk and office walls are covered with magazine covers he’s adorned, and he’s a cable news junkie. So it shouldn’t be surprising he’d accept an opportunity to sit down with some of the magazine industry’s most influential players. Since the election, he’s already met with top television executives and anchors, whom he scolded during an off-the-record gathering at Trump Tower. Two days later, Trump visited The New York Times for an on-the-record discussion with a group of executives, editors, reporters and columnists.But amid these closed-door meetings with influential media figures, Trump still hasn’t held a full-fledged press conference since being elected, a break with tradition. He has said that he’ll hold one on Jan. 11. "
48,POLITICS,House GOP's Blueprint To Gut Ethics Office Looks Like It Was Copied From Azerbaijan Scandal,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/office-of-congressional-ethics-azerbaijan-investigation_us_586d8f22e4b0c4be0af2e08a,Republicans tried to eliminate the very tools used to catch lawmakers on a shady trip.,2017-01-05,House Republicans launched a new Congress by trying to chain up their own ethics watchdog.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d906d1500009506e9e8a6.jpeg?cache=kRdrwhAs7u&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In 2013, nine U.S. House members jetted off to Baku, Azerbaijan, beside the Caspian Sea for an all-expenses-paid trip sponsored by a nonprofit source. It was meant to be an “education, cultural, business” experience for the lawmakers.Not only was their travel completely paid for, but a number of the members received nice gifts: rugs of various sizes, a six-piece crystal tea set, a silk scarf, a DVD box set about Azerbaijan’s president, a briefcase and a paperweight-and-stationery set. Sponsored trips from nonprofits are not a new perk and are typically noncontroversial. This time was different: The nonprofit approved to pay for the trip by the House Ethics Committee was hiding something.That secret wouldn’t be uncovered until two years later by the Office of Congressional Ethics, the independent watchdog that oversees House members.The OCE eventually cracked the case, figuring out that the so-called nonprofit was actually a front for the state-owned oil company of Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijan government had funneled some $750,000 into nonprofit sources to conceal the money’s origin.Still, the OCE investigation faced resistance from within Congress. The House members said they didn’t know the state-owned oil company was paying for the trip. And some didn’t return gifts they received until the ethics watchdog started its probe.Now some of those lawmakers on the receiving end of that investigation ― and many more of their colleagues ― want to make sure the office loses the same tools it used to ferret out the Azerbaijan scheme. Late Monday night, Republicans voted secretly to attach a provision gutting the OCE onto a larger rules package for the House. The measure would have given the Ethics Committee ― which is run by House members ― the power to order the OCE to halt an investigation, bar its board from releasing findings, and prohibit it from contacting law enforcement directly if the independent body learned of possible criminal violations. After intense public backlash, Republicans backed off. The amendment never made it into the final package the House passed Tuesday, but Republicans are promising to push for its return before August.“The people that spoke out in the Republican conference [against OCE] were all those who had run-ins, and I say that accurately, with OCE, and all have ethical issues,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director with the Campaign Legal Center. “That they are the aggrieved is kind of laughable.”During the Azerbaijan investigation, conducted in 2015, the Ethics Committee asked the OCE to drop the case ― in what appeared to be the first-ever such request. The OCE didn’t.Under the Republicans’ proposed provision, the OCE would have to comply if the Ethics Committee directed it to shut down a probe. “The board shall immediately cease any investigation of the matter, and shall notify the individual who is the subject of the review accordingly,” the measure said.After the OCE handed over its complete findings in the Azerbaijan case to the ethics panel, lawmakers decided to release only a short summary, deeming the independent watchdog’s entire report “not appropriate for release because the referral followed the OCE Board’s decision not to cease its investigations.” In response, the OCE’s board, on which Republicans and Democrats are equally represented, voted unanimously to release all its findings to the public.Republicans tried to put a clamp on that kind of independence, too, in this month’s measure.“Nothing ... may be construed to authorize the board of the [OCE] to make any public statement, or release any information or other material to the public or any other entity, unless such statement or information has already been released by the Committee on Ethics or the release of such statement or information has been authorized by the Committee on Ethics,” the amendment stated.Finally, in the Azerbaijan case, the OCE found that the improper acceptance of paid travel and gifts from a foreign government violated not only ethics rules and standards of conduct, but also federal law. Nearly every case the OCE deals with touches on criminal law, the Azerbaijan matter being no exception.Again, the Republican amendment took aim at this. It would have required the OCE to “immediately refer the matter to the Committee on Ethics for further review” if an accusation raised the possibility of a criminal law violation. In the process, the measure would have ended the ethics watchdog’s ability to go “directly” to any law enforcement agency.The aggressive rules change authored by Republicans was a long time coming, building steam over the years as members were placed under the microscope for questionable actions. But this attack, launched on the first day of a new Republican-controlled Congress as the GOP prepares to take over the White House, was the strongest attempt yet to strip all independence and transparency from the OCE.Congress created this mess by not granting the OCE subpoena powers from the start, McGehee argued. During an investigation, lawmakers typically hire lawyers, who then tell them they don’t have to cooperate with the watchdog. As a result, the OCE ends up treating the lawmakers as hostile witnesses.McGehee called this week’s assault on the OCE the “diciest” one to date, adding that “it’s clear OCE is going to be under siege” moving forward.“Draining the swamp is more powerful than even the politicians realize,” she said. “They often think they can control their own message, but when you start making moves that look like they are for your own benefit, the public will in fact respond.”Republicans plan to take a look at the OCE again before the August recess, some even calling for the office to be abolished altogether.McGehee, in turn, said she is going to focus on just keeping the OCE independent and transparent, by reminding House members that it benefits them.“When an allegation comes before OCE and they dismiss it, it has credibility,” she said. “Where do you go to get your reputation restored? Well, go to the OCE.”Craig Holman, a lobbyist for the watchdog group Public Citizen, thinks now is the time for lawmakers who support the OCE to push for permanently reauthorizing it ― so its future doesn’t come into question with every new Congress. He’s also hopeful that after the public uproar over the GOP’s move, lawmakers will grant the office subpoena powers and establish a similar agency to conduct oversight in the Senate.The truth is that watchdog groups will be hard pressed to find either Republicans or Democrats willing to push for expanding the OCE’s powers.“Since Republicans have the majority in the House, whether or not we can succeed will depend on whether we can embarrass enough Republicans,” Holman said Tuesday after they withdrew the language gutting the OCE. “But at least now, it’s on the political agenda thanks to the Republican fiasco this morning.”"

McCain and Tillerson had a meeting scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.And if his previous comments are any indication, McCain needs some serious convincing.“I have concerns,” McCain told Reuters shortly after Trump announced Tillerson as his pick. “It’s very well known that [Tillerson] he has a very close relationship with (Russian President) Vladimir Putin.”McCain has also spoken out against reported Russian cyberattacks against the United States, describing them as “an act of war” and calling for a Senate committee to investigate the hacks. He has described Putin as a “butcher, a murderer and a thug.”In 2013, Putin awarded Tillerson the country’s Order of Friendship. And according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Tillerson has met with the Russian president “several times” and acted “highly professional” during previous dealing with Kremlin representatives.On Tuesday, Exxon announced it had cut all ties with Tillerson in order “to comply with conflict-of-interest requirements associated with his nomination as secretary of state.” If confirmed to Trump’s post, the former company chairman and CEO stands to receive company shares worth some $180 million.

The president-elect will undoubtedly make news by addressing a number of backlogged issues, including his ongoing feud with the intelligence community over Russia’s meddling in the election and the matter of his business conflicts.Furthermore, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to hold a series of votes on the Senate floor on Wednesday as part of the GOP’s push to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Democrats are eagerly awaiting the confirmation hearings. Tillerson’s close ties to Russia and Sessions’ fitness for office, in particular, are two issues they hope will generate noise and endanger a nomination. But these potential conflicts may not matter, even if they spur a memorable exchange. It’s likely the public will be easily distracted from negative headlines given the sheer amount of news happening all at once. Like drinking water from a fire hose, the GOP schedule will overload consumers of news and the press alike.Democrats are hoping to slow-walk the confirmation process and give the incoming president’s nominees a thorough public vetting. Republicans are using two unconventional weapons ― time and attention span ― to rebuff them. It may not be best for the country, but it is smart politics. It also mirrors Trump’s tactics during the campaign. The former reality television star repeatedly starved his opponents of air time with staged dramatic events and his habit of making news unpredictably."
54,BLACK VOICES,Police Unions Outraged Over Painting In U.S. Capitol That Depicts Cops As Animals,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-unions-painting-capitol_us_586e921ae4b099cdb0fc09ba,"They say the artwork is ""reprehensible and repugnant"" and they want it removed.",2017-01-05,"David Pulphus' ""Untitled #1"" won an art competition held last year by Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.). Now, police unions say it has to come down.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e947d1b00002c006e5b91.jpeg?cache=zKsIFExM3d&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Police groups are urging lawmakers to remove a contest-winning painting from the U.S. Capitol, saying its portrayal of a protest that depicts officers and a demonstrator as animals is anti-law enforcement.In a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) this week, a coalition of California police unions called Missouri teenager David Pulphus’ artwork “reprehensible and repugnant” for representing police officers as “Pigs intent on gunning down innocent people.” Other police groups have also criticized it, saying it doesn’t belong in the Capitol.Pulphus submitted his painting, “Untitled #1,” to the 16th Congressional Art Competition as a constituent of Rep. Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) last year. Clay gave it top honors and commended Pulphus’ “colorful landscape of symbolic characters representing social injustice, the tragic events in Ferguson, Missouri and the lingering elements of inequality in modern American society” in a May statement. The acrylic painting now hangs on the wall of a tunnel beneath the Capitol, alongside hundreds of other works submitted to the annual competition.But Pulphus’ politically charged imagery struck a nerve with police unions, which have been highly critical of protests for police reform. Most of their outrage focuses on the painting’s supposed depiction of officers as “pigs,” a derogatory term for police officers.One of the characters does appear to have tusks, making it look more like a warthog or wild boar than a pig. The other officers look even less porcine, and one appears to have the face of a bulldog. A protester also has an animal head.The work features signs that read “racism kills” and “stop kill,” a slogan that appears to be cut off by the protester in the foreground. Slogans like this have been regular features at demonstrations since an officer killed black teenager Michael Brown in 2014.But some law enforcement officials say the image itself could incite violence against cops.“They’re basically saying that all police officers who wear the uniform are racist and kill African-Americans, and that’s not the truth,” Paul Kelly, president of the San Jose Police Officers Association, told the Bay Area News Group. “It absolutely may trigger someone else to say, ‘I’m done with this. I’m going to take action. I’m going to kill a cop.’”Ryan, asked about the painting at a press conference on Thursday, said he hadn’t seen or heard about it.So far, Clay has resisted calls to take “Untitled #1” down. He’s gotten a number of angry phone calls and discussed the controversy with Rep. Dave Reichert (R-Wash.), a former sheriff, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Although the two congressmen interpret the work differently, neither has plans to pursue its removal.Asked how he’s defended the painting to its detractors, Clay told the Post-Dispatch that he simply invoked the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.“I said, ‘Look now, we cannot be selective about people’s constitutional rights,” said Clay. “The Supreme Court has said artistic expression is a form of speech, and we cannot abridge freedom of speech.’”Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to more accurately describe the location of the painting."

Walters’ lawyers are meanwhile expected to seek the case’s dismissal as a result of the leaks.Chaves, who oversaw the FBI squad that conducted the investigation, has not been charged in connection with the leaks. His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for Walters declined comment.Chaves previously has been involved in several high-profile securities fraud matters, including an FBI probe into insider trading in the hedge fund industry dubbed “Operation Perfect Hedge” that resulted in dozens of people being charged.In Walters’ case, prosecutors say the gambler made more than $40 million through insider trading on tips supplied by Thomas Davis, the former chairman of Dean Foods Co.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a related civil case said Mickelson, who has won three Masters pro golf titles, at one point bought Dean Foods’ stock on a recommendation by Walters, to whom he owed money.Mickelson was not accused of wrongdoing, but he reached an agreement with the SEC to pay back $1.03 million the regulator said he earned trading shares of Dean Foods. Davis has pleaded guilty. Walters is scheduled to face trial on March 13.Lawyers for Mickelson and Davis did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.The case is U.S. v.

Especially in cause and effect.Vanity Fair noted that the 16-year-old Evancho’s latest offering is a Christmas album, so it stands to reason that sales would increase as the holiday approached.In terms of numbers, Billboard offered interesting tidbits. The music trade outlet acknowledged that sales of Evancho’s “Someday At Christmas” did rise after the Dec. 14 announcement that she would sing the national anthem at the inauguration ― but “skyrocket” might be pushing it.The Christmas album, released Oct. 28, sold 6,000 copies in the chart week ending Dec. 15. Sales then increased to 11,000 the next charting period ending Dec. 22. Then they dipped to 8,000 the week after.As for “the Movement” being responsible for boosting her sales, Billboard also noted that Evancho appeared on an “America’s Got Talent” holiday special that aired on NBC Dec. 19 and Dec. 29.In addition, her five previous studio albums never returned to the Billboard 200 after the inauguration announcement.Keep tweeting, Mr. President-Elect.

He also wants to implement a new deadline to return voter registration forms and absentee ballots to election officials. Kevin Hall, a Pate spokesman, did not immediately respond when asked whether this would shorten the absentee voting period in the state.“As I have stated many times, protecting the integrity of our elections is my top priority and this legislation will help us do that,” Pate said in a statement. “I want to make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat. If you don’t have an ID, we will send you a new voter registration card to use at the polls. This bill streamlines the system to make checking in easier and quicker. It will reduce waiting times at the polls, ensure every eligible Iowan is able to cast a ballot, and ensures their ballot will count.”There’s no data indicating that Iowa needs tougher standards. Hall told The Huffington Post last month that his office didn’t have hard data on election fraud from previous years, but studies have shown that election fraud across the country is extremely rare. A New York Times survey of every state found that there were zero allegations of voter fraud in 26 states after the 2016 election and just one claim each in an additional eight states.The proposal comes after Republicans gained control of the Iowa Legislature for the first time in nearly two decades. Republican Gov. Terry Branstad said on Tuesday that it “makes sense” to look at a voter ID law.Pate said Thursday that he had already had positive conversations with lawmakers about the proposed changes, according to The Des Moines Register.Critics argue that voter ID laws provide an unnecessary hurdle to voting and disproportionately affect low-income and minority voters. Federal courts struck down voter ID laws in Texas, Wisconsin and North Carolina last year.“Strict photo ID laws can be a roadblock for many eligible voters trying to make their voices heard at the polls,” said Jennifer Clark, a counsel in the Democracy Program at the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice, in an email. “The law in Texas, for example, was struck down this summer, but if it stood, there would have been an estimated 600,000 citizens who didn’t have one of the IDs required under the law. Those most affected by these laws are students, elderly voters, and Black and Latino Americans. If states are concerned about election integrity, they should instead focus on updating their election infrastructure and modernizing voter registration.”Pate doubted that an Iowa voter ID law would affect turnout.“We are one of the top states in the nation for voter registration and voter participation. This legislation will not have any negative impact on either of those. Instead, it will help instill confidence in our voting system and let every Iowan know that their vote counts,” he said in the statement.Allegra Chapman, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, a nonprofit citizens advocacy group, questioned why Pate was seeking the new restrictions if he himself had acknowledged there wasn’t anything suspicious in the state’s elections.“As a number of courts recently held, including the 5th Circuit ― arguably the most conservative court in the land ― strict photo ID bills like the one he proposes (it refuses use of student IDs) are discriminatory, could prevent hundreds of thousands within the state from voting, and are solutions to problems that don’t exist,” she said in an email.“The Secretary himself said voting in the state is ‘clean.’ So why tack on this new burden? The only reason to introduce this legislation is to keep some people ― low-income Americans who are often people of color, students, elderly, or disabled ― from the polling places.”"

The letter noted that “the ordinary conflict check conducted in the chief justice’s chamber’s inadvertently failed to find this potential conflict.”Roberts will therefore step aside, meaning only seven of the court’s eight justices will decide the case, which was argued on Dec. 6.Roberts’ 1,212 shares are worth around $175,000 based on the current share price of around $145.Supreme Court justices routinely recuse themselves in cases involving companies in which they own stocks, but each conducts its own checks for potential conflicts.In 2015, Justice Stephen Breyer belatedly spotted a similar stock conflict in an energy case, but instead of recusing, he decided to sell off the stock to cure the conflict before continuing to work on the case.Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix the Court, a court watchdog that has called for justices to implement better conflict checks, seemed to note a pattern.“This is the third instance in the last 15 months in which a justice initially missed a stock conflict and failed to recuse himself from a case as required by law,” Roth said in a statement. “Why is it so hard for the Supreme Court to get this right?”HuffPost contributed to this report."

That is a wall worth building!” Perriello said an email to supporters Thursday morning, which was shared with The Huffington Post. “The next Governor can block the radical redistricting that has held back our promise and progress. If we hand the system back to the people, together we can demand better wages, more time with family, paid family leave, and better, more affordable education,” he added. Virginia limits its governors to one term, and outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) had hoped for an uncontentious primary. He, along with Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, have already endorsed Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, and all three men said they would still back him despite the new development. Perriello’s announcement took by surprise some Virginia political observers, who expected that the nomination was essentially locked up by Northam.Perriello called Northam on Wednesday evening and informed him of his candidacy, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.Perriello was elected to Congress in 2008 and was a steadfast ally of the newly elected President Barack Obama. Despite representing a conservative-leaning district, Perriello was a favorite of progressives and voted in favor of the stimulus package, cap-and-trade legislation and the Affordable Care Act (although he upset some members of his party with his more conservative stance on abortion). Perriello alluded to Gillespie and Stewart in his announcement email Wednesday, saying that “Virginia is under threat” if it elects one of the GOP candidates. “The main Republican challengers include the corporate D.C. lobbyist who wrote the playbook that sold out the middle class and American Dream to the highest bidder,” he said. “His team rigged the district maps to ensure our legislature reflected his clients instead of our citizens. The other is a top Trump acolyte who sows fear and racial hatred, denies climate change, and stoked the war on women.”Read the full email: Sender: Tom PerrielloSubject: I choose to fight - I’m running for GovernorFriend ―Future generations will ask what we did at this moment to defend our values and our Commonwealth.

The new Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), doesn’t see his mission in quite the same way that McConnell saw his. “I wouldn’t call that my goal,” Schumer said in an interview with The Huffington Post Thursday. “My goal is to make sure that it’s easier for the middle class to stay in the middle class, and people trying to get there to get there. And that American values are not trampled on. ... I said that we’re going to be an accountability Congress. We’re going to hold Donald Trump accountable.”But Schumer added that if Trump continues down the path he’s already started taking with the people he’s chosen for his Cabinet, he believes Trump will serve just one term anyway.“The Cabinet wants to go back to the 1920s,” he said. “And if that’s his view, I don’t think he’ll ever win reelection.”House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) similarly told The Huffington Post last month that she didn’t see it as her responsibility to make Trump a one-term president and viewed her job differently than McConnell did. “First and foremost, our responsibility is to do the job for the American people,” she said. “So the question is, engage or confront? We’ll engage where we can, confront where we can’t. ... Hopefully we can find common ground.”Republicans are trying to get Trump’s nominees in place as quickly as possible. On Wednesday, the Senate will have hearings on six of his Cabinet picks. The president-elect is also scheduled to have a long-awaited press conference that same day. That means the attention of the press and the public will be pulled in so many different directions that any problems that arise during a hearing may not get as much attention or coverage as they would on a slower news day.Schumer said he absolutely thought Republicans were hoping that some issues from the nominees would slip under the radar, and that’s why all the hearings are on one day. “If I had nominees like that, that’s what I’d do,” he said. Democrats don’t have the votes on their own to stop Trump’s Cabinet picks. In 2013, Senate Democrats, then led by Harry Reid, eliminated the need for a president’s nominees to receive 60 votes for confirmation; they now just need a majority. But Democrats can try to slow the process down.“The American people are entitled to full and fair hearings, and we’re going to fight very hard for that,” Schumer said Thursday. “We have some levers to make that happen.”Schumer said he opposed changing the filibuster rules for Cabinet picks at the time, and he said he would consider changing the rules back if Democrats regain the majority in the Senate. “I’d have to discuss that, but it’s something I’d certainly consider, yes,” he said.Democrats plan to go after any conflicts of interest with Trump’s Cabinet nominees, many of whom are billionaires with long business ties. “They go through an ethics investigation, they then have to have a 90-day plan to divest so there are no conflicts of interest, they have to have an FBI investigation,” he said. “When Barack Obama was president, all of them had all of this done by early January. Trump people, the majority, don’t.”As an illustration of this strategy, Democrats came out aggressively Thursday against Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump’s nominee to be health and human services secretary. They plan to stall his nomination until the House Office of Congressional Ethics has reviewed his trading in health care stocks during his tenure as a member of Congress.Schumer also said Democrats plan to drill down on the more extreme positions of some of Trump’s nominees during the hearings themselves.“I understand why they want to sneak it through,” he said. “But I’ve told Mitch McConnell that would be the wrong way to go, and we would use whatever tools we have. If they have quick hearings, we’ll do very long floor debates, and we can hold things up for a long time on the floor ― even though we can’t stop them from scheduling the hearings when they want. I’m hopeful we can come to a compromise.”Schumer has already been in Trump’s crosshairs, with the president-elect tweeting Tursday that the legislator is a “clown.”Schumer didn’t return the slight, telling reporters Thursday morning that health care is “serious, serious stuff,” and “people’s lives are at stake.” In his interview with HuffPost later in the day, he said he believes it’s a mistake for Democrats to start calling Trump names.“I think you stick with your values and the merits,” he said, “because I think that you go down to his level [with name-calling]. He loves that level of just name-calling. And then the focus is off the bad things he’s doing to America.”Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.This piece was updated with additional quotes from Schumer.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e6c5d1200002d00ad5bde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Tuesday, writer and director of late ‘80s cult classic “They Live,” John Carpenter, took to Twitter to assure his followers and trolls alike that the film has “nothing to do with Jewish control of the world.” Why, you ask, did Carpenter feel the need to share this message? Let us break it down. Gizmodo reports that a group of neo-Nazis and white supremacists have been concocting a pretty twisted theory about “They Live,” which argues the film’s plot ― aliens essentially taking over the world while hiding in plain sight ― is a metaphor for Jewish supremacy. They believe the film’s narrative outlines how Jewish people become richer and control the world right under the rest of the populace’s noses. Some folks have gone so far as to share Photoshopped memes as so-called “proof” of their theory. We repeat: these memes are Photoshopped and not real depictions from the film, but what is truth in a world of fake news?The GIF below, which uses one of the film’s most iconic scenes, replaces the “Obey” billboard message with an anti-Semitic drawing. That same drawing is used here:And just for good measure, here’s the real scene: Despite the fact that Carpenter confirmed the film’s meaning, the trolls continued to dispute him. The fact that he wrote and directed the movie clearly means nothing to them.It should be noted that the theory comes from a small, but vocal, group of fans of the film. Gizmodo also notes that the theory has been floating around on message boards since at least 2008, but seems to have gained new traction in the current political climate. In an old thread on Stormfront (”Voice of the new embattled White minority!”), someone wrote, “Great movie, one of my faves. The jews in the movie are not very realistic though. The real ones are much uglier.” Another commenter wrote, “the Jews really are the aliens controlling everything. Living among us and we don’t even know it.”Sigh.

The home of “Making a Murderer” snatched up worldwide rights to a JonBenét documentary by Australian director Kitty Green that’s set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month. The film, “Casting JonBenét,” is billed as a “sly and stylized exploration of the world’s most sensational child-murder case.” Green and producers spent 15 months interviewing neighbors in the Ramsey family’s Colorado hometown on their memories of the case and the strange mythology that’s grown out of it over two decades. It’s slated to debut on Netflix in the spring.The 6-year-old child beauty pageant star was found strangled and beaten in the basement of her family’s home on Dec. 26, 1996, along with a ransom note. Although the Ramsey family offered a $100,000 reward for information about the killer, public suspicion eventually landed on members of the family themselves: parents Patsy and John and, later, on older brother Burke. The family later relocated to Georgia, and Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006.In September, Burke Ramsey spoke with Dr. Phil about the case, claiming his family’s innocence.“Casting JonBenét” follows a docuseries that aired on CBS in the fall titled “The Case of: JonBenét Ramsey,” a special on A&E titled “The Killing of JonBenét: The Truth Uncovered,” a Lifetime TV movie titled “Who Killed JonBenét?” and NBC’s Dateline special with the same name.CORRECTION: This article previously misstated the structure of “The Case Of” as a six-part series.

Carlson, a veteran conservative journalist and commentator, joined Fox News in 2009 as a contributor after previously hosting shows on MSNBC and CNN. He launched news and opinion site The Daily Caller the following year, and in 2013, stepped up to co-host the weekend edition of “Fox & Friends.”Since Kelly, widely seen as the future of Fox News, announced Tuesday she was leaving Fox News for NBC News, there’s been speculation that the network would want another woman hosting the coveted 9 p.m. slot between ratings leader Bill O’Reilly and Sean Hannity. Also, Carlson had only been in the 7 p.m. slot, vacated by Greta Van Susteren, since November. It’s a rapid rise for Carlson, though he has quickly succeeded with his show in producing strong ratings, sparking debate and generating viral moments ― metrics prized by cable news executives. “In less than two months, Tucker has taken cable news by storm with his spirited interviews and consistently strong performance,” Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of Fox News parent company 21st Century Fox, said in a statement. “Viewers have overwhelmingly responded to the show and we look forward to him being a part of Fox News’ powerful primetime line-up.”Carlson’s show has averaged 2.8 million viewers since its launch and last month ranked 2nd in the key 25-54 demographic, behind only O’Reilly. He’s also generated plenty of headlines already. Carlson got New York Times public editor Liz Spayd to agree with him that some of the paper’s political reporters’ tweets had crossed a line and sparred with Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwald and Teen Vogue’s Lauren Duca. She called Carlson a “partisan hack,” while he dismissively suggested she write about fashion instead of politics. Carlson, who made media criticism a recurring part of his Fox News show, had once been a highly regarded magazine writer for publications like New York and Esquire, as well as the conservative Weekly Standard.He later shifted to television punditry and served as the bowtie-clad conservative host on CNN’s partisan slugfest “Crossfire.” Jon Stewart famously appeared on the show in 2004 and urged Carlson and liberal host Paul Begala to “stop hurting America.” The show was canceled months later. In 2005, Carlson began hosting an evening show on MSNBC, which was canceled three years later as the network veered left in primetime. Carlson drew jeers from the conservative faithful at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2009 for speaking favorably about The New York Times and suggested there needed to be better fact-based reporting from newsrooms on the right. But Carlson has also criticized the Times, and the news media more broadly, as being disconnected from much of the country.“Everybody in journalism — black, white, Hispanic, Asian — they’re all from exactly the same culture,” he told HuffPost in 2013. “They’re all coastal. They’re all secular. They’ve never held a gun before. They also have the same — they’re all pro-choice. They’re all pro gay rights. That’s fine. But the net effect is an echo chamber.”By promoting Carlson to 9 p.m., Fox News has shifted to a primetime line-up that ranges from sympathetic to president-elect Donald Trump to outright cheerleading. Kelly, who prompted tirades from Trump after she challenged his sexist comments during a Republican debate, didn’t boost his candidacy in 2016 and frequently booked critics on her show. Meanwhile, Trump frequently turned to Hannity for softball interviews throughout the election. Carlson wasn’t a Trump mouthpiece, like Hannity, but has repeatedly criticized so-called elites, and especially those in the news media, as being out of touch with Americans who voted for Trump. “In Washington,” he said last month, “no one believes anything unless it comes from The New Yorker, New York Times editorial page, or The Washington Post.” The Drudge Report first reported the news of Carlson’s promotion, which was confirmed soon after in a press release.“Martha is a versatile and skilled anchor who has proven to be an essential component of our news programming,” Murdoch said. “For the last 12 years, our viewers have trusted her reporting and we are pleased she will be part of our primetime line-up for the first 100 days of the new presidency.”This post has been updated with more details on Carlson’s career and statements from Fox News."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d66b41500003006917430.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2013, both “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Argo” were nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. The latter, directed by Ben Affleck, went on to win. The following year, “The Wolf of Wall Street” nabbed five Academy Award nods. And in 2015, “Carol” gained critical acclaim and competed for six golden statues on Hollywood’s biggest night. This year, Kenneth Lonergan’s film “Manchester by the Sea” has landed on a bevy of year-end lists and was named the best film of 2016 by the National Board of Review. The movie has already earned three Critics’ Choice Awards, four Screen Actors Guild nominations and five Golden Globe nominations. Let’s just say chances for a few Oscars are pretty high. But what do all of those movies have in common? Well, Kyle Chandler, of course.The Emmy winner, who is best known for his beloved role as Coach Eric Taylor on the TV series “Friday Night Lights,” played supporting roles in the five films mentioned above. Chandler himself has never been nominated, but he’s clearly earned a different prize: awards season’s lucky charm. “I don’t know about that,” he told The Huffington Post in a recent interview, laughing at the concept. “I’ll tell you what, I’m lucky to be involved in all those films.” In actuality, five of the last seven movies Chandler was part of became Oscar hits. The 2013 Sundance prizewinner “The Spectacular Now” and the political thriller “Broken City” were the two movies that didn’t compete for gold, but neither went unnoticed. In fact, “The Spectacular Now” earned two Independent Spirit Award nominations and a handful of critics’ accolades. And now, believe it or not, Chandler’s next indie, “Sidney Hall,” is already surrounded by buzz.There’s no mystery behind why Chandler is cast in notable films: the 51-year-old actor is a memorable force on screen. His voice is one of a kind. He gives amazing pre-game pep talks. He plays a great CIA chief/FBI agent/authority figure, and he knows how to be a jealous husband when it’s needed. It appears Chandler always has the upper hand when it comes to playing men in charge ― he makes you believe he’s got everything under control, whether it be within an agency, administration or familial structure. (“You need a guy who’s grown up, and a lot of actors don’t seem grown up, no matter how old they get,” director Todd Haynes said in 2015, explaining why he cast Chandler in “Carol.”) With his latest role, Chandler proves he’s got the skills to make you feel all that plus true, wrenching heartbreak. Chandler, oddly enough, plays Joe Chandler in “Manchester by the Sea,” a movie riddled with both extreme grief and laugh-out-loud humor that you don’t know which emotions to embrace as the movie unfolds. The story revolves around a Massachusetts handyman, Lee (Casey Affleck), who is assigned guardianship of his teenage nephew, Patrick (Lucas Hedges), after his only brother (Chandler) dies. Although he moves back to his hometown to care for Patrick, Lee is facing darker demons that prevent him from truly tackling the role of father-figure. “I found the script very uplifting as opposed to depressing,” Chandler said when asked about the film’s somber undertones. “I find that the character I play was actually freeing my brother from a possible lifetime of imprisonment, and I was giving him the option and the choices to free himself from his past pain by being the one who’s able to do the right thing for my son. And if I was going to look at the ending of the character, I would say my brother did the best he could do for who he is and that’s what I wanted him to do before I passed away.” Lonergan’s screenplay affected Chandler so deeply that he knew he had to be in the film. So, he did his very best to convince the writer and director to hire him. “I read the script twice in a couple of hours because it moved me so much. I thought I was being tricked or something,” Chandler explained. “The next morning, I went and I sat for an hour with Kenny, [and we] talked about what I’d like to do with the character and what he did, and we had a great breakfast. I walked out of there 10 feet tall, thinking, ‘Wow, I hope he chooses me for this.’”Chandler feels that way about most of the films he’s involved with as of late. Although he no longer needs to audition (“I was always terrified of auditioning, to be quite honest”), the actor reads dozens of scripts and usually can’t believe the immense talent behind the projects he’s pitched.“I’ve never truly gone against my gut feeling,” Chandler said. “But a lot of these you don’t even have to worry about having a gut feeling. When you meet Martin Scorsese and he says, ‘Ah, I think you’d be good for this.’ You feel like, ‘OK! I think so, too.’ I’ve been so very fortunate. You look at the directors on each one of the films that you mentioned, they’re really impressive people who are really good at what they do.” Still, Chandler is always a supporting player in a field of lead actors, which has included Ben Affleck (“Argo”), Jessica Chastain (“Zero Dark Thirty”), Leonardo DiCaprio (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Cate Blanchett (“Carol”) and Casey Affleck (“Manchester by the Sea”). He insists he’s fine with that, but it doesn’t mean he’s not eager to take on a headlining role. In fact, the funnier, the better.“These supporting roles keep being offered and the people who have been involved in the films, you can’t say no to, you know?” he explained, referring to directors like Scorsese, Haynes and Kathryn Bigelow. “I’ve never had a lead role in a feature and that’s the next brass ring that I’m looking for. That’s one pursuit that I have not hit yet. But until then, I’m very happy with where I am,” Chandler added with a chuckle.He’s never seemed to have a problem nabbing a lead role on television, however. The actor once again played an authoritative but lovable family man on NBC’s “Friday Night Lights” for five seasons. His portrayal of football coach Eric Taylor earned him numerous accolades, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 2011. More recently, he stars in Netflix’s original series “Bloodline” as John Rayburn, a Florida sheriff dealing with family crisis after family crisis as a protective son and brother. Again, Chandler received Emmys love, being nominated twice for a role that mirrors a lot of his past work. Hollywood has a tendency to pigeonhole him into this stern, endearing character arc, something Chandler is well aware of.“There’s this gravitas that for some reason I get hired for these heavy roles, and I love comedy,” he admitted. “I cannot wait to get hold of a comedic script. A dark comedy, a situational comedy — anything comedy! Because I haven’t done anything fun like that in so long.”An invitation to this year’s most prestigious award show would be fun too, but that’s a whole other thing Chandler isn’t so sure about. Believe it or not, he’s never even attended the Oscars: “They won’t let me in,” he joked.Standing on the sidelines of awards season doesn’t faze him, though. “When I get a chance to go, that’s awesome. Fantastic. Great,” he said. “But if I’m not invited, I’m not bothered by it at all.” Chandler “truly” believes the Oscar buzz surrounding “Manchester” is deserved. Despite having some anxiety about taking on a Boston accent for the film (“The thing that worries me the most is people from the area. If they don’t buy it, it’s just a big fail”), Lonergan’s dedication, Affleck’s immersion into his character and the crew’s tireless efforts made Chandler quickly realize that this project was something special. If it wins, he’ll be proudest of the teamwork involved.“Within just wanting things to do well, it’s not just you. You’re striving for all the people who work around you and the whole project,” Chandler said of awards season, admitting he doesn’t “strive for nominations.”“When you go and you win an Emmy, you’re not standing up there, saying, ‘Hey, look at me, I won an Emmy. I’m so proud of myself.’ You just happen to be the grinning fool who’s standing up there holding the statue,” he added. “Without everyone else, then you’re on the sidelines. But in that sense, you’re never on the sidelines as long as you have a job because you’re always having fun doing what you want. Like I always say, that’s why they call it a play. It’s play. So it’s a good living.” Before ending the conversation, we asked Chandler what his next Oscar-nominated film would be. The actor couldn’t help but joke a bit. “It’s probably going to be a comedy and I’m going to be the lead in it. And it will be shot in black-and-white. Old, beautiful, grainy, nickel-like nitrate. That would be fantastic.” Yes. Yes, it would.“Manchester by the Sea” is now playing in select theaters."

66,POLITICS,Intelligence Officials Plan To Release Report On Russia Hacking Efforts Next Week,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clapper-russia-cyberattack-hearing_us_586e6abfe4b0c4be0af327b0,"The report will ascribe ""multiple motives"" to the cyberattack.",2017-01-05,Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Director of the National Security Agency Adm. Michael Rogers testified on Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee on foreign interference in the U.S. election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e92a01700002600928506.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The intelligence community plans to release an unclassified report early next week, detailing its findings on Russian cyberattacks aimed at disrupting the 2016 presidential election.Last month, President Barack Obama ordered a full review of foreign hacking efforts aimed at interfering with U.S. elections dating back to 2008, asking that it be completed before he leaves office. Intelligence officials plan to brief lawmakers on the full classified version of its findings next week, in addition to testifying at public hearings, outgoing Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday. The report will build on an Oct. 7 joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security, which concluded that the Russian government had directed a widely publicized hack of the Democratic National Committee’s emails. “We stand more resolutely on the strength of that statement” than ever before, Clapper testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday. Clapper declined to preview the contents of the forthcoming report, which was prepared by the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency. However, he told lawmakers that intelligence agencies had identified “multiple motives” for Moscow’s interference in the election.The DNI chief, who is generally tight-lipped in public hearings, said he plans to “push the envelope as much as I can on the unclassified version” of the report, because “the public should know as much of this as possible.” Leaks from CIA and FBI officials show that both agencies believe Russia’s interference in the election was aimed, in part, at helping President-elect Donald Trump win. Russian meddling in the election, Clapper said, was a multifaceted effort involving propaganda and disinformation in addition to cyberattacks. The intelligence community does not believe that Moscow changed vote tallies. It is outside the intelligence community’s purview to assess the overall effect Russia’s efforts had on the outcome of the election, Clapper said. The hearing, which is likely Clapper’s last before the committee, comes amid growing tensions between the intelligence community and Trump. The president-elect, who favors closer ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has dismissed intelligence assessments on the hack and accused intelligence officials of building a false case against Moscow. Trump is scheduled to receive a classified briefing on Russian hacking efforts on Friday. Committee chairman Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) urged his colleagues to “set partisanship aside” and work together to prevent and respond to future cyberattacks.“Every American should be alarmed by Russia’s attacks on our nation,” McCain said Thursday. “There is no national security interest more vital to the United States of America than the ability to hold free and fair elections without foreign interference.”Senate Democrats, still bruised from what they perceive as an attack on their presidential nominee, used the hearing as a chance to batter their Republican counterparts. “Who benefits from a president-elect trashing the intelligence community?” asked Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.).“There’s a difference between skepticism and disparagement,” Clapper responded, acknowledging past instances of intelligence failure ― most notably, the intelligence that paved the way for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. “I’ve received many expressions of concern from foreign counterparts about... what has been interpreted as disparagement of the U.S. intelligence community.”While a handful of GOP lawmakers, including McCain, have pushed for an aggressive investigation into the hack, several members have instead sided with Trump in brushing off the intelligence community’s findings.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) suggested it wouldn’t make sense for Putin to favor Trump, since Trump expressed more interest than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in building up U.S. nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. Cotton added that ascribing motives to the actions of foreign adversaries is “among the hardest tasks” of the intelligence community. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) downplayed the significance of foreign interference in the U.S. election, noting that the U.S. has “been involved in one way or another in 81 different elections since World War II.”McCain told reporters on Wednesday that he is working with ranking Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) on new sanctions legislation targeting Russia.The Obama administration imposed its own economic sanctions last week and expelled 35 Russian officials from the U.S. in response to the cyberattack.Clapper said on Thursday that he supports sanctions and beefing up defensive cyber capabilities as an initial response.Retaliatory attacks, he added, would carry the risk of counter-retaliation. And cyber deterrence would be difficult to accomplish because unlike nuclear weapons, you cannot “see, feel, touch [or] measure” cyber capabilities, he said."

Robert!” at Velodrome National, a state-of-the-art indoor track outside Paris that hosts elite cycling events.Marchand said he didn’t even see the 10-minute warning sign during the event.“Otherwise I would have gone faster,” he told the AP. “I would have posted a better time. I’m now waiting for a rival.”Speaking to Eurosport, he elaborated on his feelings about the win.“I am not here to be champion. I am here to prove that at 105 years old you can still ride a bike,” he said.As if his record-breaking race weren’t magnificent in its own right, Marchand hasn’t even been cycling constantly his whole life. Having worked as a firefighter, a truck driver and a lumberjack, he only took up cycling again when he was 68 years old. Since then, he’s managed feats like riding from Moscow to Paris (about 1,800 miles by car).Marchand’s coach and friend Gerard Mistler told the AP that the cyclist can attribute his athleticism to eating fruits and vegetables, not smoking, drinking wine in moderation, exercising daily and going to bed at 9 p.m.Oh, and reading.“Reading a lot keeps his mind alert,” Mistler said. “He does not watch much TV, apart from the Tour de France stages.”Well, excuse us. We’ll just be readjusting our 2017 resolutions while we still can."

Trump talks to members of the media after a meeting with military leadership at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, FL on Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e8fe81b00002c006e5b7e.jpeg?cache=bWlQTxAhJK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"China’s state-run tabloid the Global Times on Thursday warned President-Elect Donald Trump that his angry tweets targeting the country over trade had given Beijing officials plenty of time to prepare.“There are flowers around the gate of China’s Ministry of Commerce, but there are also big sticks hidden inside the door ― they both await Americans,” the paper said.The threat was made in response to Trump’s selection of Robert Lighthizer, a vocal critic of Chinese trade practices, as U.S. trade representative. The editorial was published on the same day that China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that the two countries should develop ties in the proper direction, amid unease in Beijing over Trump’s comments on Taiwan and trade.Trump, due to take office on Jan. 20, has angered China by speaking by telephone to Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, casting doubt on the incoming administration’s commitment to only recognising the Beijing government, and not Taiwan, under a “one China” policy.Trump has left open the possibility of meeting Tsai if she visits the United States after he is sworn in. He also has rattled Beijing by appointing people in his administration who are critical of China’s trade practices.Wang told Kerry ties were at an “important stage” and that cooperative achievements were “not easy to come by”.“Both sides should take great care to jointly safeguard and ensure the proper direction of development in bilateral relations,” Wang said in a telephone call with Kerry, according to a statement on his ministry’s website.The ministry cited Kerry as saying maintaining the “one China” policy was the position of both of the main U.S. parties, the Democrats and Trump’s Republicans.China is deeply suspicious of Tsai, and thinks she wants to push for the formal independence of Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing regards as a renegade province ineligible for state-to-state relations.The United States, which switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, has acknowledged the Chinese position that there is only “one China” and that Taiwan is part of it.China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s Communist forces won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalists fled to the island.Tsai will transit through Houston and San Francisco during a visit this month to allies in Latin America, a stopover China has called on the United States to block.Chinese policymakers are also wary of Trump’s protectionist stance on trade, and he has promised a hard line on China, threatening to raise tariffs on its exports to the United States.The Xinhua state news agency, which usually reflects government thinking, this week chided Trump for his proclivity for criticising China on Twitter, saying the social media platform “should not become a foreign policy tool”.The Global Times routinely prints provocative, hawkish editorials that other state-run Chinese media are typically too restrained to publish. The tabloid has increasingly taken aim at Trump in the last year, going as far as to call him “as ignorant as a child in terms of foreign policy” in an op-ed last month."

Those being transferred make up the bulk of the 23 prisoners declared in parole-style hearings to be safe for repatriation or resettlement in other countries.Trump on Tuesday signaled his view that all of those held at Guantanamo should remain, despite lengthy inter-agency reviews that deemed many of them eligible to leave.“There should be no further releases from Gitmo,” he tweeted. “These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield.”The White House dismissed Trump’s objections and said transfers from Guantanamo, opened by former President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, would continue until Trump takes office.“We expect that there will be more transfers,” said White House spokeswoman Emily Horne. “We do not comment on the progress of individual detainee transfers until they are completed.”The two U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, were unable to provide the nationalities of the prisoners who were headed to Saudi Arabia. Last April, the desert kingdom - one of the top U.S. allies in the region - accepted nine Yemenis under a long-negotiated deal between Washington and Riyadh.Of the 59 prisoners remaining at Guantanamo before the latest transfer, 10 face charges in military commissions, including alleged plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks, while about two dozen have not been charged but have been deemed too dangerous to release.Obama, who inherited 242 detainees at Guantanamo Bay when he took office in 2009 and has called it a “recruiting tool” for terrorists, has slowly whittled the number downward.Under Bush, the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture.Obama’s efforts to close the prison have been blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress, which has barred him from moving any prisoners to the U.S. mainland. Foot-dragging by Pentagon officials has also been blamed for slowing transfers.Administration officials have also made clear that Obama has no intention of resorting to the legally risky option of using executive action to close the prison before leaving office."

That’s equivalent to about 1,000 major solar power plants, according to experts’ estimates.The spending comes as the cost of building large-scale solar plants has dropped by as much as 40 percent since 2010. China became the world’s top solar generator last year.“The government may exceed these targets because there are more investment opportunities in the sector as costs go down,” said Steven Han, renewable analyst with securities firm Shenyin Wanguo.Some 700 billion yuan will go towards wind farms, 500 billion to hydro power with tidal and geothermal getting the rest, the NDRC said.The NEA’s job creation forecast differs from the NDRC’s in December that said it expected an additional 3 million jobs, bringing the total in the sector to 13 million by 2020.Concerns about the social and economic costs of China’s air pollution have increased as the northern parts of the country, including the capital Beijing, have battled a weeks-long bout of hazardous smog.Illustrating the enormity of the challenge, the NEA repeated on Thursday that renewables will still only account for just 15 percent of overall energy consumption by 2020, equivalent to 580 million tonnes of coal.More than half of the nation’s installed power capacity will still be fueled by coal over the same period."

He said the measure protected the privacy and safety of Texans.“It is the right thing to do,” Patrick told a news conference along with its sponsor, Lois Kolkhorst. The event was punctuated by the howls of protesters nearby in the Capitol building chanting: “Shame, shame, shame.”Similar bills have been filed for several other state legislatures this year that socially conservative backers say offer common-sense protections against sexual predators. Critics say the laws are designed to infringe on the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.A major industry group, the Texas Association of Business, said a study it helped conduct showed such legislation in Texas could result in economic losses ranging from $964 million to $8.5 billion for the state.A law enacted by North Carolina in March 2016 to restrict bathroom access for transgender people - the first such state measure - prompted a federal civil rights lawsuit and has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the state.Kolkhorst said the Texas bill would prohibit any local government from adopting an ordinance that prevents a business from making its own policy on access to places such as bathrooms and locker rooms.Local governments are also forbidden from considering those policies when awarding a contract, she said.Chick Smith, chief executive of LGBT rights group Equality Texas, said the legislation appeared to be unenforceable and targeted a marginalized group of people.“If this legislature is interested in dealing with predatory behavior, then the target of this legislation needs to be sexual predators. Transgender people are not the predators. Transgender people are more likely to be the victims,” he said in an interview.At the end of last year, four states had legislation limiting transgender bathroom rights that were set to be on the agenda when lawmakers convened in 2017.Similar legislation was filed this week in Virginia and Kentucky.(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney)"

The 57-year-old veteran officer, who has not been identified, shot the man multiple times Monday morning after a “verbal altercation,” Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at a press conference Monday. Media reports have identified the victim as 38-year-old Jose Nieves.The officer, who was assigned to the transit detail, will continue to be paid while the investigation proceeds, according to the Chicago Tribune. Stripping his police powers is the “strongest step a department can take” during an open investigation, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told the paper.Johnson said the officer was visiting an acquaintance near the shooting scene and knew Nieves from a previous dispute. Nieves’ death was ruled a homicide. The only weapon recovered after the shooting belonged to the officer, Johnson said. “I have a lot more questions than I do answers,” Johnson said. “The facts are preliminary at this time.” Nieves’ sister, Angelica Nieves, told WGN her brother had repeatedly called 911 about the officer. She claimed the dispute started with the officer harassing her brother’s girlfriend.“It was not justified. It wasn’t justified. It was not,” Angel Nieves, the victim’s father, told the news station. Chicago’s Independent Police Review Authority, which handles misconduct allegations, is conducting a separate investigation. A vigil will be held for Nieves Saturday. On Twitter, his death has been held up as an example of a broken policing system that leads to excessive violence and disproportionately affects people of color. Chicago police have come under scrutiny in several recent high-profile police shootings.Johnson took over as police superintendent last year after Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired his predecessor amid outrage over the city’s handling of the 2014 police killing of Laquan McDonald, 17. An officer shot the teen more than a dozen times as he walked away, but police dashcam footage that contradicted police claims that McDonald lunged at officers with a knife was kept secret for more than a year.The backlash also led to the creation of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which will replace the Independent Police Review Authority this year as part of the city’s efforts to improve police oversight and accountability.

There is an answer, however, as to how to react to such visceral violence: love.That’s what Love Is Love, a new comic anthology released Dec. 28 and put together by indie comic publisher IDW in collaboration with DC Comics, sets out to remind readers.The anthology, an ambitious undertaking that includes more than 300 writers and illustrators, is both a tribute to the victims of last year’s Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida ― the worst mass shooting in U.S. history ― and a therapeutic outlet for those living in its aftermath.The 144-page comic offers vignettes ranging from personal essays and poems sharing grief, to more lighthearted strips reminding readers that being in the LGBTQ community is something worth celebrating. In one comic, writer Teddy Tenebaum makes the case that LGBTQ love is in fact different from straight love ― not because it’s less than it ― but because despite hatred that the LGBTQ community faces, their love endures. It’s “super-love.” Mark Andreyko, who came up with the initial idea for Love Is Love, said his first instinct after the shooting was to make a comic.“My body just clenched and I was ill,” Andreyko told The Guardian last September. “I knew I had to do something, anything.”The author said most of the writers and artists he reached out to said yes before he could finish asking.“It has been profoundly moving to see such a diverse, and often really busy, group take the time to be a part of this,” he told the publication.Superheroes must also find a way to cope with the tragedy in Love Is Love. In a comic written by Marc Guggenheim, Batman goes to investigate the scene of the shooting, searching for answers. He finds none.In another, written by Taran Killam, Deathstroke reacts to the news by doing away with his guns. The anthology touches on subjects including gun control, acceptance of different lifestyles, and the enduring love that lets humans keep going in the face of unspeakable tragedy. The inside front cover of the anthology is perhaps the most touching page of all ― it gives the names and ages of all 49 victims who lost their lives that night. All proceeds will go to Equality Florida, an advocacy group for Florida’s LGBTQ community. You can pick up a copy at your local comic book store for $9.99."

The women ― whose names and ranks aren’t being released ― will join the 1st Battalion, 8th Marines in North Carolina, Corps spokesman Capt. Philip Kulczewski told The Huffington Post. They’ll be reporting for duty as a rifleman, machine gunner and mortar Marine. They spent years participating in an experiment for the Corps, which had been conducting studies and physical tests to determine if gender integration was feasible in ground combat units. The Pentagon announced in late 2015 that it would lift gender restrictions on all military service.And now these women are pioneers in the most male-dominated of all military services.“This serves as a testimony to the Marine Corps’ goal of leveraging every opportunity to optimize individual performance, talent and skills to maximize our warfighting capabilities,” Kulczewski said. “As we continue to move forward, we remain steadfast in our commitment to ensure that the men and women who earn the title ‘Marine’ will be ready, and will provide America with an elite crisis-response force that is ready to fight and win.”And the number of women in infantry is set to increase, as a crew of new female recruits is preparing to take positions that previously wouldn’t have been available to them. Thirty-one Marines have signed enlistment contracts for newly accessible combat occupational specialties, Military.com reports. Preparing new standards and changing training procedures to account for women joining the infantry ranks makes the Marine Corps better overall, Kulczewski said.The milestone was met with some pushback from top brass. Months before the Pentagon made its integration announcement, the Marine Corps released a study indicating that one test had shown gender-integrated infantry units to shoot less accurately and perform more slowly than all-male units, Military.com reported at the time. Critics lashed out at the study’s methodology, which often paired up men and women who had different training backgrounds and therefore lacked the cohesion that any unit can expect to develop over time.Women are blasting stereotypes and assuming ground combat roles all over the Armed Forces. In April, U.S. Army Capt. Kristen Griest became the branch’s first female infantry officer, after becoming the first female to complete Army Ranger school. "

This includes “pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.” (Pick-up and drop-off locations don’t use exact addresses and are reported at the neighborhood level, e.g. “Upper East Side” or “Astoria.”)Ostensibly, the city uses this information to audit drivers’ self-reported working hours, which are restricted on a daily and weekly basis to keep fatigued, accident-prone drivers off the road.As the new kids on the block street, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft haven’t had to provide that data to the TLC. But now that the companies are an established part of NYC transit, the city wants access to riders’ destinations. (Uber currently only provides pick-up location and time.)Uber says that since, in theory, this is primarily an argument about driving hours and fatigue, it offered to provide the city with detailed logs about its drivers’ hours, but was rebuffed. The TLC persisted, claiming it needs passenger drop-off information for other public benefits like traffic planning and analysis, and to identify drivers who break the law by running red lights, speeding and committing other infractions.That’s not good enough for Uber, which says it’s eager to protect the privacy of its users and doesn’t trust the TLC to safeguard the information. (There’s a pretty good precedent for their concern.)“We have an obligation to protect our riders’ data, especially in an age when information collected by government agencies like the TLC can be hacked, shared, misused or otherwise made public,” Uber told The Huffington Post in a statement. That’s all well and good, but it’s worth noting Uber doesn’t exactly have a spotless record either when it comes to location data collection ― or properly securing that data.After an update to its app in late November of last year, Uber began tracking riders’ specific locations for a full five minutes after their ride ends, even if the app is closed.The company says the update helps “to improve pickups, drop-offs, customer service, and to enhance safety,” but it nevertheless caused sharp concern among privacy advocates.

83,PARENTS,Well-Off White Men Are 3 Times More Likely Than Women To Get Job Interviews,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-motherhood-penalty_us_586d69fae4b0c4be0af2c02c,A new study of law firm hiring offers clear evidence of  privilege.,2017-01-05,The researchers signaled class on resumes by listing certain athletic accomplishments and extracurricular activities.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e6e341b00002c006e5ada.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Cabot and Julia Cabot seem like the kind of law school students high-paying law firms like to recruit.Their resumes and work experience are nearly identical. Both of them attend respected institutions and have worked their way to the top 1 percent of their classes. Their schools aren’t among the very top-tier institutions where the big firms do most of their recruiting ― Harvard, Yale, et al. ― but they’re still well-regarded.What’s more, James and Julia clearly come from economically advantaged backgrounds, the kind that firms admit make candidates a strong “cultural fit.” On their resumes, James and Julia each note their interest in classical music and polo. They both mention their experience on their college sailing teams. When people talk about “elites,” they’re talking about people like James and Julia Cabot.Yet when law firms looked at their resumes ― which, again, were totally the same but for their gender ― recruiters were three times more likely to call James in for an interview, according to a study first published last year in American Sociological Review and recently written up in Harvard Business Review.In a follow-up survey and interviews, the researchers learned that lawyers discounted Julia Cabot’s credentials ― indeed, the credentials of any economically advantaged woman ― because of a belief that she would eventually leave the workforce to become a stay-at-home mom.In other words, for some women, there’s a “motherhood penalty” before they’re even thinking about becoming a mother. This old-fashioned notion exists even though a majority of mothers are now in the workforce. And the stereotype, according to this study, clings mainly to economically advantaged women.As you may have already guessed, James and Julia Cabot aren’t real people. They were invented for the purposes of the above study. And while it may be hard to conjure much sympathy for the polo-playing Julias of the world, this kind of stereotyping is likely part of the reason why, despite achieving relative equality in education, women have largely failed to reach the uppermost ranks of power in the business world.“This is a key mechanism that is keeping women out of high-paying occupations,” Lauren Rivera, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post. Firms are screening out high-performing women not because of something they’ve done or haven’t done, but because of the firms’ own speculation about what they might someday do. The reasons for doing this “are completely in the heads of organizations,” Rivera said.It’s already well-known that women’s careers and incomes suffer when they become moms. Female employees who become mothers see their salaries decline by 4 percent, according to one survey. Men who become fathers, by contrast, see their salaries rise by 6 percent. But there’s less hard evidence of a pre-motherhood penalty. Indeed, the wage gap between women and men is at its smallest when women are first out of college and haven’t yet married or had children.Yet any woman who’s thought twice about wearing a wedding ring to a job interview would probably not be shocked to learn a pre-motherhood penalty exists.Even at progressive companies that say they value hiring and promoting women, the default assumption is still that a woman will want to downshift her career once she becomes a mother, if she can afford it. Women make up a majority of law school students in the United States, but only around 20 percent of law firm partners. Most firms are quick to speak of the need to hire and retain more women, to diversify. The researchers devised a second pair of candidates to go along with the Cabots ― James Clark and Julia Clark, who both hailed from less well-off families. Or at least, that’s the impression their resumes, which mention their interests in country music, pickup soccer and track and field, were calculated to give off.The researchers didn’t choose these characteristics because of any data that shows law firms tend to hire expert sailors or discriminate against country music fans. They were simply trying to signal that a person did or didn’t come from money. They even conducted an online survey to make sure their choices sent the right message. Polo signaled fancy elite rich kid; pickup soccer, not so much.It’s standard practice to include extracurriculars and outside interests in law school applications. You might not even get considered for a job without including such things. The point of the study was to drill down and see what effect social class has on hiring at high-end firms. Rivera, who has written a book on how elite investment banks and consulting and law firms favor entry-level workers from upper-class backgrounds, wanted to do more strictly quantitative work on this issue ― to try and isolate class as a factor in the hiring process.“It was hard to know from interviews if employers were truly discriminating or just picking the best and brightest,” she said.A lot of the research on class assumes that education is a great equalizer ― that once you’ve got a degree from a top school, your background doesn’t matter that much to potential employers.But “it does matter,” Rivera said. “It matters quite a bit.”The study doesn’t even get into the ways that race and ethnicity intersect with class in employers’ minds. The resumes in this study were presumed to be from white candidates. Black, Hispanic and Asian women and men face different sets of stereotypes and biases, and Rivera wants to do further research there.For the study, the resumes from James and Julia Cabot and James and Julia Clark were sent to 316 offices of 147 leading law firms around the U.S. The goal was to apply for summer associate positions ― internships at law firms that pay around $3,000 a week and typically lead to full-time job offers once the candidate finishes school. Those entry-level positions pay a stunning $150,000 a year (not counting the bonus) and offer a fast track to the 1 percent.The researchers expected that the upper-class candidates would get called back at higher rates than the candidates whose personal info telegraphed “lower-to-middle-class.”That’s not exactly what happened.James Cabot, the upper-class man, was offered an interview at 16.25 percent of the firms, a rate that far outstripped everyone else. Polo-playing Julia Cabot saw a 3.8 percent callback rate, while country music-loving Julia Clark got a 6.3 percent callback rate. The lower-class male candidate, James Clark, only got a 1.3 percent callback rate. The researchers say the differences between the women and the lower-class man were not statistically significant.It’s worth noting, Rivera said, that law firm recruiters skew male and tend to be a little older ― factors that may have had some bearing here. Still, she was surprised to find class offered no advantage to women.In a follow-up survey, Rivera and her colleagues asked 200 lawyers around the country to look at the four mocked-up resumes and give their feedback. In that survey, the upper-class man was again viewed as the most favorable candidate.The authors then personally interviewed 20 lawyers for their thoughts on the resumes. Those interviews yielded a gold mine of various stereotypes about white men and women of different economic standings.There was concern that neither James nor Julia Clark would fit in at a high-end law firm. Some of the lawyers even suggested the lower-class candidates would be better suited to public interest law. James and Julia Cabot, with their privileged backgrounds, were seen as a good fit for a law firm. “If you look at the interests, it’s classic cultural capital,” one lawyer told the researchers.However, the lawyers questioned Julia’s commitment, wondering if she “really wanted to be a lawyer,” the researchers write in their paper. Some declared she was “biding her time” until she could become a “stay-at-home mom.”James Cabot, on the other hand, was seen as a good long-term bet.“An upper-class man is always going to be working,” a lawyer named Betsy said. “He’s always gonna stay in the workforce, and chances are he’s well connected, and that might be a good person to have at your firm.”The important thing to note here, Rivera said, is that men and women both tend to leave big law firms after their first three or four years working there. Firms hire far more associates than they could ever hope to bring on as partners. In other words, even if a firm hired Julia Cabot and Julia Clark and they both left after a couple years, it wouldn’t actually make much difference to the firm.“[Firms] expect most people to leave,” Rivera said. “It’s a pyramid organization. A tournament predicated on the fact that lots of people are going to leave.”Interestingly, the gender bias wasn’t an issue for Julia Clark. Coming from a less advantaged background, she was viewed as “hungry” for work. She would have “mouths to feed” and “law school debt to pay,” the lawyers told the researchers.Perhaps this is a sign that hiring managers can overcome some gender stereotypes.

84,PARENTS,Well-Off White Men Are 3 Times More Likely Than Women To Get Job Interviews,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-motherhood-penalty_us_586d69fae4b0c4be0af2c02c,A new study of law firm hiring offers clear evidence of  privilege.,2017-01-05,The higher-class man was by far the preferred candidate of law firm recruiters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e6e881700002600928456.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Cabot and Julia Cabot seem like the kind of law school students high-paying law firms like to recruit.Their resumes and work experience are nearly identical. Both of them attend respected institutions and have worked their way to the top 1 percent of their classes. Their schools aren’t among the very top-tier institutions where the big firms do most of their recruiting ― Harvard, Yale, et al. ― but they’re still well-regarded.What’s more, James and Julia clearly come from economically advantaged backgrounds, the kind that firms admit make candidates a strong “cultural fit.” On their resumes, James and Julia each note their interest in classical music and polo. They both mention their experience on their college sailing teams. When people talk about “elites,” they’re talking about people like James and Julia Cabot.Yet when law firms looked at their resumes ― which, again, were totally the same but for their gender ― recruiters were three times more likely to call James in for an interview, according to a study first published last year in American Sociological Review and recently written up in Harvard Business Review.In a follow-up survey and interviews, the researchers learned that lawyers discounted Julia Cabot’s credentials ― indeed, the credentials of any economically advantaged woman ― because of a belief that she would eventually leave the workforce to become a stay-at-home mom.In other words, for some women, there’s a “motherhood penalty” before they’re even thinking about becoming a mother. This old-fashioned notion exists even though a majority of mothers are now in the workforce. And the stereotype, according to this study, clings mainly to economically advantaged women.As you may have already guessed, James and Julia Cabot aren’t real people. They were invented for the purposes of the above study. And while it may be hard to conjure much sympathy for the polo-playing Julias of the world, this kind of stereotyping is likely part of the reason why, despite achieving relative equality in education, women have largely failed to reach the uppermost ranks of power in the business world.“This is a key mechanism that is keeping women out of high-paying occupations,” Lauren Rivera, a professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post. Firms are screening out high-performing women not because of something they’ve done or haven’t done, but because of the firms’ own speculation about what they might someday do. The reasons for doing this “are completely in the heads of organizations,” Rivera said.It’s already well-known that women’s careers and incomes suffer when they become moms. Female employees who become mothers see their salaries decline by 4 percent, according to one survey. Men who become fathers, by contrast, see their salaries rise by 6 percent. But there’s less hard evidence of a pre-motherhood penalty. Indeed, the wage gap between women and men is at its smallest when women are first out of college and haven’t yet married or had children.Yet any woman who’s thought twice about wearing a wedding ring to a job interview would probably not be shocked to learn a pre-motherhood penalty exists.Even at progressive companies that say they value hiring and promoting women, the default assumption is still that a woman will want to downshift her career once she becomes a mother, if she can afford it. Women make up a majority of law school students in the United States, but only around 20 percent of law firm partners. Most firms are quick to speak of the need to hire and retain more women, to diversify. The researchers devised a second pair of candidates to go along with the Cabots ― James Clark and Julia Clark, who both hailed from less well-off families. Or at least, that’s the impression their resumes, which mention their interests in country music, pickup soccer and track and field, were calculated to give off.The researchers didn’t choose these characteristics because of any data that shows law firms tend to hire expert sailors or discriminate against country music fans. They were simply trying to signal that a person did or didn’t come from money. They even conducted an online survey to make sure their choices sent the right message. Polo signaled fancy elite rich kid; pickup soccer, not so much.It’s standard practice to include extracurriculars and outside interests in law school applications. You might not even get considered for a job without including such things. The point of the study was to drill down and see what effect social class has on hiring at high-end firms. Rivera, who has written a book on how elite investment banks and consulting and law firms favor entry-level workers from upper-class backgrounds, wanted to do more strictly quantitative work on this issue ― to try and isolate class as a factor in the hiring process.“It was hard to know from interviews if employers were truly discriminating or just picking the best and brightest,” she said.A lot of the research on class assumes that education is a great equalizer ― that once you’ve got a degree from a top school, your background doesn’t matter that much to potential employers.But “it does matter,” Rivera said. “It matters quite a bit.”The study doesn’t even get into the ways that race and ethnicity intersect with class in employers’ minds. The resumes in this study were presumed to be from white candidates. Black, Hispanic and Asian women and men face different sets of stereotypes and biases, and Rivera wants to do further research there.For the study, the resumes from James and Julia Cabot and James and Julia Clark were sent to 316 offices of 147 leading law firms around the U.S. The goal was to apply for summer associate positions ― internships at law firms that pay around $3,000 a week and typically lead to full-time job offers once the candidate finishes school. Those entry-level positions pay a stunning $150,000 a year (not counting the bonus) and offer a fast track to the 1 percent.The researchers expected that the upper-class candidates would get called back at higher rates than the candidates whose personal info telegraphed “lower-to-middle-class.”That’s not exactly what happened.James Cabot, the upper-class man, was offered an interview at 16.25 percent of the firms, a rate that far outstripped everyone else. Polo-playing Julia Cabot saw a 3.8 percent callback rate, while country music-loving Julia Clark got a 6.3 percent callback rate. The lower-class male candidate, James Clark, only got a 1.3 percent callback rate. The researchers say the differences between the women and the lower-class man were not statistically significant.It’s worth noting, Rivera said, that law firm recruiters skew male and tend to be a little older ― factors that may have had some bearing here. Still, she was surprised to find class offered no advantage to women.In a follow-up survey, Rivera and her colleagues asked 200 lawyers around the country to look at the four mocked-up resumes and give their feedback. In that survey, the upper-class man was again viewed as the most favorable candidate.The authors then personally interviewed 20 lawyers for their thoughts on the resumes. Those interviews yielded a gold mine of various stereotypes about white men and women of different economic standings.There was concern that neither James nor Julia Clark would fit in at a high-end law firm. Some of the lawyers even suggested the lower-class candidates would be better suited to public interest law. James and Julia Cabot, with their privileged backgrounds, were seen as a good fit for a law firm. “If you look at the interests, it’s classic cultural capital,” one lawyer told the researchers.However, the lawyers questioned Julia’s commitment, wondering if she “really wanted to be a lawyer,” the researchers write in their paper. Some declared she was “biding her time” until she could become a “stay-at-home mom.”James Cabot, on the other hand, was seen as a good long-term bet.“An upper-class man is always going to be working,” a lawyer named Betsy said. “He’s always gonna stay in the workforce, and chances are he’s well connected, and that might be a good person to have at your firm.”The important thing to note here, Rivera said, is that men and women both tend to leave big law firms after their first three or four years working there. Firms hire far more associates than they could ever hope to bring on as partners. In other words, even if a firm hired Julia Cabot and Julia Clark and they both left after a couple years, it wouldn’t actually make much difference to the firm.“[Firms] expect most people to leave,” Rivera said. “It’s a pyramid organization. A tournament predicated on the fact that lots of people are going to leave.”Interestingly, the gender bias wasn’t an issue for Julia Clark. Coming from a less advantaged background, she was viewed as “hungry” for work. She would have “mouths to feed” and “law school debt to pay,” the lawyers told the researchers.Perhaps this is a sign that hiring managers can overcome some gender stereotypes. But it’s probably best not to wait around for that day.Rivera says if we want to avoid this kind of stereotyping, law firms should stop asking candidates to put extracurriculars and interests on their resumes.The idea is that you can use the information to judge a person’s leadership, she said. But “it is strange that these things carry so much weight.”"

Almost 4.3 million people have opted to follow her updates, many of which are not true.Many of Palin’s updates are personal in nature ― like when she shares videos of her son Trig or blogs written by her daughter Bristol ― or feature inspirational stories. But Palin, a former contributor to Fox News, also regularly has misleading or fake posts about news and politics on her Facebook page. On Wednesday, Palin’s page featured a story from the conservative website Breitbart News that claimed President Barack Obama awarded himself a Distinguished Public Service medal from the Department of Defense. That is not true ― Defense Secretary Ash Carter gave the medal to the president.Former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have previously received the medal, which is described as “the highest honorary award presented by the Secretary of Defense to non-career Federal employees, private citizens, and foreign nationals.” Recipients of the medal are nominated by heads of the components of the Office of Secretary of Defense, along with secretaries of military departments. The defense secretary makes the final decision.Palin’s page featured a story on Dec. 11 from the website Young Conservatives about “voter fraud” in Michigan. But the so-called voter fraud was actually a problem with decades-old voting machines that failed to properly operate on Election Day, The Detroit News reported. Palin’s page has twice linked to a Young Conservatives story with a headline claiming Obama “imposed rules to take $3,000 from every U.S. citizen.” He did not. The story cites Conservative Tribune’s report, which reads as follows:Even thought [sic] President Barack Obama only has less than two months left in office, he hasn’t stopped his liberal agenda, and he hasn’t learned that the American people are tired of regulations.American Action Forum reported that America has just passed an important milestone — the 10-year regulatory burden on Americans has now passed $1 trillion.New Environmental Protection Agency regulations on trucks were what finally pushed the regulation costs over $1 trillion.Put another way, each American now will have to fork over a one-time payment of $3,080 for these new regulations, or an annual cost of about $540. Palin’s page also often features commentary on the media, including a post from Jan. 4 with a link to Young Conservatives’ stories on the most “under-reported stories of 2016.” That list includes stories of “the disappearing women,” a phrase they use to refer to the women who accused President-elect Donald Trump of sexual misconduct and were silenced after he repeatedly denied their claims and accused them of lying.Palin’s page has addressed the problem of “fake news” multiple times, and questioned Fox News in a post last month. The description of Palin’s Facebook page features information on her political action committee, Sarah PAC, so it’s likely someone from that group is actually posting stories to the page. Sarah PAC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

91,POLITICS,The GOP War With The Federal Workforce Will Hurt Black Workers The Most,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-gop-war-with-the-federal-workforce-will-hurt-black-workers-the-most_us_586ebd91e4b043ad97e29974,African Americans are disproportionately employed in federal jobs.,2017-01-05,President-elect Donald Trump and the new Republican-controlled Congress have major plans for reforming the federal workforce.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ec0e21b00002b006e5c57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump and the new GOP Congress are gearing up for battle with federal employees and their unions. With control of both the legislative and executive branches, Republicans want to institute a hiring freeze in the federal government, bring a halt to standardized raises, and make it easier to get rid of underperformers ― all with the stated purpose of eliminating waste and bureaucracy. When it comes to sticking it to the federal workforce, GOP lawmakers are leaving no tools in the shed. As the Washington Post reported Thursday, members of Congress even want to breathe new life into an ancient procedural rule that would allow them to target individual federal workers for salary cuts ― down to as little as $1 a year. Trump adviser New Gingrich has urged the president-elect to wage a “straight-out war” with the civil service.If Trump and his fellow Republicans achieve all these austerity goals, there’s one group that will pay a higher price for it than others: black workers.That’s because the federal government disproportionately employs African-Americans. In fiscal year 2014, 18.1 percent of federal employees ― or nearly one in every five ― were black, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. That’s a significantly higher rate than in the civilian workforce at large, where 10.4 percent of workers were black during the same period. Of that 18.1 percent of federal employees who were black, the majority of them ― 10.6 percent of the whole ― were women. As OPM’s data shows, the share of workers who are black women is roughly twice as high in the federal workforce as it is among the greater civilian workforce. So when cuts come down, black workers ― and black women in particular ― bear a higher cost simply because of the government’s workforce demographics. The same holds true of government shutdowns forced by Congress, when federal employees are forced to go without their paychecks until lawmakers can hash out a spending deal. And the same is true of austerity in state and local government, as well as cutbacks in the U.S. Postal Service, where around 20 percent of workers are black. Federal government work has long provided a stepping stone to the middle class for many black families. That’s partly due to the fact that the federal government led the private sector in curbing hiring discrimination, after Franklin Roosevelt outlawed it through executive order. Federal agencies have had minority recruitment programs for years. The feds have nonetheless struggled to improve employment among Hispanics, whose share of jobs still lags behind Hispanics in the civilian workforce as a whole."

Instead, a nightclub attack rang in 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586e4c0f1500003006917616.jpeg?cache=jTXdArcuDt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The routine is now eerily familiar for Turkish expats around the world. It starts with a quiet ping from their smartphone’s WhatsApp messaging app late at night. A sad face emoji appears as the first line of the chat. Their hands shake as they try to open and read the rest of the message. When they do, a devastating screenshot, usually captured from CNN Turk or some other news channel, appears and announces yet another terrorist act in Turkey. The attack on New Year’s Eve at one of Istanbul’s most popular nightclubs patronized by Turks and foreigners alike left at least 39 people dead and 69 wounded.It is fast becoming branded as “Turkey’s Bataclan,” named after the nightclub attacked in Paris in November 2015. My home in Turkey is five minutes from Reina. I used to walk by it every day.The attack came as many Turks abroad ― myself included ― were preparing to sit down to dinner in their adopted countries and as Turks at home had already gone to bed after New Year’s Eve festivities. Both groups desperately wished for a better 2017 for their home country.They were met with the terrible news and once again, their hopes for normalcy dashed.Only this time, they may have sensed something unusual. The reaction on the ground from all sides was inclusive and not divisive, giving them at least some reprieve in the face of this senseless carnage. The most significant post-attack statement for secular Turks, as well as those lucky survivors at Reina nightclub that evening, their families, and many others who could potentially have been celebrating there on any night, came from a rather unexpected character whom nobody associates with the liberal profile frequenting venues like Reina.Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s soft-spoken top cleric and president of Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı, or the Religious Affairs Directorate, which is the state body in charge of religious administration, took it upon himself to reassure everyone, liberals and conservatives alike, that, “there is no difference whether this barbarous action would be done in a bazaar or a place of worship or in an entertainment place.” The Religious Affairs Directorate isn’t normally the official source to go to after a terrorist attack. But in this case, before Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım and even before President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made a statement, Görmez identified that, “the only nuance” is that this time, the attack “aims to divide the nation and confront people from different lifestyles by inciting them.” Investigations are still under way. However, compared to past attacks, most of which were aimed at security personnel or tourist spots, the attack on Reina seems to target a secular side of Islam. It is seen by many in Turkey as a confrontation of the democratic Islam this country is famous for succeeding at. According to reports, victims came from 14 different nationalities. Except a few, all foreigners who died in the attack are believed to be Muslims from countries such as Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, each of which celebrate the new year in their own ways and not necessarily following a materialistic tradition. Even the pope showed sympathy for the victims and solidarity with the survivors in his first address of the new year in Rome.There is no doubt the emphasis in Görmez’s sentence is on “different lifestyles.” That’s what makes this attack ― one in so many others in my home country ― stand out. Whatever its message may be, secularists fear that what happened that night was additionally an attack on their own way of living. Which is why Görmez’s kind of tolerant approach came both as a surprise and a relief, considering the Religious Affairs Directorate’s Friday sermon just one day before the attack, dissuading the public from “non-Muslim” actions like excessive New Year’s Eve celebrations, which the directorate declared “unlawful.”Turkey is a wonderfully diverse country with people on a varying scale of piousness, living side by side. It’s the country where Sinem Uyanık, a young, modern club-goer and survivor of the Reina attack with a completely different lifestyle from a conservative female in headscarf, chose the same last prayers, reportedly reciting Allah’s and the Prophet Muhammad’s name, believing that she would certainly die that night. It’s the country where many LGBTQ members, who are among the most marginalized groups in Turkish society, choose to fast during Ramadan like their religious friends. It’s also the country where literally next door to Reina, the attacked nightclub, stands Huqqa, an equally chic café. Dubbed the “Reina for the conservatives,” it serves its namesake shisha or hookah, non-alcoholic drinks and a halal menu. Living in Bebek-Ortaköy area for a long time, I have always liked the vibe of Huqqa combining the Bosphorus view with a conservative menu since I don’t drink. It is against this backdrop that Görmez’s comments are much needed to unite an increasingly divided nation where the power struggle between Islamists, the secularist army and the elites is not new but exacerbated. Turkey has long been suffering from the toxic side effects of increased polarization between secularists and conservatives. So much so that they even have a term for it: ötekileştirme, or “otherization,” meaning intolerance toward the opposite side and labeling it as the other. There have been serious provocations by both conservatives and secularists especially during the Gezi protests of 2013. Secularists have always thought of the conservatives as the backward and the uneducated, who are forever trying to scrap Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s modernization efforts since the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923. In a statement delivered Wednesday to a group of muhtars or village heads, that represent the heart of Turkey, President Erdoğan pointed out what he saw as a double standard, and urged people to compare the Reina attack in cosmopolitan Istanbul to those like the bombing of a wedding in Gaziantep in Southeast Anatolia this past summer: “Would the same reactions be shown if the attacker committed this act not there that night, but the next day at a marketplace?” he asked. He also added, “In Turkey, nobody’s lifestyle is systematically under threat, we would never allow this. … Just as it is wrong to not be able to tolerate an imam’s call to prayer, it is also wrong to pressure someone who doesn’t do namaz [praying five times a day].” Based on this statement and his disapproval in the past of the discrimination against girls who were denied entry to schools because of their headscarves, secularists want President Erdoğan not to tolerate the increase of violent attempts by the Islamist vigilantes who frequently storm Western art and music events in big cities on the grounds that alcohol is being consumed. Fueled by the conservative media, marginal religious chauvinism was again on the rise in the run-up to New Year’s Eve.Meanwhile, the killer of so many innocent people in Reina that night is still on the loose. My friends who are planning to meet these days are looking for a place that the killer won’t think to find them, one where they can take shelter if he strikes again. Putting aside these anxieties, which is pretty much the only way millions of people in Turkey can function at the moment, there is one bitter truth that the Reina attack has revealed. One friend, an IT specialist, put it in writing beautifully in this post on her LinkedIn account: “My friends overseas used to ask me if I was OK after explosions in Turkey and yet I am with disappointment noticing that they didn’t ask after the last three explosions/shootings…” she wrote.It hurts her a lot that her friends abroad “got used to these strange (from their point of view) and deadly explosions taking place in Istanbul.” She shudders at the thought of Istanbul becoming a war zone like the once-beautiful Beirut from where some of the casualties at Reina came from. “The opposite of life is not death but indifference between life and death,” Elie Wiesel, the late Holocaust survivor and human rights champion, once said. Perhaps for foreigners, the Reina attack hit home more than other attacks in Turkey. It resonated, because not only were victims of so many different nationalities, but it could have happened in any club anywhere in the world, and not just in a Muslim-majority country. Our foreign friends do care of course and ask us, liberals and conservatives, what this latest chaos in Turkey is all about. Most of us inside and outside Turkey are watching the events in our country with increasing alarm. Like them, we have no clue in these crazy times. Those still in Turkey take one day at a time, telling themselves that everything is eventually going to get better, much like people who whistle while walking through the graveyard at night. They are under incredible pressure from trauma after trauma created by terror attacks, a failed coup d’etat and a refugee crisis.These people need the West more than any time.They need its media to understand that Turkey, a NATO country, has suffered more deaths in the last couple of years than, “anything France, Belgium, Germany and the U.S. have had to counter,” according to Guardian, and not to concentrate only on what President Erdoğan may or may not have done against these traumas. They need Western citizens to stop pitying them and to start to actively support them and pay attention to ordinary people like them, not just when a nightclub is attacked. The same selective attitude goes for the entire Middle East: On the same day of the Reina attack, a blast in a Baghdad market killed at least 28 people and injured some 50 others. But the attack barely made major news channels.My people are afraid that the West will soon become indifferent to them and like Baghdad, Istanbul will be dismissed as a war zone. In short, they need their allies and friends in London, Berlin and elsewhere to go beyond just showing solidarity.As a non-drinker, I fully share President Erdoğan’s tolerant view that even if these people were drinking and not praying, they still shouldn’t feel unsafe. In that sense, this horrific attack, because it hit at the heart of Turkey’s religious pluralism, could at least help heal those divides between Turkey’s two sides. Only then can we end these pings and sad emojis that wake us up in the middle of the night."
