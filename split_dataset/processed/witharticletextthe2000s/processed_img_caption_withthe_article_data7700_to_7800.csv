Popes throughout the decades have used the palace and gardens as a summer residence, but Francis has turned down this opportunity since becoming pope, opting for humbler accommodations.Some 15 miles south of Rome, Castel Gandolfo is a feast for the eyes. The estate houses the Papal Palace, the Vatican Observatory, the Barberini Palace, and apartment housing for 21 employees, as well as a sprawling garden and working farm that supplies fresh produce, eggs, honey and dairy to the Vatican.Pope Francis first opened the gardens to the public in 2014, in part to help offset economic downturn in the lakeside town where the estate is located, reports the Associated Press.Now visitors can tour inside the papal apartments and even view the bed in which Pope Pius XII and Pope Paul VI died and John Paul II recovered from an assassination attempt in 1981.If you aren’t able to make it to Italy ASAP, then scroll down for a virtual tour of the gorgeous property:"
1,THE WORLDPOST,U.S. Warship Challenges China's Claims In South China Sea: Officials,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/warship-south-china-sea_us_580a375fe4b0cdea3d87071e,The guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur challenged “excessive maritime claims” near the Paracel Islands,2016-10-21,Chinese dredging vessels are purportedly seen in the waters around Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580a379a1a000074285baf5a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A U.S. navy warship sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Friday, the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, U.S. officials said.The guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur challenged “excessive maritime claims” near the Paracel Islands, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has territorial disputes with its neighbors, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The latest U.S. patrol, first reported by Reuters, is expected to anger Beijing and could further escalate tensions over the South China Sea. The destroyer sailed within waters claimed by China, close to but not within the 12-nautical-mile territorial limits of the islands, the officials said.The Pentagon said the Decatur “conducted this transit in a routine, lawful manner without ship escorts and without incident.” One official said the ship, which sailed near Triton and Woody Islands, was shadowed by three Chinese vessels and that all interactions were safe.It was the fourth challenge that the United States has made to what it considers overreaching maritime claims by China in the South China Sea in the past year, and the first since May.China, Washington’s main strategic rival in Asia, claims almost the entire South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion worth of trade passes each year. The United States has criticized Beijing’s build-up of military facilities in the sea and expressed concerns they could be used to restrict free movement.China has a runway on Woody Island, the site of the largest Chinese presence on the Paracels, and has placed surface-to-air missiles there, according to U.S. officials. Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the Paracels.In the last three U.S. freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea within the last year, U.S. warships cruised within 12 nautical miles of islands claimed by Beijing. The actions drew angry responses from China, which has accused the United States of stirring up trouble there.The latest operation comes just after the volatile president of the Philippines announced, during a visit to China, his “separation” from Washington and realignment with Beijing. The Philippines has been a key ally of the United States and a territorial rival of Beijing in the South China Sea. Rodrigo Duterte took office as Philippine president in June.Duterte’s announcement on Thursday was a significant turnaround after a tribunal in The Hague ruled that China did not have historic rights to the South China Sea in a case brought by the previous Philippine administration and strongly backed by the United States.But in Washington a person close to the matter said the latest naval operation was not timed for Duterte’s China visit this week and that planning for the patrol had long been in the works.RIVAL CLAIMSBrunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all have rival claims in the South China Sea, but Beijing’s is the largest. It argues it can do what it wants on the islands it claims as they have been Chinese since ancient times.The last U.S. freedom-of-navigation operation in May went within 12 miles of Fiery Cross reef in the Spratly Islands and China scrambled fighter jets in response.In January, a U.S. destroyer went within 12 miles of Triton Island, and China called the action “irresponsible and extremely dangerous.”U.S. officials have said the operations will continue despite Beijing’s protests, but the Obama administration has been criticized in Congress for not conducting them more regularly and robustly.Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the administration was likely to face further criticism after opting for relatively uncontroversial challenges to China in all of its freedom-of-navigation operations in the past year.“They will have essentially performed the same FONOP, meaning an objection to China’s demand for prior notification, four times in a year,” he said.“That is not only redundant, but it does nothing to put a spotlight on the other, much more worrying, restrictions China is placing on freedom of navigation.”China has been placing more serious restrictions on movement, he said, around artificial islands China has built on reefs in the Spratly chain, notably Mischief Reef.(Additional reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)"

However, big cat protection group Panthera notes that scientists estimate between 4,500 and 10,000 wild snow leopards are left.TRAFFIC’s survey found that between 221 and 450 snow leopards have been poached each year since 2008, based on the estimates of experts working in regions where the cats live. Those numbers could actually be higher, the report says, noting that it’s difficult to monitor illegal trade. Snow leopards live in 12 different countries, but more than 90 percent of the apparent poaching of the animals takes place in China, Mongolia, Pakistan, India and Tajikistan.More than half of those leopards are killed by herders who are targeting animals that have preyed on livestock like sheep and cattle.A single leopard can kill up to 20 sheep or goats when it enters a pen, Rishi Kumar Sharma, a snow leopard conservation expert with WWF, told The Huffington Post in an email.A smaller proportion of the cats — 21 percent — were killed specifically for their pelts, teeth, claws and bones, all of which can be sold through illegal channels.There is sometimes a connection between so-called “retaliatory killings” and this illegal trade, according to the report: Herders who kill leopards primarily to protect their livestock may end up selling the carcass for a profit.“The snow leopard doesn’t turn up that often in markets, what the report authors have concluded is that it’s a bit opportunistic, if a snow leopard is killed and the parts or the pelt is saleable it’s almost like getting your own back for the livestock you’ve lost,” TRAFFIC’S James Compton told the BBC.Therefore, the report suggests it’s important to take steps to decrease conflicts between leopards and humans, including introducing “predator-proof corrals” for livestock and educating herders in how to minimize encounters with leopards. The report also recommends government compensation programs to give money to herders who have lost animals to leopards, so that they would have less of a financial incentive to kill the wild animals.“We have to enable mountain communities to co-exist with snow leopards,” Sharma said.The organization also calls for stronger enforcement of anti-poaching laws and better monitoring of the illegal wildlife trade.“TRAFFIC’s analysis confirms the worrying scale of illegal killing of snow leopards,” Compton said in the release. “This urgent wake-up call provides a blueprint for [Global Snow Leopard Ecosystem Protection Program] action at national and transboundary levels to protect snow leopards from threats posed by poaching and trafficking.”But hunting isn’t the only threat looming for the beautiful big cats. Scientists believe that if climate change continues unchecked, more than one-third of the leopards’ habitat could disappear, according to a WWF report released last year.But Sharma said there’s still hope.“Snow leopards will not go extinct if we act now and reduce the myriad range of threats to snow leopards,” he said. “But we need to act quickly and scale up the good conservation models to truly benefit snow leopards as well as mountain communities.”This article has been updated with comment from Rishi Kumar Sharma."

A Bloomberg poll conducted Oct. 14-17 showed that 51 percent of Republicans think the Trump’s view of what the GOP stands for better matches theirs, compared to 33 percent who said Ryan’s perspective more closely matched theirs.Ryan has set himself up for a confrontation with Trump after Election Day. “Come Nov. 9, there will be a fight for who we are, what we stand for,” one top GOP aide told The Huffington Post this month.But, if there is a fight for the Republican Party, there is no evidence to suggest Republicans will side with Ryan. And there’s no indication of Trump is going anywhere.Following the final debate, in which Trump raised the specter of continuing his fight even after losing, one senior GOP leadership aide told HuffPost on Thursday that Ryan’s sudden drop in favorability probably wouldn’t be a lasting dip. “It shouldn’t shock anyone that his numbers took a hit immediately after Trump went on a tirade, especially when the speaker’s been quiet, keeping his head down stumping for our guys,” the aide said.A fair point, but Ryan’s fall from grace may be much larger than a single poll.One thing you can say about Trump is that he’s demonstrated Republican leaders were probably a bit ahead of the GOP base on issues like trade, immigration, even entitlement reform. Ryan has publicly taken positions contrary to Trump on these very issues.A September poll showed 85 percent of Republicans agreeing with Trump’s belief that free trade has cost more jobs than it’s created. And an April poll found 63 percent of Republicans support building a wall between the entirety of the U.S.-Mexico border, in line with Trump’s pledge. Ryan is on the other side of those issues and will have to square his positions with those of his party at some point, and it’s unclear how he does that when Republicans are so divided.On top of the ideological issues, Ryan has some practical problems following the election. If you believe Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the House GOP is going to be in single digits “either way” ― meaning Ryan will have lost more than 20 seats and, potentially, the Republican majority. Of course, things might not be that bad for Republicans. They could walk away from the year of Trump losing only a dozen or so House seats. But almost no one expects Republicans to gain seats, or really even keep their losses in the single digits. If Democratic gains are closer to Pelosi’s projection, it will present Ryan with considerable vote problems on his reelection to be speaker, let alone every piece of legislation that comes before the House. Suddenly, Ryan would have to turn to Democrats for votes to pass legislation, which could further damage his standing with Republicans.“If we lose 15, it’ll be tough for Paul Ryan,” one GOP member told HuffPost this month. That means, as other members have told HuffPost, Ryan already has a speaker reelection problem. And that’s before Trump starts whipping up the GOP base. Already, we see some conservatives in the House looking apt to use Ryan’s less-than-enthusiastic support of Trump as a way to potentially remove him. “If Paul Ryan isn’t for Trump, then I’m not for Paul Ryan,” Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) said in a Twitter post last week.Ryan also has to navigate a December spending deal that’s likely to anger many other Republicans and test the promises of regular order that he made last year when he took the speakership.And these are just the known variables. If Trump truly does contest that the election was rigged by virtue of the fact that he lost, Ryan’s first confrontation may be tamping down that revolt.So the speaker’s problems with Trump aren’t going anywhere. By committing to Trump, Ryan and the Republican Party more broadly has solidified its reputation as an anti-immigrant party ― a reputation the GOP desperately looked to shake after the 2012 election, recognizing that winning over immigrants was necessary to winning national elections. And Ryan has imperiled his own reputation as a serious-minded policy wonk by continuing to support Trump through every outrage.Ryan may be able to reintroduce some distance between himself and Trump after the election (no one really believes he’s on board with the nominee), but some voters will ― and should ― always remember that the speaker didn’t speak out when it really mattered.On the other side, Ryan has clearly angered Trump voters, some of whom might never return to the Republican Party.The grand joke of Trump’s candidacy is that prominent GOP members didn’t speak out against the party’s nominee in the beginning, nor bar him from running as a Republican, because they feared he would run as an independent and split the party. Now, after tarnishing the Grand Old Party as an association that accepts misogyny and racism, Trump may split the GOP anyway.

But he maintains the whole thing is ""total bulls**t.""",2016-10-21,"Bob Creamer, seen here in 2004, is a Democratic operative targeted by James O'Keefe.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the men seen in a new conservative sting video, which purports to expose Democratic attempts to stir up political chaos and commit voter fraud, is calling for the release of the full, unedited tape.Bob Creamer, a longtime Democratic operative who works closely with the Democratic National Committee, says he is the victim of an elaborate and deceptive smear campaign by the well-known conservative provocateur James O’Keefe. In some of his first comments since that video surfaced earlier this week, Creamer said O’Keefe’s tapes make a misleading case, and that if the full footage were made public, those deceptions would be evident.“Of course they should have all the raw footage up. Everything. People should be able to see the whole thing,” Creamer told The Huffington Post. “Our firm and a number of others have been victims of a substantial, monthslong spying operation run by James O’Keefe that was pretty sophisticated.”This week, the fruits of that “spying operation” were made public when O’Keefe’s Project Veritas Action Fund published two videos. The first focused on Democratic operative Scott Foval, who is seen boasting of his efforts to disrupt Donald Trump campaign events through “bird-dogging” ― the act of placing your own activists in prime locations at the opposition’s events. The second video shows Foval describing what sounds like a voter fraud scheme, in which a campaign could send fleets of out-of-state voters into a place like Wisconsin, equipping them with fake corporate IDs, pay stubs and cars with Wisconsin plates, in order to deliver the state to Hillary Clinton. Other Democrats are featured elsewhere in the video, apparently either discussing that scheme or entertaining other nefarious campaign acts. In conservative circles, the videos caused a stir, fed in large part by Donald Trump’s campaign, which brought O’Keefe himself to the third presidential debate on Wednesday so he could shame reporters for avoiding the issue. Trump, in fact, gave O’Keefe’s outfit $10,000 through his Trump Foundation, while the CEO of his campaign, Steve Bannon, regularly featured O’Keefe’s work when he was executive director of Breitbart.But like much of what Project Veritas produces, it’s not clear whether or to what extent the content was manipulated before it made its way to YouTube. It’s also tough to tell how significant the videos’ “revelations” actually are.As The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel notes, several of the allegations appear to be overblown. Bird-dogging, for starters, is a fairly well-known tactic, common enough at campaign events that savvy reporters often see through it. And the idea that Foval was responsible, as he boasts, for stirring up a raucous, occasionally bloody protest outside a Trump rally in Chicago in March is at odds with coverage of the incident, which credited University of Illinois students with shutting the rally down.“The portrayal was total bullshit, and these poor people were taken out of context,” Creamer said.On Thursday, The New York Times contacted an activist whom Foval claimed to have trained to deliberately instigate a violent reaction from a Trump crowd. The activist told the Times she’d actually gone to the rally of her own accord and without protest training.As for the voter fraud video, many of the details of the proposed scheme just don’t make sense. Moreover, in the video, Creamer is seen and heard expressing doubt about the legality of such a scheme, before Foval, in a separate moment, says he could try to do it without Creamer’s knowledge. The videos have, nevertheless, proved embarrassing ― not just for the subjects involved, but also for the Democratic National Committee, which has paid Creamer for work this cycle, and for the Obama White House, which Creamer frequently visited as part of regular meetings with Democratic activists.Creamer, who said he and his group have been flooded with threatening phone calls and emails since the release of the videos, argues that what the tapes show is not some sinister scheme to get Hillary Clinton elected, but rather the mundane ways in which political organizations and operatives conduct their business.One of the undercover Project Veritas videographers got to Creamer by posing as a donor. Creamer was introduced to the videographer by Foval, who was also under the impression that the “donor” was concerned about the immigrant community and eager to subsidize methods for mobilizing them politically. “I met with him and he sold me completely,” Creamer recalled. “He was a very genuine guy who had a whole story about his family history. He was great.”Creamer said that he first pitched the “donor” on doing a bus trip to help get out the vote. He says the Project Veritas “donor” then suggested the scheme involving hiring undocumented workers, issuing them corporate IDs and pay stubs and getting them registered in battleground states.“Frankly, I didn’t understand what he was proposing, because corporate IDs wouldn’t do the job,” Creamer said. “It has to be a government ID.”But instead of dismissing the man outright and ending the conversation, Creamer said, he tried to steer him toward other ideas. The “donor” struck him someone who was passionate but not well-versed in electoral law. At an earlier point, the “donor” had asked if his “niece” could intern at Creamer’s group Democracy Partners, with her family paying her expenses. Creamer agreed to bring the “niece” on board three days a week ― not knowing he was allowing an O’Keefe plant into his own office.“This guy seemed well-motivated,” Creamer said. “And I thought, he is just naive about what’s available, what is possible and what is legal.”But why would Foval say, after the fact, that he could go forward with the voter fraud scheme that Creamer found out of bounds? Creamer pleaded ignorance about this. Foval, he said, was a temporary subcontractor whose comments came largely before he began working for Democracy Partners’ DNC project. Creamer suspected that Foval’s ego played a role.“This guy was posing as a Democratic political organizer, telling all sorts of great war stories and how smart he is,” Creamer said. “This is all about ‘what big fish I caught last year’ to another fisherman.”Foval, who has blogged for HuffPost in the past, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The full, unedited film would presumably show whether Creamer’s hunch is correct. O’Keefe has released the full footage for some past projects. But in other cases, he has only released clips that later proved to be misleading and heavily edited. This, of course, has been of little solace to those targets who faced recriminations and even firings before the entire story was known. In one case, Ron Schiller was forced out of an executive position at NPR after he was heard on tape calling tea party activists racist ― even though he was actually quoting a Republican saying that. In another case, a former ACORN employee was able to successfully sue after he was portrayed as having been a willful participant in an underage prostitution scheme. He had actually played along and then alerted the authorities.I had my own brush with O’Keefe five years ago, when he surreptitiously videotaped my journalism professor saying I liked to get my sources liquored up so they’d tell me their secrets. I didn’t lose my job over this. Instead, I proudly pleaded guilty. As for Creamer and Foval, both have stepped away from their work in the aftermath of the latest O’Keefe sting. Creamer, who asked that the DNC remove him from managing their “bracketing” program, said this was not an admission of guilt, but rather a simple acknowledgement that he had become a story against his will. “I didn’t want to be a distraction to this campaign,” he said. “It is simply too important to elect Hillary and defeat Trump.”UPDATE: 7 p.m. ― Foval provided the following statement to HuffPost in an email Friday evening:This scheme to cast legitimate organizing activities as a sinister plot is nothing but a ruse. When O’Keefe’s team of grifters attempted to find illegal activities going on, they were disappointed to discover, in fact, that I and my associates were only involved in above-board, legal, legitimate organizing work to counter Trump’s campaign of division, misogyny, hatred, and xenophobia. Despite our attempts to redirect the conversation and actions towards positive, results-oriented, legal and ethical political organizing, O’Keefe’s crew of imposters continued to walk down a path of deception and manipulation. Our team took the high road, deciding to not indulge the imposters in their dubious scheme, rather attempting to put our energies and intentions towards positive activities that garner electorally relevant results. All who view these recordings should remember that they were speculative conversations where we attempted to correct a misguided idea put forth by O’Keefe and his cronies, and we did not take the bait.

No, I wish we were in high school, and I could take him behind the gym. That’s what I wish.”Biden has criticized Trump for posing a “threat to our democratic process” and for being out of touch with American families.“[Trump] was born with a silver spoon in his mouth that he’s now choking on because his foot’s in his mouth along with the spoon,” Biden said in September.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
10,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Is On Her Way To A $1 Billion Campaign.

Her entire campaign, including committees closely tied to her, is poised to top $1 billion in fundraising.GOP nominee Donald Trump’s campaign trails by every measure, and will fall well short of the funding, staffing and organizational marks set by 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney.In total, Clinton and her allies had raised a total of $869 million entering October. This includes her official campaign committee, Hillary for America, the Democratic National Committee, and two joint fundraising committees, Hillary Victory Fund and Hillary Action Fund. Trump, meanwhile, has amassed $599 million through his campaign committee, the Republican National Committee, and his own two joint fundraising committees, Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again.It has been clear throughout the campaign that the Clinton operation is far more sophisticated and streamlined than Trump’s. This owes to the fact that Clinton and the Democratic Party have continued to build the campaign organization President Barack Obama used for his two election victories.Trump, on the other hand, did not begin to raise money for his campaign until the last week of May. He has been in constant tension with his own party, often insulting party leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, past presidential nominees Romney and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.Trump’s cause has not been helped by a history of misogyny that returned to the news after a leaked 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape showing him bragging about groping women. Since then, 10 women have come forward accusing Trump of touching, kissing and mauling them against their will. Trump’s standing in polls has plummeted. Trump’s inability to match Clinton’s fundraising, his failure to build a ground-game staff, and his near estrangement from his own political party put him in an almost unprecedented position. No candidate has faced such a large disparity and won in the modern political era. Other outmatched candidates ― some with disparities smaller than Trump’s ― include big-time losers George McGovern in 1972, Bob Dole in 1996, and McCain in 2008.In September, Clinton raised $73.8 million for her official campaign committee, and the DNC raised $36.6 million. Trump raised $54.7 million for his campaign, while the RNC raised $39.4 million.Each candidate’s joint fundraising committee provides funds to state parties. These state parties provide staffing to get out the vote. Democrats overwhelmingly dominated both state party funding and paid staff in the 11 most crucial states at the beginning of October. These states include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.In total, Democratic state parties in these 11 states raised $40.2 million, and employed 3,536 staffers to work on federal election activity in September. Republican state parties raised just $15.7 million, and employed 1,028 federally active staffers. The disparity is even greater than the one held in 2012 by Obama’s Democratic swing state parties over Romney.The biggest 2016 disparities are in the most important states. The Democratic Party in Florida has 838 paid staff working on federal elections, compared with just 151 for the Republican state party. In Pennsylvania, Democrats have 525 paid staff members for federal election work, while Republicans have only hired 78. In Ohio, Democratic staff outnumber Republicans 500 to 109.The only important state where Republicans have a paid staff advantage is New Hampshire, where they have 285 people for federal election work and Democrats have 102. The only difference is many of the New Hampshire Republican paid staff are low-paid canvassers and not full-time organizers.Romney held at least one advantage back in 2012: unlimited super PAC money. His Restore Our Future super PAC raised $153 million to help Romney’s unsuccessful presidential bid. The pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action raised $79 million. That Republican advantage is reversed in 2016. Priorities USA Action, now supporting Clinton, has raised $158 million. In September, the group collected $24 million, its best month. S. Donald Sussman, a Virgin Islands-based hedge fund billionaire, gave $6 million. Facebook billionaire Dustin Moskovitz gave $2.5 million. Steve Mandel, head of the hedge fund Lone Pine Capital, gave $2.5 million. Real estate billionaires Jay and M.K. Pritzker combined to give $2.5 million. The super PAC also received $1 million checks from hedge fund billionaire David Shaw, savings and loan billionaire Herb Sandler, philanthropist Marsha Laufer, and Allied Wallet founder Ahamd Khawaja.There are four pro-Trump super PACs: Future45, Rebuilding America Now, Great America PAC and Make America Number 1. These groups raised $50 million combined through September, only one-third as much as the main pro-Clinton super PAC. Casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam were the biggest donors, with a combined $10 million to support Trump.Clinton’s dominance in fundraising and ground game staff is allowing Priorities USA Action to divert some of its money into Senate races. On Thursday, it launched approximately $200,000 worth of attack ads hitting Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey (R) and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) for waffling on supporting Trump. Both senators are conveniently running in states targeted by Clinton.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

At that point, Trump turned and started to walk away, saying, “Thank you very much.” But he stopped a moment later when she asked how he responded to those criticisms. “I am the least racist person you’ve ever met,” Trump said.Watch the whole clip here.Trump abruptly ended a second interview with local media on Thursday when asked about the allegations of sexual assault against him.“I know nothing about that,” he told Columbus’ 10TV and again walked away from the reporter.It’s impossible to really know what goes on in another person’s mind, but Trump has publicly demonstrated plenty of racist thinking ― enough to attract white nationalists, many of whom support his campaign.He launched his bid for president by saying Mexico was sending rapists and criminals across the border. He has stuck by his assertion that the Central Park Five, a group of four black men and one Latino man, were guilty of a notoriously violent rape in 1989, even though they’ve long since been exonerated. His pitch to black voters implies that all African-Americans live in abject poverty in “inner cities” riddled with crime. He supports stop-and-frisk policing despite its known problems with racial targeting.He called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., only to amend it to a ban on people from certain countries, which still seemed to cover the Middle East. And the list goes on.The charges of sexism also go on. Accusations of sexual assault specifically have multiplied in recent weeks after The Washington Post published a 2005 recording of Trump bragging about kissing and groping women without their consent. More than a dozen women have come forward since and said he assaulted them. He has denied those allegations.Trump has also made a habit of judging women by their attractiveness. Among many, many examples, he has mocked his accusers for their looks, insulted Republican primary opponent Carly Fiorina’s appearance, and allegedly sought to have female workers fired if they weren’t, in his view, pretty enough.At Wednesday’s presidential debate, Trump called Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman.”Yet even then, he denied that he harbored any sexism. “Nobody has more respect for women than I do,” Trump said. “Nobody.”The audience in the room laughed.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Who’s undecided at this point?” said Angelyn Dionysatos, president of the Republican group.One issue, though, did make both sides uncomfortable: Trump’s refusal to say he would accept the result of next month’s election should he lose. Democrats reacted with outrage. Republicans grimaced and stayed silent. Jake Evans, a 29-year-old lawyer still in his suit and tie from work, said Trump probably would have been better off saying, yes, of course, he would concede if he lost. On the other hand, Evans said, the answer probably would not turn off his supporters. “Trump is a fighter,” he said. “At this point, Americans know who Donald Trump is.”Earlier, Evans had expressed his frustration when Trump interrupted Clinton with: “Such a nasty woman.”“Come on,” Evans said. “See? This is how he falls apart.”Recent polls show that in Georgia ― which 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney comfortably won by 8 points ― both candidates could be statistically tied.One reason for this is Trump’s failure to appeal to younger, college-educated Republican women. One woman in the GOP group pantomimed shooting herself when describing her efforts to persuade her friends to vote for Trump.She said she couldn’t justify the Republican nominee’s attitude toward women, exemplified by a recently unearthed “Access Hollywood” video that recorded him bragging that his celebrity allowed him to sexually assault women. “I’m the worst possible advocate for him,” she said on condition of anonymity, so as not to hurt her standing with the party.Baylie Fry, a 26-year-old lawyer who reluctantly supports Trump despite his comments about women, said the final debate performance was probably his best. “I think he did a good job because he stayed composed, which is hard for him,” Fry said. “He wasn’t as bad as [in] his first two debates.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Saying that he might lock up his opponent. ... These aren’t acceptable behaviors.”Bezos also defended a controversial fellow billionaire and Facebook board member, Peter Thiel, who’s come under fire for supporting Trump. Previously, Bezos has had less than kind things to say about Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and Palantir, a data analytics firm valued at about $20 billion. Bezos has called out Trump before. His defense of Thiel, though, was perhaps more surprising. Many in the tech industry have called for Thiel to step down from Facebook’s board in light of his recent $1.25 million donation to the Trump campaign.Clearly, Bezos doesn’t agree with Thiel.“Peter Thiel is a contrarian, first and foremost,” he said in Thursday’s interview. “You just have to remember that contrarians are usually wrong.”However, if Thiel were on Amazon’s board, Bezos said he would not fire him for holding controversial views. “It’s way too divisive to say if you have an opinion, you can’t sit on my board. That makes no sense,” Bezos said.His comments echoed those of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who said he is keeping Thiel on the company’s board of directors because he cares about a diversity of opinions.Not everyone agrees. Trump’s misogyny and racism carries over to his supporters and donors, many in the industry argue. These hateful stances aren’t simply “viewpoints” or “opinions.”Bezos, who bought The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million, previously criticized Thiel for covertly funding lawsuits against Gawker that bankrupted the site, which shut down in August after selling its sibling sites and assets to Univision. Gawker sparked Thiel’s ire by posting a story in 2007 about his sexual orientation, which hadn’t been publicly reported.“What’s that saying? ‘Seek revenge and you should dig two graves ― one for yourself.’ You have to ask yourself how you want to spend your time,” Bezos said in May at a tech conference hosted by Recode. “The best defense against speech you don’t like about yourself as a public figure is to develop a thick skin.” Late last year, Bezos also helpfully offered to send Trump into outer space. On Thursday, he made clear the offer was still open: “I have a rocket company, so the capability is there.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

We’re talking hundreds of planes, in the air at the same time, using the same runway. What would that look like?Something like this:Mike Kelley created composites of planes at airports around the world for a stunning and oddly relaxing series called “Airportraits.” An architectural and aviation photographer based in Los Angeles, Kelley took photos at airports in 10 cities including Amsterdam, Tokyo, Zurich and London to accomplish “the most insane thing I have ever done, without question,” he says.Kelley hung out at airports, camera on tripod, and captured hundreds of planes taking off or landing. He then created a composite image as if the planes were all in the sky simultaneously. As Engadget puts it, it’s “eight hours of air traffic in one image.”The project took nearly two years. A lot of planning and strategy was required to arrange flights and access to various airports, then take thousands of photographs at each one. Then there was all the time spent in post-production, arranging the photos and editing them to look as realistic as possible. Kelley racked up more than 74,000 air miles on 25 flights to complete the series. He described the process in a blog post as “arduous, to say the least:”“From some locations I had thousands of pictures that needed to be culled, color corrected, extracted, and composited. For a few locations, I had weather that changed throughout the day (e.g. Frankfurt) from sunny to cloudy and back again. I had to think of a way to put these together that respected the weather and location, showed the aircraft realistically, and looked relatively believable.”But why? To highlight what Kelley calls “the inherent beauty in aviation, something that’s easy to forget as air travel has become a touch more mundane in recent years.”Basically, he just really loves airports.See the rest of the series below."

These are people who kill women and treat women horribly, and yet you take their money. So I would like to ask you right now, why don’t you give back the money that you have taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?”In a rare moment of unity within Trump’s camp, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway repeated the talking point Thursday morning on CNN’s “New Day”― and not one of the anchors or studio guests challenged the absurd claim. The argument has a nice ring politically. It allows Trump-supporting Islamophobes to feel morally superior, justified in their hateful speech or actions through an association with one of the most successful social movements of the last few decades. It’s a neat way to deceptively rebrand the Republican Party as a champion of progress rather than a force that continues to try to suppress LGBT populations across the U.S.But it’s still a big ol’ lie ― and a very dangerous one, amounting to a dog whistle for Trump’s most extreme followers.Here’s how much money the Clinton Foundation has received from proponents of pushing LGBT people off buildings: zero dollars and zero cents.That’s because no government in the Muslim-majority world (or anywhere else in the world) has this as a policy.The only “government” that does is that of the militant Islamic State group ― a brutal international pariah that does not represent the views of most Muslims or have the legal standing to donate to the Clinton Foundation.By conflating ISIS’s actions with those of Muslim-led governments, Trump is not standing up bravely for a sexual minority. Instead, he’s revealing the depth of his ignorance, his general disdain for Muslims (ISIS must be the same as the rest of them, right?) and his disregard of the impact his words can have.The slur he is helping spread has already been linked to violent Islamophobia. In August, an Oklahoma man killed an Arab-American neighbor after speaking about the neighbor’s family as “filthy Lebanese” who “throw gay people off rooftops.”Muslim communities do have work to do on embracing LGBT rights, and there are horrific restrictions on LGBT activity in the countries Trump mentioned (Saudi Arabia and Qatar) and their Muslim-majority neighbors. In Saudi Arabia, LGBT individuals can face jail time, floggings and the death penalty. Its regional rival, Iran, uses similar punishments. So does Qatar, which is struggling to answer how it will handle LGBT athletes and attendees when it hosts the 2022 FIFA World Cup.But Trump’s misrepresentation has little chance of spurring improvements in the situation or sparking helpful, fact-based conversations that might lead U.S.-friendly governments to reform. There’s zero evidence that progress on this front is even something he wants; the call for Clinton to return the money is linked to his broader complaint about her foreign ties, not to some campaign to uphold human rights by isolating repressive governments.His true goal with this rhetoric is to establish Islam as a menacing specter and posture as a protector of LGBT folks, the “daddy” of alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.Many in the LGBT movement see through this, as writers and advocates showed when they rejected Trump’s rush to spread Islamophobia following a Muslim man’s attack on a gay club in Orlando, Florida, in June. (Those who do want to see him as president seem uninterested in this specific form of fear-mongering: lesbian voters who recently told The Huffington Post they are supporting Trump cited his views on the economy and his apparent straight-talking.)Some buy it, however, just as some LGBT voters in Europe have begun to buy ultra-conservative talking points about Muslim immigration. HuffPost’s JamesMichael Nichols explored why in a recent story:As gay people have become “normalized” in American consciousness through recent historical milestones like the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 2010 and the legalization of same-sex marriage in June 2015, these victories have created space for the homonationalist American who abandons intersectional activism and advocates racist, xenophobic, capitalistic self-interest. As these gay Trump supporters use his candidacy to try to advance their limited interests, the Republican nominee uses them, in stunts like Peter Thiel’s convention speech, to distract from the homophobic measures his party recently endorsed in its platform and from his pledge to stack federal courts with anti-LGBT judges. (As well as the pro-conversion therapy man he wants to have as vice president.)This is politically helpful with a broader group, too: the majority of Americans who want their LGBT friends and family members to be treated as equal. It’s easy for Trump to keep them content when he’s quiet about limiting the rights and freedoms of “the gays” and loud about fake threats.This particular Trump falsehood won’t be enough to shore up his flagging candidacy this close to the election. But the line of argument is one to watch. Its success in entering the discourse without major public skepticism suggests that white nationalist-endorsed talk of defending Western values against foreign barbarians will only become more common and more heated ― even if that means alienating friendly countries abroad, sowing distrust between vulnerable communities at home and, as in Oklahoma, actual violence.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

In it, artist Benjamin Schwartz recreates the iconic photo taken during the May 25, 1965, heavyweight boxing title rematch between Liston and Ali, who in 1964 changed his name from Cassius Clay.Instead of Ali, it is Clinton who towers over her opponent, an angry, taunting look across her face. Trump lies on his back, defeated.The cartoon has no caption ― no words are needed. But had there been one, it might have echoed the words spoken by the announcer of that 1965 heavyweight title: “A knock down, ladies and gentleman ― a right-hand shot, a right-hand shot on the chin.”In a separate cartoon published Wednesday afternoon, Schwartz depicted Mortal Kombat’s Scorpion telling Clinton to “finish him.” Hours later, the Democratic nominee took the ninja specter’s advice, delivering a final, fatal blow. And just as Trump has repeatedly whined about the election as a whole being rigged, so too was Wednesday night’s debate, the Republican claimed on Thursday ― providing not one iota of evidence.

But he wishes he could, he said Wednesday after watching the third and final presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. That’s in part because his mother is undocumented, although he is a U.S.-born citizen. “She’s not allowed to vote, and I want to vote for her and let my voice be heard,” he said.But even though he can’t cast a ballot, Rodriguez is absolutely certain who won the debate. Really, it wasn’t even close. “We clearly know that Hillary won this debate, because Donald Trump really didn’t answer the questions,” Rodriguez said. “He would bring up different questions and answer them. Hillary, she took a little bit of extra time, but she answered the question with her full thoughts, while Donald Trump, he interrupted her and she just kept going. She was determined to say her answer. Donald Trump didn’t know what to say.”Rodriguez was the youngest of about 40 people at a watch party organized by Latino-focused advocacy groups Mi Familia Vota, iAmerica Action and CHISPA Nevada. While the event was officially nonpartisan, there was a clear favorite in the room. People snapped their fingers and cheered at some of Clinton’s jabs at Trump, and groaned when he claimed that no one respects women more than he does, or promised that he will deport the “bad hombres.” Rodriguez kept an eye on the proceedings from a folding chair, except for a short break to get tacos outside the office building.One of his top two issues, climate change, did not come up. The other, immigration, did, after being largely passed over in the first two debates, even though it has been a huge topic of discussion this election cycle. Rodriguez actually brought the matter up with Clinton once, according to his sister-in-law Emily Zamora, the Nevada state coordinator for iAmerica. She and her husband took Rodriguez to a meet-and-greet with Clinton in February, where he asked, “They say America is a free country. If it’s a free country, why do they deport families?”Zamora said they were impressed by the question ― and by his post-debate analysis on Wednesday.Rodriguez said he talks about politics with his brother and sister-in-law sometimes, but other people in his sixth grade class don’t really discuss it. They do talk about Trump, though.“They say that he’s the worst, he’s a loser, they don’t like him,” Rodriguez said. “Nobody likes him.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

That makes three chances for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to talk about the issue, and three missed opportunities where they didn’t.Moderators made time for questions about what the candidates admire about one another and the sexual trespasses of Bill Clinton (who is not running for office). But there somehow hasn’t been any time to ask about what is arguably the most pressing global issue currently facing humanity.Climate change has come up, but only when Clinton brought it up. She mentioned the problem in the first debate last month, calling out Trump for dismissing it as a Chinese hoax. Trump denied his denial, even though he’s got a traceable Internet trail.Clinton made passing reference to the issue again on Wednesday, in her pledge to support clean energy development. She said it would help address the “serious problem” of climate change while creating new business opportunities. Ken Bone, the internet’s favorite cartoon incarnate, got the closest to asking a climate question, though he didn’t mention the words. He asked the candidates about their energy polices and what they would do to meet energy needs, be environmentally friendly and minimize job loss.Wednesday’s debate moderator, Fox News’ Chris Wallace, did not bring climate change up at all (despite the promise that the candidates would discuss “foreign hot spots”). This is perhaps surprising to no one, given Fox’s enthusiasm for the subject.Still, it’s shocking that the country has made it through three presidential debates, and one vice presidential one, without really hearing about the issue.Candidates were asked about it in the Democratic primary debates. Even the Republican primary debates had a climate change question.Meanwhile, ice sheets are melting, sea levels are rising, heat waves are getting more common and more deadly, and forest fires are getting worse.

It was as though, knowing that he could not win the presidency, Trump was determined to make the job not worth having. Trump called Clinton a liar, a “nasty woman” and someone who should have “never been allowed to run” because she is a crook.She called him a liar, a sexual predator, a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin and “the most dangerous person to run for president in modern times.”And in the stunner of the night, an embittered but unbowed Trump declined to say whether he would accept the results on election night were he to lose, as is now likely, if not inevitable.“I’ll look at it at the time,” he said airily, as though discussing a future shipment of dry wall. “I’ll keep you in suspense.”“That’s horrifying,” Clinton replied. “When you are whining, you are not up to the job.”Trump’s unprecedented threat to sow chaos rather than concede was chilling ― and could presage a continuing populist crusade to challenge the very legitimacy of government for the foreseeable future.It was all too fitting that this sordid, unedifying and mostly uninformative series of debates ended here in Las Vegas, a city built on glamorizing the seamy, low-rent side of American life.As Clinton has herself privately told friends in her circle, she may be winning the election, but this is not the type of election she wanted to win, nor the way she wanted to win it.She may win sweepingly, but it won’t bring the country together. The Democrats may gain seats in the Senate and the House, but it won’t lead to a united Washington ready to get things done.Faith in our system of government is being torn down by the very electoral process that is supposed to be a ritual of renewal. And nothing Wednesday night was likely to affect the course of the race.Neither Trump nor Fox anchor and debate moderator Chris Wallace caused the sure-footed Clinton to commit a dramatic, game-changing error or collapse in a sudden personal meltdown.True, she was under pressure on account of her campaign email issues, but she counterattacked by blaming their disclosure on the personal involvement of Putin.Trump took the bait by repeatedly praising Putin, the richest and most powerful sponsor of terrorist activity on the planet.Nor did Trump transform himself into the reasonable statesman that no one thinks he is. As if praising Putin weren’t enough, he went on to say that Syrian President Bashar Assad was a “bad guy” but probably the best we could hope for there.Exchanges on taxes, immigration, the economy and the rest were really just recitations from both candidates of one-liners and accusations they’d used before and that the country had heard.Clinton’s best moment was her defense of tolerance of and respect for women as well as people of all religions and ethnicities.The fact that such a defense seems somehow political ― that it is not something everyone would agree with ― shows just how far into the muck Trump has dragged this campaign.But that very grimness prevented Clinton from raising hopes and sights. Looking peeved, she did not have the chance ― or, perhaps, the emotional energy ― to reach for other inspiring themes.Constantly on the attack, giving as good or better than she got, Clinton showed that she was willing to settle for a victory based largely on a rejection of Trump rather than an affirmation of her.And Trump, meanwhile, seemed eager to take down whatever parts of the system he can ― in effect doing what the Soviet Union could not to undermine Americans’ faith in their own government.U.S. investigative agencies strongly suspect that Putin’s allies have hacked the Clinton campaign. A flood of embarrassing emails have given the country more evidence of the Machiavellian side of politics and of Clinton’s own maneuverings for power.That won’t be enough to make Trump president. But it won’t help restore faith in American democratic government.Our faith in our government is our best asset ― and Putin’s target. He hit his target Wednesday night in Las Vegas.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(You know, if you knew nothing else about him.) His surprise new documentary, “Michael Moore in TrumpLand,” though, is nothing short of a love letter to Hillary Clinton. While we’ve seen Clinton’s opponent stand at podiums all over the country bellowing hateful rhetoric throughout the election season, “TrumpLand” shows Moore at a podium of his own in a conservative Midwest town, bellowing a message of unity. Adopting the cadence of an evangelical preacher, an outsider come from someplace else to spread his political gospel, Moore ends with a call to action: It’s OK to hate Clinton, but you need to vote for her. “You can see at the beginning there’s a lot apprehension in the room,” Moore said after a recent screening of the film, which will soon be available online.“TrumpLand” opens on Ohio residents talking about the November election. One voter, a man in a tank top, claimed to prefer Trump because “he didn’t get it handed down to him like [Clinton did] from her parents.” A shot outside a theater revealed its marquee: Trump Voters Welcome.“This is about reaching out to the people. I live in Michigan, and so, I know. I know. You see Trump signs everywhere. It’s astounding,” Moore said.Inside the theater, in front of a group with mixed political dispositions and ages in Wilmington, Ohio, he launches into his act, which is a sort of standup routine woven with heartfelt stories. Moore reveals the depth of his respect for Clinton while trying also to spread it on a stage lined with black-and-white photos of her younger days. Surprisingly, the filmmaker’s topical jokes seem to land among the crowd. As a satirical representation of Trump’s past comments, Moore has Mexican (or “Mexican-looking”) audience members, who had been segregated in an upper tier of seats, surrounded by a prop wall. Also-segregated Muslim (or “Muslim-looking”) audience members were placed under “drone surveillance.” Joking that white men at Trump rallies sound like “dying dinosaurs,” he makes an exaggerated sad-dinosaur noise and skewers American men’s stubborn refusal to cede the leadership roles they’ve historically held. Not long ago, women couldn’t hold property, Moore reminds the crow. America hasn’t been capital-G “Great” for a lot of people over its 240 years. One of the more unexpected moments comes when the filmmaker screens a clip from the time of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment hearings. Trump, then in his 40s, is asked whether he has any dating advice for Hillary. In a softer tone of voice than we’ve heard him use to refer to any Clinton recently, Trump kindly says she doesn’t need his advice and predicts the couple’s marriage will survive. It’s an olive branch to the Trump sympathizers in the room, a warm image of the candidate in the days before he would think to call her a “nasty woman” on a national stage.“TrumpLand” doesn’t do much for voters looking to be swayed by hard facts. But, for those who oppose the Democratic candidate due to a vague sense of dislike and disgust, Moore paints an image of a woman who has continued to work hard for issues despite decades of often sexist reaction by voters and media.“It doesn’t get acknowledged, if you were an early feminist, what you put up with and what you went through,” Moore said. Before and after the Ohio performance, the filmmaker’s crew polled audience members. While the performance may not have convinced every Trump supporter to vote for Clinton in November, he says that some were swayed to third parties ― although his goal was to win undecided voters and Bernie Sanders supporters over to Clinton’s side.But Moore’s support for the Democratic nominee hinges on whether she will make good on her campaign promises. If she doesn’t, he joked after the screening, we might see him running for president in the next election on a platform of universal remote controls.Kanye-Moore 2020, anyone?Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the Ohio town visited by Moore. It’s Wilmington, not Bloomington.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Trump said he was shocked the women dominated the men at the beginning of the show.“What surprised me most was how easily the women dominated initially,” Trump said at a 2004 press conference about the show, according to the Houston Chronicle. “Yet when the women were put with the men, they lost their dominance. I don’t know why. Maybe that’s a reflection of real life.”Trump’s campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.The remark is another in a series of derogatory comments Trump has made throughout his career toward women. In a different season of “The Apprentice” he called contestant Khloe Kardashian a “piglet.” In 2005, he boasted about being able to make unwanted sexual advances toward women, saying that because he was a celebrity, he could “grab them by the pussy.” More than a dozen women have accused him of sexual assault. Trump has denied the claim by saying that the women weren’t attractive enough for him to assault or that they were coming forward for fame.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

A second officer, Patricia Cocciolone, survived the shooting with a shattered pelvis, damaged intestines and permanent brain injury.She testified at Lawler’s trial, according to a Georgia Supreme Court summary of the case.The synopsis said Lawler and his girlfriend had been drinking at a bar near their Atlanta apartment the night of the October 1997 shooting.Police were summoned by a witness who thought he saw Lawler hit the woman with a bag as they walked home. Lawler fled when officers arrived.The officers decided to help the girlfriend get home. At the apartment, they were met by Lawler, who fired at the officers 15 times, the case summary said.Sowa and Cocciolone still had their pistols strapped into their holsters when backup arrived. Lawler surrendered after a six-hour standoff, according to court records.At his trial, a co-worker testified Lawler had talked about having “an extreme dislike” of police and that if they ever tried to enter his home, he would be “ready for them,” court records said.Georgia’s State Board of Pardons and Paroles denied Lawler’s request for clemency on Tuesday. In their petition to the board, his attorneys said Lawler had recently been diagnosed with autism, a disorder that had prevented him from explaining the murder to jurors.The U.S. Supreme Court also denied a last-minute request for a stay of execution."

The approach considered by the report is one outlined by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, or Global Goals, which were released last year with the aim of reducing poverty, hunger and inequality around the world by 2030.The SDG agenda calls for significant shifts in how our food is produced, processed and sold, including growing and consuming more produce and meats that have a reduced environmental impact, embracing sustainable farming practices like low- and no-till agriculture and reducing food waste at both the production and retail level.Such shifts, the report’s author Fraser Thompson said, aren’t just “pie-in-the-sky” daydreaming or, as some critics of the SDGs have put it, byproducts of a “worthless” “high school wish list.”“It is important to stress that our business opportunities are based on currently available technologies where there is an existing model in operation in some part of the world,” Thompson told HuffPost by email. “We deliberately took this approach to ensure that the insights from the report were feasible for business.”According to the report, these global shifts would have the bulk of their impact in developing countries — over 90 percent of the forecast job creation would take place on the continents of Africa and Asia due to the large share of arable land and high future consumption growth, Thompson said.But there are significant opportunities for the U.S. to seize as well.The three top areas for possible economic growth tied to a more sustainable food system in the U.S. are largely focused on the consumption side of the food value chain — reducing consumer food waste, reformulating food products to be healthier, and helping consumers switch their diets away from resource-intensive products like beef and toward other proteins like poultry, pork, fish and vegetarian diets.There are already promising examples of the sort of sustainable practices the commission would like to see other industry leaders emulate in play throughout the world.One of them Thompson named is Winnow, a London-based startup that is battling food waste through a “smart meter” that connects commercial kitchen operations to the cloud and allows chefs to record and analyze all the food that doesn’t get put to use.Chefs then use that information to tweak their production practices and reduce their kitchens’ food waste by 50 percent or more. The company’s work was recognized with a Guardian Sustainable Business award earlier this year.The key, Thompson argues, to harnessing the impressive windfall they’ve forecast will simply be scaling up ideas like Winnow’s kitchen meter. That will require buy-in from a broad swath of businesses and consumers alike.BSDC chair Lord Mark Malloch-Brown told HuffPost by email he is hopeful the research presented in the report should help industry players connect the dots.“It will require hard work by individual entrepreneurs and companies to translate this into specific businesses that earn financial returns in line with the economic opportunity we have identified,” Brown, former UN deputy secretary-general, wrote. “That’s hard long-term work but what we have sought to show is that the prize is worth the effort.”Still, businesses have been slow to take action toward achieving the SDGs and consumers also appear skeptical, according to recent surveys.According to Thompson, though, we don’t have much longer to wait before taking action toward meeting the world’s increasing food demands, which the UN has warned will grow by 60 percent in 2050.“The challenges facing the food system in a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario should not be underestimated,” Thompson added. “Addressing the current undernourished population and the rapid demand for food and feed – and competing demand for fuel – will require a radical rethink of past practices.”―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

28,GREEN,Super Typhoon Wipes Out Nearly Every Home In This Philippine City,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/philippines-typhoon-haima_us_5808df6ce4b0dd54ce389b2d,This is a brutal reminder that global warming -- which got next to no mention in the U.S. presidential debate -- is very real.,2016-10-20,"Government workers cut branches of an uprooted tree along a road after Typhoon Haima struck Laoag city, Ilocos Norte in northern Philippines, October 20, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586ea2531700002500928552.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Philippines suffered its second major storm in a week as Super Typhoon Haima made landfall Wednesday, reportedly destroying or damaging nearly every home in Tuguegarao City, a northeastern city of about 153,000 people. From a report on Rappler, a local news site:The provincial government of Cagayan said it is possible that 100% of houses in Tuguegarao City were either partially or fully damaged by Super Typhoon Lawin (Haima), which hit land on Wednesday night, October 19.Nearly 100,000 were evacuated ahead of the storm, which had sustained winds of 140 mph, according to the BBC. At least four people were killed. The Filipino Embassy in Washington, D.C., told The Huffington Post it was monitoring the situation through updates from the country’s National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, a storm-relief agency.Typhoon season typically lasts from May to October in the Philippines, which experiences on average about 20 storms per year.But in recent years, things have gotten worse. Five of the 10 deadliest typhoons to ever hit the archipelago nation came in the last decade, according to the nonprofit Climate Reality Project. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan ― the country’s deadliest storm on record ― killed more than 6,300 people, displaced 4 million others and created $2 billion in damage.The intensity of super typhoons has spiked by about 10 percent since the 1970s, according to a study, released last year, of 850 storms in the Pacific. Researchers warned that, as humans continue to spew carbon into the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet, the destructive power of such storms like Haima will only increase. “Strong storms generate intense mixing in the upper ocean, cooling the surface layer while warming the subsurface,” Wei Mei, a climate scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, told The Sydney Morning Herald last year. “Thus the net effect of the storm passage is to pump heat downward from the surface to the subsurface ocean.”“This warming effect becomes stronger as the storm becomes stronger, because stronger storms can generate more vigorous mixing and thereby pump more heat into the ocean and to a greater depth,” Mei continued. In other words, climate change begets worse storms, which, in turn, beget even worse storms. Yet, somehow, in the United States ― second only to China in carbon emissions ― the issue has gone almost entirely ignored during a hotly contentious presidential election. During Wednesday night’s final debate between the presidential nominees, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, who has said climate change is a “hoax” invented by the Chinese government, global warming got no mention.

29,POLITICS,Appeals Court Upholds Conviction Of Bin Laden Assistant In 9/11 Terror Plot,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bin-laden-assistant-conviction_us_5808daa4e4b0dd54ce3895fd,Ali Hamza Ahmad al Bahlul had been convicted of conspiracy to commit war crimes.,2016-10-20,"In this courtroom sketch, Ali Hamza Ahmad Sulayman al Bahlul appears before a military commission at Guantanamo Naval Base on Aug. 26, 2004.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal appeals court on Thursday upheld the conviction of Ali Hamza Ahmad al Bahlul, a filmmaker and public relations assistant found to have actively helped Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda prepare for the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.In a divided 163-page ruling, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected Bahlul’s constitutional challenge to his conviction for conspiracy under the laws of war, reasoning that Congress has authority to make the crime of conspiracy a punishable offense that can be tried in an American war tribunal.“An enemy of the United States who engages in a conspiracy to commit war crimes ― in‎ Bahlul’s‎ case,‎ by‎ plotting‎ with ‎Osama ‎bin ‎Laden‎ to murder thousands of American civilians ― may be tried by a U.S. military commission for conspiracy to commit war crimes,” the court said in its main conclusion.The case arrived at the court as an appeal of a decision by a Guantanamo military commission, which found Bahlul guilty of conspiracy to commit war crimes ― including murdering civilians and providing material support for terrorism.Bahlul, who is from Yemen, rose to prominence in al Qaeda’s ranks after he produced a propaganda video that hailed a 2000 bombing that killed 17 American sailors and was used for recruitment purposes. Bin Laden then hired Bahlul as his personal aide and media relations representative. He was so central to the al Qaeda leader’s planning and interests that bin Laden declined his request to volunteer for the 9/11 attacks.Following the terror act, Bahlul fled from Afghanistan to Pakistan, where he was captured and turned over to U.S. forces. A military commission in Guantanamo later tried and convicted him of conspiracy to commit various war crimes, including preparing “martyr wills” for two of the 9/11 hijackers ― video declarations in which the terrorists describe what they’re about to do.“When I look at what Bahlul was really convicted of, I see a war crime,” said U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Wilkins in a concurrence ― one of six separate opinions in the long-running case. The nine judges who deliberated in the ruling couldn’t agree on a single rationale for deciding Bahlul’s constitutional contentions, which more or less centered on the constitutional authority of Congress to give military commissions ― rather than courts ― oversight over wartime trials for the specific crime of conspiracy. In the end, six judges voted that Bahlul’s conviction should stand, while three judges would’ve reversed it on the grounds that the military commission here went beyond its power.Notably, U.S. Chief Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, whom President Barack Obama nominated to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in March, sat for oral arguments in the case last year but did not participate in the ruling. He has stepped aside from all decision-making while his nomination is pending.The three dissenting judges argued passionately that the Bahlul conviction has less to do with his crimes or his connections to al Qaeda than with giving too much power to the federal government ― while taking away that of the federal judiciary.“The challenges of the war on terror do not necessitate truncating the judicial power to make room for a new constitutional order,” the judges wrote in a joint dissent. They would’ve squashed Bahlul’s conviction because, in their view, it went beyond the military commission’s power to render it.And in a nod to the Supreme Court, which may end up reviewing the case, they warned that Thursday’s ruling will have no binding effect.“Today’s decision thus provides no precedential value for the government’s efforts to divert the trial of conspiracy or any other purely domestic crime to law-of-war military commissions,” they wrote.This story has been updated with additional information about Bahlul and the appeals court ruling."

Security Council resolutions.The failed missile launch was the eighth attempt in seven months by the North to launch a weapon with a design range of 3,000 km (1,800 miles) that can be fired from road mobile launchers, the two militaries said.“We strongly condemn the North’s continued illegal acts of provocation,” the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.Japan condemned the launch and said it would make a formal protest to the North through its embassy in Beijing.North Korea has been conducting activities related to its nuclear and missile programs at an unprecedented pace this year in defiance of U.N. sanctions and diplomatic pressure and is believed to be making progress in its efforts to develop a nuclear missile.In June, North Korea launched a Musudan missile that flew about 400 km (250 miles), more than half the distance to Japan, a flight that was considered a success by officials and experts in South Korea and the United States.After Wednesday’s talks in Washington between U.S. and South Korean foreign and defense ministers, the countries said they would set up a high-level group to leverage “the full breadth of national power – including diplomacy, information, military coordination, and economic elements” in the face of the North Korean threat.Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking before the failed missile launch, said the United States would do “whatever is necessary” to defend itself, South Korea and other allies against North Korea.Kerry and U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter reaffirmed that any attack by North Korea would be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons “met with an effective and overwhelming response,” a joint statement said.As part of the military effort, Kerry said the United States would deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system to South Korea “as soon as possible”.China strongly opposes deployment of the U.S. system, saying it would impinge on its own strategic deterrence.South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, also speaking in Washington before the failed launch, said North Korea was nearing the “final stage of nuclear weaponisation” and the allies would mobilize “all tools in the toolkit” to defend themselves.A U.S. aerospace expert, John Schilling, said this week in a report on the 38 North project that despite the failures, the pace of testing could enable the North to put the Musudan missile into operational service sometime next year."

He was sentenced to two years labor.However, the Guardian newspaper said it was not clear whether Wilde would be included in those pardoned as the Ministry of Justice has said that no new individuals would be named or singled out. No comment from the ministry was immediately available.One man who was convicted of gross indecency in 1974, said he would not accept a pardon and wanted an apology.“To accept a pardon means you accept that you were guilty. I was not guilty of anything. I was only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, George Montague told BBC TV.Lord Sharkey said a pardon was “probably the best way of acknowledging the real harm done by the unjust and cruel homophobic laws.”“I hope that a lot of people will feel exactly the same way,” he told BBC radio.(Editing by Stephen Addison)"

More than 100 of them are embedded with Iraqi and Kurdish Peshmerga forces involved with the Mosul offensive, advising commanders and helping them ensure coalition air power hits the right targets, officials have said.The statement did not identify the service member.This is the fourth U.S. service member to be killed since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve in 2014, focused on fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.The Pentagon this week played down any new role for U.S. forces in Iraq’s battle to retake Mosul and said they would be behind the forward line of troops.

34,POLITICS,What Are The Odds That Donald Trump Just Walks Off The Debate Stage Tonight?,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-debate-odds_us_5807c37ae4b0180a36e847a6,We asked an oddsmaker for help answering this and other pressing questions.,2016-10-19,It seems unlikely that Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton would just peace out in the middle of the debate. But anything is possible this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5807ca6b1a00008f205ba8a2.jpeg?cache=oHZyP4s9Jp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We did it, everybody. We made it to the final debate of the presidential campaign. After the sheer absurdity of the past few weeks, we weren’t sure the debate was actually going to happen. But now, all we have to do is make it through an hour and a half of whatever is about to unfold in Las Vegas. And then through the 19 days until the actual election. And then through the ― oh please, sweet meteor of death, take us already.Anyway, all of this madness got us thinking. Could literally anything happen on Wednesday night? As polls show GOP nominee Donald Trump with an ever-shrinking chance of winning on Nov. 8, has he completely run out of f***s to give? Will Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lose her cool? How likely are we to see the debate devolve into complete chaos?To obtain some semi-serious answers to these questions, we turned to the expert oddsmakers at OddsShark. OddsShark is an information site, and doesn’t actually set lines or accept bets. It typically aggregates odds from sports books in Las Vegas and overseas, and uses them to write up advice for bettors.It has, for example, compiled a list of real prop bets available for Wednesday night’s debate: What color will Hillary Clinton’s jacket be? Who will be the first to interrupt the other? How many times will Trump say “rig” or “rigged”? (For the uninitiated, a prop or proposition bet is a side wager on something not directly related to the outcome of the game ― or in this case, debate.)We thought those bets were a bit tame, so we asked OddsShark to put its experience to work probing some less likely, though not impossible, scenarios. Like this:Will one of the candidates walk off the stage during the debate?That means a hypothetical $100 bet on “yes” would win you $10,000 if Trump were to say “screw it,” flip over his lectern and storm off the stage. That also means you’d have to bet $4,000 on “no” to win $100 if both candidates remain on stage and make us suffer through the entire 90-minute ordeal. OddsShark clearly thinks it highly improbable that either nominee will abandon ship mid-debate. We’ll see about that.Keep in mind, these aren’t real lines. No betting websites that we know of will accept wagers on these bets ― although we guess we can’t stop you from doing whatever you want with your friends.These figures, however, are an unofficial marker of how likely seasoned oddsmakers believe the following scenarios are. It’s hard to imagine this exercise being taken seriously in any other election, but this is 2016 and nothing really surprises us anymore.Will either of the candidates bring a previously unannounced guest (not including President Barack Obama’s half-brother or a woman who recently accused Bill Clinton of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s or anyone else whose attendance is reported before the debate)?No -150Yes +250How long will the silence last between the moderator’s introduction and the candidates’ entrance?OVER 60 seconds +500UNDER 60 seconds -500How many times will Trump sniffle?OVER 19.5 times -110UNDER 19.5 times -110Will either of the candidates use a swear word?Yes +900No -1100Will Trump say “build the wall” or some version of that phrase?Yes -180No +140Will there be any other physical contact, not including a possible handshake?

According to Trump’s letter, the show would consist of “a series of shorts and interviews with ten of the most beautiful women in the world.” The letter is from the Roone Arledge papers at Columbia University’s library. Read part of the three paragraph letter below: In any event, in conjunction with Pierre Cossette, I am going to do a one to one and a half hour special entitled “Donald Trump Presents the Most Beautiful Women in the World.” This show will consist of a series of shorts and interviews with ten of the most beautiful women in the world, including Lady Di (who I know and I think will speak to me), Claudia Schiffer, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Michelle Pfeiffer, etc… This program will be done on a yearly basis and will get huge ratings.

36,WOMEN,A Quick Reminder That Sexual Assault Is Not About Lust -- It's About Power And Control,Jenavieve Hatch and Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sex-assault-power-attractiveness-trump_us_58076e39e4b0dd54ce366233,"Listen up, Trump.",2016-10-19,Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Colorado on October 18. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58076f01170000bc16acce40.jpeg?cache=gPMxN3GPqV&ops=crop_55_83_3811_2327%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sexual assault is Not. About. Attractiveness.Assault and harassment is about power. A man, perhaps feeling insecure about his masculinity or entitled about his status, uses assault to assert control and dominance over a woman.Yet Donald Trump and his team of surrogates can’t stop making the case that only “attractive” women are somehow worthy of assault.“These aren’t even women he’d be attracted to,” Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, in an attempt to refute the growing group of women who’ve accused the Republican presidential candidate of assault. “Beauty is in the eye of beholder,” he said, as if to soften the blow.(Watch him make this statement in the video below.) Cohen’s just echoing his boss. In the last week alone, eight women have come forward with allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Trump ― in response, those women have been ripped apart by Trump’s campaign, repeatedly told they’re too unattractive to have been on the receiving end of Trump’s affections. In a campaign speech in Florida on last Thursday, Trump denied the women’s allegations, calling them “false smears.” But he did more than deny the claims ― he insinuated that one woman, People Magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff, wasn’t attractive enough to be hit on. “Look at her,” he said. “I don’t think so.”Earlier this week, People magazine corroborated Stoynoff’s claims with reports from six different sources. Sex is only part of the reason for sexually assault, which has so much to do with asserting one’s dominance and control over a victim. When a man objectifies, gropes or grabs women, he’s “proving” who is in charge. Trump himself explained it in the by-now infamous video of him from 2005.“You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait...And when you’re a star, they let you do it,” Trump says. “You can do anything.”Men who rise to more powerful positions often feel more entitled to this kind of behavior.“If you give people more power than they’re more likely to objectify and harass women and see them as objects,” said Stefanie K. Johnson, a professor at the University of Colorado’s business school who studies gender.Under this logic, a boss who makes a grab for his female employee is just demonstrating his bossiness, his entitlement to whatever he wants. There’s another disturbing thread of logic to the Trump argument ― that he wouldn’t assault an unattractive woman. The implication is: he would assault someone he found attractive.Taking Trump’s argument to its logical end, you’d expect that only the most good-looking people wind up as victims of sexual violence. Of course, that’s absurd.A wide and diverse group of men, women ― and children ― have been the unfortunate victims of sexual assault. Making assault and rape about “attractiveness” diminishes their experience. “By making the issue about sex and not about violence, this crime seems more acceptable and less severe,” explains the University of Michigan’s sexual assault and awareness center.Talking about a victim’s attractiveness, also serves to blame THEM for the assault: If she weren’t so damn hot, I wouldn’t have done it, the argument goes. The argument about attractiveness is just an extension of Trump’s relentless misogyny: Women are either attractive “pieces of ass,” or they’re worthy of contempt. That’s not a world view that’s working very well for him anymore.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Need help?

He’s suing the company that owns the film’s rights for $125 million.Shearer, who plays bassist/zucchini aficionado Derek Smalls in the cult classic rock mockumentary, filed a lawsuit against Vivendi and its StudioCanal subsidiary for fraud, breach of contract and failure to pay a share of the profits from the film and its related properties. “Filing a claim like this one is neither fun nor easy,” Shearer said in a video statement. “Going up against a major multinational is not nearly as enjoyable as playing too loud at Carnegie Hall.”Vivendi had no comment on the lawsuit. Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Rob Reiner created the band Spinal Tap in the 1970s; the four also wrote the 1984 movie at the heart of the dispute as well as the band’s songs “Big Bottom” and “Hell Hole.”Guest, McKean and Reiner were not party to the lawsuit, which stated that the four were supposed to share 40 percent of the profits related to the film and its music, per their deal with Embassy Pictures. Embassy’s films and other assets were bundled and sold over the years, with Vivendi eventually gaining ownership of “This Is Spinal Tap.” But according to a copy of the lawsuit posted online by Deadline, Vivendi paid the four just $81 in worldwide merchandising income between 1984 and 2006, and $98 in music sales between 1989 and 2006.“Well, $98 is about enough to buy one miniature Stonehenge,” said Shearer. He claims the film is “on view almost constantly.” It had two theatrical releases, has been available in just about every video format over the years and gets regular play on cable TV.“And yet most of that time, according to Vivendi, it hasn’t been profitable,” Shearer said.Shearer, who is also the voice of multiple characters on “The Simpsons,” launched a website called Fairness Rocks with more details on his lawsuit.“I am just one person seeking redress for blatant injustice,” he wrote on the site. “But I hope this lawsuit will, in its own way, help set a new precedent for faithful and transparent accounting practices, and fair artistic compensation, industry-wide.”"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) issued a stern warning to his Republican colleagues this week over their newfound love for the website WikiLeaks.“These leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process and I will not indulge it,” Rubio told ABC News in a statement published Wednesday. “Further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks: Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.”Rubio, who ran against Donald Trump in the Republican presidential primary, said he would refrain from discussing any information that wouldn’t have come to light without the help of the website known for publishing classified and leaked information.“I will not discuss any issue that has become public solely on the basis of WikiLeaks,” the senator said.Trump has shown no such reluctance, regularly attacking his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, using findings published by WikiLeaks. Many senior Republican figures and Fox News personalities who were extremely critical of WikiLeaks in the past now speak positively about it.Earlier this month, WikiLeaks began publishing the hacked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The messages involve some politically sensitive material, including excerpts from Clinton’s paid speeches to banks from several years ago in which she endorses fiscal and trade policies at odds with her presidential campaign positions.The Clinton campaign has accused the Russian government of being responsible for hacking Podesta’s email.In July, WikiLeaks also published hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee that suggested the party establishment had been opposed to the presidential candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).The U.S. government has formally accused Russia of being behind the DNC hack, but Russia has denied any involvement in the breach. The White House has asked the CIA to plan a possible retaliatory cyberattack against the country, NBC News reported."

Through her organization African Health Now, the 39-year-old has been crusading for the last 10 years to help bring basic health information, health care and resources to Ghanaians and people across the African continent. Based in New Jersey but of Ghanaian descent, Eyeson-Akiwowo was working in the publishing world in 2006 when her father fell ill in Ghana. There, she experienced first-hand the lack of primary health care available in the West African country. She also noted the ways in which members of the community were compelled to rally around him in order to make sure he received proper care. It was that sense of community she witnessed for her father that formed the catalyst for the creation of African Health Now. “I took the first step by producing a health fair to provide general medical health screenings to my father’s community,” Eyeson-Akiwowo told The Huffington Post. “If my father had known previously the importance of screenings or the signs of a heart attack this could have been prevented. I realized this was a much bigger issue. After each health fair and the interaction with our participants, I felt compelled to come back. Now, I can’t see myself doing anything else.” A decade later, African Health Now services communities by transforming local spaces into medical clinics and bringing education and primary health care such as breast exams and dental care to the people who need it. According to Eyeson-Akiwowo, the organization’s work has impacted over 20,000 people in urban neighborhoods throughout Ghana. There have been obstacles, as with any grassroots movement, especially in regards to getting human and financial resources to not only keep the organization going in Ghana but so it can expand it to other parts of Africa. Even so, Eyeson-Akiwowo remains dedicated African Health Now. On Thursday, AHN will host a special star-studded gala event in New York City to raise funds for a plan to deploy 50 mobile health units throughout Ghana over the next 10 to 15 years. It’s an ambitious plan, and one that Eyeson-Akiwowo says she firmly believes in. “Seeing the joy in a child’s face after their first dental visit is the most rewarding [experience],” Eyeson-Akiwowo said. “Five years from now, we hope to have increased that kind of access to basic health care for Sub-Saharan Africans.”For more info on African Health Now, visit www.africanhealthnow.org.

Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) says he’s so torn about the presidential race this year that he might not vote at all.“I don’t know if I’ll cast a vote for president,” Coffman told a local TV affiliate in a Tuesday interview. “I’m not going to vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. I’m struggling with it like many other Americans.”The four-term congressman has been undecided throughout the election cycle, though he’s criticized the Republican presidential nominee in campaign ads. After a tape surfaced this month showing Trump making lewd comments about women, Coffman called on him to pull out of the race altogether.He said Tuesday he’s not a fan of Libertarian Gary Johnson, either, because he said “dumb things” on foreign policy.Coffman may not like his options, but skipping out on a presidential election is more than just bad optics for an elected official. There are plenty of reasons why he should vote ― including the fact that it’s a right generations of Americans struggled to have, and something people in other countries are still fighting for.Despite his dismay with Trump, Coffman has embraced some of the GOP nominee’s conspiracy theories in the past. Coffman was caught on camera at a private fundraiser in 2012 saying he didn’t know if President Barack Obama was born in the United States.“I don’t know that,” he said at the time. “But I do know this, that in his heart, he’s not an American. He’s just not an American.”Coffman apologized for his comments soon after.The Colorado lawmaker is running for reelection in one of the most competitive House races in the country. Once a GOP stronghold, his district has become a swing district with a growing Latino population, leading Coffman to shift to a more pro-immigration stance a few years ago. His Democratic challenger, state Sen. Morgan Carroll, also stands to benefit from more Democratic voters turning out than Republicans. Clinton is currently leading Trump in the state by 5 points, per HuffPollster."

Sanford, the 1857 pro-slavery ruling, in a pending case where the state is defending an anti-abortion bill that was earlier ruled unconstitutional.Elizabeth Wydra, president of the legal think tank Constitutional Accountability Center in Washington, noted the citation on Tuesday, which led to outrage on social media and a barrage of breathless coverage in multiple outlets.And with good reason: Lawyers, let alone state attorneys general or their underlings, should know better than to make legal arguments by giving a thumbs-up to a ruling that declared that African-Americans are not citizens deserving of constitutional protection. It took a Civil War to overrule Dred Scott.In response to the backlash, Kansas withdrew the offending legal brief on Wednesday:In an accompanying media statement, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt acknowledged the citation to Dred Scott “should not have been made.”“Neither the State nor its attorneys believe or were arguing that Dred Scott was correctly decided,” Schmidt said. “Nonetheless, the reference to that case was obviously inappropriate, and as soon as I became aware of it today, I ordered the State’s brief withdrawn.”Schmidt still thinks Kansas should win the abortion case, in which his office is arguing that the state constitution doesn’t protect “a state-level right to abortion.”Be that as it may — the Kansas Supreme Court will have the final word in the dispute ― a ruling that deserves to be in the dustbin of constitutional history should never have been a part of it."

In speaking with The Huffington Post, the Tony Award winner said he’s extremely grateful to lead such a diverse musical, and said the special comes at a pivotal time in America. “This is a musical piece that is about integration, and it’s about accepting each other for who we are,” he said. “Rather than focusing on your size, or your race, or your sexual orientation, we should just accept each human being for the beauty that they bring to the planet.”He added, “So with ‘Hairspray,’ it’s fun, it’s funny, it’s exciting, and it has a great statement to make to the world.

Donald Trump is desperately trying to regain ground as he attacks women accusing him of sexual assault and sets up his supporters to believe that if Hillary Clinton wins, it means the election was rigged. Trump is set to encounter a boisterous and hostile reception when he steps off his plane in Las Vegas. Workers at his own hotel will be picketing before and after their shifts on Tuesday, and union members will be constructing a wall of taco trucks outside his hotel on the day of the debate ― a reminder that it’s not only women he’s offended. Clinton will also find resistance in this battleground state, as an ad in the local newspaper, shared by a Huffington Post reader, makes clear. The ad urges people to buy guns before “Crooked Hillary” wins in November. “I got three words for you: Cabbage Patch dolls,” Cameron Hopkins, owner of local gun store Westside Armory, replied when HuffPost asked why he believed the price of guns would go up if Clinton becomes president. “Do you remember when all the kids wanted Cabbage Patch dolls? And it was Christmas time and all the toy stores were running out of Cabbage Patch dolls? So what do you think happened to the price of Cabbage Patch dolls? They all went up,” he explained. Hopkins admitted that the horrible massacres that occurred during President Barack Obama’s presidency didn’t result in more gun control ― as many conservatives feared ― so there’s a good chance that it will stay that way. But that doesn’t mean people aren’t still afraid liberals will take away their guns, he said.“We’re a mirror,” Hopkins said. “We’re holding up a mirror to what appears to be going on in the political system right now, and there is a lot of fear that if Hillary is elected there will be dramatic changes to the American way of life, including our right to own guns.”Trump, too, has presented himself as a mirror of a certain segment of the population that believes, in his words, that this election “is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not we the people reclaim control over our government.”Topics for Wednesday’s debate include the economy, immigration, the Supreme Court and debt and entitlements, but the focus will no doubt be on how Trump is dealing with the sexual assault allegations that have dominated news coverage in the past week. A steady stream of women have stepped forward to accuse the Republican presidential nominee of sexual assault since The Washington Post released video of him bragging in 2005 that he uses his celebrity status to assault women. In the last debate, Trump said unequivocally that he does not do what he bragged about doing: Q: Have you ever done those things?Yet many women who have interacted with Trump over the years say he is lying, and they’ve stepped forward to tell their stories.A person close to Trump told HuffPost that the real estate mogul wants to go after his accusers more aggressively, raising questions about their credibility and attacking them personally. Many of his advisers, however, don’t think it would be such a good idea.“There is kind of a fissure in the campaign,” the source said, “where he’d really like to discredit all these women because he doesn’t like his reputation being impugned. ... Most people say, ‘Forget about this, just move to the issues.’ He wants to say, ‘Yeah, but this woman is really a stalker,’ and on and on.”According to this individual, Trump believes that if he goes after these women’s backstories and reveals their supposed ulterior motives, the public will be more sympathetic toward him. He has already been taking the unbelievable step of attacking his accusers’ looks: Trump’s defense is that he’s not physically attracted to them and therefore wouldn’t have assaulted them. And since Trump recently declared “the shackles have been taken off” him, he’s likely to be even more unpredictable than in past debates. Clinton has largely stepped back and let Trump implode. Her campaign has continued to release policy plans and focus on its ground game, even starting to expand the map of states she might win. The most effective replies to Trump and his comments about women haven’t come from Clinton ― who, through her marriage, isn’t the ideal messenger on this issue ― but from surrogates like the president and first lady.In this final debate, Clinton will no doubt face questions about some of campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails, which were leaked after what intelligence agencies believe was a Russian government hack. The debate will also offer her one of her final, most high-profile chances to remind voters why they should vote for her and not simply against Trump.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

50,POLITICS,Nation's Largest Seniors Group Pushes Back Against Critics Of Its Social Security Campaign,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarp-pushes-back-social-security_us_5807b41fe4b0b994d4c34d63,"The AARP initiative argues for reform, but doesn't specify what kind.",2016-10-19,"AARP activists await the start of an event for Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in Madison, Wisconsin, on March 28. The influential organization is pushing back against its critics.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5807d029170000c316acd04e.jpeg?cache=YQuEQFJAoA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AARP defended itself Monday against criticism of its “Take A Stand” Social Security advocacy campaign, which has outraged progressives because it uses conservative scare tactics about the program and does not take a position against benefit cuts.The blog post appeared to be in response to a Huffington Post report Sunday for which the group declined repeated requests for comment.“Take A Stand” uses advertising, in-person activism and other tactics to demand that political candidates spell out their plans for closing Social Security’s funding gap with as much detail as possible.The chief liberal complaint about the campaign is that AARP’s tone and language resemble the rhetoric of fiscal conservatives who try to convince the public that the program is in crisis to make cuts seem more palatable. Progressive retirement security advocates are also frustrated that the seniors group refuses to distinguish between reforms that cut benefits and those that do not. It has even given awards to Republican lawmakers who strongly back cutting benefits, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has backed privatization in the past.Another critic, Eric Laursen, author of The People’s Pension: The Struggle To Defend Social Security Since Reagan, told HuffPost on Sunday that he faulted AARP for not at least including concerns about the adequacy of current Social Security benefits in the context of the current retirement income deficit.In spite of the evolution of the debate, AARP’s “Take A Stand” campaign suggests it still views the program exclusively through the lens of financial solvency.Jo Ann Jenkins, AARP’s executive vice president and chief operating officer, responded to this charge directly in her blog post on Monday. In the post, “Putting Your Head in the Sand Rarely Solves a Problem — Especially One That Matters So Much to So Many,” Jenkins argues that concern about the adequacy of Social Security benefits is in fact at the heart of “Take A Stand,” since the across-the-board cut that will occur if Congress does nothing would hit vulnerable beneficiaries hardest.Saying a lot of people will have a lot of skin in the game seems an apt if somewhat glib metaphor, except Social Security, a cornerstone of American life for more than 80 years, is not a game. For millions of people, it’s a lifeline.Reading the two passages alongside one another “simply added to an already obvious case that they were responding to [HuffPost]. No one else writes about them,” said Frederick Lynch, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and author of One Nation Under AARP: The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security and America’s Future.But the fact that AARP responded does not mean it provided an effective rebuttal of its critics.“I hope that AARP is concerned about the adequacy of Social Security benefits,” said Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works. “Unfortunately, giving Paul Ryan a ‘champion’ award, a man who is literally the architect of dismantling Social Security and Medicare, makes it look like they support a plan to cut benefits.”“I want AARP to ‘take a stand’ and make it clear they are not supporting politicians who would cut Social Security benefits like Paul Ryan,” he added.In addition, no one is claiming that failing to address Social Security’s shortfall, which begins in 2034, would not cause enormous pain. Progressives simply maintain that there is little to gain in invoking the worst-case scenario since the gap can be closed relatively easily without cutting benefits.In fact, liberal activists are willing to wait before reforming Social Security, because that way it will be harder for politicians to close the funding gap by cutting benefits. Lawmakers will be hesitant to enact cuts so soon before the shortfall date, the thinking goes, because it can deprive people of the time needed to plan accordingly. Jenkins’ blog post also suggests there has been silence on the topic from major candidates. She claims “we’re seemingly ignoring [Social Security’s financial challenges] in the hope they will go away.”Are we though?Hillary Clinton has a relatively detailed plan for reforming Social Security, calling for wealthier Americans to pay more into the program in order to finance benefit increases and close the funding gap. Nearly every Democrat in Congress has come out in favor of similar proposals to expand the program, specifically by lifting the cap on earnings taxed for Social Security. (In 2017, Americans will not have to pay into Social Security on earnings above $126,000.)Donald Trump has offered fewer specifics, but claims he would avoid cutting the program by rooting out fraud. (Overpayments are extremely rare, so cracking down on them would likely yield little money.)He has said in the past, however, that he backs cutting the program but believes politicians should not discuss their plans to do so if they want to win elections."

Sources in law enforcement told the website that two FBI agents went to Jolie’s home, where they spent around three hours interviewing the family. Apparently, the agents were there to determine whether or not there is enough evidence supporting the child abuse claims against Pitt to warrant an investigation.The alleged incident is said to have happened on the family’s private plane while they were flying from France to the U.S.. Pitt was reportedly being “verbally abusive” and “physical” in front of his children. The dispute is apparently what prompted Jolie to file for divorce and seek sole physical custody of their six kids. Last month, sources told People magazine that the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services was conducting an “ongoing” investigation into the incident. The Los Angeles Police Department denied involvement.According to TMZ, the agents at Jolie’s house were trying figure out the exact location of the plane when the altercation occurred, because it may matter if the plane was in U.S. airspace or not. At one point, the plane refueled in Minnesota, and there may be a chance Minnesota officials may have jurisdiction. TMZ reports that Jolie was cooperating with the agents, and notes it’s unlikely the FBI will move forward with the case. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September citing irreconcilable differences. The couple had been married for two years. The Huffington Post has reached out to Pitt’s and Jolie’s representatives, as well as the FBI, for comment and will update the post accordingly. "

The group has a similar case ongoing in Minnesota."

He also chastised his GOP counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for largely staying silent on Trump.“Mitch McConnell is as responsible as anyone for creating Trump,” Reid told reporters Wednesday, noting that Republicans in Congress have encouraged birtherism, climate change denial and the demonization of immigrants. McConnell has endorsed Trump, but other than that, he’s been quiet on the GOP nominee. “If you’re interested in the presidential election, you might as well get up and leave, because I don’t have any observations to make on that,” McConnell said recently during a speech at a local chamber of commerce in Kentucky.McConnell’s spokesman declined to comment on Reid’s remarks, noting that Reid has been trying to pin the blame for Trump on Republicans for months.Reid also said he’s been disappointed in Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who recently withdrew his support of Trump after video emerged of the GOP nominee bragging in 2005 about sexually assaulting women. Reid said it’s too late now for McCain to wash his hands of Trump: John McCain and I came to Congress 34 years ago. We came to the Senate 30 years ago ... So I’ve had a relationship with John McCain. It always hasn’t been a loving relationship, but it’s been a good relationship. We all know about his temper. I’ve been on the brunt of that quite a few times. But I’ve always spoken highly of John McCain because of his background.This week, McCain attracted notice for promising that Senate Republicans would be united against any Supreme Court nominee Clinton might nominate if she wins in November. He later tried to walk back those remarks. McCain’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“For him to say, as he did a few days ago, it doesn’t matter who she brought up, they will oppose,” Reid said, “that doesn’t speak well of him or, I assume, the Republicans he’s trying to lead.”Reid also dismissed Trump’s allegations that the electoral system is “rigged,” saying, “The only ‘rigged’ thing I’ve seen in this election is his mind.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

56,POLITICS,Why A President Trump Would Be A 'Massive Disaster' For U.S. Water,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-environment-water_us_5807a6ece4b0180a36e80b87,"The GOP nominee's environmental policies are vague at best, and dangerous at worst.",2016-10-19,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump addresses supporters during a campaign stop inside a hangar at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport in Lakeland, Florida on October 12, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587c4b8b170000fa01fdec86.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump told a crowd gathered in Lakeland, Florida, last week that he would ensure the United States had “crystal clear, crystal clean” water if he were elected president. It’s a promise the Republican presidential nominee has made on the campaign trail many times, but environmental activists don’t think he can deliver on it. The Trump campaign hasn’t issued much of a formal platform concerning water policy or the environment in general, and it didn’t respond to The Huffington Post’s request to view any such plans. Trump’s energy plan alludes to making clean water a “priority” but offers little detail on the topic.Because of this, environmental advocates have had to analyze comments Trump has made during campaign events and television appearances ― and many have concluded that a President Trump could have a devastating impact on the nation’s water quality and overall well-being. Some of Trump’s most specific comments on water policy have come in the form of criticizing a rule that would more specifically protect streams and wetlands under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Rule, which has been proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, is currently tied up in courts because opponents say overregulates the agricultural industry.Trump told Farm Futures magazine in September that he would “eliminate” the rule, which he believes is “unconstitutional.” Michael Kelly, communications director at Clean Water Action, a national environmental advocacy group, said Trump’s promise to ax the Clean Water Rule is deeply troubling. Streams are a source of drinking water for 117 million Americans, the EPA estimates. Trump’s other, more vague comments on a number of water-related issues have been raising eyebrows among environmental groups for some time. In May, the businessman told a crowd of supporters in Fresno, California, that “there is no drought.” His solution to the state’s water scarcity? To, simply, “start opening up the water.” (The drought, it should be noted, is very much real.)Trump told the Detroit News in September that the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, “would have never happened” if he were president, but he offered no details on why that was the case.Flint residents were deeply skeptical of Trump’s motivation when he visited the city this fall. And later that day, the candidate joked before a crowd in Canton, Ohio: “It used to be cars were made in Flint, and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico, and you can’t drink the water in Flint!” Trump has also repeatedly stated that he intends to dismantle the EPA, the federal agency that writes and enforces regulations intended to keep America’s water “crystal clean,” as it were. (An expert in environmental law has called this proposal a “ridiculous idea.”)And he has indicated that he does not believe in climate change, an issue that is linked to water issues like droughts and infrastructure challenges.Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute and a prominent water and climate analyst, said such comments are alarmingly uninformed.“His statements about water, such as they are, have been either simple platitudes or policy ‘dog whistles’ to his base,” Gleick wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Given what we’ve seen so far, I think it safe to assume that a Trump presidency would be a massive disaster to local, national, and global environmental health.” Kelly, from Clean Water Action, is also alarmed by Trump’s zeal for gutting the EPA. The agency has already been the subject of budget cuts and is at its lowest staffing level since 1989.“If you attack the EPA any more, it’s going to be impossible to actually enforce laws like the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act,” Kelly said. “The EPA keeps getting squeezed every year, and that impacts their ability to go out and do what it needs to do.” The EPA has received a great deal of criticism from both conservative-leaning policymakers and liberal-leaning environmental groups for its role in the water crisis in Flint. However, Erik Olson, a senior adviser to the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, emphasized that cutting the agency altogether would put more communities at risk because a lack of regulatory oversight and support for infrastructure maintenance can make problems like water contamination grow exponentially. Local utilities, already straining in many cases to adequately maintain their water systems, would struggle to keep up, putting peoples’ health at risk. “It’s completely illogical and contradictory,” Olson said. “You can’t slash the EPA’s budget and the investments in our water infrastructure and on one hand say we’re going to have ‘crystal clear water.’ The two don’t add up.”Ultimately, Olson added, Trump’s comments on water have had more to do with grabbing headlines than anything else. And that’s not a good sign for our environmental health.“The Trump campaign seems to really be looking for soundbite answers to problems that require real solutions,” Olson added. “But there’s nothing in his statements that back up his claim [that he wants clean water]. Everything he’s proposing is going is exactly the opposite direction.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

All of that is now in the rearview mirror.Malik Obama came out as pro-Trump in July, and pro-Trump Breitbart nabbed the scoop then — from Agence France-Presse, which interviewed Malik Obama from Nairobi, Kenya.“This Trump guy is a really cool guy and I like him because he speaks from his heart and he is so down to earth,” said the older Obama then. The wire service reported he held dual citizenship in both the U.S. and Kenya and that he has voted in American elections since the 1980s.Trump may soon have something in common with Malik Obama: HuffPost Pollster shows it’s likely the magnate will lose by significant margins come Election Day, much like when Malik Obama lost a bid for a Kenyan governorship in 2013, also by big margins.“If my brother is doing great things for people in the United States, why can’t I do great things for Kenyans here?” Malik Obama told Reuters ahead of that election, where he finished in a distant third place.CORRECTION: An earlier version mischaracterized the assemblage of women at Trump’s pre-debate press conference. Three of the four women who appeared have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Large groups of Nobel laureates endorsed Barack Obama in the past two elections.Clinton has made climate change action a key issue, calling it an “urgent threat” and a “defining challenge of our time.”Trump, on the other hand, has called climate change a hoax created by the Chinese.

Nearby, an anti-personnel mine lies half buried in a dirt road.Residents began returning on Wednesday to the village of Sheikh Amir on the road to Mosul, recaptured overnight by advancing Kurdish fighters in the early days of the biggest advance that has been launched against Islamic State.They found a village rigged with explosives and dug in with elaborate underground defenses, abandoned by the Islamists who have retreated closer to Mosul, 30 km (19 miles) to the west.Three days into the assault began on Mosul, U.S.-backed government and Kurdish forces are steadily recovering outlying territory before the big push into the city itself, expected to be the biggest battle in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.Much of Sheikh Amir had been torn down, including the house of Abbas Ahmad Hussein, a 36-year-old resident who fled the village when Sunni militants of Islamic State, also known as ISIL, ISIS or Daesh, captured it in 2014.A Shi’ite, he returned on Wednesday to survey the damage with a small truck to take out any salvageable items, but found nothing left to save amid the wreckage.“I spent all my money to build this house and Daesh destroyed it,” he said. “My brother, my uncle and my cousins live around here and they destroyed all their houses too. They destroyed all the houses belonging to the Shi’ites.”Nearby, red graffiti had been sprayed on a house: “Shi’ites are non-believers.”The village had a mixed population before Islamic State arrived, but Shi’ite houses were destroyed by the militants who consider all Shi’ites infidels who must convert or die.Mosul, the last major stronghold of Islamic State fighters in Iraq, is five times the size of any other city the militant group has held. Recapturing it would deal a decisive blow to its self-declared caliphate.But the booby trapped bunkers dug underneath this village, as well as the sectarian invective sprayed on its walls, show how difficult the advance may be. Tens of thousands of pro-government troops will face a tenacious enemy that has had years to prepare and a history of using civilians as human shields. A population of some 1.5 million will be in harm’s way.SHI’ITE MILITIA TO JOIN FIGHTThis area of northern Iraq is among the most diverse parts of the country, with many ethnic and religious groups fearful of revenge attacks and worried about the balance of power once Islamic State fighters are chased away.In an announcement that could alarm some Sunni civilians in the path of the fighting, a powerful Shi’ite paramilitary force said it would support the Iraqi army’s offensive by helping secure a town located on one of the main routes out of Mosul.The Popular Mobilization Force (PMF), a coalition of mostly Iranian-trained Shi’ite militias, said late on Tuesday it would back government forces advancing towards Tal Afar, about 55 km west of Mosul.The PMF includes thousands of battle-hardened fighters with powerful political allies in Baghdad. They have been accused of carrying out killings and kidnappings in other areas freed from Islamic State, although they deny such abuse is pervasive.Iraqi officials want to keep them off the main battlefields in Mosul to avoid alarming Sunni Muslim residents.Taking Tal Afar would in effect cut off the escape route for militants wanting to head into neighboring Syria and would please the Iran-backed army of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which accuses the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State coalition of planning to allow the jihadists such a safe passage.But it could also hamper the escape of civilians from Mosul, who must be persuaded that it is safe to leave. Washington is keen to limit the Shi’ite militias’ role.The U.S.-led military coalition providing air and ground support for the Mosul offensive said it would not assist PMF units.“As far as the Shi’ite PMF, the coalition only supports those elements that are under the direct command and control of the Iraqi security forces ― and the Shi’ite PMF are not,” said Major General Gary Volesky, the commander of U.S.-led coalition ground forces in the fight against Islamic State.“As far as what the Shi’ite PMF’s role is, again, that is up to the government of Iraq and we (advise) them on our recommendations,” Volesky said. “But at the end of the day, that is the government of Iraq’s decision.”Tal Afar’s pre-war population of 150,0000 to 200,000 was a mix of Sunni and Shi’ite ethnic Turkmens until Shi’ites fled the town after Islamic State arrived.“The Iranians and the (PMF) plan to take Tal Afar because of the Shi’ite significance and use that as a way to angle in to Mosul,” said a senior Iraqi official who asked not to be identified. “But they also want to use it as a way to angle into the Syria fight.” SECTARIAN DIVISIONSU.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday it would be a difficult fight but Islamic State “will be defeated in Mosul”. He hopes to bolster his legacy by seizing back as much territory as he can from Islamic State before he leaves office in January.A total of 20 villages were taken from the militants east, south and southeast of Mosul by early Tuesday, according to statements from the two forces.Islamic State said on Monday its fighters had targeted the attacking forces with 10 suicide bombs and that their foes had surrounded five villages but not taken them. None of the reports could be independently verified.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters on Tuesday that it was known that civilians in Mosul were being used as human shields.Iraqi government forces are mostly fighting south of Mosul and were trying on Wednesday to clear the region of Shora, 40 km (25 miles) south of the city, a military statement said. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were deployed on the eastern and northern frontlines, 20 to 25 km from the city.“The PMF will be backing the security forces on the western front (..) along two axes. The first is Tal Afar and the second is to support the forces going into the center of Mosul,” a statement on the PMF website said.Iraqi officials and residents of Mosul say Islamic State is preventing people from leaving the city but civilians are fleeing from outlying districts and villages.The United Nations says that in a worst case scenario 1 million people could be displaced by the Mosul campaign, requiring emergency housing and food. It has warned that some 100,000 people may arrive in Syria from the Mosul area.Still, most of the people from the area say they are waiting only for the fighting to end so that they can come home.In Sheikh Ahmed, around the corner from the ruined house of Shi’ite villager Abbas Ahmad Hussein, a 47-year-old Sunni shepherd named Ali had also returned to check on his house.It was relatively intact although some items had been stolen, Ali said.“When I came to the edge of the village I didn’t want to come in,” he said. “I was shocked by the destruction. It made me sick.”Asked if Shi’ites and Sunnis could live together in the village again the future, Ali said: “Inshallah” (God willing).“I have more Shi’ite friends than Sunni friends,” Ali said. “Daesh is a threat to all humanity.”(Additional reporting by Maher Chmaytelli in Baghdad, writing by Peter Graff, editing by Timothy Heritage)"

It was far from the first time her town had endured a barrage of terror from the self-described Islamic State, which was then holed up one town over.But that day, March 8, would bring a different kind of terror. Fatima’s mother, Zeynep, sprinted toward the front door when she heard the familiar sound of rocket fire. “Fatima! Fatima!” she screamed, searching for her daughter.And there she was, her little girl, standing in front of a rocket filled with mustard agent. Fatima would die one day later along with two other children, their small bodies and organs failing due to toxic chemical exposure. Zeynep survived, but the chemicals disfigured her arms, chest and neck.As U.S.-backed Iraqi and Kurdish forces move toward Mosul, Iraq, in a massive operation launched Monday, there’s growing concern that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, will use chemical weapons to defend its last major stronghold in Iraq’s second-largest city.“We believe they will use more chemical operations as the Mosul operation starts,” said Brig. Gen. Hajar Ismail, director of coordination and relations at the Kurdistan Regional Government’s Ministry of Peshmerga, in an interview this month. “We believe Daesh is weaker than in the past, so they need to defend themselves with mine, IEDs and chemical weapons,” he added, using another term for the Islamic State.Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Syrian civilians have also come under fire from ISIS’s chemical weapons. The militant group has used chemicals over 15 times against Peshmerga forces, according to Ismail. The WorldPost could not independently confirm that number, though a handful of those attacks were covered in local and international press.Ismail says the Peshmerga have between 12,000 and 15,000 gas masks ― not nearly enough for every fighter. The WorldPost only saw a handful of gas masks near the frontlines on Monday, day one of the Mosul operation. ISIS shell fragments are now regularly being tested for chemical agents, one U.S. official told Reuters.U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have targeted ISIS’s chemical weapons sites throughout the year. Last month, in the lead-up to the Mosul offensive, a dozen U.S. warplanes bombed an Iraqi factory that officials say ISIS had converted into a chemical weapons plant. Since militants fired two shells at U.S. and Iraqi forces at Qayyarah Airfield West on Sept. 20, ISIS’s chemical weapons have drawn more attention. When the first laboratory test of the shells came back positive for mustard agent, panic ensued ― and some news outlets dubbed it the first chemical weapons attack against U.S. troops since World War I. But later, definitive tests concluded that it was not mustard agent, according to military sources. U.S. forces nevertheless say they’re on high alert, and are prepared for potential chemical weapons attacks as the Mosul offensive escalates. The push to take back Mosul from ISIS militants is the biggest military operation against the group since it seized large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014. Tens of thousands of Iraqi government forces, Kurdish fighters, Sunni tribesmen, Shiite militias and other groups are working in concert to drive ISIS out of the last remaining major city it holds in Iraq.Kurdish and Iraqi forces have met with heavy resistance as ISIS deploys numerous suicide bombers and litters villages with IEDs to slow their advance. The prospect of ISIS using chemical weapons adds another dangerous dimension to the battle, and shows how far the militant group is willing to go to maintain its grip on the city.But although ISIS chemical attacks have killed civilians in Syria and Iraq, experts say the group may not be capable of killing a large number of people using chemical weapons. Many victims of ISIS chemical attacks are children and infants, who are less able to cope with the toxicity.On Wednesday, U.S. officials also downplayed ISIS’s ability to produce chemical weapons. So far, the militant group has used sulfur mustard in its attacks, which is an agent banned under international conventions. Sulfur mustard causes skin to blister and can burn the respiratory tract if it’s inhaled ― which can be fatal. But experts also point out that its effects are local, and ISIS would need hundreds to thousands of shells for a large-scale attack. Still, the group may find the use of chemical weapons valuable for other reasons ― for slowing down military operations against its fighters and as a means of psychological warfare, for example.“Chemical weapons represent what is called a dreaded risk ― a risk that people instinctively react to with a high degree of fear and panic because it is invisible, insidious, and indiscriminate,” said Gregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University.“The psychological impact is one of the main reasons to use chemical weapons: Even if they only kill a few, they will terrify large numbers.”The threat of ISIS chemical weapons carries additional weight for Kurds, who were the victims of one of the most notorious gas attacks in history in 1988. As many as 5,000 Kurdish civilians died when Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein dropped bombs containing sarin and mustard agent on the Iraqi town of Halabja. Despite Iraq’s history with deadly chemical weapons, many Iraqis do not know how to respond in the event of an attack, says Dr. Majed Mohammed, a virology and molecular cell biologist at Duhok University. “Iraq is always unstable,” he laments. “Everyone has weapons. It’s important to learn about chemical weapons and how how to detect and protect, especially those who live on the border with [ISIS-controlled areas].”Mohammed and his wife, Dr. Mauida Hasoon, an aquatic virology researcher, are trying to promote awareness and eventually, set up a chemical and biological weapons research program in Iraq. But, like many researchers and academics in the cash-strapped country, they lack the necessary funding.After the attack on their town, some Taza residents waited hours before seeking help, as their symptoms slowly worsened. Nurses from Taza’s eight-bed clinic say women are now giving birth to babies with birth defects. Many people who came in direct contact with the chemical agent still suffer from non-life-threatening symptoms like skin ailments. But worst of all, they say, is the psychological toll the chemical weapons had on the town. “When I itch, I think about it, said Mohammed Khalil Askar, a 37-year-old local fireman suffering from skin rashes since the attack. “I can’t sleep.”He says neighbors and friends are obsessing over maladies, blaming everything on the attack. “They’ll pay a ton of money to get tests done to make sure it’s not because of the chemical weapons,” he said. “It’s haunting them.” Zaynep weeps when she speaks of Fatima’s death, saying her family is “broken.” She was pregnant during the attack, and her day-old baby boy now sleeps peacefully next to her. So far, she says, he’s healthy. But she’s consumed with guilt. She stood helplessly by as her daughter slowly died at the hospital.“I’m thinking about it everyday,” she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. “I cannot forget my daughter.”Sophia Jones and Kamiran Sadoun reported from Taza.

Like other parts of the Middle East, it is historically multi-ethnic and multi-religious. While many of those who now fight hard to kick the so-called Islamic State out of Mosul pay lip service to the beauty of this cultural richness, their proposals for governance of the region after ISIS are merely scenarios for more ethnic and religious strife. A more logical solution, put into practice already in northern Syria, is hardly ever discussed.The potentially problematic future of Mosul and Nineveh province is mentioned in practically every background article that is now being published about the battle for Mosul, which finally began on Oct. 17. The issue at hand is how to make sure that the fragile coalition of irregular fighters and official and semi-official armies, both domestic and foreign, doesn’t unravel as soon as the enemy is defeated and lead to yet more strife and retribution.For many, this issue boils down to the question of how to divide Iraq or how to divide the Nineveh lands. Two possible solutions are often discussed. One is to transform Nineveh Province into an autonomous region, like Kurdistan in northern Iraq. The second is to divide Nineveh into smaller regions that would be governed autonomously by designated groups, such as Yazidis, Christians, Turkmen, Sunni Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shiite Arabs.These two proposed solutions are problematic because they divide people along ethnic and religious lines. One group would be in charge of the others.The former governor of Nineveh Province, Atheel al-Nujaifi, is an advocate of an autonomous Nineveh. A nationalist Sunni Arab, he leads one of the armed forces participating in the liberation of Mosul. But if Nineveh was autonomous, how many rights would, for example, the Turkmen have? How would the rights of non-Sunnis be guaranteed?Kurdistan does fairly well when it comes to minority rights. Christians, for example, have always been safe under Iraqi Kurdish rule, and many refugees, including small ethnic and religious groups, have found refuge in Kurdistan since ISIS barged into neighboring provinces. But this safety is not inherent to Iraq’s pseudo-state system; it is rooted in the Kurdish experience of brutal suppression at the hands of former President Saddam Hussein. It is not certain that Nineveh, under Sunni Arab rule, would be hospitable to minorities.What about the idea of smaller autonomous cantons, or territorial divisions, for different groups? Assyrians, Turkmen, Yazidis ― all sorting out their own affairs. But problems immediately arise in this scenario. Turkmen are predominately Sunni. Do they need their own region, or should they move to the Sunni area? What about Shiite Turkmen? The Yazidis are ethnically Kurdish. Should they join a Kurdish region, or would they feel safe among Sunnis? Do the Kurds need a region at all, since perhaps they could just move to Kurdistan?Such a system leads to seemingly unsolvable issues.

Like other parts of the Middle East, it is historically multi-ethnic and multi-religious. While many of those who now fight hard to kick the so-called Islamic State out of Mosul pay lip service to the beauty of this cultural richness, their proposals for governance of the region after ISIS are merely scenarios for more ethnic and religious strife. A more logical solution, put into practice already in northern Syria, is hardly ever discussed.The potentially problematic future of Mosul and Nineveh province is mentioned in practically every background article that is now being published about the battle for Mosul, which finally began on Oct. 17. The issue at hand is how to make sure that the fragile coalition of irregular fighters and official and semi-official armies, both domestic and foreign, doesn’t unravel as soon as the enemy is defeated and lead to yet more strife and retribution.For many, this issue boils down to the question of how to divide Iraq or how to divide the Nineveh lands. Two possible solutions are often discussed. One is to transform Nineveh Province into an autonomous region, like Kurdistan in northern Iraq. The second is to divide Nineveh into smaller regions that would be governed autonomously by designated groups, such as Yazidis, Christians, Turkmen, Sunni Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shiite Arabs.These two proposed solutions are problematic because they divide people along ethnic and religious lines. One group would be in charge of the others.The former governor of Nineveh Province, Atheel al-Nujaifi, is an advocate of an autonomous Nineveh. A nationalist Sunni Arab, he leads one of the armed forces participating in the liberation of Mosul. But if Nineveh was autonomous, how many rights would, for example, the Turkmen have? How would the rights of non-Sunnis be guaranteed?Kurdistan does fairly well when it comes to minority rights. Christians, for example, have always been safe under Iraqi Kurdish rule, and many refugees, including small ethnic and religious groups, have found refuge in Kurdistan since ISIS barged into neighboring provinces. But this safety is not inherent to Iraq’s pseudo-state system; it is rooted in the Kurdish experience of brutal suppression at the hands of former President Saddam Hussein. It is not certain that Nineveh, under Sunni Arab rule, would be hospitable to minorities.What about the idea of smaller autonomous cantons, or territorial divisions, for different groups? Assyrians, Turkmen, Yazidis ― all sorting out their own affairs. But problems immediately arise in this scenario. Turkmen are predominately Sunni. Do they need their own region, or should they move to the Sunni area? What about Shiite Turkmen? The Yazidis are ethnically Kurdish. Should they join a Kurdish region, or would they feel safe among Sunnis? Do the Kurds need a region at all, since perhaps they could just move to Kurdistan?Such a system leads to seemingly unsolvable issues. It is impossible to decide for whole communities that often have mixed identities which group they should feel the most loyal to. Moreover, even in “exclusive” territorial divisions, there will always be minorities – unless you ethnically or religiously cleanse them, which is what nobody in his right mind wants.This system would also do no justice to groups that have nearly disappeared from Nineveh since ISIS’s arrival, such as the Chaldeans and the Shabaks.

The 35-year-old has yet to speak out about the horrifying robbery incident that occurred Oct. 3 in Paris. On Monday, Kardashian’s assistant Stephanie Sheppard posted a note on behalf of the reality star. “Hey guys,” the note on Kardashian’s app said. “So you may have noticed we haven’t updated the app in a couple weeks. Keeks is taking some much needed time off.”During an appearance on “Ellen” last week, Khloe Kardashian said her sister was “not doing that well” after the incident and making a lot of adjustments to her life. “I mean, it’s incredibly traumatic what happened to her, but our family is super close and great and we’ll get through it together, and we do appreciate all of your guys’ love and support,” Khloe said. “And it will take time.

Some of the materials he used include foam board, paper cups, spray paint and plastic bendable straws. He told The Huffington Post he spent about $30 on the project.Harley helped along her dad the way, from test fittings to the finishing touches.“She was most excited about the little necklace beads and straws she helped me glue on the Falcon,” Ignacio said.The creative dad has especially loved experiencing “Star Wars” again with his daughter and passing down his appreciation for the massive franchise, Millennium Falcon and all.“I grew up with a deeper understanding of teamwork, hopefulness and being good because of ‘Star Wars,’” Ignacio said. “It’s great to see the same things resonate with her.”See more photos of Harley’s Millennium Falcon below.H/T Babble"

And she has more than the usual simple burden of trying to win an election.Perhaps it’s unfair ― politics is unfair ― but the state of the country and its tattered politics requires that the Democratic nominee do more than just eke out a victory.Clinton has to win BIG, so she can at least have the chance to protect public trust in the machinery of elections, in the ability of the federal government to function, and in the credibility of American democracy.She has to close the sale, on her own terms and on her own behalf.If she doesn’t ― if she performs poorly in Wednesday’s debate and in the last three weeks of the campaign ― she risks a close result that could leave GOP nominee Donald Trump wounded but unbowed, and unwilling to accept the results of the Election Day count.If she doesn’t, as president she will face a once-again divided government in Washington with no mandate and no power to deal.“Even if she brings in a lot of Democrats with her, even if the Democrats take the Senate and even the House, it’s not going to be easy,” said Norman Ornstein, a leading author of DC governance. “But without any of that, it is hard to see how she gets anything done.”The Clinton campaign is fully aware of the challenge ― and the opportunity.Campaign and Democratic Party officials are working to expand the battlefield, both in terms of states Clinton might be able to win and in Senate and House races that previously were not thought close.Even Texas, astoundingly, might now be in play in the presidential race, thanks to growing Hispanic clout that the Bush family well understands ― but that Trump has crudely dismissed.If Democrats can win the Senate ― let alone the House ― a President Clinton would be able to bargain from a position of strength. And if Trump and the GOP lose badly ― very badly ― the party’s rejectionist front might be weakened enough to allow the tradition of bipartisan dealmaking to regain some momentum.In other words, Washington might work, a little.Clinton currently leads Trump by decent and sometimes growing margins in virtually every national poll. Big-data prognosticators, including the legendary bookmakers on the Las Vegas Strip, give her nine in 10 chances of winning the election. Her modest lead in the popular vote is amplified by the state-by-state math of the Electoral College into a projected large win.Though trends rarely change dramatically this late in the game, it’s also true that three weeks is a lifetime in American politics, especially in the rapid-metabolism era of Twitter and Facebook.And that is Clinton’s challenge, starting with the debate: to keep the trend going.At this point, very little new (or worse) can be said or revealed about Trump. He is what he is. His supporters are fierce, not necessarily because they love him personally, but because they see him as a heat-seeking missile aimed at destroying the many political and financial establishments and elites they despise.The rest of America, (and that is clearly the majority) thinks that Trump is unhinged, unqualified and unfit to be president.In other words, Trump has all but disqualified himself.But that, in turn, does not mean the country is eager to accept, let alone embrace, Clinton.As much as most voters like Clinton’s policies ― her support for health care, education and women’s rights, among other things ― they see her as the two-faced, manipulative engineer of a corrupt bargain between politics and corporate money.Even Clinton’s own advisers worry that she hasn’t not conveyed an exciting, ennobling vision of what her ascension would bring to America. So far, that hasn’t mattered much, as she has been able to keep the focus on the shortcomings of Trump.But Clinton still needs a positive grand theme of her own, and has been unable to gain traction with one.Meanwhile, Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks is publishing a steady stream of Clinton campaign emails unearthed (probably, the FBI says, by Russian hackers). The emails add a vivid side narration to the Clinton camp’s reputation for all-too-clever behind-the-scenes maneuvering for power and money. No one email is a “smoking gun,” but the overall smell is sour.Young voters and minorities, who should be breaking down doors with eagerness to vote for Clinton, aren’t ― at least yet. Nor are suburbanites of all colors and kinds who can’t stomach Trump, but who are having trouble supporting Clinton. Clinton must win over voters such as Ana Santos, a fourth-year student here at UNLV, where the debate will be held.“I’m undecided,” Santos told me in the UNLV student union on Tuesday. The 21-year-old Las Vegas native, who is studying politics and communication, told me she “could never vote for Trump.”Nor could she vote for either minor-party candidate, Libertarian Gary Johnson or the Green Party’s Jill Stein.So she’s for Hillary, right?“Well that is why I am undecided ― between voting and not voting,” Santos said. “I like some of her positions, but I don’t trust her. The emails … her whole history. I don’t know if I am going to vote at all.“I’ll watch the debate.”So will about 80 million other Americans.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The respondents also answered demographic questions, including whether or not they had children, and if so, whether they had sons, daughters or both.“The gender of voters’ children is rarely tracked by pollsters as an indicator of how people vote,” wrote Washington Post polling manager Scott Clement. “But a slew of Republicans citing respect for daughters in criticizing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s hot-mic comments raised the question of what difference, if any, having a daughter makes in the way people view this issue or the campaign overall.”The poll results suggest that it may indeed make a difference, but this conclusion is limited to parents who only have daughters. While 47 percent of all likely voters supported Clinton, that number rose to 58 percent when looking at respondents with daughters but no sons (versus 37 percent for Trump).Parents with both sons and daughters were no more likely to support Clinton than the overall pool of likely voters, and for those with sons only, the percentage of Clinton supporters fell to 40 percent. “Clinton’s standing among parents is notably on par with her support among non-parents (56 percent), a group dominated by younger people who tend to lean Democratic,” Clement explained.Still, the same poll indicated that parents of only daughters were only slightly more likely than other voters to say Trump’s treatment of women is “a legitimate issue” in the presidential election. They were no more apt to say that the GOP nominee’s infamous videotape comments made them less likely to vote for him and no more likely to say his comments “went beyond how men typically talk about women.” They were, however, slightly more likely to say Trump’s apology for the videotape comments was “not sincere.”Though analysis suggests that any discrepancies among parents may have more to do with the partisan loyalties of respondents than the sex of their children, it remains true that parenthood can have a profound impact on a person’s political views and party affiliation. Trump hasn’t exactly made his case for being an ideal candidate for parents ― between his horrendous treatment of breastfeeding mothers, problematic maternity leave plan, promotion of bullying and fear in schools and habit of scaring the bejesus out of baby Republicans.Yes, baby Republicans. We know.H/T The CutEditor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The pro-Clinton campaign created the video, titled “It’s Not OK,” in response to Donald Trump’s recently resurfaced hot mic comments and the accusations of sexual assault the GOP nominee faces from more than a dozen women. The video features dozens of women, including celebrities like Rose McGowan and Amber Tamblyn, describing a time they were sexually harassed or assaulted by men. Each woman has a story of verbal harassment to go along with the sexual assault she’s experienced.Their riveting testimonies remind viewers that Trump’s “locker room banter” is anything but “just words.” Warning: Stories in the below video may be triggering to some readers. “I think people like Donald Trump will never understand the correlation that women understand between words and actions,” Tamblyn ― who’s been an outspoken advocate for sexual assault survivors ― says. “Especially when you’re a man in a position of power and you talk that way publicly and you say those things. You are telling the world, you are telling everyone, that it’s OK to behave that way.” As one woman says in the video in response to Trump’s “grab ‘em by the pussy” comments: “It’s not ‘just words,’ it happens every day. It’s happened to me more times than I can count.”  Liz Garbus, the Oscar-nominated filmmaker who directed “It’s Not OK,” explained in a press release why featuring these women’s voices is so important.“After the release of the Trump Access Hollywood tapes, I felt it was important to share the OTHER side of the story ― stories of women being objectified, kissed, groped, and humiliated by the words and actions of others. These words and actions have a huge effect on women’s lives. And we are here to say, together, in one loud voice, that this is NOT OKAY.”As another young woman in the video asked: “You’re taking about harassing us, like that’s OK?” Spoiler alert: It’s not ― and many American women won’t stand for it.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Need help?

They’re taking advantage of it. On Sunday, the Virginia senator and running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton gave a speech entirely in Spanish at a Spanish-language church service ― a first for a candidate on a presidential ticket. The next day, he appeared on the Spanish-language show “Noticias Telemundo” to attempt another appeal to Latinos, including by promising a push in the first 100 days of Clinton’s presidency for immigration reform and a jobs package.“Latino culture is one of the most important things in our country right now because we have had Hispanic roots since the beginning. ... Spanish was the language of our country before English,” he said in the interview with José Díaz-Balart, according to a translated transcript. “It’s important to remember that, and celebrate it,” Kaine continued. “And also, the issues important to Latinos are the same: education, economic development and, especially, respect. In this campaign the question of respect is very important, because the two sides of the campaign have very different opinions about the Latino community.” Latinos, particularly Mexicans and those of Mexican descent, have been the subject of much discussion during the current election, both as voters to win over and targets for attacks from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The GOP nominee began his campaign by accusing Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S., criticized rival and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for speaking Spanish and accused a U.S.-born federal judge of being biased against him because the judge’s parents were from Mexico. Clinton, meanwhile, has attempted to appeal to Latinos to the point of at times veering into “Hispandering.” In addition to Spanish-language ads, her campaign has done advertising that blends English and Spanish, a nod to the fact that about 60 percent of English-speaking Hispanics in the U.S. speak Spanish as well. She is leading Trump significantly in polls of Latino voters. “We want to make sure that our campaign is accessible to everyone and that we’re meeting voters where we are,” Clinton campaign Latino vote director Lorella Praeli said on a call with reporters on Tuesday. Kaine, who learned Spanish while living in Honduras to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries, has frequently conducted interviews in the language. He is right about Spanish being an early part of U.S. history, although it was not the only language that was here before English. Spanish colonizers first brought their language to the area known today as the continental United States in the 16th century, founding the settlement of St. Augustine in modern-day Florida in 1565 and exploring much of the country’s Southwest and California.That legacy is visible in the Spanish names of many of our states ― Nevada, Florida, Colorado ― as well as a host of loan words that Americans now commonly use in English, like bodega, mustang or ranch. But even well into the colonial period, it was more likely that those living in America would speak one of the region’s roughly 300 indigenous languages, rather than Spanish or English.“When I’m at an event with people I want to speak their language and, especially, listen to them in their own language,” Kaine told Díaz-Balart.

75,POLITICS,Most Republicans Don't Think Sex Assault Claims Should Disqualify Trump -- Even If They're True,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sex-assault-claims-poll_us_5806432be4b0180a36e66a8b,Opinions are deeply divided along party lines.,2016-10-18,Forty-five percent of Americans who’ve been sexually assaulted say they personally identify with Donald Trump's accusers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58064a5b170000c316accb27.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are more likely than not to consider the sexual assault allegations  against Donald Trump credible, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. But opinions are deeply divided along party lines, with many Republicans saying that, even if true, the allegations aren’t enough to disqualify him from the presidency.Americans say by a 17-point margin ― 43 percent to 26 percent ― that they consider the allegations of sexual assault and harassment levied against Trump to be generally credible, while another 31 percent haven’t heard enough or aren’t sure.If the allegations are true, 44 percent of Americans say that should disqualify Trump from the presidency. Twenty-seven percent say that it would be relevant to the election, but not disqualifying, while 22 percent believe it wouldn’t be relevant to the election at all.For some people, the allegations have personal implications as well as political ones. Twenty-eight percent of Americans say that they personally identify at least somewhat with the women who’ve made accusations against Trump. Among Americans who say that they’ve personally experienced a sexual assault, that number rises to 45 percent, with 31 percent saying that they feel “a lot” of kinship with the women in question.The survey also found that most Americans ― 53 percent ― say that conversations about groping and kissing women without consent, which Trump was filmed bragging about, are not normal for men. Trump referred to his boasts after the tape emerged this month as “locker room banter.”Just 26 percent think Trump respects women, while 59 percent say he does not. Yet, the latest news seems to have done little to shake the confidence of the minority who still believe that he does. Among registered voters, 31 percent say they believe Trump respects women, virtually unchanged by either the revelation of the 2005 tape or the accusations of sexual assault this month.A main reason for that is partisanship. While some Republicans have deserted Trump in the wake of the most recent scandals, many are siding with him. Republicans are 34 points likelier than Democrats, 51 percent to 17 percent, to say that Trump’s comments were normal for men. They are 49 points likelier, 55 percent to 6 percent, to say that Trump respects women.Those partisan divides ― which are far larger than the divides on other demographics, such as gender ― extend to the latest allegations. Seventy percent of Democrats, but just 12 percent of Republicans think the sexual assault allegations against Trump are credible.Seventy percent of Democrats think that, if true, the allegations are disqualifying, with 21 percent saying they’re relevant but not disqualifying. Just 3 percent believe that they’re not relevant. Although 19 percent of Republicans think the claims would be disqualifying, a 39 percent plurality say that, even if it were proven that Trump sexually assaulted women, it would not be relevant to the election.Even responses among political independents are highly dependent on which party they feel more of a connection with. Most independents lean toward one party or another, with those who favor Democrats, for instance, 78 points likelier than those who tilt toward Republicans to consider the allegations against Trump credible.Partisan divides go deeper than just the response to Trump. Feelings about the broader topic of sexual assault are also significantly polarized. As the political scientist Michael Tesler noted this week, Republicans ― especially those who supported Trump in the primaries ― were already more likely than others to believe that “women who complain about harassment often cause more problems than they solve.”In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, Americans say by a 42-point margin, 63 percent to 21 percent, that sexual assaults that go unreported or unpunished are a bigger problem than false accusations of sexual assault. That sentiment extends to a majority across party lines, but Democrats are still 20 points likelier than Republicans to consider unreported assaults a bigger issue.While 92 percent of Americans say touching someone’s genitals without consent is sexual assault, Democrats are 24 points likelier than Republicans, 73 percent to 49 percent, to consider kissing someone without their consent to be sexual assault.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 14-Oct. 17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

76,POLITICS,A Plea To The Fraternal Order Of Police: Take Back Your Trump Endorsement,Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fraternal-order-police-sexual-assualt_us_58063f17e4b0180a36e66553,Trump has boasted of committing crimes against women with impunity. That's not something the police should endorse.,2016-10-18,"Donald Trump speaks to retired and active law enforcement personnel at a Fraternal Order of Police lodge during a campaign stop in Statesville, N.C., on Aug. 18.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the GOP nominee for president having boasted about his ability to sexually assault women with impunity, a leading women’s group is asking the Fraternal Order of Police to back off of its endorsement of Donald J. Trump. Officers take pride in defending the good work they do on behalf of crime victims, particularly in the face of heightened criticism. Trump and the national FOP were to appear at a rally together in Philadelphia on Oct. 10, but the event was canceled after audio of Trump’s lewd comments surfaced the Friday before.The FOP cited a scheduling conflict, but the event has yet to be rescheduled, suggesting that internal dissent around the endorsement is growing. HuffPost reached out to the FOP the day after the remarks were made public. Repeated requests for comment since then have gone unreturned.NARAL Pro-Choice America, meanwhile, is urging the FOP not to defend an alleged assailant. (You can sign the petition here.) To have a police group hold a public event championing Trump after at least a dozen women say he assaulted them puts victims in an awkward situation. The Washington Post published audio of Trump bragging that because he is famous, he can kiss and grope women ― “grab them by the pussy,” in his words ― without their consent. At the last presidential debate, Trump said that the boast was merely “locker room talk,” and that he had never actually done what he claimed.Of the millions of those watching that night, an untold number knew for a fact he was lying, and several began telling their stories publicly ― to The New York Times, People Magazine, The Huffington Post, The Guardian and elsewhere.The FOP also represents thousands of African-American police officers, many of whom have complained publicly that a largely white leadership pushed through the endorsement without getting consensus.“At a time when we’re all trying to unite and bring the world to a calm, the last person we need is a Donald Trump,” said David Fisher, president of the greater Philadelphia chapter of the National Black Police Association. “And the last thing the police need is to hitch its wagon to a Donald Trump.”Calling on the FOP to rescind its endorsement is a tall ask, but it’s one worth making, as it might at least put enough pressure on the FOP that it decides not to reschedule its event with Trump. That alone would send a strong signal.“No matter who commits it, sexual assault is a serious issue and a serious crime,” said NARAL President Ilyse Hogue. “Women need to trust the police to investigate sexual abuse claims ― not to endorse someone accused of them.”To join the effort, add your name here and share the petition. The signatures will be delivered to Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the FOP.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 2018. That is, if his wife approves.“So, I’ve made my decision. I’m going to run,” the outspoken conservative said on WPRO radio Tuesday morning. “But ― but― I haven’t talked to Shonda, my wife. And ultimately it’s going to come down to how her and I feel this would affect our marriage and our kids.”Schilling has openly discussed running for office as a Republican in recent months. The future Hall of Famer has even hinted that he wants to run for president in 2024.Warren likely won’t be too worried about the matchup: In September, she led the former Boston Red Sox star 47 percent to 28 percent in a hypothetical race, a poll from UMass Amherst, WBZ TV, and WBZ NewsRadio found.A spokesperson for Warren declined to comment on Schilling’s Senate plans.After retiring from baseball, Schilling became an analyst at ESPN, where his political views and penchant for sharing offensive memes on social media constantly landed him in trouble with his employer. ESPN suspended him in August 2015 for sharing a meme that compared Muslims to Nazis.The network fired Schilling in April after he shared an offensive meme about transgender people ― an apparent reference to the controversy around North Carolina’s anti-transgender bathroom law.Schilling is also a big supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The former pitcher has repeatedly called for the imprisonment of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and said she “should be buried under a jail somewhere” after she was accused of including classified State Department emails on a private server.During the appearance, Schilling also refused to apologize for his role in the failure of 38 Studios, a video game company he launched that received a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island before collapsing.This post has been updated to note a Warren spokesperson declined to comment."

I promise you,” McCain said during an interview with a Pennsylvania radio station. A spokeswoman later in the day tried to walk back some of McCain’s remarks.Grassley, whose job on the judiciary committee gives him oversight over confirmation hearings, gave credit to that later “modification” by McCain’s staff.“The modification is the right thing to do,” he said. “I think we have a responsibility to very definitely vet ― if you want to use the word vet ― whoever nominee that person puts forward.”Grassley then praised his party nominee Donald Trump’s lengthy list of pre-vetted candidates to the nation’s high court, whom he said could be regarded as “strict constructionists” ― a term for jurists who have a textualist understanding of the Constitution.Clinton’s future nominees, on the other hand, will be “judicial activists,” Grassley said ― using a decades-old epithet Republican politicians like to wield for Democratic appointees to judicial vacancies. Clinton herself has said she’d like to appoint justices “who understand the way the world really works” and have “real-life experience.”Both presidential candidates are expected to get questions about their vision for the Supreme Court at Wednesday’s third and final debate before Election Day.To that end, Bloomberg’s Greg Stohr has compiled a list of pointed questions about the court both candidates should be able to answer in front of the American public."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/580663b7170000bc16accbb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The students of America have spoken, and they want Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to be the next commander in chief of the United States, according to the results of Scholastic News mock election released Tuesday. The results show Clinton dominating Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, earning 52 percent of the vote from K-12 students. Trump received 35 percent of the vote. The rest of the students wrote in other choices, including Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and less conventional figures, like Kanye West. Students mailed in ballots or voted online between August and early October.Clinton beat Trump in a number of key battleground states like Ohio and Florida. Here’s a map of the breakdown: Although about 153,000 kids from every state and the District of Columbia cast votes, the mock election is not scientifically representative of the U.S. population. The purpose of the activity is encourage civic engagement among students. Still, Scholastic News says kids have only failed to accurately predict the outcome of the presidential election twice since 1940 ― in 1948, when Harry Truman faced Thomas Dewey, and in 1960, when John F. Kennedy faced Richard Nixon. This presidential election has been particularly challenging for teachers. Racially charged bullying has been on the rise in America’s classrooms as a result of Trump’s campaign, according to an April report from the Southern Poverty Law Center ― a phenomenon known as “The Trump Effect.”Furthermore, some of the most newsworthy moments of the election cycle have involved inappropriate language. After a 2005 video of Trump saying his fame allows him to “grab [women] by the pussy” came to light, teachers struggled to talk about current events in their classrooms. When 11th-grade educator Jarrett DeMent talked to students in his civics and government classes about the tape, he told them they were not allowed to repeat specific language used by the Republican nominee. “Being that they are juniors in high school, I told them, ‘If you really want to know the exact quote, I’m sure you can find it online. But as far as what we’re talking about in class, we’re not going to exactly quote it,’” DeMent previously told The Huffington Post. A student reporter for Scholastic News said he struggles with similar issues. Erik Weibel, 14, reports on political news as part of the Scholastic News Press Corps. He recently covered on a Trump rally, where he interviewed attendees about the 2005 tape. When he wrote an article about the event, he did not repeat what Trump specifically said in the video.“Kids reading the article, they need to know this about the candidate. They need to know he said mean things about women. But they don’t need to know exactly what he said,” Erik said. “I try to tell the truth, not necessarily sugarcoat the truth, but make it a more age-appropriate truth.” While Erik, who goes to school in Pennsylvania, would not disclose his own political leanings, he says most of his peers seem to be Trump supporters.

The fashion magazine has never endorsed a candidate before. But in an editorial published Tuesday, the magazine’s editors said they broke tradition due to the “profound stakes” of Donald Trump’s candidacy.“Vogue has no history of political endorsements,” reads the editorial. “Editors in chief have made their opinions known from time to time, but the magazine has never spoken in an election with a single voice. Given the profound stakes of this one, and the history that stands to be made, we feel that should change.”The editorial continues, “We understand that Clinton has not always been a perfect candidate, yet her fierce intelligence and considerable experience are reflected in policies and positions that are clear, sound, and hopeful.”The editors cite support for Clinton’s positions on immigration, LGBT rights, health care and women’s rights, as well as the historic prospect of electing the first female president.“It has taken nearly a century to bring us to the brink of a woman leading our country for the first time,” they write. “Let’s put this election behind us and become the America we want to be: optimistic, forward-looking, and modern.”As the editors note, the endorsement is unlikely to surprise many people. Anna Wintour, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, hosted fundraisers for President Barack Obama and has reportedly consulted Clinton on her campaign trail fashion.But that Vogue, best known for its couture fashion spreads and glossy advertisements, decided to wade into the 2016 fray says a lot about the stakes of this election. Several other publications have made similarly tradition-breaking endorsements this cycle. Wired also backed Clinton in its first-ever presidential endorsement, making the case against Trump’s “dark and atavistic” vision for America. (Wired and Vogue are both owned by Condé Nast.) Foreign Policy also made its first endorsement in its 50-year history to support Clinton, while The Atlantic’s recommendation on behalf of the Democratic nominee marked its third-ever endorsement. It’s also been a historic election cycle for newspapers. USA Today took a side for the first time ever to endorse voting against Trump. And many papers, including the Arizona Republic and the Cincinnati Enquirer, have bucked decades-long traditions of backing Republican candidates in favor of supporting Clinton.Trump, meanwhile, has received endorsements from two daily newspapers.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

A state authority is now investigating the controversial incident.The mayor of Edina, Minnesota, announced Sunday that the citation will be dismissed, following a firestorm of attention over the Oct. 12 arrest of Larnie Thomas, which was filmed and widely seen on social media.In the video, Thomas is seen arguing with an Edina police officer who accuses him of inappropriately walking in the middle of the street. The city later acknowledged in a statement that one of the surrounding sidewalks had been closed for construction. The statement nonetheless accused Thomas of being “belligerent” and refusing to obey orders.Thomas was eventually taken into custody and cited for disorderly conduct and failure to obey a traffic signal, the city said at the time.The Minneapolis NAACP had demanded that Lt. Tim Olson, the officer in the video, be suspended without pay.Mayor Jim Hovland, in responding to the NAACP’s requests, said the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will review the incident, but maintained that Olson “was following established protocol.”“However, under the circumstances, the City will review that protocol and determine how to better approach this type of incident with greater sensitivity in the future,” Hovland’s statement read. “We will work with the Edina community and invite other organizations to participate in this very important conversation. There are lessons we should and will learn from this experience.”Hovland added that Olson will remain on the job and the city will provide additional training to its police force “on implicit and explicit bias.”“We would value suggestions for specific training from the Minneapolis NAACP,” the city’s statement read.The NAACP, responding to the city’s announcement in a Facebook post Monday, stated that “this is not justice, but it is a step in the right direction.”The NAACP, in addition to calling for Olson’s suspension, had asked that the city’s mayor and police chief formally apologize, and that an independent investigation take place."

Lamb pitched in by giving Stormie’s staff a “Frozen” spin and stitching her bag by hand, and his dad made leather pieces for the costume. In total, Lamb said he spent about $150 on the materials, accessories, staff, boots and lightsaber.And it was totally worth it.

If confirmed, the two moons would be the planet’s 28th and 29th known satellites.While most moons in the solar system are named for characters in Greek mythology, most of the 27 moons of Uranus have names taken from Shakespeare, including Oberon and Titania, the two largest moons.Eight of the smaller moons are grouped so closely together that NASA said “astronomers don’t yet understand how the little moons have managed to avoid crashing into each other.”"

The executives were listed alongside nearly four dozen vice presidential candidates that a team of Clinton’s top advisers compiled, including campaign chairman John Podesta, who wrote the March 17 email. The broad list also included Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who Clinton chose as her running mate in July. Clinton, who has billed herself as a champion for women and minorities, has since taken heat for choosing a white, Christian, straight, cisgender man as her vice presidential pick. But the names pulled from the private sector, which has struggled to proportionally elevate women and minorities to top-ranked slots, represent a diverse bunch.Apple CEO Tim Cook became the first openly gay chief executive in the Fortune 500 when he came out two years ago. Coca-Cola CEO and Chairman Muhtar Kent, a Turkish-American, has said he was “very proud to have been raised as a secular Muslim.” General Motors CEO Mary Barra made history in 2013 when she became the auto giant’s first-ever female chief. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is Jewish. Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, who announced plans to step down this year, is the only black woman leading a company in the S&P 500. Coca-Cola, GM and Xerox declined to comment. Apple and Starbucks did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent Tuesday morning. The list also included three big-name philanthropists: Judith Rodin, who serves as president of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Bill and Melinda Gates, who run the world’s largest private foundation.Still, putting five executives with little or no political experience on the vice presidential list could underscores concerns over Clinton’s close corporate ties at a time when income inequality has become a core issue. Sanders’ surprise challenge during the Democratic primary propelled economic inequality to the forefront of the election, becoming a major theme of both parties’ campaigns. That Podesta also included progressive darlings such as Sanders, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) may ease those concerns. The Clinton campaign has yet to authenticate any documents that WikiLeaks, led by hacker and political provocateur Julian Assange, has leaked. "
