Security Council resolution demanding an end to settlement-building.Separately, the envoys of 10 other nations were called in to the Israeli Foreign Ministry to be reprimanded on Sunday, and Netanyahu had more harsh words for Washington over Friday’s U.N. vote.An Israeli spokesman gave no details of when Netanyahu would meet U.S. Ambassador Daniel Shapiro.The resolution was passed in the 15-member Security Council because the U.S. broke with its long-standing approach of diplomatically shielding Israel and did not wield its veto power, instead abstaining.Netanyahu put his personal imprint on Israel’s show of anger by repeating at the weekly cabinet meeting what an unidentified Israeli government official contended on Friday - that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama had conspired with the Palestinians to push for the resolution’s adoption.The White House has denied the allegation.“According to our information, we have no doubt the Obama administration initiated it (the resolution), stood behind it, coordinated the wording and demanded it be passed,” Netanyahu told the cabinet in public remarks.Another official said Netanyahu had ordered that for the coming three weeks, until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, cabinet ministers refrain from traveling to or meeting officials of countries that voted in favor of the resolution.The envoys from 10 of the 14 countries that voted for the resolution and have embassies in Israel - Britain, China, Russia, France, Egypt, Japan, Uruguay, Spain, Ukraine and New Zealand - were summoned to the Foreign Ministry.Sunday is a regular work day in Israel, but most embassies are closed, and calling in envoys on Christmas Day is highly unusual.At the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu described a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, when Israel and President-elect Donald Trump successfully pressed Egypt to drop the anti-settlement resolution it had put forward.It was resubmitted a day later by New Zealand, Senegal, Venezuela and Malaysia.“Over decades American administrations and Israeli governments disagreed about settlements, but we agreed that the security council was not the place to resolve this issue,” Netanyahu said.“We knew that going there would make negotiations harder and drive peace farther away. As I told John Kerry on Thursday, ‘Friends don’t take friends to the Security Council’,” he said, switching from Hebrew to English.Israel has pursued a policy of constructing settlements on territory it captured in a 1967 war with its Arab neighbors - the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, areas Palestinians seek for a state.Most countries view the settlement activity as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Israel disagrees, citing biblical and historical connections to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as security interests.(Additional reporting by Ori Lewis; editing by Andrew Roche)"

On Sunday, he also called for an end to “fundamentalist terrorism” in Nigeria, a reference to Boko Haram, which has killed 15,000 people and displaced more than two million during a seven-year insurgency to create an Islamic state. .Francis further appealed for an end to tensions between the government and opposition in Venezuela, for harmony in Colombia, which recently ended a civil war with FARC guerrillas, and an end to strife on the Korean peninsula and in Myanmar.(Reporting by Philip Pullella; editing by Mark Heinrich)"

They have a much better grip on reality than the Obama administration did,” he added.Gingrich then suggested the United States should consider suspending civil liberties to combat terrorism as former President Abraham Lincoln did during the Civil War.“People should go back and look at how Lincoln dealt with Southern sympathizers during the Civil War,” Gingrich said. “We passed a Sedition Act for example, which changed our ability to control people who were advocating treason.” It is not clear what legislation Gingrich is referring to, but Lincoln did crack down on basic freedoms, including First Amendment rights. Most notably, however, Lincoln unilaterally suspended habeas corpus, or the centuries-old right to a speedy trial.“Habeas corpus is, for many historians, a serious blemish on Lincoln’s record,” Jennifer Weber, a University of Kansas history professor, wrote in a 2013 op-ed in The New York Times.

And my wife’s noticed as she’s done her Christmas shopping this year that more of the retailers are saying, ‘Merry Christmas,’” Falwell said. “There’s a new hope and optimism ― there’s a good spirit in America, and I think that’s coming from his lead.”Trump championed hot-button social issues on the campaign trail, including the supposed “war on Christmas” that Fox News pundits and other hardliners claim without evidence has created a hostile environment for those who would like to say “Merry Christmas.”“You can say again ‘Merry Christmas’ because Donald Trump is now the president,” former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said on Fox News this month.In his interview with Wallace, Falwell also shrugged off concerns about Rex Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil CEO Trump has tapped to serve as Secretary of State. Tillerson’s work advocating for the Boy Scouts of America to accept openly gay youth has drawn stinging criticism from evangelical leader Tony Perkins, who heads the Family Research Council.“His position on social issues, I don’t believe are relevant in the position of Secretary of State,” Falwell said. “I don’t think he’ll ever have to weigh in on any of those issues.” "

She worked multiple jobs to make sure that her 8 children had food, clothes, and opportunities. My grandfather also worked multiple jobs including working many years at Alcoa. They were married for 56 years before he passed away over a decade ago from complications from Alzheimer’s. If you are a regular reader, you know that I got married this past summer. It was a small wedding and we were trying to keep things low key. That didn’t work, so we went full public with our response. I purposely didn’t invite extended family to my wedding. My siblings were the blood relatives that attended along with one cousin and one aunt who I count among my closest and most supportive family.Although I have not hidden my sexuality, at the request of my family, I’ve been very evasive when I visit my small home town. Until I met my husband, David, I never brought anyone home for any family event, homecoming, or holiday. In fact, I was the only “single” family member and frequently got the sofa in my family’s small home at the holidays. At Thanksgiving, I received a box of Christmas ornaments and decorations from my grandmother. She is downsizing and doesn’t want them thrown away. Included with them are things that I gave to her or my grandfather over the years. Along with the box came a lovely note from my grandmother. I’ve never officially come out to her. Although I have aunts who have had “special friends” for many years, I wasn’t sure how to tell her myself. I know through stories in my family that she was aware that I was gay, but we just avoided the topic. I was evasive when we visited and used gender neutral pronouns when speaking about my dating life. In the note at Thanksgiving, she mentioned that although she doesn’t have a computer, use the internet, or check out “the Facebook,” my aunt Debbie told her about my wedding. Gram mentioned that she missed hearing from me. To be frank, I hadn’t written to her since meeting David other than a Christmas card the year before. Prior to meeting him, I would try to write once every month or so. David has become such an important part of my life that I couldn’t figure out what to write without including him in any note to her. After reading her note, I decided that it was time to bite the bullet and just tell her. No more hiding. I sent her our Christmas Card with a note inserted. The gist of the letter went something like this:Dear Gram,I apologize for not writing sooner. Things are going well for me in Brooklyn. Yes I did get married this summer. I kept the wedding very small and only invited close friends, mom and dad, and my siblings. I wasn’t sure how you felt about me being gay or gay marriage. I know that it isn’t the most comfortable thing for mom, dad, or our family. I married a Nigerian man in Rochester. I’ve decided that regardless of what other people think, I need to live my life for me, and not them. David is a social worker and he models part time. I’ve taken up photography outside of work and frequently go with him to shows. I’ll try to be better about writing more often. I sent your Christmas gift directly from the company and you should get it soon. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.Love,EricI also included my new last name. I put a stamp on the letter and was shaking when I dropped it in the mail. How was she going to react? What would mom and dad say when they found out I told her. I know they are both still learning to accept who I am. Well, Gram didn’t disappoint. I got a letter back from her shortly after. Dear Eric and Friend,First I received your two packages on Friday, December 9th. I haven’t opened them as I don’t open my gifts until Christmas. Thanks very much. I hear from you more often than I hear from my grand children close by. Anthony calls about every two weeks and came to see me when he was up in October for a wedding. As I don’t have a computer, don’t do email, facebook, etc. I heard about your wedding from Aunt Debbie who saw it on Facebook. Your mom hasn’t mentioned it. One day when your dad came alone we had a little visit. He seems to take everything in stride and doesn’t get too concerned with things that he can’t change. So many things have changed in my lifetime of 85 years and can’t imagine the ones to come. Grandpa and I were married 56 years when he passed away 11 years ago. God created us all different and some things are harder to accept. Things here are fine and I count my blessings and am thankful for my family and friends each day. I’m still playing cards Monday, shuffle board on Tuesday, and of course the dance twice a month. I went on a bus trip to St. Catherine’s Ontario to see an Irish singer. Yesterday I went to Morrisburg to see a play with 45 on a bus. It’s snowing here 3” so far so I moved my car about 8:00 a.m.With love, Happiness, and Prayers, Gramp.s. - Thanks again. I’m not sure how I can describe in words how that made me feel. I’d like to say that relieved was the first emotion that came over me. I also teared up a little. I know that my life isn’t easy for some people to understand, especially people who grew up in small towns far from cities that are not very diverse or accepting of people who may be different. Just seeing a letter addressed to “Dear Eric and Friend” brought tears to my eyes and a little belly laugh. My dear aunt who passed had a “friend” for many years who she lived with. We love that “friend” who is still an important part of our family. I’m also glad that now when I go to visit my parents, I don’t have to leave David somewhere or make him hide when Grandma visits. Our family photos that include him can be sent to her too. All of this has been causing me stomach aches since I met him. My siblings, too, have not been sure what to do. We always take a family photo and send a copy to Gram. I hate to lie. I hate to hide. Now it can all be in the open. So that was my Christmas gift from my grandmother. I hope that you all have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I’m off to Christmas Eve Service. "

However, Trump reportedly said otherwise to Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” when she sought clarification about the statement from him on Friday. “Let it be an arms race,” Trump allegedly said. “We will outmatch them at every pass. And outlast them all.”"

11,COLLEGE,New Years Resolutions of Self-Growth for My Fellow 20-Somethings,"Gabby Beckford, ContributorGabby. 21. Living in Dubai, UAE. Self proclaimed 'jack of all ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-years-resolutions-for_11_b_13752786.html,,2016-12-25,2016-12-21-1482300819-5644903-SriLankaPacksLight.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-21-1482300819-5644903-SriLankaPacksLight-thumb.jpg,"New year, new me, am I right?Now that the new year is upon us, everyone has resolutions that they've been thinking of for the past month that will somehow drastically change the course of their lives during the next year. Especially us 20-somethings! We have to balance our young, still-discovering-who-I-am lives with the bees dying, Kim and Kanye's divorce, and of course the challenges of transitioning into fully functioning, independent adults (that being said, don't forget to call your parents and ask what the heck to do with our taxes next month).For us ""millennials"", New Year's resolutions tend to involve getting incredibly fit, finding a significant other, having more ""fun"", moderating our drinking/smoking, and all the while making an unrealistic amount of money.But what you may not realize is that all of these usual resolutions have one problem in common: they all deal with everyone else's perception of you.Everyone struggles with perception issues, but especially in your teens and twenties it's very easy to allow ourselves to rely on happiness mainly from other people's opinions of us.And that's what all of this is really about, right? Being happy?Ultimately the decisions and resolutions we make are usually designed to increase our happiness, not decrease it. But as simple 20-somethings, how can we know what truly makes us happy?My favorite quote to this point is from Tom Shadyac in his movie, I Am. He says,""The person who has two million dollars is not twice as happy than the person that has one million dollars"".That is, money and material things are not proportional to levels of happiness.So, what to do? I've said money and other people's opinions won't make you truly happy (it looks like it's working for Kylie Jenner, but trust me on this). So what now?The following New Years resolutions are centered around finding your inner happiness. Not through material wealth or attention, but by self-improvement and genuine actions.So, millennials, this year try to:Be honest with yourself This is a major key. The most hurtful lies are the ones that we tell ourselves. Ask yourself the hard questions this year!Are you happy where you are? With your job? With your significant other? With your college major? Wherever you're at in life, this is the time to make the big change. If you're scared, just know it's better to make the change now and get the ball rolling then prolong it any longer. It's like knowing you're getting a shot at today's doctor's appointment, and having to wait 10 minutes beforehand. It turns into the longest 10 minutes of your life, because the anticipation is the worst part of the unknown.New Years resolutions are usually good for ""cold turkey"" type goals, so take this opportunity to cut the bullsh*t. Remove all sources of negativity and doubt from your life and replace them with things that consistently bring inspiration and happiness to you.Help others How many philanthropic things have you done this year? I'm not talking about giving all your old clothes to your younger siblings.If you didn't get many community service ours in this year, a great New Years resolution is to jump on it for this year. Especially in the winter, where much of the world is very cold right now, volunteering somewhere would be much appreciated. Do some research where you can help out locally in your community.And if you can't find the time to help out an organization, try being philanthropic in your daily life. Make a resolution to do as many random acts of kindness as you possibly can this year.Make a resolution to do as many random acts of kindness as you possibly can this year.Help your neighbor carry her groceries in her house. Choose seeing your family that one weekend over that awesome party.The littlest adjustments can make the biggest differences!Be conscientious 2016 was definitely the Year of the ""Woke"". Let this year carry on the tradition, and continue to be conscientious of all the things you learned in the last year.Continue to try your best to not make assumptions about people based on things portrayed in the news media. Stay open-minded, do your own objective research before believing every viral Facebook photo or article. Believe in the good in the world.Be environmentally conscious, health conscious, and politically sensitive.Last year you got woke, now this year, #StayWoke.Travel as much as possible, as far as possible. Travel is always a good idea, period.But this year, try to do it for more than the Instagram likes. Do it for the sake of self-growth.If you can swing it, go to a different country. Learn about a different language, a different culture, a contrasting lifestyle. Make your world just a little bit bigger (literally, and metaphorically).I can say that living in Dubai for the last 4 months has dramatically changed my outlook on people and the world as a whole, in the best way.If money or time is still an issue, travel is still travel even if it's close to home. Hop one state over, or even one city over. Look up blog posts on the ""must do's"" and the ""hidden treasures"" of that city and dive in.In your travels, expand your comfort zone. Do things you've only ever imagined. Try foods you've never tried. Have you had African Wolof rice, or Vietnamese pho noodles? You're missing out!Ask questions, and listen and internalize the answers. Document it with photos and travel journaling. Again, the point is not to have a travel journal that you can take a photo of at a cafe in Paris and post on Instagram for likes. I mean, you can--but that's not the point.The point is to learn more about yourself. See what you like and what you don't like. Improve your communication with this world through dialogue and knowledge.Keep on keepin' on Times are hard. Our president-elect is controversial, global warming is out of control, the job market after college is suffocating, and did I mention the bees are dying?Everywhere you look it seems like another negative thing is happening.So the most important resolution for this year is to stay up.You will fail at some of these, no doubt, in a year-long period. You will go through rough patches, financially and otherwise. You will have doubts.But keep your chin up and roll out of bed each morning and realize that each new day is the youngest you will ever be, and you are ultimately in control of your own life. For example, any moment you could cut your hair, change your clothes, leave your job and university, and start a life as a peach farmer.Will you? Likely not. But you could. You could do anything.You could be the next president. You could discover the cure to cancer. You could make someones day today with a simple act of kindness. You could see the world.Let this new year where you manifest those ""could""s into ""did""s!Follow Gabby's travel blog and Instagram for more content."
12,RELIGION,Baby Jesus and the War on Christmas,"John C.

Even before Christianity transformed Yahweh into a three-headed deity, the God of Abraham had a split personality. The same God who lovingly nourishes the children of Israel with manna from heaven flies into a lethal rage when the foodies among them get bored with it and cry for meat (Numbers 11). Elsewhere Yahweh promises to love and nurture his Chosen People like a suckling child in a mother's arms (Isaiah 66:9-13), yet he also demands that any among them who pick up sticks on the Sabbath should be stoned to death (Numbers 15:32-36). These two divine personalities -- unconditionally loving versus fearsome, judgmental, and punishing -- reflect the two distinct selective pressures through which evolution has made us susceptible to religious emotions and beliefs.Religion and TribalismOne of these is the selective pressure for social cooperation, which transformed our primate ancestors from the moderate sociality of our chimp cousins into the builders of the most complex societies our planet has seen. Central to this is a mechanism that supports trust and cooperation on a grand scale, far too grand for anyone to keep track of how much each person has contributed to every group effort. Religion supports such large-scale cooperation, but only if it involves belief in a god who knows all and who rewards the righteous (cooperators) and punishes the wicked (cheaters) -- hence the emergence of belief in judgmental and punishing gods. And there's one more vital ingredient: the religion must also demand costly, hard-to-fake sacrifices as proof of fealty to the gods. Those who make the sacrifices prove their loyalty to the group; those who don't are shunned or ostracized. Of course it is not religion per se that is being selected here, but rather greater reproductive success through complex social behavior. From this social root of religion we get not only trust and cooperation within the group, but also fear and loathing of competing tribes. After all, they're worshiping the wrong gods. Michelangelo: David killing Goliath, a member of the out-group.  Religion and InfancyThe other selective pressure behind religion has to do with our long period of helplessness as infants and dependent children. Like the infants of our primate cousins, human babies are born with an innate longing for their mothers. Despite their lack of coordination and incomplete neural development, human newborns prefer faces to other visual stimuli and quickly learn to recognize their mother's face as distinct from others. They also prefer her voice, especially when she speaks motherese -- the lilting and musical speech that babies effortlessly elicit from adults. This innate neural model of a loving and nurturing other, of a primordial savior, appears to be so deeply burned into the neonatal brain that it endures into adulthood. It imbues our perception of reality with the vague sense that the universe is somehow mindful and loving, and in times of desperate helplessness it can precipitate the compelling illusion of the presence of a loving mystical being. It is this neonatal root of religion that spawns belief in a god of unconditional love.Why Baby Jesus?We see both of these dimensions of religiousness in nearly all religions, though the relative proportions vary, and that bring us back to Christmas. Christianity is dripping with infantile imagery, from the admonition that we must be born again (become infants again), to the parental labels used for God. In addition to our ""Heavenly Father"", Catholics venerate the Blessed Virgin as ""Holy Mary Mother of God"" -- only one tiny preposition away from ""Mother God"". The centrality of the mother-infant bond as the source of this infantile dimension of religion is most obvious in the Christmas story, where that bond is not merely likened to the relationship between God and humans, it is that relationship. But there is a slight problem here. If God is a nurturing parent to helpless and infantile humans, then why does God appear as the helpless infant in the Christmas story? Why is it so appealing to venerate God as a tiny baby? Madonna and Child by Guido ReniI think there are several reasons for this, but the simplest has to do with that other biological source of religion, the social root that creates God in the image of a fearsome and cruel dispenser of punishment. Not all Christian sects celebrate Christmas. Some utterly reject it as a demon holiday. But those that emphasize God's compassion, forgiveness, and kindness in their theology tend to embrace Christmas in a big way. They defang the fearsome God of the social root by venerating him as a helpless infant. Hindus do the same, transforming their god Vishnu -- the destroyer of worlds whom Oppenheimer once likened to a nuclear explosion -- into his earthly incarnation as the cute little baby Krishna. Christmas cranks up the infantile and maternal love in Christianity, while turning down the fear, loathing, and tribalism. Except when it doesn't...Why the War on Christmas?Christian fundamentalists, whose theology emphasizes the judgmental god of the social root, sometimes reject Christmas altogether, but in recent years many have adopted a new strategy for putting their judgmental Christ back in Christmas. The phrase ""Merry Christmas"" has become the seasonal rallying cry for their tribe, and those who won't say those magic words -- like the department store executives who mandate ""Happy Holidays"" as the store greeting -- are hostile and dangerous enemies. More than that, they are waging a ""war on Christmas"", one that seeks to drown the fundamentalist's favorite childhood memories and adult religious identity under a flood of multiculturalism, moral relativism, and political correctness. Just as fundamentalists imagine that prayer is banned from public schools, they conjure a nonexistent war on Christmas because external threat -- like the real threat of a hostile tribe -- strengthens group cohesion and loyalty. Authors and politicians sense the anger and exploit it for personal gain. Atheists like me sense the silliness and retaliate in kind.  Image credit: John C. WatheyMerry Christmas to all!

14,ENTERTAINMENT,Musical Artist Interview: Garrett Miller,"Robin Raven, ContributorAuthor, editor, blogger at RobinRaven.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/musical-artist-interview_b_13847994.html,,2016-12-25,2016-12-25-1482641245-1331378-Garrett_Miller_Blond_Jesus_2016Cover_LowRes.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-25-1482641245-1331378-Garrett_Miller_Blond_Jesus_2016Cover_LowRes-thumb.jpg,"Garrett Miller is a dynamic, talented artist who wears many hats. Since 2012, he has been hosting ""Rated G Radio,"" a successful radio program that he created. Garrett released his first EP, Eyes Wide, in 2013; the album featured his holiday song ""Guess What Its Christmastime."" He released the follow up full-length album, Blond Jesus in 2015 with songs like ""Gay Wedding,"" ""Sweat & Testify,"" ""Witch Sisters Halloween,"" and the title track. I was happy to catch up with Garrett to find out more about his fascinating careers, his musical influences, what we can expect from him in 2017, and more.  Can you tell me more about yourself and what you are striving to achieve as an artist?I'm a guy who woke up half way through his life and decided he wanted to make a difference in the world, to share his messages and give people hope and inspiration. That's the altruistic reply - it's honest - though I really, selfishly, wanted to do something fun for a change. For a long time, my life wasn't much fun and I was at a serious crossroads. I had to do something, anything to change or continue going down a rabbit hole which was sucking the life out of me. Literally and figuratively. So, I did. I had no idea of the how, just that I would. Somewhere at the end of 2011, I decided I wanted to do a radio show where I could talk with people when I got home from work, like a ""fireside chat"" or going out for coffee - with people other people would also want to listen in on. I had no clue how to do any of it, but I knew I was going to do it. Within six months, though a series of serendipity I was broadcasting live five nights a week. You know what they say, you get a sample and then want the whole pie. That's kind of what happened. I loved doing the radio show so much, the world of possibility started opening my imagination as well. I'd had blinders on to who I was and who I thought the world wanted me to be for so long, that being an authentic version of myself was something foreign to me. This was the hardest part for me to reconcile. I'm now finding everyone liked the ""real"" me and the ""fake"" me was something they tolerated. Trouble was, I wasn't sure who the real me was, or is. It's still something I'm discovering every day. The radio show soon led to wanting to sing a song. I had no practical experience singing, but knew I wanted to record a song. Like with the radio show, I found a producer, wrote lyrics to a song and recorded it all within a short period of time. Next, I wanted to be in movies and television; I wanted to act. In the first half of 2016, I was in four indie movies and two television shows as background or bit parts. As an artist getting to taste several different types of opportunities, I'm starting to get better at figuring out what I like more than others. Right now, I'm enjoying the current wave with the music from the album Blond Jesus. In January, I'll have a new book out. It's finding ways to release the creativity inside that feels impactful. How did you decide to start your fantastic podcast? I've always enjoyed listening to people chat on the radio while driving around. My first real ""love"" of a show was the ""Beth & Bill Show"" on KEZ 99.9 in Phoenix, AZ. Beth McDonald and the late Bill Austin were the best morning duo in the country as far as I'm concerned. The perfect amount of news, music, chatter, interviews, comic relief, you name it. For 20 years, I listened to Beth & Bill every morning on the way to work. They made getting up fun! Fun was what I wanted to have. That's the real answer - I wanted to have some fun in my life, and chatting with fun people seemed like a good way to do it. Once it got started, it quickly took on a life of its own, guests soon started contacting me to be on, and often I'll be booked four to five months in advance. For a show that's live five days a week, I'm still like, ""Wow!"" It's one of the most enjoyable things I get to do, and I have Beth & Bill to thank for giving me a great format as a model. What inspired you to start creating music? If you told me 10 years ago that my life today would look like it does, I'd say you've lost your mind. But looking back at my life 10 years ago, I was insane for living the way I did. Around the same time, I started doing my radio show, one of my all-time favorite entertainer's, Kathy Griffin, had a talk show on Bravo. She sang her theme song. It was heavily auto-tuned to make her sound decent - and I loved it. ""I'll Say It"" was the perfect intro to her show. I said to myself, ""If Kathy can do it, I want to do that, too!"" I reached out to the world and said, ""I want to sing a song! I can't sing! I need help! Who should I talk to?"" Within a month, I was in the studio with my producer, Brian Pothier, who said, ""I have worked with worse. I can make this work."" I took in the lyrics I'd written out for ""Tell Me Something More,"" and the rest is history. I sang the song, breaking Brian's Autotune several times, and he delivered a song that, arguably, sounds pretty good considering. It was the most fun thing I'd ever done. Ever. I knew I wanted to do more. Brian offered to work with me on more songs, and that's when I got the bug to create music that I wanted to listen to with my stories.What has been your most popular song? ""Unlike You"" recently spent 18 weeks at #1 on one indie radio network, and debuted at #1 on another and stayed there several weeks as well. It's my story of getting sober, not liking myself and ending a relationship with someone who loved me even though I was a complete jerk. It's also a ballad. For it to get such a great response to a song I was nervous about releasing shocked me in a way that validated sharing real parts of my life with people. Do you remember the first time you truly loved a song? I've loved music for so long, this is a tough one! I truly loved Donna Summer's ""Bad Girls"" and ""Hot Stuff"" at the same with the Village People's ""Macho Man"" was happening. I'd play the songs over and over and over. Loudly. On my record player. Before there were headphones. My family was kind in their tolerance of the volume I'd enjoy blasting it out at when I'd get home from my paper route at 6:30 a.m.Which singers or musical acts inspire you and your own work? The short answer is George Michael and Billy Idol. I was the first person I knew with a CHOOSE LIFE t-shirt and wore far too much fluorescent clothing ala ""Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."" Billy was too ""rock"" for me for a long time, until a friend introduced, i.e. forced me to listen, to his music. Then I was like, ""Where has he been all this time?!"" Lyrically, both write dynamic, vibrant, inspiring songs. Vocally, both are completely different. If I could sound like anyone, I'd always want to sing as beautifully as George Michael does. Stylistically, I'd love to be Billy Idol any day.Where else do you find inspiration?From a lyric perspective, I have to be in the mood to write. I like to tell stories. I have to be in a story telling mode and then I'm good to go. For me, a song is a short story. First, I write the short story out in long form. Usually by hand. Then I begin to form the beginning, the middle and end. If it doesn't make sense to me, it doesn't get into the studio. I think most of my music I see in my head as a music video or concert performance. I'm very visual, so I have to be able to see the story as I'm telling it. If I can do that, I'm happy. Hopefully, the listeners also are able to go on a similar journey with me.  Which song of yours did you most relate to?""I AM"" is a song declaring my worthiness to me, the world. Originally, I wanted to do this as the title track for the album in a 12-minute, extended remix with only ""I AM"" as the words in the song. That didn't work once I was in the studio. So there's a spoken intro and a spoken outro that help take the listeners on the journey with me. Now it makes sense and I love it, love everything about it. When I'm having a down day or need a reminder, ""I AM"" is my go-to song.How would you like your music to be perceived? Fun. I hope fun. The objects in the songs may be closer than they appear. Everything I write about comes directly from something going on in my life at the time. If you're part of it, you'll hear it in the songs. If you know me, you'll know the who and the what I'm referencing. It's cathartic for me. If you're a blogger or writer or radio interviewer, you get a creative outlet doing that. When I'm writing lyrics, I'm doing the same thing.Who are your mentors and heroes?  There are so many good people who've influenced me. I'm lucky the list is long. I always roll my eyes when people mention their parents, but my dad really was, and continues to be, a great role model. Never a mean thing to say about anyone, always thinks through situations before reacting, and leads by example. He is always available anytime I need someone to talk to, a shoulder to cry on, or just someone I could bitch to without fear of judgment. I think one of the reasons I respect my dad so much is that I know who he is. He isn't fake. He doesn't put on a show. He's just a real guy, and, even with all of my faults as a son, he still loves me anyway.   Where and how do you like to relax when you're creating?I completely zone out. I mentally shut everything else off in my world - the computer, the radio, the puppies, the roommate watching TV in the living room, the ocean waves down the street at the beach. Everything. It's less about relaxing - or maybe my concept of relaxing and being creative are not exclusive. If I'm relaxing, I'm face down on a massage table getting a deep tissue. If I'm creative, I've got a notebook and red ink pen, and I'm writing fast and furious before the thought leaves me. I might get ideas like a song title or line, but I'm like a dog in that I'm easily distracted. Unless I write it down for later, it's going in one ear and out the other. That's not necessarily a bad thing; I used to spend a lot of time driving in my car. In Southern California. It's typical to have a one-way commute be over 2 hours. So, I had a lot of time to get ideas and let them take root. Sometimes the ideas would germinate and sprout once I got home and sat down at my desk. Sometimes they were over-watered or didn't get any nourishment, and those never saw the light of day again. I'm more of a concept person. I know the concept of a project, show, song, book or script I want to write. That, I can get my head around. So, when I am sitting down to put it on paper, I'm focused and ready to write. The clock becomes a blur and I'll find myself spending hours taking notes, making outlines, creating characters, or building a plot line. When the juices are flowing, I write until I'm spent.  If you could collaborate with any artist in all of history, who would you choose and why?I would love to write and record a song with George Michael. I've been in love with his image and music since Wham first hit the scene in the early 1980's. The opportunity to create something historical like a ""Careless Whisper"" would be at the top of my bucket list. I'm such a mark for him. What have been the biggest rewards and challenges of having multiple projects going on?I think people outside of my bubble think I'm doing all of these projects 24/7. For me, having multiple projects is a necessity. If I only have one project to focus on at a time, I'd go nuts. There's no way to spend every waking second on something and have all pieces of the puzzle in alignment with your calendar and time-table. If I only worked on one thing at a time, I'd pull all my hair out and spend most of my time screaming, ""Why can't you see this is the only thing you should have going on in your life too!"" Everything I work on tends to be creative - photography, website design, writing stories, writing lyrics, writing scripts, singing songs, acting, and doing Rated G Radio. Each, in their own way, are important to me, special, and time sensitive. So, when they have momentum, I give them the attention they need to grow. I've learned to accept that others have projects they're involved in and can't always magically push all of that to the side the moment I am ready to work on something. It used to really frustrate me that such-n-such project was taking longer than I wanted. When I stopped pounding my head on the brick walls, other creative opportunities started appearing. That works much better for me, and I'm having much more fun.Do you have a favorite motto or quote?  Believe and receive! Attract and allow. If you want great things to happen in your life, let them happen. Believe they are happening to you now. Give thanks to God, your angels, your family, your friends, your whoever now that you're receiving exactly what is in your highest good. Be thankful in life. Believe and receive! Attract and allow.What artistic projects do you have on the horizon?I'm starting work on my 3rd album, which will be heavily influenced by disco. There will be a couple of guest appearances by major stars singing with me. I can't wait to head back into the studio next year. It all takes money to go record music, so getting the money together is my current focus. Anyone have a blank check they can give me?My first book is nearly set for release. The Blond Jesus-ISMS features 10 stories from my life told with a little humor, and hopefully a lot of inspiration. I just signed off on the cover with the publisher last week and am putting the final touches on it now. Just like the album - the stories are mine. They may not be perfect, but they're mine and I'm sharing myself with you.  What do you most want to achieve as an artist?BCS: Blatant Commercial Success. I want #1 records on Billboard now. I want #1 streams on Soundcloud and Spotify now. I want a global tour where I headline major stadiums around the world now. I want the fame, fortune, and respect as an artist recognized for making fun, popular, and profitable music now. I want it all now.   What's your favorite compliment that your art has received so far? On my first album Eyes Wide, one of the songs is called ""FOG"". People still email saying this song helped them get through whatever tough time they are going through. That's what the song did for me at the time I wrote it, so hearing listeners resonate with it was a ""wow"" moment.   When are you most happy? I'm most happy when I'm spending time with my dogs; Eric, Sookie, Bill, Angie, and Jenny. If I'm working on a creative project, that makes me happy. Otherwise, I'm not all sunshine and smiles, which will probably shock a lot of people, but I'm not. I'm always wondering what I can be doing next.

15,ENTERTAINMENT,Musical Artist Interview: Garrett Miller,"Robin Raven, ContributorAuthor, editor, blogger at RobinRaven.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/musical-artist-interview_b_13847994.html,,2016-12-25,2016-12-25-1482641286-1588349-GarretBlondJesus2016copy.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-25-1482641286-1588349-GarretBlondJesus2016copy-thumb.jpg,"Garrett Miller is a dynamic, talented artist who wears many hats. Since 2012, he has been hosting ""Rated G Radio,"" a successful radio program that he created. Garrett released his first EP, Eyes Wide, in 2013; the album featured his holiday song ""Guess What Its Christmastime."" He released the follow up full-length album, Blond Jesus in 2015 with songs like ""Gay Wedding,"" ""Sweat & Testify,"" ""Witch Sisters Halloween,"" and the title track. I was happy to catch up with Garrett to find out more about his fascinating careers, his musical influences, what we can expect from him in 2017, and more.  Can you tell me more about yourself and what you are striving to achieve as an artist?I'm a guy who woke up half way through his life and decided he wanted to make a difference in the world, to share his messages and give people hope and inspiration. That's the altruistic reply - it's honest - though I really, selfishly, wanted to do something fun for a change. For a long time, my life wasn't much fun and I was at a serious crossroads. I had to do something, anything to change or continue going down a rabbit hole which was sucking the life out of me. Literally and figuratively. So, I did. I had no idea of the how, just that I would. Somewhere at the end of 2011, I decided I wanted to do a radio show where I could talk with people when I got home from work, like a ""fireside chat"" or going out for coffee - with people other people would also want to listen in on. I had no clue how to do any of it, but I knew I was going to do it. Within six months, though a series of serendipity I was broadcasting live five nights a week. You know what they say, you get a sample and then want the whole pie. That's kind of what happened. I loved doing the radio show so much, the world of possibility started opening my imagination as well. I'd had blinders on to who I was and who I thought the world wanted me to be for so long, that being an authentic version of myself was something foreign to me. This was the hardest part for me to reconcile. I'm now finding everyone liked the ""real"" me and the ""fake"" me was something they tolerated. Trouble was, I wasn't sure who the real me was, or is. It's still something I'm discovering every day. The radio show soon led to wanting to sing a song. I had no practical experience singing, but knew I wanted to record a song. Like with the radio show, I found a producer, wrote lyrics to a song and recorded it all within a short period of time. Next, I wanted to be in movies and television; I wanted to act. In the first half of 2016, I was in four indie movies and two television shows as background or bit parts. As an artist getting to taste several different types of opportunities, I'm starting to get better at figuring out what I like more than others. Right now, I'm enjoying the current wave with the music from the album Blond Jesus. In January, I'll have a new book out. It's finding ways to release the creativity inside that feels impactful. How did you decide to start your fantastic podcast? I've always enjoyed listening to people chat on the radio while driving around. My first real ""love"" of a show was the ""Beth & Bill Show"" on KEZ 99.9 in Phoenix, AZ. Beth McDonald and the late Bill Austin were the best morning duo in the country as far as I'm concerned. The perfect amount of news, music, chatter, interviews, comic relief, you name it. For 20 years, I listened to Beth & Bill every morning on the way to work. They made getting up fun! Fun was what I wanted to have. That's the real answer - I wanted to have some fun in my life, and chatting with fun people seemed like a good way to do it. Once it got started, it quickly took on a life of its own, guests soon started contacting me to be on, and often I'll be booked four to five months in advance. For a show that's live five days a week, I'm still like, ""Wow!"" It's one of the most enjoyable things I get to do, and I have Beth & Bill to thank for giving me a great format as a model. What inspired you to start creating music? If you told me 10 years ago that my life today would look like it does, I'd say you've lost your mind. But looking back at my life 10 years ago, I was insane for living the way I did. Around the same time, I started doing my radio show, one of my all-time favorite entertainer's, Kathy Griffin, had a talk show on Bravo. She sang her theme song. It was heavily auto-tuned to make her sound decent - and I loved it. ""I'll Say It"" was the perfect intro to her show. I said to myself, ""If Kathy can do it, I want to do that, too!"" I reached out to the world and said, ""I want to sing a song! I can't sing! I need help! Who should I talk to?"" Within a month, I was in the studio with my producer, Brian Pothier, who said, ""I have worked with worse. I can make this work."" I took in the lyrics I'd written out for ""Tell Me Something More,"" and the rest is history. I sang the song, breaking Brian's Autotune several times, and he delivered a song that, arguably, sounds pretty good considering. It was the most fun thing I'd ever done. Ever. I knew I wanted to do more. Brian offered to work with me on more songs, and that's when I got the bug to create music that I wanted to listen to with my stories.What has been your most popular song? ""Unlike You"" recently spent 18 weeks at #1 on one indie radio network, and debuted at #1 on another and stayed there several weeks as well. It's my story of getting sober, not liking myself and ending a relationship with someone who loved me even though I was a complete jerk. It's also a ballad. For it to get such a great response to a song I was nervous about releasing shocked me in a way that validated sharing real parts of my life with people. Do you remember the first time you truly loved a song? I've loved music for so long, this is a tough one! I truly loved Donna Summer's ""Bad Girls"" and ""Hot Stuff"" at the same with the Village People's ""Macho Man"" was happening. I'd play the songs over and over and over. Loudly. On my record player. Before there were headphones. My family was kind in their tolerance of the volume I'd enjoy blasting it out at when I'd get home from my paper route at 6:30 a.m.Which singers or musical acts inspire you and your own work? The short answer is George Michael and Billy Idol. I was the first person I knew with a CHOOSE LIFE t-shirt and wore far too much fluorescent clothing ala ""Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."" Billy was too ""rock"" for me for a long time, until a friend introduced, i.e. forced me to listen, to his music. Then I was like, ""Where has he been all this time?!"" Lyrically, both write dynamic, vibrant, inspiring songs. Vocally, both are completely different. If I could sound like anyone, I'd always want to sing as beautifully as George Michael does. Stylistically, I'd love to be Billy Idol any day.Where else do you find inspiration?From a lyric perspective, I have to be in the mood to write. I like to tell stories. I have to be in a story telling mode and then I'm good to go. For me, a song is a short story. First, I write the short story out in long form. Usually by hand. Then I begin to form the beginning, the middle and end. If it doesn't make sense to me, it doesn't get into the studio. I think most of my music I see in my head as a music video or concert performance. I'm very visual, so I have to be able to see the story as I'm telling it. If I can do that, I'm happy. Hopefully, the listeners also are able to go on a similar journey with me.  Which song of yours did you most relate to?""I AM"" is a song declaring my worthiness to me, the world. Originally, I wanted to do this as the title track for the album in a 12-minute, extended remix with only ""I AM"" as the words in the song. That didn't work once I was in the studio. So there's a spoken intro and a spoken outro that help take the listeners on the journey with me. Now it makes sense and I love it, love everything about it. When I'm having a down day or need a reminder, ""I AM"" is my go-to song.How would you like your music to be perceived? Fun. I hope fun. The objects in the songs may be closer than they appear. Everything I write about comes directly from something going on in my life at the time. If you're part of it, you'll hear it in the songs. If you know me, you'll know the who and the what I'm referencing. It's cathartic for me. If you're a blogger or writer or radio interviewer, you get a creative outlet doing that. When I'm writing lyrics, I'm doing the same thing.Who are your mentors and heroes?  There are so many good people who've influenced me. I'm lucky the list is long. I always roll my eyes when people mention their parents, but my dad really was, and continues to be, a great role model. Never a mean thing to say about anyone, always thinks through situations before reacting, and leads by example. He is always available anytime I need someone to talk to, a shoulder to cry on, or just someone I could bitch to without fear of judgment. I think one of the reasons I respect my dad so much is that I know who he is. He isn't fake. He doesn't put on a show. He's just a real guy, and, even with all of my faults as a son, he still loves me anyway.   Where and how do you like to relax when you're creating?I completely zone out.

16,TASTE,Locations:  A Wine Life Hack,"Tara Fass, ContributorLicensed Psychotherapist in Los Angeles, California",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/locations-a-wine-life-hac_b_13853986.html,,2016-12-25,2016-12-25-1482688785-1726816-NS_Orin060916_1600.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-25-1482688785-1726816-NS_Orin060916_1600-thumb.jpg," Grenache grapes for French Rose, the one single varietal Locations Wines produces, all others are blends   ""Wine is sunlight, held together by water."" Galileo Galilei, astronomer and father of modern science, 1564-1642  Innovations in wine making and marketing come down the pike from time to time. When Dave Phinney the, ""Bad Boy of Blending,"" known for taking risks in riding and creating the blended wine wave, came up with a new wrinkle, attention was paid for good reason. Embracing taboos has been his way of blending and branding wine that turns heads. As the consumer, understanding his labeling process with Locations Wines could help one choose a great bottle of wine at a decent price point.  The generic labels on vintner Dave Phinney's Locations Wines might help a consumer confront the challenge and confusion over knowing which blend to choose. Locations bottles' labels are an abbreviation of the respective places where the grapes originate. For me, the generic label is an attempt to capture what makes a region's wine iconic. Mr. Phinney has said something else.  Phinney explained the unique labels were inspired by a trip to France. At the Charles De Gaulle airport he saw the letter 'F' on a taxi. This sighting led to thinking about wine labeling, using abbreviations only for other countries or states. For instance, the French Red Blend we enjoyed to the max is called simply F. It is crafted to represent the best of France with grapes sourced from Bordeaux, Rhone and Languedoc-Roussillon. Basically, Dave limits himself to one country or state in the U.S. at a time, but then his imagination takes hold, tempered by a track record of commercial and critical successes. Blends are all the rage. Sorting through the vast number of offerings daunting. A generic label can stand out and be of use to the novice oenophile or a more experienced wine imbiber who is pressed for time, to rely on Mr. Phinney's reputation to quickly pick a great blended wine for the value. The nomenclature is a helpful guide to what you will find inside the bottle consistent with its region. As a point of information: a blend is defined as a wine which contains less than 75% of any one grape. It also is given a name, rather than bearing the name of a grape. Given Mr. Phinney's early acclaim with the label Orin Swift, before the tender age of 30, it is no surprise that Locations Wine is anything but boring. Mr. Phinney's philosophy is organized around novelty. 'Come with me to play and think outside the box,' could be Mr. Phinney's motto behind an attitude that has created some lovely, soft and easy to drink, tasty wines. The first few years his style was to make bold, hit you upside the head wines. Wines historically known for being robust, Phinney seems to be following a newer trend, a more feminized approach to vinification.  I offered to play with the idea of 'places.' Like 'Dora the Explorer,' Locations would accompany me over the winter holidays 2016, until I am here to report, my supply (sadly) ran out. Interesting Musing on Wine from actor David Hyde Pierce, known for his role as a psychiatrist on the television show, 'Frasier':  ""Maybe it's because I'm getting older, I'm finding enjoyment in things that stop time. Just the simple act of tasting a glass of wine is its own event. You're not downing a glass of wine in the midst of doing something else."" Guzzling alcohol, getting drunk and nursing a hang over the next day is not what drinking wine is all about. As a therapist who writes about wine occasionally, the focus is always about savoring the entire experience from choosing the wine -as every bottle tells a story - pairing wines with foods and sharing it all with friendly folks and family.   Quality and Moderation ""Wisdom comes through suffering. Trouble, with its memories of pain,  Drips in our hearts as we try to sleep,  so men against their will Learn to practice moderation.""  ―Aeschylus, Agememnon, Greek Myth, 458 B.C.E. Writer and actor Dan Aykroyd said it well, ""Wine represents to me sharing and good times and a celebration of life. It is always around happy occasions with family and friends and centered on joy. What better item to be involved in then something that represents all these wonderful things?""   NUMBER ONE GO TO HOLIDAY HACK: WINE WITH CHEESEMr. Phinney takes well known combinations of traditional grapes such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. He then chimes into the mix with more exotic varietals like Viognier and Rousanne. The label is CA. The combination of wines on the face of it could seem bizarre at first glance, but it does pair quite nicely with cheese and its accompaniments.   Look no further than F for rose (not to be confused with F for the red blend) for a versatile wine with any number of cheeses. The grenache grapes for this rose were sourced from Fontaine de Vaucluse, the Provence region of France. Mr. Phinney's philosophy is organized around novelty. 'Come with me to play and think outside the box,' could be Mr. Phinney's motto behind an attitude that has created some lovely, soft and easy to drink, tasty wines. The first few years his style was to make bold, hit you upside the head wines. Wines historically known for being robust, Phinney seems to be following a newer trend, a more feminized approach to vinification.Locations Wines accompanied me to a few Friendsgiving celebrations, the start of a new tradition, a holiday keeper forevermore.   Menus and Wine SuggestionsBlue Apron acorn squash curry on the Sunday before The Giving, in Los Angeles. E for Espana was perfect with Anne Thompson and Nora Chute the formidable mother daughter duo;F for France tasted sangiovese-like the Thursday before Thanksgiving Friendsgiving: one a veggie stir fry for two after a long day of work, finished up two days later with posole, a gift from a parent at dear Luisa Bottari Stern's school, before heading out of town. Tuesday Friendsgiving the pentultimate day before Thanksgiving: A dry rubbed fully cooked brisket delivered in butcher paper ready to slice from Marfa Meat Company with OR a, ""silky pinot,"" according to Artist Sam Schonzeit noted. For him, it was the best wine in a Texas pre-Giving dinner party line up. Two bottles of I for Italy with Turkey in Marfa opened up very nicely for Thanksgiving and the next day leftovers with a glass for the bone broth to boot. (We also had the I for a Shared Plates event, the October prior. Locations was so kind to sponsor for those hosting dinner parties.) TX for Texas with dry aged Kansas City strip DeBragga steaks the Saturday night after Thanksgiving in Marfa when it was time to wind down from turkey. I found out about DeBragga, an old guard of New York butcher shops, around since the 1920s, from an informative survey by Gear Patrol. It laid out several fine sources for the best steaks online. Stefanie Faison, of DeBragga, told me a high concentration of customers hail from Oklahoma and Texas, ""where they know good beef."" TX was found at The Get Go, the one fancy foods market in Marfa.The last and final bottle for Thanksgiving and beyondAR for Argentina went to a rare fruit growers party over the weekend in Malibu, where no one was drinking anything stronger than kombucha or beer. We may have committed a faux pas, but since our rare fruit grower hosts do not partake of wine they did not seem to mind that we held the bottle in reserve for the next holiday gathering.  We brought AR, not to be confused with Arkansas, the next day to Anne Beatts' and her daughter, Jaylene's, holiday open house. Bon vivant that she is, Ms. Beatts was one of the original writers for Saturday Night Live.Breaking bread as a group is a deeply humanizing activity. As I have written before about the world of wine is how well it goes with food. The combination of average portions of food and middling amounts of wine is one aggregator of culture to be practiced regularly.   Rule of thumb: One bottle contains 6 glasses for a minimum of 3 people.    To stay safe and away from a danger zone: Remember, some rules are not meant to be broken.  How does a person know where one stands on the spectrum of moderation? Here is a self test to determine if one is in trouble with controlling alcohol consumption. Responsible drinking is within reach for many, but not everyone. Anything more than a glass, not filled to the top, maybe two modest glasses though not much more, is how much one should drink at any sitting as a rule. Disclaimer Alert: What I have written here should NOT be construed as or substituted for therapy. If you or someone you know is suicidal, do not hesitate to reach out to a professional, trusted family member or friend to get needed help. If you -- or someone you know -- need helps, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you are outside of the U.S., please visit the International Association for Suicide Prevention for a database of international resources."

Locations bottles' labels are an abbreviation of the respective places where the grapes originate. For me, the generic label is an attempt to capture what makes a region's wine iconic. Mr. Phinney has said something else.  Phinney explained the unique labels were inspired by a trip to France. At the Charles De Gaulle airport he saw the letter 'F' on a taxi. This sighting led to thinking about wine labeling, using abbreviations only for other countries or states. For instance, the French Red Blend we enjoyed to the max is called simply F. It is crafted to represent the best of France with grapes sourced from Bordeaux, Rhone and Languedoc-Roussillon. Basically, Dave limits himself to one country or state in the U.S. at a time, but then his imagination takes hold, tempered by a track record of commercial and critical successes. Blends are all the rage. Sorting through the vast number of offerings daunting. A generic label can stand out and be of use to the novice oenophile or a more experienced wine imbiber who is pressed for time, to rely on Mr. Phinney's reputation to quickly pick a great blended wine for the value. The nomenclature is a helpful guide to what you will find inside the bottle consistent with its region. As a point of information: a blend is defined as a wine which contains less than 75% of any one grape. It also is given a name, rather than bearing the name of a grape. Given Mr. Phinney's early acclaim with the label Orin Swift, before the tender age of 30, it is no surprise that Locations Wine is anything but boring. Mr. Phinney's philosophy is organized around novelty. 'Come with me to play and think outside the box,' could be Mr. Phinney's motto behind an attitude that has created some lovely, soft and easy to drink, tasty wines. The first few years his style was to make bold, hit you upside the head wines. Wines historically known for being robust, Phinney seems to be following a newer trend, a more feminized approach to vinification.  I offered to play with the idea of 'places.' Like 'Dora the Explorer,' Locations would accompany me over the winter holidays 2016, until I am here to report, my supply (sadly) ran out. Interesting Musing on Wine from actor David Hyde Pierce, known for his role as a psychiatrist on the television show, 'Frasier':  ""Maybe it's because I'm getting older, I'm finding enjoyment in things that stop time. Just the simple act of tasting a glass of wine is its own event. You're not downing a glass of wine in the midst of doing something else."" Guzzling alcohol, getting drunk and nursing a hang over the next day is not what drinking wine is all about. As a therapist who writes about wine occasionally, the focus is always about savoring the entire experience from choosing the wine -as every bottle tells a story - pairing wines with foods and sharing it all with friendly folks and family.   Quality and Moderation ""Wisdom comes through suffering. Trouble, with its memories of pain,  Drips in our hearts as we try to sleep,  so men against their will Learn to practice moderation.""  ―Aeschylus, Agememnon, Greek Myth, 458 B.C.E. Writer and actor Dan Aykroyd said it well, ""Wine represents to me sharing and good times and a celebration of life. It is always around happy occasions with family and friends and centered on joy. What better item to be involved in then something that represents all these wonderful things?""   NUMBER ONE GO TO HOLIDAY HACK: WINE WITH CHEESEMr. Phinney takes well known combinations of traditional grapes such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. He then chimes into the mix with more exotic varietals like Viognier and Rousanne. The label is CA. The combination of wines on the face of it could seem bizarre at first glance, but it does pair quite nicely with cheese and its accompaniments.   Look no further than F for rose (not to be confused with F for the red blend) for a versatile wine with any number of cheeses. The grenache grapes for this rose were sourced from Fontaine de Vaucluse, the Provence region of France. Mr. Phinney's philosophy is organized around novelty. 'Come with me to play and think outside the box,' could be Mr. Phinney's motto behind an attitude that has created some lovely, soft and easy to drink, tasty wines. The first few years his style was to make bold, hit you upside the head wines. Wines historically known for being robust, Phinney seems to be following a newer trend, a more feminized approach to vinification.Locations Wines accompanied me to a few Friendsgiving celebrations, the start of a new tradition, a holiday keeper forevermore.   Menus and Wine SuggestionsBlue Apron acorn squash curry on the Sunday before The Giving, in Los Angeles. E for Espana was perfect with Anne Thompson and Nora Chute the formidable mother daughter duo;F for France tasted sangiovese-like the Thursday before Thanksgiving Friendsgiving: one a veggie stir fry for two after a long day of work, finished up two days later with posole, a gift from a parent at dear Luisa Bottari Stern's school, before heading out of town. Tuesday Friendsgiving the pentultimate day before Thanksgiving: A dry rubbed fully cooked brisket delivered in butcher paper ready to slice from Marfa Meat Company with OR a, ""silky pinot,"" according to Artist Sam Schonzeit noted. For him, it was the best wine in a Texas pre-Giving dinner party line up. Two bottles of I for Italy with Turkey in Marfa opened up very nicely for Thanksgiving and the next day leftovers with a glass for the bone broth to boot. (We also had the I for a Shared Plates event, the October prior. Locations was so kind to sponsor for those hosting dinner parties.) TX for Texas with dry aged Kansas City strip DeBragga steaks the Saturday night after Thanksgiving in Marfa when it was time to wind down from turkey. I found out about DeBragga, an old guard of New York butcher shops, around since the 1920s, from an informative survey by Gear Patrol. It laid out several fine sources for the best steaks online. Stefanie Faison, of DeBragga, told me a high concentration of customers hail from Oklahoma and Texas, ""where they know good beef."" TX was found at The Get Go, the one fancy foods market in Marfa.The last and final bottle for Thanksgiving and beyondAR for Argentina went to a rare fruit growers party over the weekend in Malibu, where no one was drinking anything stronger than kombucha or beer. We may have committed a faux pas, but since our rare fruit grower hosts do not partake of wine they did not seem to mind that we held the bottle in reserve for the next holiday gathering.  We brought AR, not to be confused with Arkansas, the next day to Anne Beatts' and her daughter, Jaylene's, holiday open house. Bon vivant that she is, Ms. Beatts was one of the original writers for Saturday Night Live.Breaking bread as a group is a deeply humanizing activity. As I have written before about the world of wine is how well it goes with food. The combination of average portions of food and middling amounts of wine is one aggregator of culture to be practiced regularly.   Rule of thumb: One bottle contains 6 glasses for a minimum of 3 people.    To stay safe and away from a danger zone: Remember, some rules are not meant to be broken.  How does a person know where one stands on the spectrum of moderation? Here is a self test to determine if one is in trouble with controlling alcohol consumption. Responsible drinking is within reach for many, but not everyone. Anything more than a glass, not filled to the top, maybe two modest glasses though not much more, is how much one should drink at any sitting as a rule.

But he’s still stopping short of what top ethics experts recommend, The New York Times reported on Saturday.The businessman plans to donate the holdings of the Trump Foundation, his charity fund, and then disband it, a change first reported by the Times. The news follows a decision by his second son Eric Trump to suspend operations of his charity after a nonprofit that he and his brother Donald Trump Jr. lead received negative attention for auctioning off access to the president-elect.“The Foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups ... However, to avoid even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President I have decided to continue to pursue my strong interest in philanthropy in other ways,” Trump said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.Along with its donations, an investigation by The Washington Post revealed that the charity had engaged in self-dealing, something it later admitted.New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been investigating whether foundation spending benefitted Trump’s campaign. Amy Spitalnik, a spokeswoman for Schneiderman, said Saturday on Twitter that the foundation “cannot legally dissolve” until the investigation concludes.In addition, the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas announced on Wednesday that it had agreed to a four-year union contract with its workers, abruptly ending a prolonged battle to resist the union that the federal government claimed broke the law. The company and Unite Here union representing the Vegas workers also reached an organizing deal that could ease the path for unionization at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington.As president, Trump would have the power to appoint members of the National Labor Relations Board, the very agency that ruled against his hotel’s behavior toward Unite Here. His company, the Trump Organization, has also announced decisions to nix construction or plans to build hotels in several foreign countries, including Brazil, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Argentina.The president-elect continues to downplay the ethical quandaries that his business and charity holdings present, most recently protesting this month about the pressure Eric Trump felt to close his foundation. But the Trump Organization’s general counsel Alan Garten indicated to the Times that the series of actions, including last month’s decision to settle lawsuits against the defunct Trump University for $25 million, reflected a desire to avoid potential “distractions.” Trump initially intended to reveal his plans to sever ties to the Trump Organization’s operations on Dec. 15. His transition team subsequently postponed the announcement until January.He has repeatedly stated he plans to hand over control to his adult sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.But the notion that they would run his sprawling business operations raises questions for critics wary of their role as advisers to the president-elect. Aware of these concerns, the Trump Organization is considering bringing in a supervisor or trustee from the outside to minimize potential ethics questions related to the company’s business dealings and interactions with the government, according to the Times. Still, neither Trump nor his transition team have given any indication that they plan to adopt the recommendations of top presidential ethics experts that he liquidate the company and place the cash from the sale into a blind trust.“Although it is of course important that he have no involvement in Trump business operations, in order to avoid conflicts, he must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent,” said Norm Eisen and Richard Painter, the ethics lawyers for President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush’s, respectively, in a Nov. 30 statement.The full extent of Trump’s business holdings and the conflicts of interest they may present remain unknown, since he declined to release his tax returns during the presidential campaign ― a break with four decades of tradition.His ownership of the Trump International Hotel in Washington has already drawn scrutiny as foreign governments flock to patronize it in the hopes of currying favor with the incoming administration. Kuwait even moved its national day celebration to the hotel at the last minute in response to pressure from Trump Organization officials, a source with knowledge of the matter told ThinkProgress.This article has been updated to include a comment from Eric Schneiderman’s spokeswoman."

(Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585ea7621d00002d0019832c.jpeg?cache=KJrciQQCvp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Rodrigo CamposNEW YORK (Reuters) - The year-end stocks rally on the heels of the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president was built on expectations of reduced regulations, big tax cuts and a large fiscal stimulus.Now signs are emerging from the Trump camp that harsher trade policies that could jeopardize the honeymoon are likely in the offing, and investors would be well advised to give those prospects more weight when gauging how much further an already pricey market has to run.By naming China hawk Peter Navarro as head of a newly formed White House National Trade Council, the incoming administration is signaling Trump’s campaign promises to revisit trade deals and even impose a tax on all imports are very much alive.Among the policies favored by Navarro and Trump’s pick for commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, who has the president-elect’s ear on a range of economic issues, is a so-called border adjustment tax that is also included in House Speaker Paul Ryan’s “Better Way” tax-reform blueprint.If implemented, economists at Deutsche Bank estimate the tax could send inflation far above the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target and drive a 15 percent surge in the dollar.Analysts calculate that, all else being equal, a 5 percent increase in the dollar translates into about a 3 percent negative earnings revision for the S&P 500 <.SPX> and a half-point drag on gross domestic product growth. The dollar index <.DXY> has already gained more than 5 percent since the U.S. election.Harsher trade policies may not cause a full economic slowdown, “but I’d expect a localized recession in manufacturing and smaller gains in factory employment as well,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.He said the border tax could trigger retaliation, pouring uncertainty into the market.“Even if the drafters of the legislation have pure intentions, other countries could use this as a pretext for propping up or subsidizing their own favorite industries.”TOP ECONOMY RISKStocks have rallied broadly since Nov. 8, with the S&P 500 advancing by 5.7 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> surging nearly 9 percent to brush up against the 20,000 mark. Some sectors, such as banks <.SPXBK>, have shot up nearly 25 percent in the post-election run.U.S. equities have gotten substantially pricier from a valuation vantage as well. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 has risen by a full point since Election Day, from 16.6 to 17.6, Thomson Reuters data shows. That makes stocks about 17 percent more expensive, relative to their earnings potential, than their long-term average multiple of around 15.Small caps have gotten pricier still. The forward multiple on the Russell 2000 <.RUT> has risen to 26 from 22 on Nov. 8, up 18 percent, while the index price has climbed 14 percent.S&P 500 earnings are expected to rise 12.5 percent next year, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research estimates. Anything that impedes companies from achieving that target, such as a bump from a trade spat or further dollar appreciation in anticipation of new trade barriers, would undermine equity valuations.In the latest Reuters poll of U.S. primary dealers, economists at Wall Street’s top banks cited Trump’s evolving trade policies over other factors, such as fiscal policy, a strong dollar and higher interest rates, as the greatest risk to the near-term economic outlook.The idea of a tax on imports “should alarm people,” according to Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.“If we do have a trade war that’s going to be a major negative” for stocks, he said, adding that the upward momentum in equities, alongside the lack of participation due to the upcoming holidays, have so far prevented a repricing but “we could cap the rally here, that could very well happen.”O’Rourke said technology, a sector that represents the globalization trade, would be among the hardest hit by taxing imports.Deutsche Bank’s auto sector equities analyst estimated the border tax could slam other industries that rely on global supply chains, with the cost of a new car, for instance, jumping by as much as 10 percent.(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Dan Burns and Meredith Mazzilli)"
22,THE WORLDPOST,Weekend Roundup: The Berlin Attack Has Sealed The Political Fate Of Europe,"Nathan Gardels, ContributorEditor-in-chief, The WorldPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/weekend-roundup-149_us_585d48eee4b0de3a08f50927,The blow to German Chancellor Angela Merkel could spell the beginning of the end for a union with open borders.,2016-12-24,All eyes are on Merkel after this week's Christmas market attack in Berlin. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585db0a61d00002c001982a5.jpeg?cache=12SmDzwKMt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Europe was already reeling from major terror attacks in Brussels, Paris and Nice as well as Brexit and the defeat of the political establishment in the Italian referendum before this week. With anti-immigrant parties standing ambitiously in the wings waiting for events to further boost them into power, the worst thing that could have happened, the shoe waiting to drop, was a terror attack at Christmas time in Germany by an asylum-seeker linked to Islamist terror groups. It is just that which took place in Berlin this week. That the inevitable has now occurred likely seals the political fate of Europe. Public opinion will surely turn decisively against the open-arms refugee policy of German Chancellor Angela Merkel — the most prominent defender of the troubled European project of integration and the free movement of people. Merkel’s coalition partner (yet mainstream opponent) Horst Seehofer of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, has already laid down the challenge. “We owe it to the victims, to those affected and to the whole population to rethink our immigration and security policy and to change it.” As Nick Robins-Early reports, the Alternative for Germany party and other anti-immigrant groups are already capitalizing on the incident. One AfD leader called those killed “Merkel’s dead.”Alex Görlach hopes that Merkel’s considerable political skills can save the day by adjusting the Europe-wide refugee policy in the wake of this week’s tragedy. That she is also the only European leader who can stand up to the next American president, Görlach notes, could be a political asset.Yet, even if the chancellor survives, the damage has already been done. The European idea, which has been losing luster for years, looks to be the latest and most consequential casualty of a world in turmoil that stretches from the rubble of Aleppo to the World War II memorial ruins of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, near where the Christmas market attack took place in Berlin.Writing from Germany, Stefan Schmidt argues that his fellow citizens should resist calls to blame anyone but the perpetrator while continuing to embrace the values of an open, but inevitably vulnerable, society. In a similar vein, Sebastian Christ writes from Berlin that, “We can’t give in to those who want to force their hate-filled world view on us. ... On top of everything, we must continue to hold on to freedom for ourselves. I will definitely continue going to Christmas markets in Berlin.” Picking up on the theme in the back of everyone’s mind about Muslims at Christmas, Dean Obeidallah fondly remembers his Muslim father, born near Jesus’ birthplace of Bethlehem, hanging Christmas lights on their home in New Jersey as a child. He also surveys other American Muslims who partake in the holiday, including Aasif Mandvi. Unfortunately, the attack in Germany wasn’t the only attack we saw this week. Another act that shocked the world took place in Ankara, where the Russian ambassador to Turkey was assassinated. John Tures, who has studied the different motivations and effectiveness of “lone wolf” versus “wolf pack” terrorists linked to organized extremists, argues that preventing future attacks, whether of the kind in Berlin or Ankara, requires being able to distinguish between these two threats.Details are still emerging about the attack in Ankara, but it appears to be an apparent act of revenge over the Kremlin’s key role in the brutal assault on Aleppo in recent weeks. As Alex Motyl writes, more such attacks can be expected due to Putin’s Syria policy. “Anti-Russian terrorism is the new normal,” he says. Turkish journalist Ilgin Yorulmaz ponders the timing of the assassination in Ankara, which came on the eve of a tripartite meeting of Russia, Turkey and Iran concerning Syria, and reports that some suspect a geopolitical aim. “A strong NATO member,” she writes, “Turkey may have found a new ally in Russia, and possibly even Iran, to become a game changer in the Middle East.”This week also saw the last evacuations out of Aleppo. Dr. Ahmad Tarakji, whose organization has been working on the ground in the besieged city, offers a detailed account of the humanitarian catastrophe there, which he says is far from over after the forced relocations. “The world has failed the people of Aleppo time and time again,” he writes, “but it’s not too late to act now to help those seeking refuge somewhere else. The international community must do everything in its power to protect these most vulnerable of people. They continue to suffer while the world is standing idly by.”Writing from Moscow before the Syrian regime claimed control over all of Aleppo, Vladimir Frolov proposes that the best course for the Kremlin now would be, “declaring victory in Aleppo, scaling down its military operations against the rebels, refocusing its air war on ISIS in a new collaborative effort with the U.S. and pressuring the Assad regime into a political settlement.” Returning to the hot issue of Russian influence meddling in the affairs of democracies, Toomas Hendrik Ilves knows from whence he speaks. In 2007, the former president of Estonia experienced a Kremlin-led cyberattack on his government, banking and news media servers. He expects more such attacks in Europe as elections loom. “The conundrum that Europe will face in the coming year,” he writes from Tallinn, “is whether or not to use illiberal methods to safeguard the liberal state. … Because of cyberattacks and fake news, we can already imagine the problem all democratic societies will face in future elections: how to limit lies when they threaten democracy?”In an exclusive interview, former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski claims Russian President Vladimir Putin was directly involved in the effort to tip the recent American election scales in Trump’s favor. “Yes. Russian intelligence was involved, no question,” he says, “Yes. Putin plays that kind of direct role. Russian intelligence is not some independent agency. It is an agency of the state organized for specific political purposes. Putin absolutely controls the state apparatus. No doubts there.” He also warns that “stupid irritations” over Taiwan risk derailing America’s most important foreign policy relationship with Beijing. “A world in which America and China are cooperating,” Brzezinski underscores, “is a world in which American influence is maximized.” One of the hottest issues in the U.S. presidential campaign was Donald Trump’s pledge to build a wall with Mexico. Writing from Mexico City, Homero Aridjis and James Ramey offer a highly innovative proposal: Instead of Trump’s wall, they want to build a border of solar panels. “It would have a civilizing effect in a dangerous area,” they contend. “Since solar plants use security measures to keep intruders out, the solar border would serve as a de facto virtual fence, reducing porousness of the border while producing major economic, environmental and security benefits on both sides.” Such an installation, they continue, “would make trafficking drugs, arms and people all the more difficult for criminal cartels. In Mexico, the solar border would create a New Deal-like source of high-tech construction and technology jobs all along the border, which could absorb a significant number of would-be migrant workers on their way to cross into the U.S. illegally, at great physical risk.”Rolling back globalization to stem joblessness and inequality was another prime issue in the recent presidential election campaign. Branko Milanovic takes up this challenge, arguing that reversing globalization would only reduce growth rates in both the advanced and emerging economies, to no one’s benefit. “A more promising avenue for dealing with inequality in rich countries for the 21st century,” he writes, “is to reduce inequality in human and financial capital endowments. This implies, first, reversing the currently extraordinary high concentration of capital assets by giving the middle classes fiscal and other incentives to invest and own assets and, second, equalizing access to high-quality education that is increasingly monopolized by the rich.” A special  Highline investigative report we publish this week traces the corporations and criminals profiting handsomely from the refugee crisis.As we get closer to the end of the year, we take a look at 52 photos from around the world that summed up 2016.

Capping off a year of power struggles, the narrow defeat of Gov. Pat McCrory (R) led to a legislative backlash that drew widespread criticism for undermining the democratic process itself.In fact, a new report from the Electoral Integrity Project says that North Carolina should no longer be classified as a “fully functioning democracy,” a lead EIP researcher wrote in the Raleigh News & Observer.The report points to three main flaws in North Carolina’s political system: extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression of black and brown residents, and the usurpation of incoming governor Roy Cooper’s power through hasty legislation.“If it were a nation state, North Carolina would rank right in the middle of the global league table ― a deeply flawed, partly free democracy that is only slightly ahead of the failed democracies that constitute much of the developing world,” UNC-Chapel Hill political scientist Andrew Reynolds wrote in the Dec. 22 op-ed.The EIP is a nonpartisan project that grades democracies worldwide on a 100-point scale. The gradings are based on multiple factors including voter access to polling sites, the influence of state-controlled media and the potential that an election has been rigged.For this year’s election, North Carolina received a score of 58 out of 100, Reynolds wrote. That’s in the same neighborhood as the governments of Cuba, Sierra Leone and Indonesia.But the idea that North Carolina is on par with such countries has come under criticism, notably from Andrew Gelman, a political scientist at Columbia University who takes issue with the report’s methodology. The EIP sends a survey to participating elections experts asking them to evaluate elections around the world based on 49 indicators. The experts gauge if those contests met international standards before the campaign begins, during the campaign, on Election Day and in the days following. This year, about 40 domestic and international experts were consulted for each election, and the overall response rate was 29 percent. This methodology is how North Korea’s ruling regime was judged to have “moderate” electoral integrity in 2014, as Gelman pointed out in a Jan. 2 post on his website: “Who did they get to fill out this survey? Walter Duranty?“OK, let’s look more carefully. In this table, the response rate for North Korea is given as 6%. And the report said they consulted about 40 ‘domestic and international experts’ for each election. Hmmm ... 6% of 40 is 2.4, so maybe they got 3 respondents for North Korea, 2 of whom were Stalinists.“That 2014 report mentioned above gave North Korea a rating of 65.3 out of 100 and Cuba a rating of 65.6. Both these numbers are higher than at least 27 of the 50 U.S. states in 2016, according to the savants at the Electoral Integrity Project.“Political science, indeed.”(In case you got stuck on Walter Duranty: He was a now-notorious New York Times reporter based in Moscow whose coverage of Joseph Stalin’s rule often downplayed or excused the brutal facts of Soviet communism, most notably in denying the widespread famine of 1932-33.)Gelman further noted that North Carolina isn’t even the lowest ranked state. It’s not that he’s a particular fan of what’s been going on in North Carolina.“If [the scholars associated with the Electoral Integrity Project] don’t like what the North Carolina legislature has been doing, fine. It could even be unconstitutional, I have no sense of such things. ... Vote suppression is not the same thing as an [sic] one-party state and any number-juggling that suggests that is just silly, but, sure, put together enough restrictions and gerrymandering and ex post facto laws and so on, and that can add up,” Gelman wrote. “Electoral integrity is an important issue, and it’s worth studying. In a sensible way,” he concluded ― before calling out several media outlets, including The Huffington Post, for give the report “credulous” coverage.Patsy Keever, chairwoman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, agreed with the report, saying that her state’s current efforts at governing do not adhere to democratic principles.“Senator [Phil] Berger and Speaker [Tim] Moore are power hungry leaders whose number one goal is to protect their power no matter the cost,” Keever said in a statement to HuffPost, referring to the state’s Senate leader and House speaker.“Since 2010, the NC GOP has systematically engaged in a dangerous partisan political agenda, making it harder for people to vote, changing the nature of the State Board of Elections and stripping an incoming Democratic governor of power,” she said. “That’s not what democracy looks like ― and North Carolinians deserve better.”The flaws in North Carolina’s democratic system predate this last election, according to the EIP report. The Republican-controlled legislature racially gerrymandered its own district lines to such a degree in 2011 that a federal court struck down the electoral map as unconstitutional on Nov. 29 and ordered the state to hold special elections in 2017. The EIP concluded that the state of North Carolina had the least democratic redistricting in the world.“There is nowhere in the world outside of America that allows politicians to change the district lines to this degree; it’s a recipe for disaster,” Reynolds told HuffPost. “You’ve got voters locked into a system where they’re unable to change the power dynamics of the state, regardless how they vote.”The North Carolina GOP has also been accused of suppressing black voters, which drew a lawsuit from the state NAACP in October. Thousands of voter registrations, most belonging to black residents, were canceled with less than a week left before the election.Access to voting is a key principle of democracy, one that North Carolina directly attempted to undermine, Reynolds said.But the most blatant move by the North Carolina Republicans to maintain their power came in two laws hastily passed since the gubernatorial election. On Dec. 19, McCrory signed HB 17, which undercuts the power of the incoming governor by requiring Cooper’s Cabinet picks to be approved by the Republican-dominated Senate and cutting the number of state officials he can appoint. The previous week, McCrory had signed SB 4, which increases the number of people on the North Carolina Board of Elections from five to eight, half to be chosen by the governor and half by the legislature ― thereby ensuring an even party split and an effective deadlock on voting matters.The EIP took all these factors into account when assessing North Carolina and concluded that maintaining party power had taken precedence over adhering to true democratic principles.How can North Carolina ― and the United States as a whole ― turn this around? Reynolds had two suggestions to start: An independent entity should be assigned to draw more fair and representative districts, and voting rights advocates must continue the legal battle against voter suppression in the federal courts.“If we know the elections are deeply flawed, and we see all these other puzzle pieces ... it adds up to a deep atrophy of democracy that is no longer worth its name,” Reynolds said. “We claim to be the greatest democracy in the world, but if you look at the symptoms, it’s pretty sick.”This post has been updated to include criticism of the EIP report."

""We're on a mission.""",2016-12-24,President-elect Donald Trump might soon get inundated with yonic treats.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585dde3a1d00002d001982cd.jpeg?ops=crop_0_78_3000_1722%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As a man who has infamously expressed his fondness for grabbing women by their lady parts without consent, President-elect Donald Trump should be thrilled by the hordes of unsolicited vaginas headed his way.Though we’re sure he won’t be.This week, an “LGBT high school couple,” who identify themselves simply as Jules and Gabe, launched Send Trump Pussy, a nonprofit website that allows anyone in the world to send Trump an edible, flesh-colored vulva on a stick for only $3.99.The website claims that it will anonymously send all lollipop orders directly to Trump’s headquarters in New York. Jules and Gabe told The Huffington Post that they intend to donate half of their proceeds to Planned Parenthood, despite removing any mention of donations from their website.“We would really love for people to put their money where their mouths (and social media handles) are and actually work towards sending a tangible message to our unfortunate President-elect Trump while also supporting a very important cause,” they wrote in an email to HuffPost.Those yonic treats will supposedly look like this:The couple launched their campaign with one goal in mind: to let the incoming president of the United States know that there are people who are not happy with the result of this year’s election.“We’re on a mission to show Trump and America that we’re unsatisfied, and our desire for an inclusive un-misogynistic America is unwavering, by sending him pussy-shaped lollipops,” their website reads.The website criticizes Trump on women’s issues (”He’s a mysogynistic pig”), his stance on immigration (”He’s building a fucking wall”) and his apparent inability to represent all of America (”Trumps rhetoric is xenophobic, racist, and misogynistic. He’s the furthest thing from inclusive, and therefore he doesn’t speak for US!”) as reasons you should support Send Trump Pussy and its vagina pop-making endeavors.Jules and Gabe told HuffPost that they chose to keep their identities secret in order to keep the attention on their campaign and because they have not told their families about their sexual identities.Although their domain’s registration, which was created Dec. 18, 2016, is linked to a Danish mailing address and phone number, they maintain that they are students who attend high school in the U.S. The foreign address, they claim, is a result of the domain plan they purchased “in order to further protect our privacy.”Jules and Gabe said they will wait until more people purchase their lollipops so they can send them in bulk to Trump’s headquarters.“That way,” they explained by email, “he will really understand how important [the campaign] is and so he and his administration see how many people really believe in women representing their reproductive rights.”For those who don’t want to send Trump a pussy pop, the website offers a link to Send Dicks to Donald, a similar, but unrelated, campaign created in August that offers to send edible lollipop penises to “the world’s yuuugest douche bag” for $4.99. (Send Dicks to Donald’s domain registration is linked to a mailing address and phone number in Phoenix.)Whether it’s penis or vulva pops, the mission remains the same.“We are not proud of this President-elect representing the American people,” Jules and Gabe said. “We are the American people, the LGBTQ community represents the American people, women comprise the American People, and Donald Trump needs to represent us.”This story has been updated to include comments from the creators of Send Trump Pussy."

30,GREEN,My Top Three Choices For Green Holiday Gifts,"Gay Browne, ContributorEnvironmental advocate, humanitarian, and founder of Greenopia...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-top-three-choices-for_b_13834132.html,,2016-12-24,2016-12-24-1482553410-8785493-shutterstock_230227600.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-12-24-1482553410-8785493-shutterstock_230227600-thumb.jpg," As an environmentalist, people are always asking me what the greenest holiday gift is that you can give to someone. This holiday season has been no different. My answer falls into three categories.#1 Buy from a company that has a sustainable policy that matches your values. There is no easier way to give green than to support organizations and companies who are taking action to protect our environment by producing cleaner, safer and purer products. There's a growing number of businesses built around sustainable values to choose from, some of which I have talked about in previous blogs like Love Goodly, Beautycounter and Thrive Market, Noble Carriage for baby toys and Grimms Bluff Vineyards. Whether you choose your gifts based upon the methods by which they are produced or the ingredients in the products, not only are you giving the gift of green, you are supporting companies who have sound environmental principles built into their business plan and who recognize there is a direct link between our actions and global warming. I call it voting with your dollars. The extra bonus is that not only do you give the gift of green to someone else, but you've also paid it forward for yourself and your children and the planet by supporting green business. After I suggest this, the next question is always where to find these products and businesses. Fortunately, there are more and more resources popping up every day. The Environmental Working Group and Health Child Healthy World can guide you on everything from skin care products to those best for children's health. The Rainforest Action Network provides insight down to whether your bank is financing companies that put forests and people at risk. One Percent for the Planet has a guide of businesses that pledge 1% of their annual sales to support environmental causes. Greenpeace even has a guide to greener electronics! Many cities, like Santa Monica, have their own sustainability seals for green business that also encourages buying local. Last, but certainly not least, my own company, Greenopia offers local listings for eco-friendly products in cities all over the United States.#2 The Re-gift. The concept of recycling does not need to be limited to bottles, cans, paper and plastic bags which is why another choice I offer is to give something you already own but know the other person likes or would appreciate. Maybe it's a sweater, a piece of jewelry or a book they've remarked upon. Some of the best gifts I have ever received are the ones my friends have given me, literally off their backs. I love and collect shawls, and you will rarely find me without one within arms reach. More than one of them has come into my possession as a re-gift from a friend who noticed me coveting theirs as I remarked on the color or texture and often it is made by Jules Allen, which I find to be the perfect weight for any California weather. The re-gift is a particularly green gift as it does even involve putting gas in the car.#3 The Gift of Love.My last suggestion, which perhaps should be my first, is always the gift of love. It never goes out of style, is always in season and the perfect size no matter how big or small you are or what age and it is as green as it gets! No harmful side effects to our water or air, and there have been no reports of it killing trees. But for most of us, love is a complicated subject that gets more instead of less complex as one grows older with girlfriends and boyfriends, spouses and significant others, ex's, ""halfs and steps,"" adopted children, distantly related by blood, or chosen to be related because of shared beliefs. Love is non-denominational and the most popular written and talked about topic in the universe. Yet it is not always top of mind when one is racking their brain for the perfect gift. Perhaps that's because our culture ties so much to the material or for some us love might not be present in exactly the way it once was because of a divorce or broken relationship. But love is by far the greenest gift of all. And in its purest form will be re-gifted to you again and again.I wish you all a holiday season full of past and present love, re-gifted jewels, as well as boxes and bags of presents from companies creating sustainable work environments and products, staffed by employees who work hard every day to live with a green heart.  A Christmas family gathering!"

Young girl at Al Alam camp, Tikrit Photo: UNHCR/Caroline GluckBy Bathoul Ahmed and Caroline GluckAl Alam camp, Tikrit, Iraq - UNHCR. For two days and one night, Nasser and Anwar travelled by foot with their seven children to escape from armed groups in Hawiga, spending nearly one day crossing a mountain range in the freezing cold. ""We only had what we wore"", said 37 year-old Nasser, who arrived a day earlier, events still fresh in his mind. ""We walked for 20 hours through the mountains and there were so many mines and IEDs along the way. I counted five or six bodies. It was terrifying"". The family only had bread and water with them. They tried to stay warm at night, huddling together and wrapping themselves with a nylon sheet until reaching the safety of UNHCR's Al Alam camp for displaced Iraqis in Tikrit.Intensified fighting around Hawiga district is one reason that the family, like tens of thousands of others, decided to flee. More than 60,000 Iraqis have left Hawiga since an intensification of military operations to retake the district began in August. But shortages of food, as a result of soaring prices, is another driving factor, with families describing a worsening humanitarian situation.  Nasser and his family, Al Alam camp. Photo: UNHCR/Caroline GluckAnwar said her family survived on one basic meal a day for four months. ""Food was so expensive and we had no money"", she said. ""We were eating just one meal a day, a bowl of bulgur wheat. We at like this, surviving for four months.""Rice prices have increased ten-fold, say former residents. One kilo of rice now sells for 15,000 Iraqi dinars ($12), when it used to cost just between 500 and 1,000 Iraqi dinars (less than $1). A kilo of sugar now costs 42,000 Iraqi dinars ($35) when it used to cost just 1,000 dinars (less than $1).""People were hungry and living in fear"", said Jumah, who fled the city with his wife and three children and is now sheltering in UNHCR's Laylan 2 camp in Kirkuk. ""Everything became more expensive. Cooking oil became like gold and not everyone could afford it"". Jumah said families had run out of money for food and that fuel for heating was also scarce, making it impossible to stay warm.   Jumah with his daughter, Sarah, 3, and 18 month old grandson, Samhan. Photo: UNHCR/Bathoul Ahmed Even water was in short supply, said 15 year-old Farah, who is staying in Laylan 2 camp. ""Around five months ago, they cut off the water supply to many of the villages. We had no water in our homes.""We had to go to the river to get water for drinking and so on. If you had no money, you had to drink river water"", she said.Atrocities and brutality against civilians has also been widely reported. Many people described life in Hawiga as living under a reign of terror. Being caught with a phone or a satellite dish could lead to severe punishment; as could violations of strict dress codes.""The forms of torture they used are unheard of"", said Abdullah, another displaced Iraqi who arrived in Laylan 2 camp a week earlier. ""You cannot as a human being imagine the kinds of things they were capable of. They would torture people and hang them out like you hang meat at a butchers'"", he said. According to Nasser, the displaced Iraqi in Al Alam camp, strong punishment was meted out as a deterrent to others. ""Sometimes they killed people at the door of their home, in front of their family. ""They insisted to keep dead bodies for four days, as a warning to others. I saw this with my own eyes.""Desperate families have been facing stark choices. Mother of five, Sabah, managed to leave Hawiga with her family on her second attempt, travelling with around 100 other people. Even though she risked her life, she said it was a journey worth attempting. ""I feared my children would starve. I have five youngsters, all under 11 years old. ""Would you stay and watch your kids cry of hunger?"", she asked. ""It is easier to try to flee again than to sit and wait for my children to die a slow death"". But while Sabah and family are now safe in Laylan 2 camp, and have received a tent, kitchen items and winter assistance from UNHCR and its partner, anxiety still haunts her. Her father, who is disabled, remains in Hawiga and cannot walk. ""If you cannot walk, you cannot leave. You just wait and pray to be rescued"", she said.""If not, you just wait for them to kill you."""

The media. The terrorism.My personal life.Yes, on the most personal of personal notes, my 2016 was as hard as they come. Really f*cking hard. The kind of hard that makes or breaks you, reminds you that life is in no way a cake walk, and hits you dead in the face with a bucket of ice cold water - and if you wanted a towel to dry it up, you'd have to make it yourself. And I knew this would be the year. The year of so many hard things.  But despite all this, as I look back, I realize that 2016 was a beautiful kind of hard. 2016 was the year.It was the kind of hard that plunged me headfirst into entrepreneurship and being able to support my family. It was the kind of hard that forced me to love myself enough to put my ideas out into the world. It was the kind of hard that inspired me to find out what it meant to be successful. It was the kind of hard that made me appreciate the quiet. The simple pleasure of getting into bed after yet another tough day. The beauty of just being.2016 was the year I realized that growth comes from fear. That the hard times are designed to push you out of your comfort zone. That without the lows to our highs, we're all merely just existing.This is why 2016 was, for me, a beautiful kind of hard.2016 was the year that proved to me that I was designed to succeed. That I could never just merely exist. That I was designed to use my voice for a greater purpose - to help one, two, or three thousand people with my words. And as the days of my life grew harder in 2016, I became more driven, more focused, more determined. This is why 2016 was, for me, a beautiful, life-changing kind of hard.That life-changing kind of hard that makes you realize how much strength and capability you really have. This year provided me with the perfect opportunity to go out and grab life by the balls, make success my own, and begin pursuing my passions with a fervor I never knew existed within me.Because 2016, for me, was hard.And because of that, my inner-superwoman took over. Kicked aside the insecure, worried little woman that was standing in this reality, and prepared to dominate. I told myself there was no way I'd let this hardship get the best of me or my family - and that I wouldn't stop until success was a reality once again.Because 2016 was hard. Beautifully f*cking hard.Is there a part of me that wishes for less worry, less stress, and easier times in 2017? Maybe.But is there a part of me that would keep the worry, the stress, and the ""hard"" if it meant my continued hunger for success and change? My newfound compassion for the world around? My love for what comes from hard work?You're damn right - in every fiber of my being.So, for this new year, I wish you whatever you want. I wish for peace in the world, your happiness, my happiness, and all of what makes everybody feel good. But if 2017 only gets messier and life only gets harder, I wish you all the strength to turn the pain of all into beauty.   Here's to the hard times. Because 2016 was the year.

35,POLITICS,Keith Ellison Says It’s Time For Democrats To Stop Ignoring Their Voters,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/keith-ellison-dnc-detroit_us_585d8258e4b0eb5864864bc8,The Minnesota congressman says the DNC is in need of serious repair -- and he’s the one to fix it.,2016-12-23,Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) campaigned for Democratic National Committee chair in Detroit Thursday and spoke about the need for a major revamp of the party.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d8b231c00000a070ed479.jpeg?cache=27MSZXvOoA&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DETROIT ― Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) rallied hometown supporters and made his case to lead his party on Thursday, toeing the line between criticizing Democrats’ failings and calling for them to come together under a Donald Trump presidency.“We cannot, as Democrats, form some circular firing squad,” he said. “We need unity more than ever.”Ellison, who is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee and will give up his congressional seat if he wins, grew up in Detroit. He held Thursday’s town hall at the Baptist church where his brother Brian Ellison is a pastor.His opponents for the DNC position, which is currently held by Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, include Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Idaho Democrat Sally Boynton Brown, South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire’s Ray Buckley. Several hundred members of the committee will vote on the new chair during their February meeting. Ellison has racked up high-profile endorsements from progressives and labor unions, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions. But he faces serious competition from Perez, who has President Barack Obama’s indirect support, the endorsement of a couple of unions and a strong reputation from his time running the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. The first Muslim to be elected to Congress, Ellison’s bid for DNC chair has made him the target of a smear campaign that accused him of anti-Semitism over recently released remarks on Israel. He has also been criticized for, years ago, supporting Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom he has since denounced.According to Politico, some of Perez’s support comes from Democrats wary of the controversy and concerned Ellison is too connected to identity politics. But Ellison dismissed the contentious theory that identity politics is costing Democrats voters. “The idea that somehow we’ve got to go talk to the white working class or we can talk to people of color is a ridiculous notion that must be rejected,” Ellison said. Instead, he said Democratic issues like social security and better wages have universal appeal. “There’s not some magic transformation that takes over you once you leave the countryside and come to the city. We can talk to each other,” he added, using the example of finding common ground with relatives who own guns or live in the South.Thursday’s town hall felt a bit like a family affair, with an audience full of Ellison’s actual relatives and local influential members of the party.  Ellison’s occasional pandering to the hometown crowd ― including a riff on why it’s time to axe the term “Rust Belt” and digs aimed at Ben Carson and Betsy DeVos, Trump’s two cabinet picks from Michigan ― were rewarded with bursts of laughter and applause.The event also underscored his familiarity with a region that unexpectedly swung red in the recent election, and Ellison criticized Democrats for being out of touch with voters on the ground. “The way Democrats campaign is, you look at all the red states and get rid of them.

Keith Ellison on Jan. 26, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d98c61c00000a070ed4b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DETROIT ― Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) rallied hometown supporters and made his case to lead his party on Thursday, toeing the line between criticizing Democrats’ failings and calling for them to come together under a Donald Trump presidency.“We cannot, as Democrats, form some circular firing squad,” he said. “We need unity more than ever.”Ellison, who is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee and will give up his congressional seat if he wins, grew up in Detroit. He held Thursday’s town hall at the Baptist church where his brother Brian Ellison is a pastor.His opponents for the DNC position, which is currently held by Interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile, include Labor Secretary Tom Perez, Idaho Democrat Sally Boynton Brown, South Carolina’s Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire’s Ray Buckley. Several hundred members of the committee will vote on the new chair during their February meeting. Ellison has racked up high-profile endorsements from progressives and labor unions, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions. But he faces serious competition from Perez, who has President Barack Obama’s indirect support, the endorsement of a couple of unions and a strong reputation from his time running the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. The first Muslim to be elected to Congress, Ellison’s bid for DNC chair has made him the target of a smear campaign that accused him of anti-Semitism over recently released remarks on Israel. He has also been criticized for, years ago, supporting Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom he has since denounced.According to Politico, some of Perez’s support comes from Democrats wary of the controversy and concerned Ellison is too connected to identity politics. But Ellison dismissed the contentious theory that identity politics is costing Democrats voters. “The idea that somehow we’ve got to go talk to the white working class or we can talk to people of color is a ridiculous notion that must be rejected,” Ellison said. Instead, he said Democratic issues like social security and better wages have universal appeal. “There’s not some magic transformation that takes over you once you leave the countryside and come to the city. We can talk to each other,” he added, using the example of finding common ground with relatives who own guns or live in the South.Thursday’s town hall felt a bit like a family affair, with an audience full of Ellison’s actual relatives and local influential members of the party.  Ellison’s occasional pandering to the hometown crowd ― including a riff on why it’s time to axe the term “Rust Belt” and digs aimed at Ben Carson and Betsy DeVos, Trump’s two cabinet picks from Michigan ― were rewarded with bursts of laughter and applause.The event also underscored his familiarity with a region that unexpectedly swung red in the recent election, and Ellison criticized Democrats for being out of touch with voters on the ground. “The way Democrats campaign is, you look at all the red states and get rid of them. Look at the blue states, ignore them,” and then typically solely focus on likely voters in swing states, Ellison said. “When you ignore people they have a tendency to do what? Ignore you right back.”Ellison said that if he’s put in charge, he’ll start by holding listening sessions around the country and call for daily door-to-door campaigning, beginning immediately, to form the lasting relationships that could pay off in fundraising and voter turnout later. “If I’m elected chair of the DNC, it’s going to be a lot more work for everybody,” he said.

The classic “Seinfeld” holiday is celebrated on Dec. 23. As 2016 comes to close, we can’t help but note that this year has been particularly aggravating. So in the spirit of holiday, let’s gather around the Fesitivus pole and air our grievances together.President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet picksAfter Trump was won the election last month, political commentators across Twitter and on cable TV urged skeptics to “wait and see” before making judgments on his presidency. Well, we waited, and so far we’re not impressed. Trump’s cabinet picks are especially worrisome. For secretary of energy, he chose Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who once vowed to axe the department. For secretary of state, he picked an oil executive with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president-elect also tapped a climate change denier to run the Environmental Protection Agency and a man who opposes the minimum wage for Labor Secretary. Incoming White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has ties to white nationalists and Ben Carson, who will run Housing and Urban Development, has referred to a major anti-discrimination policy as a “mandated social-engineering scheme.”The Republican Party is still hell-bent on killing ObamacareMillions of people have health insurance thanks to President Barack Obama’s. signature health care law. The uninsured rate has reached an all-time low and the country has even seen some indirect benefits like better emergency care. Despite this, Republicans, who have been trying in vain for years to repeal the legislation, have promised to “repeal and replace” it as soon as Trump takes office. Even though they’re not even completely sure how they’d replace it. As The Huffington Post’s Jeff Young notes: The party still doesn’t know what it wants the health care system to look like, even though it’s been over six years since the Affordable Care Act became law. Second, Republicans are willing to hold the entire health care industry and 22 million people hostage while they try to solve a riddle that has always eluded them.This seems like it’s going to work out great for everyone.Brexit happenedThe United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, the culmination of a worldwide drift toward nationalism and against the idea of European unity. Since then, the pound has tanked, xenophobic attacks have increased and far-right parties have gained support across the continent. But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the European Union referendum was that its leaders admitted to fudging the numbers on some of the main things they promised. The extra £350 million that former London Mayor Boris Johnson bragged Brits would save from giving up their EU dues didn’t taken into account the money the country gets back in grants and subsidies. The planet reached several alarming climate change milestonesThis year about to become the hottest on record. Arctic sea ice levels have reached historic lows. Climate change was even responsible for the extinction of an Australian rodent species. All in all, a pretty terrible year for Planet Earth.On the bright side, with some of the world’s most powerful countries and corporations joining forces, it looks like we might actually see some progress in the months and years to come. Bill O’Reilly aired one of the most racist things we’ve seen on TVThe below video, starring Fox News correspondent Jesse Watters, will undoubtedly go down as one of the most offensive things we saw all year. Watters visited New York City’s Chinatown to mock Chinese-speaking elderly people, reference several outdated racist stereotypes and take karate lessons (even though karate is a Japanese martial art.) In summation: Good riddance, 2016. You won’t be missed.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated that sea levels in the Arctic were at a new low. Rather, it is sea ice that is at a historic low."

This is particularly true for a president and the presidential team since the stakes are extremely high. Markets can move, global conflicts can erupt and legislation can be halted or sprung to life based on a single word choice. So depending on one’s perspective, it has been either remarkable or harrowing to watch as President-elect Donald Trump and his aides have discussed nuclear proliferation policy with little apparent cohesive message at all. Like many modern dramas, this one started with a tweet from Trump. What followed was 24 hours of clarification that suggested one of two things: The Trump team sees ambiguity as a good thing or they aren’t all operating from the same playbook. TRUMP: WE MUST EXPAND OUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITY. Trump started this whole saga on Thursday:TRUMP AIDE: HE MEANT PREVENTING NUCLEAR PROLIFERATIONLater on Thursday, Trump’s top spokesman Jason Miller put out the first comment in reaction to the tweet.President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it — particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes. He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.TRUMP AIDE: HE’S NOT NECESSARILY SAYING EXPAND OUR NUCLEAR CAPABILITYOn Thursday night, Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway appeared on The Rachel Maddow Show.MADDOW: Honestly, though, the American position on nuclear weapons worldwide for a very long time now, not just as a partisan matter but over multiple presidents, has been that we are trying to lead the way in reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world. He’s saying we’re going to expand our nuclear capability. TRUMP: NO, I REALLY MEANT I AM FINE WITH MORE NUKES On Friday morning, Trump reportedly told the hosts of Morning Joe that he was fine with more nukes.“Let it be an arms race,”Host Mika Brzezinski quoted him as saying. “We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.”  TRUMP AIDE: THERE WON’T BE AN ARMS RACELater on Friday morning, NBC’s Matt Lauer asked Trump’s incoming press secretary Sean Spicer about Trump’s comments. LAUER: If there is going to be an arms race...There is such a thing as strategic ambiguity ― the concept that you benefit when your adversaries have to guess at your intentions. Trump certainly seems drawn to this concept. He chastised President Barack Obama repeatedly for being too forthcoming about his counter-terrorism strategies. He’s also moved quickly to shake up decades of U.S. policy to China without outlining a coherent replacement plan. But the downside of strategic ambiguity is that it can facilitate some unexpected, unwanted results. And in this case, that might include marching the world closer to a nuclear confrontation.Want more updates from Sam Stein? Sign up for his newsletter, Spam Stein, here."
39,POLITICS,Obama’s Labor Team Took Aim At Wage Theft. But They’re Gone In January.,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-labor-department-wage-theft_us_585d3b14e4b0de3a08f4ffcd,"We'll see if Trump's team is ready to target industries, like fast food, where workers often get stiffed.",2016-12-23,The fast-food industry has a poor record when it comes to paying workers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d45741c0000f50e0ed356.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like a lot of other hotel housekeepers, Iris Castro wasn’t being paid for all the overtime she worked at the Baymont Inn in Galveston, Texas. After the Labor Department investigated, the company recently agreed to pay her $13,000 in back wages and damages to cover years of overtime violations. That’s more than half of what Castro, a Honduras native, earns in a full year.Most wage recoveries by the Labor Department are not that large. They typically amount to three or four weeks of back pay, said David Weil, the outgoing head of the agency’s Wage and Hour Division. But to a worker living paycheck to paycheck, that sort of money can make all the difference.“It translates into groceries, a month of rent or the ability to keep up a car. That’s huge,” said Weil. “Beyond that, people are talking about the restoration of their dignity. They know they’re being underpaid unlawfully. There’s a notion of justice that comes with it.”For what’s often considered a sleepy agency, the Labor Department has played a central role in the Obama administration’s economic agenda. Some of President Barack Obama’s most significant domestic reforms ― including one that would extend overtime protections to more than 4 million additional workers ― have emerged from the Frances Perkins Building, the department’s headquarters in Washington. And as Obama’s political appointees begin clearing out their desks, they’re pointing to their efforts in combating wage theft as one of Labor’s big accomplishments.During the last fiscal year, the department ordered employers to pay more than $266 million in back wages to 283,000 affected workers. The only recent year with a larger haul than that was 2012, when back wage awards totaled $281 million for 309,000 workers. The agency’s average yearly recoveries under Obama, adjusted for inflation, were stronger than those during the George W. Bush years and Bill Clinton’s second term, which is as far back as the publicly available data go.“We’ve pretty much fundamentally changed the way we do enforcement,” said Weil, who joined the agency in 2014 from Boston University, where he’d taught economics. “We have the largest impact we possibly can to help and protect the vulnerable workers that are out there.”Despite the eye-popping numbers, the Labor Department probably recovers only a fraction of what the country’s cheated workers are really owed. Setting aside the fact that many workers are too scared to file complaints, the department has always been poorly funded given the number of workplaces it’s tasked to police. A 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office found that during the Bush years many wage-and-hour complaints were never even registered, let alone investigated.Weil insists the department has made vast improvements since then, but also acknowledges its ongoing limitations. To maximize their impact, Labor officials in recent years have zeroed in on industries where they think wage theft is most likely to happen. That includes hotels, like the one that employed Castro, and fast-food restaurants, where employers commonly violate minimum-wage and overtime rules. Last fiscal year, investigators found that more than $5.4 million was owed to 10,300 fast-food workers. They identified violations in more than eight out of every 10 cases they looked into.Given the election of Donald Trump, the days of the fast-food program might be numbered. Even in a Cabinet-to-be stocked with billionaires, the president-elect’s choice for labor secretary was a stunner: Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, corporate parent to the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. burger chains. If Puzder is confirmed, a fast-food CEO will be in charge of policing low-wage workplaces just like his own for safety violations and wage theft. Puzder’s company has often run afoul of labor law, including one case in which Hardee’s agreed to pay $58,000 in back wages to 456 workers.There’s a striking contrast between Puzder’s background and Weil’s previous work.In his academic writing, Weil raised alarms about what he called the “fissured workplace” ― a growing phenomenon in which companies outsource work to other companies, making it unclear who’s ultimately responsible for working conditions at the bottom. Weil held up fast-food franchising as a case in point. Because most McDonald’s restaurants, for instance, are owned and operated by franchisees, McDonald’s is usually off the legal hook when workers get stiffed. To someone like Weil, this system poses deep ethical questions about the nature of employment. To a fast-food CEO, it’s how the world works. Many Labor Department employees ― political appointees as well as civil servants ― are now worried their work will be scaled back or undone by what’s shaping up to be an especially business-friendly administration. Weil wouldn’t comment on what he expects in the Trump-Puzder era, but he noted that the agency’s mission doesn’t change, regardless of who occupies the White House. “I hope anyone who sits in my position, and anyone who sits in the secretary of labor’s position, would take very seriously the fundamental mission of this department and this agency,” he said. “That’s to protect the labor standards of working people according to what the law says. We’re a law enforcement agency, and the law is very clear that people should be paid for their work.”The individual investigations into wage theft allegations are carried out by career civil servants. But broader policies ― like whether to target the fast-food industry ― are steered by the president and his nominees. Republicans have historically taken a more employer-friendly approach at the Labor Department. Trump and his deputies are expected to unwind a lot of the regulations set down by Obama and his outgoing labor secretary, Thomas Perez, who’s now running to lead the Democratic National Committee.One monumental reform that might not survive is the overtime rule. The Obama administration wanted to change overtime regulations so that more people earned time-and-a-half pay when they worked over 40 hours in a week. Salaried employees must earn a salary below a certain threshold in order to be guaranteed overtime pay regardless of their job duties. For years, that threshold has been just $23,660. The administration wanted to raise it to $47,476, which would bring overtime protections to an estimated 4.2 million additional workers. After business groups sued, a federal judge issued an injunction stopping the rule from going into effect on Dec. 1 as originally planned. The Obama administration has appealed the injunction, but it’s likely the litigation will continue beyond Inauguration Day. If Trump wants the rule to die, his Justice Department can basically decline to defend it.Weil doesn’t try to hide his disappointment at the court ruling or the uphill battle the rule now faces. “It was crafted in a painstaking manner,” he said. “We did an enormous amount of outreach and research. It was legally sound from start to finish and consistent with our regulatory history. It remains the right thing to do.”Trump ran a campaign based on restoring good jobs and raising pay for middle-class folks. Weil said he’s encouraged at least by the political quandary killing the overtime rule would create for the incoming president, as well as the fact that Americans seem to be growing less patient with their jobs being degraded.“Wage theft is a notion that is out there now, as is the concern about inequality,” Weil said. “This election was very much about people’s insecurity in changing economic conditions. They’re concerned about what the world is going to look like for their children. I don’t think this is a moment in time that is going to pass.”"

42,POLITICS,Election Polls Underestimated Donald Trump In More Than 30 States,Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/election-polls-donald-trump_us_585d40d7e4b0de3a08f504bd,It's not just that polls got it wrong. It's how wrong they were.,2016-12-23,"Supporters of Donald Trump often claimed during the 2016 election that polls were wrong. Turns out, they were right.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d46a91600002500bdf5c3.jpeg?cache=yMpZpERChC&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Now that all the votes are counted and certified, we can get an accurate look at how polls performed relative to actual outcomes in the 2016 election. While we’ve heard many arguments about why polls failed this year, the real problem isn’t that polls inaccurately predicted the winner. It’s that they all failed in the same direction.In the polling aggregates that included all 50 states, poll errors favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by a ratio of roughly 6 to 1 in Daily Kos estimates, about 5 to 1 in HuffPost Pollster’s aggregates and around 3 to 1 in FiveThirtyEight’s aggregates.Polling aggregates are the simplest way get a macro view of how polls performed. Each aggregator uses different methods, and some exclude certain types of polls. But this year, that didn’t matter ― Clinton was systematically overestimated in all of them.HuffPost Pollster’s estimates underestimated Trump’s performance by at least 1 percentage point in 36 states, FiveThirtyEight underestimated him by at least 1 point in 33 states and Daily Kos did the same in 37 states.The chart above illustrates just how lopsided the aggregate estimates were. The vertical black line at 0 represents the actual vote margin. Anything to the right of that line indicates that the aggregate polls missed in a way that underestimated Trump’s vote. Anything to the left of the line indicates that they underestimated Clinton. In the few states where there seems to be no bar ― Virginia and Colorado, for example ― aggregates were very close to the actual vote.The graph clearly shows there were far more Trump underestimates. But it also shows that the president-elect was underestimated by more than Clinton. HuffPost Pollster underestimated Clinton most in California by about 6 points; FiveThirtyEight and Daily Kos underestimated her most in Hawaii by 8-9 points. Contrast that with the other end of the chart: HuffPost Pollster and Daily Kos underestimated Trump by more than 10 points in seven states, and FiveThirtyEight did the same in nine states. The misses were smaller in battleground states, although still nearly uniform in underestimating Trump. More aggregators had estimates for these states, including RealClearPolitics and The New York Times Upshot.Out of the 15 battleground states in the chart above, polls underestimated Clinton in just two. In the other 13, polls underestimated Trump, though they came very close to the actual result in Virginia. Adding to the issue, in the states Trump was expected to win, polls had him ahead by a maximum of 2 to 3 percentage points. For Clinton, that maximum was north of 8 points.It’s noteworthy ― but not unusual ― that the largest poll misses were actually in states where polls accurately predicted the winner. So while polls had the right candidate, they didn’t predict what a landslide the results would be in California and Hawaii on the Democratic side and West Virginia and Tennessee on the Republican side. This is a pattern we’ve known about for many election cycles. Due to undecideds and “other” categories, polls almost always underestimate the winner’s vote share when it’s an overwhelming win.That tells us something interesting about polling imprecision: We ignore errors when they’re in the right direction, even when they’re really big. That has to stop if polls are to regain any of the credibility they lost this year. We can learn just as much by studying how polls underestimated Clinton by 8 points in California as we can from studying Trump’s 6-point underestimate in Wisconsin.But all of these misses would be far less concerning if they weren’t so one-sided. In theory, polling errors should be normally distributed ― that means Clinton should have been underestimated just as much as Trump was. The charts show very clearly that it’s not even close to equal this year. That means there was a systemic problem in polling in 2016.The claims that polling errors this year weren’t that bad offer little comfort in the face of evidence that the vast majority of the misses benefitted one side. Just because it’s an average-sized miss doesn’t mean it’s OK; it means we’ve been ignoring errors for too long.

Not a single subject given the vaccine developed Ebola, according to research published in The Lancet by scientists from the World Health Organization, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and other groups. The news comes just a couple years after a 2014 epidemic in West Africa killed more than 11,000 people, including one in the United States and several in Europe.“While these compelling results come too late for those who lost their lives during west Africa’s Ebola epidemic, they show that when the next Ebola outbreak hits, we will not be defenseless,” Marie-Paule Kieny, the WHO’s assistant director general for health systems and innovation and the study’s lead author, told The Guardian.The creation of such an effective vaccine in near light speed is “remarkable,” scientists say, and an emergency stockpile of 300,000 doses has been created in case of another outbreak, The New York Times reports.But while the vaccine had 100 percent efficacy among the nearly 6,000 test subjects in Guinea who received it, NPR notes those numbers will likely decline over time as more people are vaccinated, and more work is likely needed to craft a “perfect” counter to the virus.Scientists are also unsure about its long-term effectiveness and have pointed to some side troublesome side effects like headaches and muscle pain. The experimental vaccine (dubbed rVSV-ZEBOV) may also only protect against one of the two common Ebola strains, which will mandate continued work to fully prevent the virus, according to the Times.The Ebola outbreak in 2014 sparked a global health emergency as officials scrambled to contain the virus as it debilitated entire countries in West Africa. It was the largest such outbreak in history.Researchers working on the crisis wrote the outbreak was “clearly not the ideal situation for doing a vaccine trial,” but urgent international need for a solution helped spur work with local government to establish an effective method “in compliance with good clinical practice and international standards.”The vaccine has yet to be approved by a regulatory agency like the Food and Drug Administration. But its manufacturer, Merck, Sharp & Dohme, has been given permission to go through fast-track procedures to meet those hurdles, according to The Guardian."
44,POLITICS,Photos Of Iranian General Linked To U.S. Deaths Suggest Trouble For Trump's Syria Plan,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/photographs-iranian-general-aleppo-trump-syria_us_585c4abce4b0d9a59457c989,"Michael Flynn, the president-elect's national security adviser, could find himself in bed with a man he fought against in Iraq.",2016-12-23,Aleppo's Umayyad mosque following Syrian President Bashar Assad's capture of the city.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585c4cfb1600002400bdf49a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Recently released photographs from Aleppo cast fresh doubt on President-elect Donald Trump’s apparent plan to align with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Syrian President Bashar Assad and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran, the leaders of the alliance that has killed thousands of civilians in the shattered Syrian city.The pictures show Iranian commander Qassem Suleimani visiting Aleppo after pro-Assad forces’ brutal conquest of the city this month. Suleimani has been blamed for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq through funneling Iranian support to trusted militias and aiding Al Qaeda when useful.Since 2014, Suleimani has used increasingly frequent appearances at Middle East battlegrounds to boost the idea that Iran — not the U.S. or its traditional partners, such as Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia — is the most important power in the region. His name has come to represent Iran’s ambitions even in U.S. congressional debates, in which lawmakers have railed against benefits he could receive from President Barack Obama’s nuclear diplomacy with Tehran. So analysts and social media accounts rushed to highlight the photographs over the weekend as a signal of Iran’s policies and assertiveness at a moment of triumph for Assad. The State Department confirmed Monday that the images are real. Now the incoming Trump administration faces an awkward choice. Trump has indicated that he wants to work with the pro-Assad alliance — and, by extension, the Iranians. But his party’s top foreign policy figures have spent years condemning Iran, particularly Suleimani’s wing of the hard-line Iranian military. And retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the president-elect’s choice for national security adviser, has a long history with the Iranian general. They’re not friends. Flynn spent years in Iraq, serving under Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top intelligence officer at the Joint Special Operations Command. He was there as Suleimani trained and armed Iraqi Shiite militias, then began to funnel roadside bombs across the Iran-Iraq border. Once inside the U.S.-occupied country, those weapons killed hundreds of American soldiers.McChrystal held Iran responsible for the American deaths, he told The New Yorker. In the fall of 2006, Flynn’s boss established a task force to lead U.S. operations against the Iranian proxies and Suleimani’s division of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, the Quds Force. After the U.S. team targeted Suleimani in a January 2007 raid and captured a group of Quds Force agents, the “Erbil Five,” one of Suleimani’s militias promptly killed five Americans. In the years that followed, the top U.S. general in Iraq, David Petraeus, developed a deep understanding of Suleimani’s effect on his forces and on Iraqi politics. He called the Iranian “truly evil.”Flynn has cited his experiences in Iraq, with obvious references to Suleimani, in criticizing the rise of Iranian power under Obama’s watch. In a 2015 interview with Fox News a few months after the release of a string of photographs of Suleimani on Iraqi battlefields, he said Iranian “leadership are actually acting as sort of field commanders in some of these battles inside of Iraq.” Flynn went on to say he would be more worried about Iran controlling Iraq than he would be about the vicious Islamic State group running Baghdad. In congressional testimony on June 10, 2015, he bashed the nuclear deal with Iran by saying, “Evil doesn’t recognize diplomacy.”Now Flynn is working for a man who appears to be willing to cut a deal with any foreign power so long as it might bring some benefit to the U.S. The president-elect has consistently presented himself as tough on Iran. He has said he would tear up the nuclear deal, an outcome even opponents of Iran, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, now oppose. But Trump may have gone so far in his pledge simply because he knew he needed to sound aggressive — the way he tried to court the right by going far beyond GOP talking points on reproductive rights and immigration, suggesting he would punish women who had abortions and ban Muslims from entering the U.S. He eventually softened both statements.There is no guarantee Trump’s statement indicates a real fear of Iran’s potential danger to the U.S. or a true desire to rein it in. In fact, Trump attacked Obama’s deal in a way few others have: He said it does not provide enough money-making opportunities for U.S. companies. That suggests a more lucrative agreement might assuage his concerns. Moreover, Trump has already shown a tolerance of unsavory regimes — including the one in Tehran. Trump did business with an Iranian bank for five years, from 1998 to 2003, despite a U.S. Treasury guidance that the entity was controlled by the government he now calls a “big enemy,” the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed in October. Trump has also long admired strongmen such as Iran’s allies Assad and Putin. Over the past quarter-century, the president-elect has praised Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein (angering the Kurds that Hussein massacred and that Trump now says he wants to befriend), China’s Communist rulers, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and, of course, Iran’s partners in Syria, noted Tom Wright, a scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, in an interview with The Atlantic. Although Assad has destroyed his country by pummeling his own population and encouraging the rise of the Islamic State, Trump has said the Syrian leader is “much tougher and much smarter” than Obama.So many in the Middle East doubt that Suleimani’s history will prevent the Trump administration from helping Iran and Assad. Last month, an influential Iranian general publicly described Trump’s rise as an opportunity for Tehran in Syria. Damascus sees Flynn, a skeptic of the opposition in Syria, and potential secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a critic of the kind of sanctions Iran is currently under, as figures who could guide an Assad-friendly policy, Kamal Alam, a scholar at the Royal United Services Institute in London and Levant consultant for the security firm Hoplite Group, told The Huffington Post. The Syrian leader appears keen to engage with Trump.There is “cautious optimism” in Iran because of Trump’s deal-making inclinations and his relationship with Putin, according to Matthew McInnis at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. It’s unclear whether Flynn, Iran skeptics tapped to lead the Pentagon and CIA or Republicans on Capitol Hill can force a different path.Some action against Iran is inevitable in the post-Obama era, argued Brian Katulis, a scholar at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress. Congress pushing through new sanctions on Iran’s missile programs, U.S. officials demanding tighter enforcement of the nuclear deal after repeated Iranian violations in its first year, the Treasury Department forming interpretations that make trade with Tehran even more difficult, and U.S. military routines becoming more robust in the Persian Gulf are all possibilities, AEI’s McInnis said.But Trump will ultimately prioritize counterterrorism and combating the Islamic State above pushing back Iran, McInnis predicted, and that necessitates some degree of coordination. That could mean Suleimani’s triumphant travels around the region — a bugaboo for Republican senators such as Arkansas’ Tom Cotton, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Texas’ Ted Cruz — are far from over.Still, U.S. officials considering closer cooperation with the Iranian general should be cautious, McInnis warned.“He’s not crazy. He’s not a wild-eyed mullah. He’s not that type of person,” he said. “There may be certain tactical points, like when it comes to ISIS, when our goals can align. But not long term…. I could never really see some type of strategic alliance.”Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did Flynn."

Roosevelt certainly would be,” he said.The White House and U.S. intelligence officials have accused Russia of trying to interfere with the U.S. election by hacking Democratic Party accounts. Information from those hacks was leaked online, causing political problems for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Putin dismissed suggestions Moscow had helped Trump to victory in any way however.“It’s not like that,” he said. “All of this (the accusations) speaks of the current administration’s systemic problems.”“SORE LOSERS”The question of who hacked the U.S. Democratic party was not important anyway, said Putin, but what the hacks revealed - that public opinion in the United States was being manipulated - was.“They (the Democrats) are losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame. In my view this, how shall I say it, degrades their own dignity. You have to know how to lose with dignity.”Putin, who spoke positively of Trump before his election win, said that Moscow had believed in his victory.“Trump understood the mood of the people and kept going until the end, when nobody believed in him,” Putin said, adding with a smile. “Except for you and me.”Putin addressed Trump’s comments about the need to boost the U.S. nuclear arsenal, saying they were perfectly normal.Trump’s comments, made in a tweet on Thursday, alarmed non-proliferation experts who said that a boost to the U.S. arsenal could fuel global tensions.But Putin said he was surprised by the fuss Trump’s tweet had caused and how it had been linked to his own statements about Russia’s plans to modernize its own nuclear arsenal.Putin said on Thursday Russia’s military was “stronger than any potential aggressor”. He made clear on Friday he did not regard the United States as a potential aggressor.“I was a bit surprised by the statements from some representatives of the current U.S. administration who for some reason started to prove that the U.S. military was the most powerful in the world,” said Putin.“Nobody is arguing with that.”(Additional reporting by Katya Golubkova, Vladimir Soldatkin, Denis Pinchuk, Peter Hobson, Maria Kiselyova and Andrey Ostroukh, Gleb Stolyarov, Oksana Kobzeva, Andrey Kuzmin, Anastasia Lyrchikova; Editing by)"

47,THE WORLDPOST,Politics And Patriarchy Leave Women In Zimbabwe Without Food Aid,"Sally Nyakanyanga, Women & Girls Hub",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zimbabwe-women-patriarchy-food-aid_us_585d506ee4b0de3a08f51160,"In rural Zimbabwe, food aid is supposed to be distributed according to need. But rights advocates say some village heads",2016-12-23,"With Zimbabwe in the grip of drought, many families rely on food aid to get by. But some NGOs and rights activists say women are being denied aid if they don’t support the ruling ZANU-PF party.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d52c11800002d00e444b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In rural Zimbabwe, food aid is supposed to be distributed according to need. But rights advocates say some village heads are keeping rations from people – mainly women – who don’t support the ruling party.In October last year Tapiwa Mawoma gathered with other residents of Rukangare village, in eastern Zimbabwe, to have her name added to the list of people who were to receive food aid. With the help of the village community, the World Food Program (WFP) had compiled a set of criteria to help decide who was eligible. As Zimbabwe suffered yet another drought, Mawoma, 61, was struggling to feed herself and her family, and due to her age, she was told she would be a beneficiary of the food aid program. But when the time came to collect her rations, she was told her name was no longer on the list.Mawoma is convinced that the decision to deny her food was politically motivated. The village chief, like many in Zimbabwe’s rural communities, supports the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and Mawoma suspects he used his power to scratch her name off the list to force her to switch her loyalties. “No one knows which political party I support, but the village head believes I belong to the Movement for Democratic Change, the opposition political party in Zimbabwe,” she says. Food aid has been handed out every month since, but Mawoma is yet to get any: “We have survived on one meal per day.”El Niño has hit Zimbabwe’s farmers hard, causing two sequential years of severe drought and dry spells, and leaving more than 4 million people in need of food aid. With so many families dependent on NGOs for their meals, rights advocates are concerned that village chiefs, most of them men, are using food aid to boost support for ZANU-PF as the country approaches the 2018 elections.The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission says many people, especially women, are being punished for not backing the “right” party, and addresses the biases affecting food aid in a report released in September. “Food is being distributed on party lines; people who are affiliated to opposition parties such as the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) are never considered for food aid, particularly in most rural areas in Zimbabwe, which are strongholds of the ruling party.” According to activists, women denied aid because of their political affiliation are sometimes forced to turn to prostitution, offering sex with village heads or aid distributors in return for food.“Humanitarian food aid is male-dominated, as women don’t have a say in the distribution of food aid and rarely have their needs met,” says Sally Dura, head of the Women’s Coalition of Zimbabwe. “The chiefs, district administrators, village heads and community leaders in rural communities in Zimbabwe are largely male. As such, very few women will own this process and gender inequalities ensue.”With Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe having declared a state of emergency because of the country’s ongoing food shortages, international organizations continue to bring aid to mainly rural communities. Staples such as cereals, vegetable oil and pulses are sent to the worst affected areas. According to WFP country representative Eddie Rowe, the aid is distributed based on need and with input from everyone in the community. “Targeted districts and wards are selected based on the prevalence of food insecurity,” he says. “Village elders and community members, together with partners and WFP staff, fully participate in the selection and identification of the households eligible for assistance.”But Rowe says the feedback that the WFP gets from villagers indicates that the system is not free from abuse. “We have also received complaints – though a limited amount – about households being excluded for other reasons than their food security status,” he says. “About 62 percent of the feedback we receive is from women.”NGOs warn that the food shortage is exacerbating gender inequalities in Zimbabwe. Women carry the responsibility of finding water every day, and struggle to keep families fed by trying to grow food in parched fields and skipping meals so their children can eat. As with food, the distribution of economic aid often ends up with women losing out.Everyone who is part of Oxfam’s cash transfer program, for example, gets $5 a month through mobile money platforms. But according to Oxfam gender officer Nomthandazo Jones, while women are usually in charge of running the household, men often control the money. “We have had to deal with cases of husbands receiving cash transfers into their mobile phone numbers and then running away with the money and not using it to purchase food for the home,” says Jones.Most villagers are asking for sustainable projects to help them break free from their reliance on food aid and cash transfers. For many women in Zimbabwe, even that is not a viable solution as the majority do not have the rights to their own land. In Zimbabwe, 70 percent of agricultural labor is provided by women, but of the smallholder farmers who benefited from the government’s land reform program, only 18 percent are female; for commercial land, the figure is just 12 percent women.Jones calls for a thorough gender analysis of communities before the launch of any food aid or cash transfer programs, so that socially excluded groups such as women can be part of the design. She also wants to see more women participate in food aid decision-making committees at all levels, to ensure a gender balance among the beneficiaries.For Dura of the Women’s Coalition, rewriting laws around land ownership is the key to making sure women get their fair share of aid. Making it possible for women to own land, not just through their spouses, brothers or fathers, “ensures they are not left out when agricultural inputs distribution takes place and results in women having total control over their farming produce,” she says. “The plight of women is exacerbated in such emergency situations and little is done to address specific gender needs.”The names of some of the people in this article have been changed to protect their identities.

Last week, Obama himself seemed resigned to the idea that Garland will never get the job.“I have an interest in seeing the government work well,” Michel, a longtime environmental lawyer, told The Huffington Post.In August, he took a trip to Washington, D.C. There, acting as his own attorney, he filed a lawsuit in federal court against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to try to accomplish just that. Neither man has lifted a finger since Obama named Garland to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.Far-fetched as it may seem, Michel’s argument was rather simple. As a New Mexican whose senators are both in favor of Garland getting an up-or-down vote to replace Scalia, Michel says McConnell and Grassley’s refusal to do their jobs deprives him of his 17th Amendment right to Senate representation. The courts have jurisdiction over this constitutional violation, Michel argues, and so they should compel the senators to act.Five different federal judges so far have said no dice.The latest rejection came earlier this week from none other than the nation’s top judge, Chief Justice John Roberts, who turned down — on his own — Michel’s emergency request for an injunction against McConnell and Grassley.“Unless this Court grants the injunctive relief I request,” Michel wrote in his plea to Roberts, “I will have been irreparably harmed because the senators I elected, and who are to represent me in the Senate, will have been denied a vote in the required Senate function of deciding whether to confirm Judge Garland.”Roberts’ one-line order simply read “Application... denied by The Chief Justice.” (History suggests Roberts might at least be in a position to sympathize with Garland. In 1992, Roberts’ own nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where Garland now serves as chief judge, was shot down without a hearing or a vote by then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden.)Michel took Roberts’ response in stride.“I’m fine,” he said when he found out about it. “I was asking a judge to do something extraordinary. Although I’m disappointed, I wasn’t shocked by his refusal.”To be clear, the courts that have weighed in thus far haven’t passed judgment on the merits of Michel’s pro-Garland lawsuit. They’ve simply dismissed his claims for lack of “standing” — that is, the right to get his foot in the courthouse door.In November, the first federal judge who addressed his case, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, said Michel couldn’t sue McConnell and Grassley because allowing him to press his claims would turn the courts into a “higher legislature” and invite “suits from all citizens who feel that their representatives have been treated unfairly by the legislative process.”When HuffPost reported on that ruling, we characterized Michel’s legal effort as “dead on arrival,” and repeated what legal commentators across the ideological spectrum had already concluded: that the Constitution leaves it up to the president and the Senate to work out the judicial appointment process. The courts, for the most part, stay out of those fights. Shortly after that article was published, Michel emailed to say our conclusion may have been “overstated,” and forwarded a copy of some of his own legal research on the Senate’s so-called “duty” to act on Supreme Court nominations. Relying on case law, historical practice and the Federalist Papers, the lawyer argued that McConnell and Grassley were thwarting the constitutional “advice and consent” process by obstructing everyone else’s role in it.“The current situation in the Senate is the complete opposite of what the Framers intended ― with a small group of powerful Senators obstructing an orderly nomination and appointment process to fill Supreme Court vacancies,” Michel wrote in an attachment to his email that resembled a legal memorandum.Contreras, the district judge, never reached this argument. Neither did the D.C. Circuit, which earlier this month upheld the ruling and said that Michel’s claimed injury — his loss of Senate representation — was “wholly abstract and widely dispersed.” Which is to say: It’s not a real harm that you can ask a court to vindicate. All of this has come at a price for Michel. He’s spent thousands in filing fees and travel costs, and sacrificed evenings, weekends and even that Nepal vacation, which he said he had to call off to keep up with the judicial process. His wife, though, was supportive from the get-go.“You’ve got to do it. Just go file it,” he recalled his wife telling him right before he went to Washington with his complaint, $400 filing fee in hand. His brother, who lives in Washington, did him the favor last week of personally walking his emergency petition to the Supreme Court, he said.That court could still get one last look at Michel’s case, if he decides to file a formal appeal with the justices ― which would cost him an additional $300 and involve more legal research and compliance with the court’s strict printing requirements for legal documents. Since the Supreme Court only reviews a small portion of the appeals it receives, Michel’s chances remain slim at best. Garland, for his part, is getting ready to go back to his old job in January.Whatever the lawyer’s next steps, he says, the experience has been worthwhile — and he’s picked up some lawyerly skills along the way.“I don’t regret it,” Michel said. “If I hadn’t done it, I’d always be wondering what would’ve happened. At least here I did what I could. I could sleep well.”"

His wife, though, was supportive from the get-go.“You’ve got to do it. Just go file it,” he recalled his wife telling him right before he went to Washington with his complaint, $400 filing fee in hand. His brother, who lives in Washington, did him the favor last week of personally walking his emergency petition to the Supreme Court, he said.That court could still get one last look at Michel’s case, if he decides to file a formal appeal with the justices ― which would cost him an additional $300 and involve more legal research and compliance with the court’s strict printing requirements for legal documents. Since the Supreme Court only reviews a small portion of the appeals it receives, Michel’s chances remain slim at best. Garland, for his part, is getting ready to go back to his old job in January.Whatever the lawyer’s next steps, he says, the experience has been worthwhile — and he’s picked up some lawyerly skills along the way.“I don’t regret it,” Michel said. “If I hadn’t done it, I’d always be wondering what would’ve happened. At least here I did what I could. I could sleep well.”"

The Canadian rock band, which scored big in 2001 with the hit “How You Remind Me,” has been subject to memes, hate articles and even a petition to prevent its members from performing over the years.This time the joke comes from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who poked fun at the rockers in a YouTube video unveiled Tuesday to promote his home AI assistant, voiced by none other than Morgan Freeman. (Robert Downey Jr. volunteered his services after Zuckerberg made the announcement that he was looking for a voice for his AI, but it looks like Freeman won out.)While showing how the device helps with various tasks at home, Zuckerberg asked Jarvis to play “some good Nickelback songs.” “I’m afraid I can’t do that,” Jarvis responded. “There are no good Nickelback songs.”“Good. That was actually a test,” Zuckerberg said. “How about just play some songs that our whole family likes?”Ouch.Fellow Canadian singer Avril Lavigne took to Twitter to stand up for the band fronted by her ex, Chad Kroeger. The pair split in 2015, but are still friendly. She called Zuckerberg out for bullying, writing, “Many people use your products — some people love them and some people don’t. Either way, you’re allowed your musical opinion however, your jab at Nickelback is in poor taste. When you have a voice like yours, you may want to consider being more responsible with promoting bullying, especially given what’s going on in the world today. #SayNoToBullying #TheJokeIsOld #NickelbackHasSoldOver50MillionAlbums.”Well, we now know Nickelback has at least one dedicated fan. Lavigne and Kroeger have collaborated on songs in the past, including tracks on Lavigne’s 2013 self-titled release. Nickelback’s most recent album, “No Fixed Address,” came out in 2014. And be ready ― according to Billboard, the band is working on new music. "

The teller gave Santa an undisclosed amount of money and he left the bank.However, he didn’t leap into a sleigh or any kind of getaway car. Surveillance video shows him walking down Raines Road, according to the newspaper.No one was hurt, except, of course, for the Christmas spirit.“That’s kinda low.

52,GREEN,Sales Of Livestock Antibiotics Are Still Growing,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/livestock-antibiotics-sales_us_585d48ade4b0de3a08f508e8,Doctors say the overuse of antibiotics on farms presents a massive public health risk.,2016-12-23,The FDA has called on the agriculture industry to curb the use of antibiotics on farms. New sales data suggests that's not happening.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d49331c00000a070ed385.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even as scientists sound the alarm that overusing antibiotics on farms is contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant superbugs, sales continue to rise.According to new data released by the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, the sale of antimicrobial drugs approved for food-producing animals rose an additional 1 percent between 2014 and 2015.This is tied for the lowest annual sales increase since 2009, the FDA noted, but drug sales are still up 24 percent overall since that year. Sales of antibiotics considered medically important to humans grew 26 percent over the same period.The increase comes despite the FDA’s recent efforts to urge the agricultural industry to voluntarily phase out its “sub-therapeutic” use of antibiotics for livestock, typically used to plump up animals and prevent disease rather than to treat illnesses. All told, agriculture is responsible for about 70 percent of the nation’s total antibiotics sales. Researchers believe the widespread use of antibiotics on livestock is putting humans at risk of “superbugs” ― like a rare antibiotic-resistant gene that Ohio State University researchers identified at a U.S. pig farm in a study published earlier this month. Dr. David Wallinga, senior health officer of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s health program, said he was “deeply disappointed” by the latest FDA sales figures. They indicate that the FDA’s warnings have proven insufficient, he said.“The signal this sends is that whatever we’re doing is not enough and not fast enough to address the urgency of the health threat,” Wallinga told The Huffington Post. “Our fear is that the FDA’s efforts are so limited that they might do very little to really address this enormous overuse.”To date, the FDA has advocated for the agriculture industry to use medically important antibiotics judiciously — only, for example, when veterinarians can oversee the practice to ensure healthy animals.In the agency’s firmest rule yet, farmers will be required to work with a veterinarian to use a wider subset of antibiotics starting Jan. 1, 2017.But Thursday’s numbers suggest that even the FDA’s new regulation may not go far enough, Wallinga argued.“Every year, we delay really tackling the root of this issue, [and] the threat to all of us becomes greater,” said Wallinga, who believes it’s important to set firmer targets and timelines for reduced use of the drugs.While the agricultural industry has been slow to reduce the use of antibiotics, major food companies like McDonald’s, Subway, Chipotle and Panera have been moving away from serving meat raised with antibiotics. As of 2017, according to Consumer Reports, all the chicken sold at the four chains will be antibiotic-free.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Data were collected from 2,002 urban, literate Brazilian women aged 18 to 39.More than half of those surveyed said they had avoided or tried to avoid pregnancy because of the Zika epidemic, the results showed, while only 27 percent said they had not tried to avoid pregnancy because of Zika.A further 16 percent said they had not been planning pregnancy, regardless of the virus.The study also found that a higher proportion of women in northeastern Brazil (66 percent) than in the south (46 percent) reported avoiding pregnancy. The researchers said this was most likely due to the epidemic being more concentrated in northeastern Brazil.(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Tom Heneghan)"
54,POLITICS,House Conservatives Target Healthy School Lunch Standards,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-freedom-caucus-school-lunch_us_585ac244e4b0de3a08f3d34e,"Lawmakers seem to want ""bringing junk food back into schools.""",2016-12-23,"The House Freedom Caucus has listed the National School Lunch Program at the top of what one nutrition advocate called its ""regulatory kill list.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585ac3621600002400bdf065.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An influential group of House Republicans aims to dismantle the National School Lunch Program and the improved nutritional standards that first lady Michelle Obama advocated.Conservative lawmakers in the House Freedom Caucus last week listed hundreds of regulations and rules they want President-elect Donald Trump’s administration to examine or revoke within its first 100 days. The school lunch program is first on the list. The Freedom Caucus document claims the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act’s 2012 standards to increase the healthiness of food served to 30 million students “have proven to be burdensome and unworkable for schools to implement.” Students, the lawmakers say, aren’t eating the healthy food and schools are throwing it away. Nutrition advocates said they were startled by the proposal to roll back the first lady’s signature program, which studies show is having a positive impact on children’s health.“If we want to improve child nutrition, there is no better way I know of that will impact so many children,” Lorrene Ritchie, director of the University of California’s Nutrition Policy Institute, said of the school lunch program. “Repealing this seems to me to make no sense.”Ritchie helped author a study published in last month’s issue of the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that found meals served through the lunch program were nutritionally superior to those students brought from home. School lunches were associated with more fruit, fewer refined grains, and fewer calories from added sugars and solid fats, according to the study of almost 4,000 elementary school students in California.The study covered a period before the stricter nutritional standards in 2012 and was in line with previous research. “Even prior to those changes, we are seeing kids who eat school meals eat better than kids who don’t,” Ritchie told HuffPost.If researchers were to repeat the study with the new nutritional standards, Ritchie said, school lunches would look even better. School cafeterias, she added, are the front lines for action against the nation’s well-documented struggle with childhood obesity.It’s unclear whether the GOP-led Congress would support loosening school lunch standards, which have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support. It’s also uncertain whether the conservative lawmakers want to gut the program’s nutritional standards or change them. The caucus wants a “rethinking” of the $12.7 billion lunch program and associated breakfast program, Ben Williamson, a spokesman for Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), the caucus chairman, said in an email. He cited a 2015 Congressional Budget Office report as evidence the program may “run the risk of becoming insolvent.” Williamson didn’t respond to a request seeking further comment.Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the GOP attack on the program was “out of touch with the progress that’s been made” improving school lunches.Wootan acknowledged there were well-founded complaints about the program’s stricter standards, but the gripes have declined as schools have adapted. She described Freedom Caucus opposition as “purely political anti-government sentiment” that upends the program’s historical support from both parties.“School lunch has long been a bipartisan tradition that has brought together rural agriculture concerns with urban poverty concerns and everybody in between,” Wootan told HuffPost. “It’s a shame to see calls for bringing junk food back into schools.”A Pew Charitable Trusts report issued this month found that 84 percent of schools reported revenue from meal reimbursements, and from snack and beverage sales have either risen or remained stable under the new guidelines. Six in 10 food-service directors acknowledged obstacles in meeting the requirements.While food waste remains an issue in America’s school cafeterias, that problem has not been made worse by the new meal standards, according to a 2014 study published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.Trump doesn’t appear to have commented on the school lunch program. The president-elect, who famously has a fast-food fondness, has yet to name an agriculture secretary, who would oversee the program.“We’ll see if the administration appoints people who recognize the enormous progress that has been made on school nutrition in the last five years and either support it or to try to roll it back,” Wootan said.―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

62,GREEN,Churchill’s Polar Bears Are Finally Back On The Ice—And They're Sending A Christmas Message,"Dr. Steven C. Amstrup, ContributorChief Scientist, Polar Bears International",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/churchills-polar-bears-are-finally-back-on-the-ice_us_585c6511e4b068764965bb9c,"With Christmas almost upon us, the polar bears of western Hudson Bay have finally returned to their sea-ice hunting grounds",2016-12-23,<p>A late freeze-up on Hudson Bay delayed the return of the area’s polar bears to their seal-hunting grounds. The implications go far beyond polar bears and far beyond the Arctic.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d24971800001c00e4441b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With Christmas almost upon us, the polar bears of western Hudson Bay have finally returned to their sea-ice hunting grounds. The fall of 2016 was the latest freeze-up ever for these bears, shortening their seal-hunting season and straining the limits of their fat reserves. During the first decade of the satellite record (1979-1989), western Hudson Bay had 30% ice coverage by November 13th. During the most recent decade, the average freeze-up date was pushed back to November 24th. But this year on November 24th, there was no ice anywhere in the bay, and polar bears could not return to the ice until the middle of December. Polar bears can only reliably catch their seal prey from the surface of the sea ice. For them, no ice = no hunting = no food. This autumn as hungry polar bears waited longer for the ice to return to the area of Churchill, Manitoba—often called the polar bear capital of the world—reports of polar bear/human conflicts hit an all-time high. Numerous conflicts also were observed amongst the bears themselves as hungry bears tried to catch and eat each other. Although freeze-up finally has arrived on Hudson Bay, the sea ice extent across the Arctic has remained at record lows since October. This means that Churchill’s polar bears are not the only ones at risk. From Alaska to Canada, from Greenland to Svalbard and across the Russian Arctic, the very existence of polar bears ultimately is threatened by sea ice loss from human-caused climate change. If the bears are lucky, next year’s freeze-up may not be as late as this year’s due to natural variation in the climate system. But unless we halt CO2 concentration rise, years like 2016 are guaranteed to be increasingly frequent, and the average availability of sea ice that bears need for hunting can only decline until it is gone—with grave impacts for polar bears. But should we really care about the polar bear’s problems? Is there value in preserving cold places like those on which polar bears depend? Despite having worked most of my adult life in the Arctic, even I don’t like being cold. So, should we really be concerned?Yes, I think we should! Because polar bears depend on a habitat that literally melts as temperatures rise, they provide an easy-to-see example of the impacts of global warming. But global warming is indeed global, goes way beyond melting sea ice, and provides many reasons for concern. Preventing ever-stronger waves of human refugees is one of those reasons. Around the world there is increasing angst about human refugee problems and mass migrations, as millions of people try to find better lives for themselves. Mass migrations and worsening refugee crises are assured if we allow Earth’s temperature to continue to increase. Across Africa and the Middle East, for example, where warmer temperatures and drying landscapes already have challenged human welfare, annual average temperatures are projected to be 3-5°C (~5-9°F) warmer, by the end of the century, than at present. Three or even 5° may not sound like much, but we must remember this is the annual average! The impact of this “average temperature increase” on seasonal temperatures will be huge. If societies around the world continue to release CO2 at present rates, end-of-century summer temperatures over most of Africa and the Middle East will be hotter than anything we ever have experienced. Some parts of the Middle East are predicted to see summer temperature extremes that humans simply cannot withstand. Water availability for wildlife, livestock, and people across much of this region will be dramatically reduced. Each ° C temperature rise, on average, is expected to reduce wheat production by 4%-6%, with impacts greater in areas that already experience warm growing conditions. On top of blistering heat and reduced agricultural production, human numbers across Africa and the Middle East are projected to increase 2-3 fold this century. It is clear that if we fail to halt global temperature rise, numbers of refugees challenging the world’s national boundaries, including our own, will exceed anything we currently can imagine. Polar bears are shouting a message now about how unbearable our world will be in the future if we don’t deal with this crisis, so yes, we should care. Much of President-elect Trump’s support arose from concerns about managing human migration challenges. Mr. Trump knows that refugee crises must be solved at their source rather than at borders of countries to which people are fleeing. He also knows that action is required now to head off these future challenges. If we wait until that unbearable heat is upon us, humanitarian challenges literally will be unmanageable. On the other hand, if we stop global temperature rise in time to save polar bears, we can assure a future world climate that will dramatically reduce humanitarian hardships and stop many refugee crises before they emerge. Avoiding future refugee challenges is at least one reason we should care about polar bears. And in this season of giving and goodwill, we should thank polar bears for the message they are sending."
63,THE WORLDPOST,The Assassination Of The Russian Ambassador Was An Anomaly Even For Grief-Stricken Turkey,"Ilgin Yorulmaz, ContributorFreelance Turkish Journalist, East West Center Fellow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/assassination-russia-ambassador-turkey-anom_us_585c23dce4b0d9a5945794e8,"Regardless of who did it or why, there is only one loser.",2016-12-23,The Russian ambassador’s death is complicated and troubling for the future course of events in Turkey.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585c1d9d1800002c00e4425d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even by the standards of recent tragedies experienced by my country, Monday’s assassination of Andrei Karlov, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, was an anomaly. My grandparents’ generation used to speak of the fear they felt for my parents during the so-called “political violence of the ‘70s” when Turkey’s youth was almost lost to armed fighting between the nationalists and the leftists on the streets and in college campuses. I have a friend whose father was brutally gunned down by his political foes right in front of his young family. The end result was the military takeover in 1980, which set Turkish democracy back at least a decade.Political assassinations are sadly common in Turkey. In fact, Ottoman history is peppered with sons of sultans ordering assassinations against each other in order to take the throne. Yet, the assassination on Turkish soil of a foreign dignitary like Ambassador Karlov is almost unheard of. Some have even likened Karlov’s assassination to that of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, who was killed in Sarajevo in 1914 by a Serbian nationalist, sparking the outbreak of World War I. This line of thinking might be a bit of a stretch, but there are other issues that make the Russian ambassador’s death still complicated and troubling for the future course of events in Turkey. Karlov was a career diplomat and an instrumental force behind the recent rapprochement between Russia and Turkey. The relations between the two countries soured after the downing of a Russian jet by Turkish forces on the Syrian border last year, only to be mended very recently. It’s telling that someone timed Karlov’s assassination to coincide with the improvement of relations between Turkey and Russia, and on the eve of trilateral talks between Turkey, Russia and Iran to discuss the evacuation of Aleppo and resolutions to the Syrian crisis. Everyone in Turkey is in shock and wants to know: Why would someone commit this crime? And why now? The truth is, long before this week’s assassination, Russia and Turkey had been courting each other.Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the first foreign statesmen to offer Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan his support after the coup attempt in July. He has also vowed after Karlov’s assassination that his top diplomat’s death will not damage the fragile relationship between the two nations. During Karlov’s term, Turkey finalized the signing of major joint energy projects with Russia, including Turkish Stream, a trans-Black Sea pipeline that transfers natural gas from Russia to Turkey. It is possible that the newfound Turkey-Russia romance is first and foremost a partnership of convenience. However, there are signs that the partnership may be long-lasting and extend beyond the economy and into the military. It is no secret that Russia is testing waters with neighboring countries and allies for a Russian-led NATO-like formation called CSTO, or the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Last month, Russia offered to set up a joint task force to give it legal grounds to protect Armenia against foreign aggression.The Russian ambassador’s assassination may expose the vulnerabilities of the new shift in Turkey’s foreign policy towards the East at the cost of turning its back on its natural ally, the United States.It’s true that new alliances bring new opportunities for Turkey, but they also mean new variables in an already complex equation. The sentiment expressed by the Turkish government and voiced increasingly loudly by the Turkish public is that hidden powers are trying to manipulate the current chaos and undermine Turkish foreign policy every time Turkey embarks on a new mission. Fear mongers cite the example of the downing of the Russian jet under suspicious circumstances just before the Turkish military was preparing a major onslaught against the self-proclaimed Islamic State in Jarabulus last year. A strong NATO member, Turkey may have found a new ally in Russia, and possibly even Iran, to become a game changer in the Middle East. Recent political moves by Ankara such as the Euphrates Shield operation and the trilateral Syrian talks this week support this logic. Finally, there is the mystery behind Ambassador Karlov’s assassin, Mevlüt Mert Altıntaş, who police later killed in a shootout. He was a riot policeman, whose ranting in broken Arabic seconds after he shot Karlov took everyone by surprise. Considering that he appeared to be reciting memorized phrases, one wonders if someone was trying to link his terrible crime to terrorist organizations like al Qaeda. Investigations into the assassination are still ongoing, but it seems increasingly possible that Altıntaş was more than a policeman, even possibly a Carlos the Jackal-like professional hit man.President Erdoğan has since tied Altıntaş to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gülen and his movement, which the Turkish government calls the Gulenist Terror Organization or FETÖ. Reports have indicated Altıntaş’s and his uncle’s alleged involvement or connection with the Gülen movement’s school network in İzmir, a coastal town in western Turkey. It has now become the norm for the movement to deny any wrongdoing by Gülen affiliates despite growing allegations against it as Turkey reels from a coup attempt and attacks. At home, the pro-government media and supporters of the Turkish nationalist party MHP, or the National Movement Party, which backs Erdoğan’s bid for a Turkish-style presidency, have long believed that ISIS, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or the PKK, and FETÖ all share information and work towards the same target. In the wake of so many terror attacks in such a short period of time, this assumption is suddenly looking plausible for many Turks. In the last week and a half alone, dozens of people were killed and hundreds were wounded in several attacks against security forces near a stadium in Istanbul and aboard a bus carrying low-ranking soldiers in Kayseri in central Anatolia. In both attacks, The Kurdistan Freedom Hawks, or TAK, a splinter faction of the PKK, deemed a terrorist organization by many, claimed responsibility. There is growing concern that the country will be drawn into further chaos if this trend continues. Unlike Franz Ferdinand’s assassination, Andrei Karlov’s assassination this week was captured on video, and photos were shared by thousands of people on social media, which didn’t exist in Ferdinand’s time a century ago. But the old tricks of provocation and manipulation never cease to work. Regardless of who wanted the ambassador’s death to be a message to whom ― and via whom ― the only loser in this power game looks like ordinary Turks and Turkey itself. "

The Rohingya muslims constitute a significant block of Myanmar’s 55 million population, inhabiting the politically turbulent state of Rakhine. Termed the ‘most persecuted ethnic community in the world’ by the United Nations, the Rohingyas face multiple discrimination at the hands of their host state - Myanmar, as well as their parent state - Bangladesh.Not recognized as citizens or accorded the status of residents in either Myanmar or Bangladesh, the Rohingyas have confronted huge disappointment from neighboring states such as Indonesia, which recently shut its doors for ‘illegal immigrants’ permanently. Human right abuses of ‘illegal Bengalis’ (as the Rohingyas are known in Myanmar) has further escalated, following the killing of nine policemen by a group of Rohingya men and boys on 9th of October. As a consequence, the civilian government and military has declined access to basic humanitarian aid- food, nutrition, health care, to over 130,000 men, women and children.With a long history of tussle between the Rohingya muslim population and the ethnic Rakhine Buddhists prevailing since 2012, certain factions had apprehended smothering of this age-old friction with the coming to power of Aung San Suu Kyi. However, on the contrary, in the face of heightening tensions in the Burmese land, the Myanmar government has out rightly denied reports of human right abuses in Rakhine. Authorities have rather claimed them to be on-going ‘clearance operations’ targeting specifically on the perpetrators of the October 9 incident. Accompanied by heavy clampdown on media and human rights activists, the government forces have failed to suggest that everything is under control to the global onlookers. International outrage has garnered greater momentum, so much so that Malaysia’s foreign minister Anifah Aman and Canadian authorities have urged Myanmar to take urgent steps to establish peace in the region.In such a grave situation, the legitimacy and credibility of the newly elected civilian government is put to doubt, which has amassed wide regional support, including from India. As the largest and oldest functioning democracy in the region, India has traditionally taken up the role of a peace builder. Either as the front-runner of the ‘non-aligned’ movement, or through its independent nuclear doctrine and subsequent stance on the Non-proliferation treaty. India has perpetually striven towards acquiring a unique position in the regional realm, which has catered adequately to its global status. A status of such kind can be acquiesced not just through economic transactions or military exchanges, but by means of proclaiming an identity and sustaining values and norms in diplomatic endeavors and negotiations that is uniquely and intricately woven to the state structure.In doing so, India has ‘intervened’ in the affairs of its neighbors to establish peace and stability: Bangladesh in 1971, Maldives in 1988 and Sri Lanka in 1990s, and very recently Myanmar. While reports claimed that India has secretively tried to break into the sovereign territory of Myanmar, Myanmar has denied such allegations. In this context, it needs to be highlighted that India has a long tradition of contributing to the UN peacekeeping missions. India has been participating in multiple operations including that of Congo, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Gaza. Such has reflected continuity in India’s foreign policy doctrine, and its opposition to forcefully transforming a peacekeeping operation into a peace enforcement without suitable UN authorization. As the principle of consent has held utmost significance for India, it has renewed its engagement with the Burmese government following a brief period of estrangement, in 1990s. And very recently, Suu Kyi’s government has shown renewed enthusiasm to engage with India in developmental activities and economic growth, owing also to its rich past and cultural symphony with India.It is worthy to note here that India has not issued any public statement either in support of the Myanmar government or as siding with the international community in condemning blatant human rights abuse in Myanmar. With a history of being a conflict mediator, this stands as an opportunity for India to sensitively aim at resolving this crisis through peaceful methods of collective decision making. As a partner to Myanmar at the ASEAN, WTO, and BIMSTEC, India can play a major role in ameliorating the struggle of millions of stateless civilians who have turned into victims of a spiraling ethnic conflict.By carefully delineating its stance as neither interference nor forceful imposition of its might, India has the onus of collectively driving the process of peaceful transition of Myanmar. While concerns over China are relevant for India, considering growing proximity between Myanmar and China in the recent past, India upholding its value system of tolerance and non-violence, has the obligation to act responsibly and deliver upon its role of a ‘legitimate’ player in the region.Domestically faced with unprecedented violence in Kashmir which led the Prime Minister to pick up on the volatility of Baluchistan, India’s quietude over Myanmar could be mistaken as ‘self-contradictory’ in the global realm. And in hindsight could be referred to as India’s failure to keep up with its agenda of establishing rule of law and sustainable democratic structures. As India proclaims its foreign policy doctrine to be guided by the principle of democracy, development and diaspora, it is apt time to not just support UN mechanisms but also garner force in the region, to pressurize the civilian government to act boldly and support the cause of human rights in Myanmar. Taking into account Myanmar’s attempts to boost relations with India alongside India’s growing stature in the international realm, the former’s voice will count much more than any other regional partners."

He negotiated the normalization of U.S.-China relations in 1979. He spoke to The WorldPost earlier this week about Russian hacking, Taiwan and Trump.You’ve long spoken about the “political awakenings” from the Arab Spring to the Maidan protests in Ukraine as a new element affecting world affairs. Now, a different form of awakening is sweeping the Western democracies ― populism that seems to have an affinity for Vladimir Putin. What is that about?I think the affinity for Putin is overblown, largely promoted by self-serving journalists. Certainly, some individual leaders of these movements profess admiration for his strongman approach to governance, but I see little evidence there is some kind of popular groundswell in any serious country.The populist movements in the European democracies are the result of confusion and liberation. Europeans are liberated from the past of a continent divided by the Cold War and now integrated economically, which has brought new challenges, not [the] least over migration issues. So there is confusion, and little agreement, about where they are headed in the future. As a consequence, we are getting an hysterical mess in which the recourse to violence, I’m afraid, will play an ever greater role. The situation will become more dangerous as time goes on.Much of the above is also applicable to the current state of the American democracy. Instead of clear-headed leadership, we have sloganeering and an intensifying inclination towards domestic violence. Some groups and political leaders may cast themselves as pro-Russian, yes, and the Russian intelligence agencies are stirring up trouble, trying to undercut European unity on Russian sanctions by encouraging sympathetic political forces. But that is all marginal compared to [the] underlying dynamic I’ve described.Speaking of Russian intelligence agencies meddling in democracies, the CIA and FBI have accused Russia of trying to tip the recent U.S. election in Donald Trump’s favor. President Obama has implicated Putin directly. Is Russia the culprit? Does Putin play that kind of direct role?Yes. Russian intelligence was involved, no question. Yes. Putin plays that kind of direct role. Russian intelligence is not some independent agency. It is an agency of the state organized for specific political purposes. Putin absolutely controls the state apparatus. No doubts there.The meddling had a deliberate aim. The intention was to complicate American political life, initially without too much confidence that Putin would be able to influence events and help Trump win. Later on, as conditions changed and Trump gained traction, they were encouraged to go deeper. They became more ambitious and assertive.Having said that, I don’t mean to suggest Russian efforts were the fundamental or in any way decisive factor of President-elect Trump’s victory. He won soundly for domestic reasons and because of his considerable political skill. But it is also wrong to say Russian efforts had no impact.A top intelligence official told me last week that the Russians and Americans have been engaged in trying to influence elections around the world for decades. All we are seeing, he said, is “old tactics, new methods” enabled by advanced cyber tools. Is that so, or would you say this kind of influence meddling is a new departure?The new methods give activities of this sort a wider scope than ever before. And thus they are indeed more influential and effective than ever before. That is new and, of course, deeply troubling.President-elect Donald Trump upset the geopolitical apple cart by taking a call from Taiwan’s president and making some follow-up comments suggesting he questions the long-standing “One China” policy that recognizes Beijing’s rule over that island nation. You personally negotiated that “One China” policy with Deng Xiaoping when you served as national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter. What dangers do you see in this apparent change of course? The danger I see is provoking antagonism in this foremost relationship of American foreign policy without any significant strategic accomplishment. It is not in our interest to antagonize Beijing. It is much better for American interests to have the Chinese work closely with us, thereby forcing the Russians to follow suit if they don’t want to be left out in the cold. That constellation gives the U.S. the unique ability to reach out across the world with collective political influence.I don’t think it is worth dissipating that with a gesture, such as the phone call, that is not followed by any constructive action. It is a pointless irritant.A world in which America and China are cooperating is a world in which American influence is maximized. If we reduce that through stupid irritations, what do we accomplish? Some are concerned that the new Trump administration will cozy up with Russia and seek to thaw present tensions. Wouldn’t that be good for global stability because it will then break the current momentum that is pushing China and Russia together in a hostile bloc against the West? Russia is not a rival to America in terms of what it has to offer in dealing with China. The Chinese know damned well that, though we may be weakened, depleted and confused, America is basically still number one in the world, and they, the Chinese, are also almost a number one. China thus has a choice to make. If it chooses to be against America, it will end [up] losing out. It is more in their interest to belong to the dominant pack. The reverse is also true for the U.S. if it pushes China away. There is nothing particularly complicated about this. It is only a matter of recognizing some fundamental strategic realities. If we irritate the Chinese to the point where they begin to look for alternatives, they will find them. We won’t find that a very comfortable situation, but one fraught with dangers.Some worry that Trump’s “America First” approach, which has questioned the value of alliances as well as trade and climate pacts, will amount to a withdrawal from the world. With Europe in turmoil, and Russia not truly a world-class player, wouldn’t that leave China as the only major power with a global outlook? To underscore the strategic reality I’ve already outlined, the U.S. and China are the world’s dominant powers. To the extent we have worked together over the years since the normalization of relations, it has not been for the evil purpose of war or conquest, but for the good of enhancing the security and stability required for each to pursue their own interests. In today’s world, China can’t lead alone. Neither can the U.S.. To put it in sharper, if seemingly paradoxical terms, if America tries to go it alone in the world without China, it will not be able to assert itself.If we keep that in mind, we can begin, gradually, to shape a world that is more stable than the world today, which is very unstable and very unpredictable. America’s long-term interests lie fundamentally with deepening our ties to China, not uprooting them for perceived short-term gain. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."

After Carla’s husband had a stroke, she cared for him for more than 20 years. Her husband died last year, and Barton wrote on their trip blog that “she’s been completely lost as to who she is without him ... and she just can’t seem to find her old adventurous self.” That’s why Barton decided to take her on 20 traveling adventures for her 20 years of help.Their journey began in Paris, and the trio have since been to Switzerland, Prague, London, Budapest and more. Barton told The Huffington Post that his mom was initially apprehensive when she found out she would be gone for months, but was excited to travel with him and his partner.“I could tell that the adventurous side of her was itching to go, but the nervous part of her was fighting back a bit,” he said. “But, in true mom fashion, the adventure side always wins.”Carla, who will turn 78 on January 2, loved going to Disneyland Paris and visiting Wales. Strasbourg in France also “made all her dreams come true.” Gregg enjoyed the “stunning city of Prague,” but said his favorite destination so far was the Alsace region. As for Barton, he said Budapest was especially enjoyable for him because of one specific moment with his mom.“My mom has always loved to swim, but she gets cold so easily she rarely does anymore,” he said. “So to see her in a swim cap, swimming around the thermal baths at Gellert Baths in Budapest ― well, it made my heart happy.”Watch a video from part of the trio’s trip below.Gregg, who is responsible for creating the blog for the trip (The Little Girl From Kamas) as well as taking many of the photos and videos, described the trip as “an amazing journey” for the trio. He told HuffPost he has especially enjoyed spreading holiday cheer with Carla. “Carla and I bonded through our love of Christmas and caroling years ago, and now have sung together every Christmas for six years,” he said. “This one has been no different. Only this year, we have been able to carol in Christmas markets throughout Europe! We even found a piano and sang in the Prague train station.”The trip is especially sentimental for Gregg, who lost his mother 20 years ago. During their trip, he’s been honoring her by lighting candles in cathedrals and churches across Europe. He’s also kept up with some of her traditions on the trip like making Christmas ornaments and sending them to family in the United States. Gregg told HuffPost sometimes the trip hasn’t been easy, but he’s happy to be able to go on the adventure with Carla and Barton. He’s especially glad Barton is seizing this opportunity with his mother. “Having lost my own mother 20 years ago, it’s wonderful to see that he doesn’t take this opportunity for granted,” he said. “It’s a chance that many people don’t have with their parents, and I’m so glad that he took it.”Barton is ecstatic he’s getting to travel with his mom, too. “What an enormous gift this has been ― to hold her hand, steady her as she walks on cobblestones, watch her face light up when she sees something she’s seen in a book, and the joy of the simple things,” he said. “Being able to make her toast in the morning, smile at all her little quirks that annoyed me to no end growing up, but now I see as the sweetest things ever.”He told HuffPost he’s not taking a single moment for granted. “It may be so stupid, but as we’re seeing all this stuff, just being able to keep my mom’s arthritis pills in my bag and give them to her when her joints ache, take her in for hot chocolate when she’s cold, or just those simple things, that’s been my greatest joy.”To keep up with their journey, head to The Little Girl From Kamas blog.

71,THE WORLDPOST,Blaming Terrorist Attacks On Refugees Isn't Going To Make Europe Safer,"Alexander Görlach, ContributorVisiting scholar, Center for European Studies, Harvard Univers...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/berlin-attack-refugees-europe_us_585d298ce4b0eb5864860177,"At a moment when we should stand united, rising right-wing parties and even some of Angela Merkel's allies are dividing Germany and Europe.",2016-12-23,German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier walk towards the Christmas market in Berlin a day after it was attacked.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585d3c7b160000dc02bdf5ab.jpeg?cache=YpU0UERZjd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It didn’t take long for Germany’s far-right party Alternative for Germany to exploit the Berlin terrorist attack for political gain. “These are Merkel’s dead,” tweeted AfD leader Marcus Pretzell on Monday.However, Germany has been on the radar of Islamist terrorists for quite some time. So have Christmas markets: in 2000, four Algerians plotted to blow up the Christmas market in Strasbourg in France. In 2007, three terrorists were arrested in Germany for planned simultaneous car bomb attacks ― “the world will burn,” one reportedly said.Terror arrived in Germany long before the Berlin incident. But it was the first in recent times that caused such significant casualties. This is very tragic, but to exclusively blame it on Syrian refugees defeats the purpose of trying to understand how to combat terrorism and prevent future attacks from happening. The suspect, Anis Amri, who was killed in a shootout with police near Milan today, was a Tunisian who came to Europe in 2011, entering through the Italian island of Lampedusa. This was back before the Syrian civil war had become the regional conflagration that it is today; it was also during the aftermath of the Arab Spring, when order in some countries in northern Africa was on the verge of collapsing. How many asylum seekers came to Europe then with bad intentions? How many of them were already eager and keen to become terrorists? The honest answer is: we don’t know.But the right wing’s take on the Berlin attack is shortsighted. As a matter of fact, when southern Europe groaned under the pressure of refugees, the rest of the continent was indifferent about it. Europe’s refugee policy is flawed. The continent needs to get its act together: the regions around it may most likely remain in upheaval and turmoil for quite some time. Not having done so yet has nurtured the rise of anti-establishment activism, right-wing parties and xenophobic violence across the continent.For now, Angela Merkel’s fate depends on how she handles the crisis in her government and the reaction of her electorate unfolding after the Berlin attack. Politicians from her Bavarian ally party, the Christian Social Union, already toured TV and radio stations showing little solidarity with the chancellor. Their fear is that the AfD may gain voters from the CSU and Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union in the federal election next fall.Just like in many countries, the fear spreading after a terrorist attack has the potential to turn the political tables. In Germany right now, the scenario is bizarre: Merkel faces an enemy within her government acting irrationally. If Merkel fails to win next year, the CSU’s Bavarian conservatives would fail to re-enter the national parliament. Some say the logic behind this was to overturn Merkel and install a new candidate for the chancellory. At a moment when the country and its government should stand united, Germany sees a rising division in society.But Merkel’s role is far more important than the division she faces today in the wake of this one attack. She is the only European leader who, at this point, could talk her colleagues into a new immigration policy deal. She is also the only leader who could stand up to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who himself has expressed an intention to dial back America’s military engagements and commitments abroad. Without the U.S., however, Europe is left quasi-defenseless and would see many more terrorist actions succeeding. What we seem to learn from the Berlin attack is this: a brave lorry driver from Poland fought the terrorist until he couldn’t. And Anis Amri, now dead, too, was never wanted in Europe, nor was he invited by Angela Merkel into Germany. The right wing’s exploitation of the terrorist incident is most likely just the warm-up leading into a hot election year in Europe: France and Germany will choose their governments for the coming years. The campaigns will largely revolve around immigration issues, Islam and Muslims in Europe. Hate, once crawled out of the box of Pandora, will only serve to harm our own societies tremendously."

During the presidential campaign, Trump, Conway and the Republican National Committee repeatedly hammered Hillary Clinton for her long press conference drought. Muir reminded Conway of that criticism on Thursday and played a clip of the former campaign manager telling reporters that Clinton “doesn’t respect you the way we do.”Trump hasn’t held a news conference since July, and has broken with tradition by still failing to conduct one in his 44 days as president-elect. By comparison, both President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush held news conferences three days after being declared the winner in the 2008 and 2000 elections, respectively.Conway suggested there hasn’t been time for a press conference, as Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have been forming their cabinet “at record pace.” However, Trump ― who proposed and canceled a press conference to address plans for his business upon taking office ― has recently had time to meet with Kanye West, go on a “Thank You” tour and attend a cocktail party Sunday night with the press at Mar-a-Lago, a half-hour meeting that reporters controversially allowed to be off the record.Over the past week, other top transition figures, such as incoming White House Chief of staff Reince Priebus and senior communications adviser Sean Spicer, have said that some traditions, like the daily televised briefing and White House seating arrangement, were being re-evaluated.In a Fox News interview, Spicer said Trump won’t kick news outlets out of the White House, a departure from the campaign’s willingness to blacklist nearly a dozen. But he acknowledged that the incoming team is looking “at everything” with respect to the press operation. Trump is expected to name his press secretary as early as Thursday, with Spicer at the top of the list. The president-elect is said to also be considering Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle for the high-profile role. "

Google, which has lagged behind smartwatch rivals Apple and Samsung, will begin selling Android Wear 2.0 watches in next year’s first quarter, Jeff Chiang told The Verge. “We are working with a partner OEM on flagship watches for Android Wear 2.0,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. The devices will be known by the partner’s name, rather than Google’s. New features in the Wear 2.0 platform include apps that wearers can run without a phone, and support for Android Pay and the voice-operated Google Assistant, The Verge reported.Many customers with existing Android Wear watches will get an update to the 2.0 platform.Tech blogs such as Android Police have been covering leaks about the watches for months. The devices had been nicknamed Angelfish and Swordfish in those early reports, and they may wind up looking like this, according to Android Police.The Android Wear watches face competition from several established companies and uncertain consumer demand. Reports this fall were divided over whether smartwatch shipments plummeted or surged in the past year. Despite beating Apple into the smartwatch market in 2014, Android Wear hasn’t kept up with its rival, according to Wearable. Samsung Gear rolled out its latest wearable, the S3, in August, well ahead of the holiday shopping season. Fitness device maker Fitbit, meanwhile, acquired watchmaker Pebble this month.

74,POLITICS,House Report Accuses Edward Snowden of Being 'In Contact' With Russian Intelligence,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/edward-snowden-russian-intelligence_us_585c05d5e4b0eb5864856e81,"The report brands the fugitive NSA leaker a dangerous, disgruntled ""fabricator.""",2016-12-22,"Edward Snowden speaks via video link during a conference at the University of Buenos Aires Law School, Argentina, in mid-November.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585c0b731800002d00e44202.jpeg?ops=crop_339_162_2315_1808%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale," A scathing House Intelligence Committee report attacks National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden as a “fabricator” who continues to be “in contact” with Russian Intelligence and has seriously imperiled American troops abroad.“Most of the documents Snowden stole have no connection to programs that could impact privacy or civil liberties — they instead pertain to military, defense, and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries,” says the newly declassified report, released Thursday.Since Snowden’s June 2013 arrival in Moscow, where he fled to escape U.S. treason charges after he leaked NSA documents exposing massive surveillance of ordinary citizens, he “has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services,” says the heavily redacted document, which offers neither evidence supporting the findings nor details.The Pentagon claims to have found 13 “high risk” security issues caused by Snowden’s release of tens of thousands of sensitive NSA documents, according to the report. Eight of those issues could put American troops at “greater risk in any future conflict” if China or Russia gained access to the information, the report says.The document paints Snowden as a “serial exaggerator and fabricator” and “disgruntled employee.” “Snowden was no whistleblower,” the report says.Snowden took to Twitter to defend himself, saying the report was riddled with “obvious falsehoods.”“After three years of investigation and millions of dollars, they can present no evidence of harmful intent, foreign influence, or harm. Wow,” Snowden tweeted.Snowden noted that the report failed to acknowledge his previous criticisms of Russian policies and President Vladimir Putin, including his vocal opposition to a law signed last summer that gave the government sweeping control over Russians’ online communications.“Despite this, they claim without evidence I’m in cahoots with Russian intel,” Snowden wrote.He pointed out that he destroyed important evidence when he fled to Moscow to keep the information out of Russian hands. He concedes he may have been “a pain in the ass to work with ... but this report establishes no worse.”Snowden’s attorney, Ben Wizner of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the report an expensive “failed attempt to discredit Edward Snowden, whose actions led to the most significant intelligence reforms in a generation.” The document “wholly ignores Snowden’s repeated and courageous criticism of Russian surveillance and censorship laws. It combines demonstrable falsehoods with deceptive inferences to paint an entirely fictional portrait of an American whistleblower.”The congressional report comes as Amnesty International presses a last-ditch effort to convince President Barack Obama to pardon Snowden. In a novel strategy, the organization has released a recording from Snowden that can be used as an answering-machine message. Though the recording tells callers to “please leave a message,” Snowden warns that “you’re being watched and recorded.”Amnesty International is supplying the audio download in hopes that it will bring more attention to Snowden’s dire warning about American Big Brother surveillance and build support for him.“Whistleblowers play a critical role in upholding constitutional and human rights guarantees and should be celebrated, not punished,” Amnesty’s Johanna Westeson said in a statement. “Edward Snowden must be pardoned, whistleblowers across the world must be protected, and indiscriminatory mass surveillance of personal data must stop as a matter of urgency.”Snowden said this month that retired Gen. David Petraeus mishandled far more sensitive information than he did, yet Petraeus was then being considered as a possible secretary of state for President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to leaking classified information to his lover and biographer. He was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Trump later chose oil man Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state nominee."

All along, I’ve been proven to be right. 100 percent correct. What’s happening is disgraceful,” Trump said.Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s former campaign manager who will serve as a counselor to the president, tried to clarify Trump’s plans for a Muslim ban on ABC’s “Good Morning America” Thursday.“He said during the campaign long after he had originally proposed that, that this would be more strictly tied to countries where we know they have a history of terrorism and that this is not — this is not a complete ban,” Conway said.At one point in his election campaign, Trump called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country as a means of fighting terrorism, drawing widespread criticism at home and abroad. He later rephrased this to propose temporarily suspending immigration from regions deemed as exporting terrorism and where safe vetting cannot be ensured.However U.S.-born citizens, rather than immigrants, were involved in some of the main attacks in the United States in recent years, including the mass shooting at an Orlando gay nightclub in June.On Monday, Trump issued a statement about the Berlin attack in which he said that Islamic State and other Islamist militants “continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.”But when asked about his reference to Christians, the president-elect on Wednesday appeared to soften his response: “It’s an attack on humanity, and it’s gotta be stopped.”Current and former U.S. officials had reacted with dismay to Trump’s original language, saying it could inflame anti-Western sentiment among Muslims and erode cooperation from Muslim communities that they view as central to quashing such attacks.Trump has been critical of Obama, and of his Democratic rival in the November presidential election, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for what he says is a reluctance to clearly name Islamist militancy as a threat.(Reporting by Melissa Fares and Susan Heavey; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Frances Kerry and Alistair Bell)"

On Dec. 20, Adrian Wood traveled on an American Airlines flight from Raleigh, North Carolina, to Miami with her four kids, who are 3, 7, 9 and 11. In a Facebook post for her blog Tales of an Educated Debutante, she wrote about how the airline went “above and beyond” for her family.She wrote that her traveling experience started when a “smiling agent waiting on the curb” helped her with all of the family’s bags. When she got her “motley crew” inside, another agent guided her to a line for priority customers.“My older children were enchanted with this preferred treatment and so was I,” she wrote. “Nothing seemed to be a problem. Today, I needed nothing to be a problem.”Wood told The Huffington Post that her experience with American Airlines meant a lot to her particularly because her youngest child has special needs.“Amos is the delight of our family, but at 3 still does not speak, and we have been in the throes of seeking a diagnosis for him,” she said. “It has been a tough year truthfully.”A friend of Wood’s told her that airlines typically offer help for customers with special needs, but Wood had never thought to bring it up.“Amos looks like an average adorable 3-year-old and so, we don’t stand out,” she said.This time, Wood spoke up and explained that her son has special needs. She said that her explanation was “not met with one raised eyebrow or disapproving glance.” The family was able to board early, and once they got to their seats a flight attendant captured the moment by taking photos of them, “a kind gesture recognized by a mother that is too often absent in the snapshot.”After her flight, Wood shared what she thought of her traveling experience with American Airlines. A representative told her they would pass on her compliments to the agents who helped her while she traveled.Wood told HuffPost that she wrote her post and shared it publicly because the airline made her family “feel awfully special” and to remind others to “find good things” in life.“We are trying to live by the philosophy that our cup is half full, not half empty,” she said. “It’s so easy to get annoyed and cross this time of year, but it’s more fun to count kindness.”H/T Babble"

I’m not going to be a lobbyist. It’s not going to happen.”The about-turn came on Wednesday, when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he was told the president-elect had soured on the refrain.“He now says it was cute, but he doesn’t want to use it anymore,” Gingrich said on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” after “somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.”The former House speaker backtracked abruptly on Thursday, however, stating he had “mischaracterized” Trump’s attitude. “He intends to drain the swamp,” Gingrich said.“Drain the swamp” wouldn’t be the first chant to lose favor with Trump now that he has won the election. Earlier this month, the president-elect said he no longer cared about prosecuting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton despite the popular “lock her up” refrain heard at his campaign rallies.“That plays great before the election ― now we don’t care, right?” he said.This article has been updated to include Trump’s reaction to Lewandowski’s comments. It has also been updated to include Gingrich’s reversal on the matter."
