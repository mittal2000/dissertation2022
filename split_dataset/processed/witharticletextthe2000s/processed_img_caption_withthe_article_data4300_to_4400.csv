Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a candidate for Democratic National Committee Chairman, cheer during a forum in Baltimore, on Feb. 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b1b07829000020000c31f9.jpeg?cache=NXfGBkjnlL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ATLANTA ― Democratic National Committee members on Saturday voted down a resolution that would have reinstated former President Barack Obama’s ban on corporate political action committee donations to the party.Resolution 33, introduced by DNC Vice Chair Christine Pelosi, would also have forbidden “registered, federal corporate lobbyists” from serving as “DNC chair-appointed, at-large members.”A majority of the 442 eligible DNC members rejected the resolution after roughly a dozen members rose to speak for and against it. Supporters of DNC chair candidate Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) could be heard cheering loudly during arguments in favor of the resolution from their seats in the section of the auditorium open to the public.The resolution will now go to the DNC’s smaller executive committee for consideration.Obama, as the party’s presidential nominee in 2008, banned contributions from political action committees, as well as from lobbyists. Former DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz quietly lifted the ban ahead of the 2016 election.Bob Mulholland, DNC member from Chico, California, was one of the bill’s most vocal opponents and helped lead a successful effort to table the resolution for further review on Friday. He argued that the ban would handicap Democrats at a time when they need all the resources they can muster.“Just a reminder that Republicans control all three branches of the government right now ― all three branches. We do not have a president in the White House,” Mulholland said. “I am not a member of Mother Theresa’s sisters organization; I am a member of the Democratic Party.”New York DNC Member Stuart Appelbaum, a co-sponsor of the resolution, insisted that it was crucial for voters to believe the DNC is accountable to them, not corporate interests.“This resolution provides us an important opportunity to send a message to the people of this country as to our values,” said Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.“It is not something new: We operated this way for seven years!” Appelbaum added, referring to the Obama-era ban.Resolution 33 appears to be narrower than the ban on contributions from lobbyists and PACs imposed by Obama, explicitly banning donations only from corporate PACs.Ellison told HuffPost in January that he would reinstate Obama’s ban on lobbyist donations. He subsequently walked back the promise, vowing only to make sure the measure was seconded and debated by the DNC’s executive committee.His chief opponent, former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, declined to say whether he supports the idea of such a ban."

Li disappeared at some point but it didn’t come to light until cruise workers did a head count of disembarking passengers on Monday. Maritime authorities alerted police, who arrested Belling on suspicion of murder. He was charged with murder and faced a preliminary investigative judge Friday for a hearing in the Rome prison of Regina Coeli. The judge said just before midnight local time that he should remain in custody because of his “suspect” behaviour and concerns that he would try to leave the country, according to the Irish Times.His lawyer indicated to The Telegraph Wednesday that there’s a perfectly good explanation for what happened, though he didn’t provide one. He says Belling would have behaved differently had he been a killer.“He simply headed to Ciampino airport with his children [ages 4 and 6] to catch the flight that he had booked when he first organized the cruise,” said defense lawyer Luigi Conti. He added that his client would explain what happened in court.The lawyer expects the investigative procedure to be brief and expects the case to come to court within less than a year, the Irish Times reports.The last time anyone remembers seeing Belling’s wife was in a shop with her family on Feb. 10, according to La Stampa. The Magnifica was stopped mid-cruise Wednesday evening so investigators could examine the room where the couple was staying, the Irish Sun reports.Belling works as a tech consultant whose clients include Apple, according to the Telegraph. He’s a German citizen but lives in the Irish capital of Dublin. Italian authorities stopped him as he was about to board a flight to Dublin Monday.The couple’s children are in the care of Italian social services.This article has been updated to include details of Belling’s hearing Friday."
2,BUSINESS,7 Ways Managers Motivate And Demotivate Employees,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-ways-managers-motivate-and-demotivate-employees_us_58af5199e4b0658fc20f9314,Few things are as costly and disruptive as managers who kill morale.,2017-02-25,"<p>Dr. Travis Bradberry takes a closer look at 7 mistakes that kill morale, with advice for how managers can do right by their employees.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af51ba2900002700f285d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Few things are as costly and disruptive as managers who kill morale.Demotivated employees underperform and then walk out the door at the first opportunity.The scariest thing is how prevalent this lack of motivation is. Gallup research shows that 70% of employees consider themselves to be disengaged at work.Organizations know how important it is to have motivated, engaged employees, but most fail to hold managers accountable for making it happen.When they don’t, the bottom line suffers.Research from the University of California found that motivated employees were 31% more productive, had 37% higher sales, and were three times more creative than demotivated employees. They were also 87% less likely to quit, according to a Corporate Leadership Council study on over 50,000 people.The Gallup research shows that a mind-boggling 70% of an employee’s motivation is influenced by his or her manager. It’s no wonder employees don’t leave jobs; they leave managers.Making Things WorseBefore managers can start creating motivated, engaged employees, there are some critical things that they need to stop doing. What follows are some of the worst behaviors that managers need to eradicate from the workplace.1. Making a lot of stupid rules. Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be short sighted and lazy attempts at creating order. Whether it’s an overzealous attendance policy or taking employees’ frequent flier miles, even a couple of unnecessary rules can drive people crazy. When good employees feel like big brother is watching, they’ll find someplace else to work. 2. Letting accomplishments go unrecognized. It’s easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Rewarding individual accomplishments shows that you’re paying attention. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it’s a raise; for others, it’s public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you’re doing it right. 3. Hiring and promoting the wrong people. Good, hard-working employees want to work with like-minded professionals. When managers don’t do the hard work of hiring good people, it’s a major demotivator for those stuck working alongside them. Promoting the wrong people is even worse. When you work your tail off only to get passed over for a promotion that’s given to someone who glad-handed their way to the top­­­­­­­, it’s a massive insult. No wonder it makes good people leave. 4. Treating everyone equally. While this tactic works with school children, the workplace ought to function differently. Treating everyone equally shows your top performers that no matter how high they perform (and, typically, top performers are work horses), they will be treated the same as the bozo who does nothing more than punch the clock. 5. Tolerating poor performance. It’s said that in jazz bands, the band is only as good as the worst player; no matter how great some members may be, everyone hears the worst player. The same goes for a company. When you permit weak links to exist without consequence, they drag everyone else down, especially your top performers.6. Going back on their commitments. Making promises to people places you on the fine line that lies between making them very happy and watching them walk out the door. When you uphold a commitment, you grow in the eyes of your employees because you prove yourself to be trustworthy and honorable (two very important qualities in a boss). But when you disregard your commitment, you come across as slimy, uncaring, and disrespectful. After all, if the boss doesn’t honor his or her commitments, why should everyone else?7. Being apathetic. More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee’s success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It’s impossible to work for someone eight-plus hours a day when they aren’t personally involved and don’t care about anything other than your productivity.Making Things BetterOnce managers have eradicated the seven negative behaviors that demotivate their best people, it’s time to replace them with the following seven behaviors that make people love their jobs. 1. Follow the platinum rule. The Golden Rule (treat others as you want to be treated) has a fatal flaw: it assumes that all people want to be treated the same way. It ignores the fact that people are motivated by vastly different things. One person loves public recognition, while another loathes being the center of attention. The Platinum Rule (treat others as they want to be treated) corrects that flaw. Good managers are great at reading other people, and they adjust their behavior and style accordingly.2. Be strong without being harsh. Strength is an important quality in a leader. People will wait to see if a leader is strong before they decide to follow his or her lead or not. People need courage in their leaders. They need someone who can make difficult decisions and watch over the good of the group. They need a leader who will stay the course when things get tough. People are far more likely to show strength themselves when their leader does the same. A lot of leaders mistake domineering, controlling, and otherwise harsh behavior for strength. They think that taking control and pushing people around will somehow inspire a loyal following. Strength isn’t something you can force on people; it’s something you earn by demonstrating it time and again in the face of adversity. Only then will people trust that they should follow you.3. Remember that communication is a two-way street. Many managers think that they’re great communicators, not realizing that they’re only communicating in one direction. Some pride themselves on being approachable and easily accessible, yet they don’t really hear the ideas that people share with them. Some managers don’t set goals or provide context for the things they ask people to do, and others never offer feedback, leaving people wondering if they’re more likely to get promoted or fired.4. Be a role model, not a preacher. Great leaders inspire trust and admiration through their actions, not just their words. Many leaders say that integrity is important to them, but great leaders walk their talk by demonstrating integrity every day. Harping on people all day long about the behavior you want to see has a tiny fraction of the impact you achieve by demonstrating that behavior yourself.5. Be transparent. Good managers are transparent and forthcoming about company goals, expectations, and plans. When managers try to sugarcoat, mask, or euphemize in order to make things seem better than they are, employees see right through it.6. Be humble. Few things kill motivation as quickly as a boss’s arrogance. Great bosses don’t act as though they’re better than you, because they don’t think that they’re better than you. Rather than being a source of prestige, they see their leadership position as bringing them additional accountability for serving those who follow them.7. Take a genuine interest in employees’ work-life balance. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It’s so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing to them; it makes them feel as if they’re being punished for their great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don’t get anything out of the extra work.Bringing It All TogetherIf you cultivate the characteristics above and avoid the demotivators, you’ll become the kind of boss that people remember for the rest of their careers.Have you seen these motivators and demotivators in action? Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.If you’d like to learn more, my book Emotional Intelligence 2.0 is a great place to start."

5,ENTERTAINMENT,George Clooney Subtly Compares Donald Trump Era To McCarthyism,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/george-clooney-edward-r-murrow_us_58b1c65be4b060480e0879f8,The actor referenced Edward R. Murrow’s famous words during a speech on Friday night.,2017-02-25,George Clooney took on President Donald Trump once again on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b1c7022900002200beae39.jpeg?cache=JRusr5jQb3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"George Clooney was in Paris on Friday for the 42nd César awards, France’s version of The Oscars, where he was presented with an Honorary César for his body of work. On stage with actor Jean Dujardin, who presented the award, the actor at first thanked his wife, Amal Clooney, and the French Academy, before turning to the state of things in the U.S.“As citizens of the world, we’re going to have to work harder and harder not to let hate win,” he said, later adding, “I was thinking about Edward R. Murrow as we find ourselves nostalgic for when America was great and when the news wasn’t fake.”Clooney then weaved together quotes from one of the broadcast legend’s most famous telecasts, when Murrow famously criticized Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wis.) on CBS’ “See It Now” on March 9, 1954, as the senator ramped up his anti-communist activities.Said Clooney on Friday:We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must not walk in fear of one another. We must not be driven by fear into an age of unreason. If we dig deep in our history and remember that we are not descendants from fearful people, we proclaim ourselves indeed as we are the defenders of freedom wherever it continues to exist in the world. But we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.Cassius, in this instance, refers to the character from William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. Clooney also swapped in a few words to bring Murrow’s words into the modern era, switching out the journalist’s “the junior Senator from Wisconsin” for “this president.”Edward R. Murrow’s famous criticism of Joseph R. McCarthyClooney is a known fan of Murrow’s career, as he wrote, directed and starred in 2005’s “Good Night, and Good Luck,” a film that followed the tension between Murrow and McCarthy in the 1950s. The actor has repeatedly taken President Donald Trump to task in recent months. Just earlier this week, he called Trump a “Hollywood elitist” who collected “$120,000 a year in his Screen Actors Guild pension fund.”"
6,POLITICS,Anti-Muslim Hate Crimes Are Spiking In The U.S. Donald Trump Won't Speak Up.,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-islamophobia-anti-semitism_us_58b08debe4b0780bac2938b4,"“It is [the president's] duty to repudiate bias.""",2017-02-25,President Donald Trump's inability to understand the fears and concerns of American Muslims was apparent even before he won the election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b0b46f29000020000c30bc.jpeg?cache=4qfNdGraob&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After much pressure, President Donald Trump finally conceded this week that the rise in anti-Semitism around the country “has to stop.” But some American Muslims are wondering ― does the president have our back, too? Since Trump entered the White House, mosques have been vandalized and even set on fire, a prominent Muslim civil rights leader has been threatened with physical assault, and Muslim university students have been targeted with racist fliers and propaganda.This Islamophobia is nothing new. Last year, The Huffington Post tracked 385 anti-Muslim acts in the United States, ranging from verbal harassment to physical abuse.But Trump and his administration has had very little to say that would reassure America’s 3.3 million Muslims that their leaders, institutions, and sacred spaces are safe.Corey Saylor, a leader at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that this organization is waiting on Trump to speak out, after a significant rise in anti-Muslim incidents over the past year. “It is [Trump’s] duty to repudiate bias. President Bush went to a mosque to push back against anti-Islam sentiment in 2001,” Saylor told HuffPost in an email. “We are still waiting for President Trump to demonstrate the same leadership.”Trump’s inability to understand the fears and concerns of American Muslims was apparent even before he won the election. During a presidential debate, when an American Muslim asked him directly how he would combat Islamophobia, he turned the question into an opportunity to rant about “radical Islamic terrorism” ― glazing over the woman’s concerns about anti-Muslim bigotry.This week, American Muslims saw that attitude reappear in the White House. A reporter asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer about the rise in anti-Muslim hate groups during a press conference this week. But Spicer dodged the question, speaking instead about “radical Islamic terrorism.” Like his boss, he ignored the fact that Islamophobic groups are fueling hatred and even calling for violence against American citizens. Catherine Orsborn is the campaign director of Shoulder to Shoulder, an interfaith organization dedicated to ending anti-Muslim bigotry. She told HuffPost that it’s clear from Spicer’s comments that “there is a huge disconnect between what our fellow Americans are facing, in terms of anti-Muslim hate incidents, and how the administration is thinking about these issues.”“They’re not demonstrating any level of concern for American Muslims to live in peace and security,” Orsborn said. “And we need our government to not only speak out against attacks on Muslims, but also show by their actions that they do indeed respect the rights and freedoms of American Muslims as part of the fabric of our country.”On the campaign trail, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which has since morphed into a travel ban that targets refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries. In the past, he’s claimed that “Islam hates us” and that refugees from the Middle East are “trying to take our children.”Reports of anti-Muslim harassment spiked immediately after the election, with some leaders claiming that Trump’s rhetoric has emboldened hate groups. At the same time, anti-Semitism has also been on the rise. The Anti-Defamation League has recorded a troubling rise in hate speech against Jewish journalists online. After the election, several schools and universities reported anti-Semitic vandalism on their campuses. And since Jan. 9, at least 69 bomb threats have been called into 55 Jewish Community Centers across the country. While no bombs were recovered from these locations, the repeated phone threats have caused fear and aggravation in the Jewish community. Rabiah Ahmed, communications director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told HuffPost that she holds Trump and his administration accountable for the increase in hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, and other minorities. “It is their divisive rhetoric that has emboldened many to act out on their biases and feel justified in doing so,” Ahmed wrote in an email. “And it is their responsibility to undo this increasing tide of hate that we are witnessing.”The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect is one of the Jewish organizations that have been calling for the administration to speak out on the rise of anti-Semitism in the country. The center called Trump’s statement against anti-Semitism a “pathetic asterisk of condescension.” And like CAIR, the center is also waiting for Trump to speak out against the abuse that Muslims have had to face.“The President’s Islamophobia, marked by his repeated phony portrayals of Muslims as more prone to terrorism than others, is responsible for creating the incubator of hate that foments the crimes we are seeing against Muslims in America today,” executive director Steven Goldstein told HuffPost. Goldstein said that he was “devastated”, but not surprised, by the President’s silence in condemning anti-Muslim attacks. He called it the silence a “double-barreled danger” to Jews and Muslims.“We have no pecking order in which we fight Antisemitism first, and Islamophobia and other hatred second,” he said. “We have to save every Anne. Never again must mean never again to anyone. Never again is now.”Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, also called out Trump’s silence on anti-Muslim bigotry. “Just as we saw the President denounce anti-Semitism earlier this week, albeit far overdue, we demand and expect the same be stated when it comes to anti-Muslim bigotry,” Pesner told HuffPost. Orbsorn said that while a condemnation of Islamophobia is critical, interfaith activists like her need to see “more than words.”“We need to see action that demonstrates that American Muslim rights are given the same respect as that that should be given to Americans of any other religious faith or background,” she said. “So, yes, we need to hear the condemnation of Islamophobia, but we’re going to need more than words as well to stop the waves of hate crimes.”"

Rabiah Ahmed, communications director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told HuffPost that she holds Trump and his administration accountable for the increase in hate crimes against Jews, Muslims, and other minorities. “It is their divisive rhetoric that has emboldened many to act out on their biases and feel justified in doing so,” Ahmed wrote in an email. “And it is their responsibility to undo this increasing tide of hate that we are witnessing.”The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect is one of the Jewish organizations that have been calling for the administration to speak out on the rise of anti-Semitism in the country. The center called Trump’s statement against anti-Semitism a “pathetic asterisk of condescension.” And like CAIR, the center is also waiting for Trump to speak out against the abuse that Muslims have had to face.“The President’s Islamophobia, marked by his repeated phony portrayals of Muslims as more prone to terrorism than others, is responsible for creating the incubator of hate that foments the crimes we are seeing against Muslims in America today,” executive director Steven Goldstein told HuffPost. Goldstein said that he was “devastated”, but not surprised, by the President’s silence in condemning anti-Muslim attacks. He called it the silence a “double-barreled danger” to Jews and Muslims.“We have no pecking order in which we fight Antisemitism first, and Islamophobia and other hatred second,” he said. “We have to save every Anne. Never again must mean never again to anyone. Never again is now.”Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, Director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, also called out Trump’s silence on anti-Muslim bigotry. “Just as we saw the President denounce anti-Semitism earlier this week, albeit far overdue, we demand and expect the same be stated when it comes to anti-Muslim bigotry,” Pesner told HuffPost. Orbsorn said that while a condemnation of Islamophobia is critical, interfaith activists like her need to see “more than words.”“We need to see action that demonstrates that American Muslim rights are given the same respect as that that should be given to Americans of any other religious faith or background,” she said. “So, yes, we need to hear the condemnation of Islamophobia, but we’re going to need more than words as well to stop the waves of hate crimes.”"

We inherited a legacy from Woody, Pete Seeger and the Weavers and many others who inspired us. They never quit, never stopped and never stopped advocating. Doing so is “in our blood” and it’s a great gift to both Noel and me, as it would be to Mary – were she still to be with us. She would join, even (or maybe especially) at our advanced age, the current advocacies that “hammer out a warning”, “ring out danger” and “sing about the love between our brothers and our sisters”. No, we’ve not “gone away”. We, and others who also come from the folk music/activist tradition, are solidly committed to using our music to generate community and consensus at our concerts and at gatherings and demonstrations to confront the most dangerous of challenges now threatening our country.I have written, and currently perform, two songs that have come out of the presidential campaign and its results, one being The Children Are Listening and the other being, Lift Us Up. I am grateful that, in a limited context (for sure) both of these songs have become rallying points for efforts to assert what is good in ourselves and what is reprehensible and frightening in the face of the recent election. By far the most important effort yet, by either Noel Paul or me – in terms of its reach and, in my opinion, its brilliance – is Impeachable, a parody Noel wrote of the song Unforgettable, which was a huge hit by Nat King Cole from the early 1950s. Impeachable was just released on the internet and went viral with, currently, over 800,000 hits. (Please share this link with your buddies and help us spread the message.)Impeachable is an example of Noel’s extraordinary ability to write a super-funny, very surprising yet also, highly nuanced, lyric. He is, and has always been, an amazing songwriter. In its first public performance last weekend Impeachable brought the audience at our concert in Thousand Oaks, CA to its feet with a prolonged standing ovation. There were screeches of delight the likes of which I have never before heard at a Peter Paul and Mary concert.Noel has clearly struck a hugely resonant chord amongst those who heard the hammer strokes warning of a grave danger to our nation, our democracy and, in fact, the whole earth.Impeachable is a new twist on the kinds of songs that Peter Paul and Mary were singing that helped to mobilize Americans at the time of the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement. Blowing In the Wind and If I Had a Hammer written by Bob Dylan and Pete Seeger & Lee Hays, respectively, were anthems that brought folks together in ways that let them recognize, in very personal ways, their collective strength as well as reassert a commonly held ethical/political perspective. Such was also the case with Where Have All the Flowers Gone and a myriad of other songs. With their repetition at rallies, marches and on the radio, these songs inspired many newcomers to the world of activism who asserted to us that our music, and that of our fellow folk musicians, became the “sound track of their political awakening”. (In our view, this is one of the greatest compliments we ever received.)Today, of course, the dominant transmission of such advocacies comes through social media, though in-person efforts such as The Women’s March on Washington, and the demonstrations at Standing Rock that electrified the nation are still, I believe, the most powerful tools for social/political mobilization.Also, there is another new aspect to a musician’s, or an actor’s, or any artist’s efforts in the realm of advocacy. In this time, humor, as offered by the likes of John Oliver, the gifted cast and guests, such as the amazing Alec Baldwin, on Saturday Night Live, Samantha Bee, Melissa McCarthy, Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah, to name just a few, has played a huge role in inspiring and activating the spirit of our nation. It cuts through the extreme “noise” in tweets, frightening pronouncement and actions emanating from the current administration,Please take heart my friends. From my travels, I have found that there has been a huge call to action heeded, even (and emphatically) in my and Noel’s elder demographic. Be assured that a large body of former artist-activists is mobilizing now with their songs, their poetry, their heart-rending videos, their humor and their visual work on signs and memes that spread across the internet with ever more amazing directness, humor, and determination. As long as this continues to build, we’re walking together and gaining strength. Let’s carry it on, my friends.In solidarity and love, Peter  Impeachable By Noel Paul StookeyImpeachable, that’s what you are… Impeachable, and yet so far... You’ve avoided closer scrutiny And even though Vlad-i-mer Putin, he Opens many doors, it only makes you more...

9,HEALTHY LIVING,10 Habits Of Mentally Strong People,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-habits-of-mentally-strong-people_us_58a63b3be4b0fa149f9ac3f9,You have to be kind to people who are rude to you.,2017-02-25,"<p>Mental strength is a choice and a discipline, not an innate quality bestowed upon the lucky. Dr. Travis Bradberry unveils the habits they rely on so that you can start using them today. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a63f6025000038080b9912.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite West Point Military Academy’s rigorous selection process, one in five students drop out by graduation day. A sizeable number leave the summer before freshman year, when cadets go through a rigorous program called “Beast.” Beast consists of extreme physical, mental, and social challenges that are designed to test candidates’ perseverance.University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth conducted a study in which she sought to determine which cadets would make it through the Beast program. The rigorous interviews and testing that cadets went through to get into West Point in the first place told Angela that IQ and talent weren’t the deciding factors.So, Angela developed her own test to determine which cadets had the mental strength to conquer the Beast. She called it the “Grit Scale,” and it was a highly accurate predictor of cadet success. The Grit Scale measures mental strength, which is that unique combination of passion, tenacity, and stamina that enables you to stick with your goals until they become a reality.To increase your mental strength, you simply need to change your outlook. When hard times hit, people with mental strength suffer just as much as everyone else. The difference is that they understand that life’s challenging moments offer valuable lessons. In the end, it’s these tough lessons that build the strength you need to succeed.Developing mental strength is all about habitually doing the things that no one else is willing to do. If you aren’t doing the following things on a regular basis, you should be, for these are the habits that mentally strong people rely on.1. You have to fight when you already feel defeated. A reporter once asked Muhammad Ali how many sit-ups he does every day. He responded, “I don’t count my sit-ups, I only start counting when it starts hurting, when I feel pain, cause that’s when it really matters.” The same applies to success in the workplace. You always have two choices when things begin to get tough: you can either overcome an obstacle and grow in the process or let it beat you. Humans are creatures of habit. If you quit when things get tough, it gets that much easier to quit the next time. On the other hand, if you force yourself to push through a challenge, the strength begins to grow in you.2. You have to delay gratification. There was a famous Stanford experiment in which an administrator left a child in a room with a marshmallow for 15 minutes. Before leaving, the experimenter told the child that she was welcome to eat it, but if she waited until he returned without eating it, she would get a second marshmallow. The children that were able to wait until the experimenter returned experienced better outcomes in life, including higher SAT scores, greater career success, and even lower body mass indexes. The point is that delay of gratification and patience are essential to success. People with mental strength know that results only materialize when you put in the time and forego instant gratification.3. You have to make mistakes, look like an idiot, and try again—without even flinching. In a recent study at the College of William and Mary, researchers interviewed over 800 entrepreneurs and found that the most successful among them tend to have two critical things in common: they’re terrible at imagining failure and they tend not to care what other people think of them. In other words, the most successful entrepreneurs put no time or energy into stressing about their failures as they see failure as a small and necessary step in the process of reaching their goals.4. You have to keep your emotions in check. Negative emotions challenge your mental strength every step of the way. While it’s impossible not to feel your emotions, it’s completely under your power to manage them effectively and to keep yourself in control of them. When you let your emotions overtake your ability to think clearly, it’s easy to lose your resolve. A bad mood can make you lash out or stray from your chosen direction just as easily as a good mood can make you overconfident and impulsive.5. You have to make the calls you’re afraid to make. Sometimes we have to do things we don’t want to do because we know they’re for the best in the long-run: fire someone, cold-call a stranger, pull an all-nighter to get the company server back up, or scrap a project and start over. It’s easy to let the looming challenge paralyze you, but the most successful people know that in these moments, the best thing they can do is to get started right away. Every moment spent dreading the task subtracts time and energy from actually getting it done. People that learn to habitually make the tough calls stand out like flamingos in a flock of seagulls.6. You have to trust your gut. There’s a fine line between trusting your gut and being impulsive. Trusting your gut is a matter of looking at decisions from every possible angle, and when the facts don’t present a clear alternative, you believe in your ability to make the right decision; you go with what looks and feels right.7. You have to lead when no one else follows. It’s easy to set a direction and to believe in yourself when you have support, but the true test of strength is how well you maintain your resolve when nobody else believes in what you’re doing. People with mental strength believe in themselves no matter what, and they stay the course until they win people over to their ways of thinking.8. You have to focus on the details even when it makes your mind numb. Nothing tests your mental strength like mind-numbing details, especially when you’re tired. The more people with mental strength are challenged, the more they dig in and welcome that challenge, and numbers and details are no exception to this.9. You have to be kind to people who are rude to you. When people treat you poorly, it’s tempting to stoop to their level and return the favor. People with mental strength don’t allow others to walk all over them, but that doesn’t mean they’re rude to them, either. Instead, they treat rude and cruel people with the same kindness they extend to everyone else, because they don’t allow another person’s negativity to bring them down.10. You have to be accountable for your actions, no matter what. People are far more likely to remember how you dealt with a problem than they are to recall how you created it in the first place. By holding yourself accountable, even when making excuses is an option, you show that you care about results more than your image or ego.Bringing It All TogetherMental strength is as rare as it is important. The good news is that any of us can get stronger with a little extra focus and effort.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me. If you’d like to learn more about increasing your mental strength, my book Emotional Intelligence 2.0 can help."
10,POLITICS,Trump’s Glass House Is Cracking (Though He’ll Swear It’s Made Of Steel),"Seth Davin Norrholm, PhD, ContributorTranslational Neuroscientist/Psychologist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trumps-glass-house-is-cracking-even-though_us_58b10770e4b0658fc20f9567,He is solely concerned with being the best and the biggest even when shown conflicting evidence.,2017-02-25,"<p>Metaphorically speaking, President Trump has spent his first month in office throwing stones from inside a glass house.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b107962900000240f28a76.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The old proverb states, “People who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones.” This saying typically means that one should not criticize others for faults that he or she also possesses. However, with regard to President Trump, there are alternative ways at looking at this adage. In his first five weeks in the Oval Office (or at Mar-a-Lago), Trump has repeatedly attacked the media, the intelligence community, and nearly all of his critics as purveyors of “fake news” and the spreaders of lies.Psychologically speaking and at its simplest level, a mental health professional might say that Trump is projecting his own faults onto others and is doing so with increased frequency. For example, this morning the President tweeted his criticism of leakers and how they could be devastating to the U.S.You need only change one word in that sentence for it to read that the leaks would be devastating to Donald Trump and his brief term in office.This afternoon, Trump took the unprecedented step of barring CNN, the New York Times, the LA Times, Buzzfeed, the BBC, the Guardian, and Politico from a White House press briefing. This move escalated an increasingly intense feud between Trump and the free press while also raising concerns about First Amendment violations.As I pointed out in a column last month, this radical step by Trump likely reflects two parallel forces at play here. First, Trump’s limitation of the media outlets that were represented today is a transparent play to control the amount of criticism to which he is exposed; an action that protects his vulnerable ego and is consistent with his malignant narcissism.It is no secret that the outlets that were barred have also been heavily covering Trump’s potentially treasonous ties to Russia. It is also of little surprise that the exclusion of certain media groups today is straight out of the fascist playbook when it comes to rising to an authoritarian position and staying there.Yet, remember what we know about our 45th President. Those with whom he has worked closely report that he has a short attention span, he does not read, he has an insatiable diet for cable news, and he is overly concerned with how he “performs” at public events. He also shows two-dimensional thinking and has a limited use of the English language and the vast possibilities afforded by an expanded vocabulary.Updated 2/25/17 11:30 pm: President Trump has decided not to attend the White House Correspondent’s Dinner becoming the first since Ronald Reagan (who missed the event after being shot in the chest) not to attend. This decision also appears to be the result of separate lines of thinking. One, it neutralizes the potential criticism toward and vulnerability of the hyper-sensitive President in the form of the ribbing that often accompanies this dinner. Second, it reinforces the use of the fascist playbook in its dismissal of the popular media. Lastly, the increasing scrutiny of the President’s ties to Russia would most certainly be a topic of conversation or satire during the event.In other words, he does not have the capacity or desire to “do the heavy lifting” when it comes to being an authoritarian leader… he just wants the adulation. His senior advisers, spokespeople, Cabinet, and permissive Congress are there to plan, execute, and maintain the strategies that will keep King Donald atop his throne while the Court pursues its own individual agendas (e.g., Steve Bannon’s deconstruction of Washington, Stephen Miller’s nationalist state, Betsy DeVos and her interpretation of God’s plan for schools).The man is solely concerned with being the best and the biggest even when shown conflicting evidence. I am proud to see the marches, town hall meetings, and the activist groups that are opposing the President’s narcissistic, inexperienced, immature, delusional, and dangerous behaviors. I believe it is becoming increasingly effective and that his projections (or throwing stones from his own glass house) will be his undoing politically."
11,HEALTHY LIVING,Health Officials To Decide If The U.S. Should Get 3 MMR Shots Instead Of 2,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-officials-to-decide-if-the-us-should-get-3-mmr-shots-instead-of-2_us_58b0dadde4b0a8a9b7828046,A series of big outbreaks are prompting experts to consider giving Americans a boost.,2017-02-25,"There have been several large mumps outbreaks in recent years in the U.S., prompting officials to consider recommending a third vaccine to prevent the disease. <br>*Cases as of Dec. 31, 2016; **Cases as of Jan. 28, 2017. Case counts are preliminary and subject to change.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b0db792900002200f28a2e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal health officials are convening to discuss whether Americans should have three vaccines for the mumps instead of two, The Washington Post first reported this week.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ deliberation is expected to take a full year and is in response to the large number of mumps outbreaks in the U.S. in recent years ― most notably in 2016, when there were more than 5,000 cases, This trend appears to be continuing into 2017, and it’s occurring not in communities with pockets of low-vaccination rates, but instead in areas where vaccine coverage is robust. ACIP liaison member Patsy Stinchfield, who represents the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, said the workgroup of experts would dive deeper into the mumps situation, “given we have had significant cases of mumps in 2006, 2010 and now again in 2016.”These virus outbreaks could be a sign that the current two-shot schedule, which is given in combination with vaccines for measles and rubella between the ages of 12 and 15 months and then when children are between 4-6 years old, may not be strong enough to prevent an infection. Two doses of the MMR shot protects against mumps 88 percent of the time, while one shot is 78 percent effective. In contrast, two doses of the vaccine protects against measles 97 percent of the time, and just one shot is 97 percent effective against rubella.“At present, mumps does not come as a single antigen vaccine and is available only as combined MMR vaccine so deliberating a third dose would also need to consider extra doses of measles and rubella,” said Stinchfield, who is Senior Director of Infection Prevention at Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.Some of the questions the advisory group will consider include why the outbreaks only seem to be occurring among teens and young adults, but not older adults, Stinchfield said.The committee will examine the context of the most recent outbreaks, which for the most part have taken place on college campuses, but not on military bases, which also house similarly aged people in close quarters. The committee will also consider if vaccine storage and handling techniques, or a shift in the mumps genotype compared to the vaccine, could explain the outbreaks.And because the mumps dose is part of a combination vaccine, the committee will examine any potential adverse effects that may come with getting a third MMR shot ― although due to poor record keeping or a person’s uncertainty about their history, Stinchfield said she has often seen patients who have received more than two MMR shots. “In general, receiving extra doses of MMR vaccine is not ideal but poses little to no medical problems,” she said.“Multiple doses and adverse events will also be analyzed by the workgroup.”Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has some guidelines in place for local public health agencies considering offering a third MMR shot to people in the face of a large-scale mumps outbreak, but these are not official recommendations because scientists need more evidence of its effectiveness. In short, local health officials should consider a campaign for a third MMR shot if the outbreak is happening among people with a 90 percent or higher two-dose MMR coverage rate and if there are signs that transmission has gone on for more than two weeks. And an attack rate of more than five cases per 1,000 people could help local health leaders decide to encourage a third shot. In January alone, there were 495 reported mumps infections. Last year there were 5,311 cases. In 2006, the last year there was a large spike in reports, there were more than 5,700 cases, many of which were among fully vaccinated college students. “Remember, mumps is not just a cute chipmunk face associated with an upper respiratory illness,” Stinchfield said. “We vaccinate against it because mumps can cause encephalitis, meningitis, deafness, oophoritis (ovary swelling) and orchitis (testicular swelling).”People with mumps can also experience fever, headache, fatigue and inflammation of the salivary glands, causing patients’ necks to swell, or even mastitis, inflammation of the breast tissue. Once you’re exposed to the virus, it can take an average of 16 to 18 days for symptoms to set in, although some infections can cause very mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.It is passed along through saliva and mucus, so kissing or sharing eating and drinking utensils with infected people puts you at risk. Simply living in close quarters with infected people could also put you in harm’s way, which explains why many of the most recent outbreaks in the U.S. have taken place at universities. In response, some of these universities held large-scale vaccination campaigns to give students a third shot of the vaccine. In 2014, there were also mumps outbreaks among several National Hockey League teams. In one recent outbreak that spanned from 2015 to 2016, people at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign started getting mumps despite the fact that most of them had received two recommended mumps vaccines. In response, the university health center recommended that all students and staff born in 1957 and afterward receive a third MMR vaccine, and about 11,500 complied. In total, 317 became infected with the mumps at that campus, even though 73 percent of them had received the usual two doses. In fact, another 45 of those who got the mumps had gotten three vaccines, with the third shot being administered during the outbreak, although experts suspect that they had gotten infected before the vaccine had a chance to kick in. Lest you think this is evidence that the MMR vaccine isn’t worth the hassle, consider this: Before the mumps vaccine was introduced in 1967, the virus used to be considered a universal disease of childhood, according to the CDC. Most children got the virus by the time they were 14 years old. Outbreaks were also common in the military, especially at the most inconvenient of times — such as mobilization.But once the vaccine became a national recommendation, the disease rates plunged. In 1968, one year after the shot was introduced, there were 152,209 reported cases. By the early 2000s, those reported cases had dropped 99 percent to an average of less than 270 annually. And The Washington Post noted in its report this week that even though recent outbreaks spread among a population that was mostly vaccinated against mumps, the vaccine appeared to mitigate the severity of the disease. In Arkansas, where about 2,800 people have gotten mumps since 2016, only 17 people experienced inflammation of the testicles. Without vaccines, that number could have been as high as 700 or 800.

The approval process is supposed to take 60 days, but Human Rights Watch heard nothing back until Monday.The group received a letter from Israel’s Interior Ministry denying the work permit “on the grounds that we were not a real human rights organization,” said Shakir, a California native of Iraqi descent with a master’s degree from Georgetown and a law degree from Stanford.The Interior Ministry cited guidance from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a letter explaining its decision not to grant Human Rights Watch’s request. “The opinion received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that, for some time now, this organization’s public activities and reports have engaged in politics in the service of Palestinian propaganda, while falsely raising the banner of ‘human rights,’ and therefore recommended denying the application,” the letter stated.The Israeli government did not respond to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment.Human Rights Watch has operated in Israel for three decades, Shakir said. The last director of the Israel and Palestine program was an Israeli national and did not need a work permit. However, previous regional directors needed and received work permits from the Israeli government, he added.On the Israel/Palestine page on its website, Human Rights Watch criticizes Israel for “severe and discriminatory restrictions on Palestinians’ human rights” and for building “unlawful settlements” in the occupied West Bank. But it also criticizes the Palestinian Authority for arresting dissenting students and activists and Hamas security forces in Gaza for using torture.“This decision and the spurious rationale should worry anyone concerned about Israel’s commitment to basic democratic values,” Iain Levine, who oversees Human Rights Watch’s research and reporting, said in a statement. “It is disappointing that the Israeli government seems unable or unwilling to distinguish between justified criticisms of its actions and hostile political propaganda.”Human Rights Watch pointed to a law Israel passed last July that increased reporting requirements for organizations that support Palestinian groups and receive foreign funds, but not for those that support the expansion of Jewish settlements.Human Rights Watch got a vote of support on Thursday from the U.S. State Department, whose acting spokesman, Mark Toner, said it strongly disagreed with Israel’s description of the group.“HRW is a credible human rights organization and even though we do not agree with all of their assertions or conclusions, given the seriousness of their efforts, we support the importance of the work they do,” Toner said. “We reference HRW reports in our own reporting, including our annual human rights reports.”Human Rights Watch was founded in 1978 to monitor compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which included guarantees of human rights. The nonprofit now operates in some 90 nations to report on human rights conditions. In 1997, a group it co-founded, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, won the Nobel Peace Prize.Israel joins Egypt, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea on the list of nations that refuse entry to Human Rights Watch to monitor human rights conditions."

We’re here to answer your most pressing, puzzling, even politically incorrect questions, about all things related to the Chinese in Africa and Africans in China.Depending on who you speak with, China’s engagement in Africa is often described in extreme terms as either the best thing to happen to the continent in the post-colonial era or just the latest foreign predator coming to pillage Africa of its resources.

ICE says they are keeping her under observation and that she has 24-hour care available.Beltran-Hernandez faced gang violence and domestic violence in El Salvador, according to Amnesty International. She left her homeland for the U.S., where she has family. Since November 2015, however, ICE has held her in detention despite her claim to asylum.Per U.S. and international law, people like Beltran-Hernandez who fear for their safety in their home country can seek asylum while their claims are reviewed. Amnesty International is demanding that Beltran-Hernandez be released while that request is under review, especially in light of her poor health.“Sara should never have been detained this long to begin with, let alone locked up while suffering a serious medical emergency,” Eric Ferrero, a spokesman for Amnesty International USA, said in a press release. “She must get the medical care she needs immediately, and be allowed to recover with her family while her asylum claim is reviewed.”Earlier this month, Beltran-Hernandez collapsed while in detainment. She was brought to the hospital and spent days there, unable to contact her legal team or her family. Melissa Zuniga, a paralegal on the case, said in a statement that ICE had Beltran-Hernandez “tied up from hands and ankles.”Beltran-Hernandez’s stepfather and mother reside in New York, and her two children are in El Salvador. Her legal team is working on getting her family to her.Raquel Beltran-Hernandez, Sara’s sister, offered more details about Sara’s condition in a statement.“She told me that, from time to time, she feels numbness in her feet and part of her face,” Raquel said. “She told me that nothing has been [medically] checked at all, and that she is only being provided with a pill which is not helping in any way, since it is not for the frequent and strong headache she is experiencing.”Raquel is now in Texas with Zuniga, who was recently hospitalized herself under heart attack risk. Zuniga said she is trying to find an attorney in Dallas so they can be ready if Sara gets released.“We need an aggressive, intelligent, professional immigration attorney,” Zuniga told The Huffington Post from the hospital Friday. “They blocked my access to Sara [on Thursday]. I’m a paralegal, so I could not do much. We don’t have someone with us right now ready to accompany Raquel to jail, and we need that.”Zuniga said that “Sara is dying” and “has been denied treatment for the last 14 days.”New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office has reached out to Beltran-Hernandez’s law firm to offer support, according to the New York Daily News.“This appears at this stage to be a dangerous and inhumane overreach by ICE,” Rosemary Boeglin, a spokeswoman for de Blasio, told the paper. “It’s this type of haphazard, callous enforcement that undermines American values and any common sense of decency.”In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security this week, Amnesty International argued that immigration officials should use detention only as a last resort. The group also said that people with medical emergencies, like Beltran-Hernandez, should be released immediately, as they pose no flight risk.“In the face of President [Donald] Trump’s aggressive immigration orders, we will fight to ensure that people with asylum claims are given a fair hearing and humane treatment,” Ferrero said. “People like Sara who are seeking asylum for horrific violence should not be treated like criminals while their cases are processed. We must do everything we can to ensure protection for people who are fleeing violence.”This is a developing story and will be updated."

They’re rejecting the idea of being governed by a bunch of unelected old men in Brussels.”Farage helped lead the political movement behind Brexit, a position of isolationism that has caused debated economic effects in Britain and across Europe. The British pound immediately fell when British voters sided with Farage’s “leave” campaign in June. The currency recently dropped to a three-year low compared to the Euro and a three-decade low against the dollar.Still, Brexit’s supporters have been emboldened recently, in part by Trump’s “America First” rhetoric and similar nationalist movements in Europe that advocate for tighter borders and policies that critics denounce as nativist and xenophobic.While Farage said countries should put their own interests first, he also advocated for good relations between countries that share a common language.“Our real friends in the world speak English, have common law and stand by us in times of crisis,” he said.Farage added that 2016 was the year democracies “made a comeback against the globalists of those who wish to destroy everything that we have ever been.”He poured on the praise for Trump, saying that just as Brexit becomes more popular in Britain, Trump will become more popular in America.“What I’m seeing 36 days into a Trump presidency, I’m seeing something quite remarkable,” Farage said. “I’m seeing an elected leader who is trying to put in place the platform on which he was elected.”Every time he’s come to America since Trump’s election, Farage said, he feels a bit more American.“What happened in 2016 is not the end of this great global revolution, what happened in 2016 is the beginning of a great global revolution,” he said.Farage added that these new political actors were governing for their countries and their people.“And we are winning,” he said."

This year, several Democrats are aiming their guest list at Trump’s efforts to ramp up deportations, block refugees and stop travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. Democratic Party leaders are also giving a major platform to a young undocumented woman, Dreamer Astrid Silva, who will deliver the party’s Spanish-language response to the president’s speech. Reps. Raúl Grijalva and Ruben Gallego, both Arizona Democrats, have invited the U.S.-citizen daughters of Guadalupe “Lupita” García de Rayos to attend Trump’s address. Their mother was deported from her home in Phoenix earlier this month.“[W]e believe it is important for Donald Trump to face the people who have been victimized by his disastrous policies,” Gallego said in a statement on Friday. “As a result of Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, Phoenix lost a long-time member of the community and two young Americans lost their mother.”Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) seeks to bring attention to arrests of immigrants in his state by inviting Rev. Keary Kincannon, the pastor of Rising Hope Mission Church in Fairfax County, Virginia. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently grabbed people outside a hypothermia shelter at the church. “My hope is that this will send a message to President Trump: these actions diminish the immigrant community’s trust and cooperation with law enforcement, and they hurt Virginia’s families, neighborhoods, and communities,” Warner wrote in a Facebook post. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Ct.) will bring Marwan Sulaiman, who came to the U.S. from Iraq as a teenager on a student visa in 2007. In January, Trump attempted to bar all travelers from Iraq and six other countries from the U.S. for at least 90 days in an executive order that has since stalled in the courts. The president has said he plans to issue a new executive order next week with the same goal of barring a large swath of people from entering the country.“If President Trump’s proposed policies on immigration and refugees were in place at the time, however, this bright young man would have been denied access to our country and had a very different future,” Himes said in a statement. “We must stop villainizing innocent people fleeing turmoil and terror in their homelands and seeking safety within our borders.”The president’s travel ban disproportionately targeted Muslims, although he and White House officials have said it was not a “Muslim ban.” During the campaign, Trump proposed to bar all Muslims from entering the country, and as president, he said he would be willing to make exceptions for Syrian Christians while continuing to bar Syrian Muslims.Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) has invited Samia Abdul-Qadir, a high school student who is Muslim, to hear Trump’s congressional address in person. Earlier this month, she spoke at an event Foster held on the travel ban, telling the crowd that a fellow fencing-team member had said she “looked like a terrorist” in her hijab.Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) said she is bringing a legal permanent resident who was detained at Los Angeles International Airport during the initial phase of the travel ban. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) is also focusing on the travel ban by bringing Chicago-based immigration attorney Fidaa Rashid, who is the daughter of refugees and works mostly with Middle Eastern clients.“If he looks up during the speech, I want Trump to see the face of a woman, the face of a Muslim, and the face of someone whose family has enriched and contributed to this country despite starting out as refugees,” Gutiérrez said in a statement. “Trump needs to know that real people are hurt by his policies and Ms. Rashid can make that point in so many ways.”The story has been updated with Rep. Torres’ invited guest."

We believe that such marriages are an important step towards formation of an inclusive society where people have equal rights,” Klampfer said.A number of other European Union states have legally recognized same-sex marriages, including Britain, France and Spain, but the issue remains contentious in many other EU countries.The law was passed ten months ago after a December 2015 referendum rejected a draft which would also have given gay couples the right to adopt children.“This is a big step forward,” Lana Gobec, spokeswoman for the Legebitra LGBT rights campaigning group, said. “But we will continue to strive for complete equality of heterosexual and same-sex couples.”Officials in Ljubjana said no same-sex couple had registered to marry in the capital so far.Gay activists say more remains to be done in Slovenia. Apart from being denied the right to adopt children, they are also excluded from artificial insemination.“We are still far from our goal... If you truly recognize human rights you recognize them in full. The new law solves some problems but does not solve the basic problem that all people in our country should have the same rights,” gay partners Jure Poglajen and David Zorko said in a statement.Homosexual couples in Slovenia, a European Union member with a 2 million population, have been able to register their relationship since 2006 and are also allowed to adopt children from a partner’s previous relationship - though not the children of others."

21,POLITICS,Parents Shift From Fear To Defiance As Bomb Threats Target Jewish Centers,Andy Campbell and Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parents-bomb-threats-jewish-community-centers_us_58b04cb2e4b060480e071a18,"Kids learn to read, swim, draw and do cartwheels at these facilities.",2017-02-24,People of ages take classes at their local Jewish Community Center.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b06b4b280000db9899affc.jpeg?cache=yuUudPgw5L&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kara Nelson has been going to the New Orleans Jewish Community Center for more than 20 years. She likes that they have karate and ballet courses. Sometimes she takes art classes. Her children, 5 and 7, have attended camp there. Nelson and her kids aren’t Jewish.“It’s the best place,” Nelson told The Huffington Post. “It’s like a second home to me since I’ve been in New Orleans. People are super friendly and I like that my kids are learning about Jewish traditions.”On Thursday morning, Nelson was taking her exercise class at the JCC when an evacuation was announced on the overhead speakers. Someone had called in a bomb threat to the community center, which also acts as a nursery and preschool.“The kids were all out first and taken to the high school across the street,” Nelson said. “That seemed to be the first priority, to hustle them out and away from everybody.”Within minutes, New Orleans police arrived and swept the building. Unwilling to let the threats destroy their day, Nelson’s classmates continued their exercise outside. Police eventually gave the all-clear.The last two months haven’t been easy for parents who have children attending classes at Jewish Community Centers. At least 69 bomb threats have been called into 55 JCCs across the country since Jan. 9, sometimes forcing kids and adults to evacuate and wait for police officers to sweep buildings. Fear has mixed with aggravation as authorities have deemed the bomb threats to be hoaxes so far. Gordon JCC in Nashville, Tennessee, has received three threatening calls, the most targeting any one location. “We have no idea why we were singled out,” Leslie Sax, executive director of the center, told HuffPost. “It’s such a disruption. We’ve had to spend too much time on security protocol recently rather than what we do here every day.”She said parents haven’t pulled their kids from her center’s programming in light of the threats, but suggested that other JCCs haven’t been so lucky.“I think they’re more sad and frustrated that it’s going on,” Sax said. “The important thing to note is that the kids have not been traumatized by this. I credit the staff for that. The time we did evacuate, the kids thought they were on a field trip ― they were having fun.”Some officials at the JCC Association of North America have found comfort in the fact that FBI is looking into the series of bomb threats, although the agency doesn’t comment on active investigations. Members of Congress have called on the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to aid local investigators.But parental nerves are still strung tight.On Thursday, a suspicious package was reported at the Newton JCC in Massachusetts, a center that had already been the victim of an earlier bomb threat. Authorities deemed it a false alarm, and no threat was called in this time. But it was enough to shake up Sean Roche, a father and one of the people evacuated (his kids weren’t there at the time). Initially, he’d called the incident “terrorism” on Twitter.“This is a direct consequence of threats that JCCs all over the country have received,” Roche told HuffPost. “There’s a heightened awareness and sensitivity.” Although there have been no bombs yet, every threat is taken seriously by local authorities and the JCC Association. The calls themselves can be terrifying and have often involved a disguised voice that sounds robotic.The Jewish Telegraphic Agency obtained audio from one call made to an unidentified JCC. The voice said, “In a short time, a large number of Jews are going to be slaughtered. Their heads are going to be blown off from the shrapnel.”Anti-Semitic hate crimes make up the largest portion of religiously motivated attacks in the United States. Bomb threats are all too easy for the perpetrators and harmful to communities all over the country.“We want the threats to stop so we can continue working for our community,” Sax said. “We hope to find someone responsible. We realize that with today’s technology it could be difficult to find them, but we can’t have this hanging over our heads.”"

Two other people ― including Kuchibhotla’s co-worker at technology company Garmin, Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, a 24-year-old bystander ― were injured in the shooting.An Olathe man, Adam Purinton, 51, has been charged in the shooting. He reportedly fled the scene and later told an employee at a bar in Clinton, Missouri, that he had killed two Middle Eastern men, according to the Kansas City Star.Kavipriya Muthuramalingam, a friend of Kuchibhotla’s, set up the GoFundMe campaign Thursday to raise money for his family.“Srinu was a kindhearted, gentle, very compassionate human being. He was a brilliant, budding engineer who had a bright future ahead of him,” Muthuramalingam told The Huffington Post. “Everywhere Srinu went, he only left a positive impression with his gentle and decent behavior. We are heartbroken, and things will never be the same. His wife and family are facing incredible grief.”The campaign exceeded its fundraising goal of $150,000 in a matter of hours. The funds will go toward helping Kuchibhotla’s family pay for funeral costs and other recovery expenses, according to the GoFundMe page.“This includes the very expensive process of carrying his mortal remains back to India, so his parents can say goodbye one last time to their beloved son,” the page says.Crowd-funding pages were also set up Thursday to help cover medical expenses for Madasani and Grillot. Police arrested Purinton early Thursday morning at an Applebee’s about 80 miles from the Olathe bar. He was charged with premeditated murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to local officials. An FBI representative said the agency was investigating whether the shooting violated federal laws that might designate it as a hate crime, the New York Daily News reported."

It doesn’t matter if a child came from your womb or if you found that person at age 2, 10 or 20. If the love is real, the caring is pure and it comes from a good space, it works.”Winfrey, who lost a child just weeks after birth when she was 14, has opened up previously about forgoing parenthood. “If I had kids, my kids would hate me,” she said in a 2013 interview. “They would have ended up on the equivalent of the Oprah show talking about me; because something [in my life] would have had to suffer and it would’ve probably been them.”H/T People"

Mesnard (R) announced Monday that the chamber will not hear a bill that would permit the government to seize protesters’ assets and prosecute them under a racketeering law designed to target organized crime.Mesnard told The Arizona Republic he reached his decision after hundreds of constituents called his office to express their concerns.“At the end of the day, I think the people need to know we are not about limiting people’s rights,” he said. “The sponsor is not about it, the governor is not about it, the government is not about that. The most efficient, expedient way to communicate that is to kill the bill.”Previously:The Republican-led Arizona state Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that would permit the government to seize protesters’ assets and prosecute them under a racketeering law designed to target organized crime.Senate Bill 1142 seeks to limit political demonstrations by expanding the definition of a “riot” to include actions that damage property, and making rioting an offense that can be prosecuted under racketeering statutes. If the measure passes in the GOP-controlled state House and is signed into law, protesting in Arizona would be on par with terrorism.Republican lawmakers say the legislation is intended to limit the influence of paid protesters, a popular conservative conspiracy-theory scapegoat for grassroots demonstrations that have been intensifying since the election of President Donald Trump. There’s no evidence of any paid protest movement.The legislation is written in a way that would allow protesters to be charged ― even if they don’t do anything. As the Arizona Capitol Times reports, racketeering laws permit police to arrest people for planning to commit a crime ― before anything has actually happened. Even those who don’t participate in a demonstration could be charged. The bill’s fact sheet explains that “an overt act is not required” to prove conspiracy. The state could seize assets for restitution. As the Phoenix New Times observed: “Plan a protest, lose your house.”“The purported purpose for this bill isn’t based in reality,” Steve Kilar, the communications director for the Arizona ACLU, told HuffPost in an email. “The bill’s supporters are using the false ‘paid protestors’ argument to connect this bill to what is commonly the purpose of anti-racketeering laws: targeting the financial incentives of criminal enterprises.“But if this bill were to pass, ‘riot’ would join ‘terrorism’ as the only racketeering crimes in Arizona that would not require a financial incentive,” Kilar said.The bill’s implications for free speech apparently are of little concern to state Sen. Sonny Borrelli, the primary sponsor.Borrelli said in comments published by the Phoenix New Times that the First Amendment is “not absolute,” and that his bill would protect “the civil liabilities of the citizens.”It’s true that there are limits on free speech ― yelling fire in a theater, for example. Still, the ACLU isn’t sold on Borrelli’s argument.“There’s no doubt this proposal would chill the public’s right to free speech and assembly because it could allow police and prosecutors to go after the organizers of peaceful protests if a handful of participants engage in unlawful acts,” Kilar said. “Furthermore, the conduct this bill allegedly addresses is prohibited by existing law and there’s no evidence that additional deterrence is necessary to prevent rioting or the incitement of riot.”The bill passed the state Senate on a party-line vote, with all 17 Republicans voting in favor, and all 13 Democrats opposed.

25,BLACK VOICES,Four Black Trailblazers On How They Are Empowering Communities Of Color,Lilly Workneh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/four-black-trailblazers-on-how-they-are-empowering-communities-of-color_us_58b03dcfe4b060480e06ffd6,"These influencers work across the areas of business, media, tech and activism.",2017-02-24,Jonathan Jackson shares his insight on how Blavity has achieved success since their launch. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b08dce2900002200f288ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every individual has the power to create change and in honor of Black History Month. BAOLers, a new employee resource group for black employees at AOL, hosted an event in New York Wednesday to recognize four black trailblazers who have made this their full-time mission. The event, which was held at the AOL/The Huffington Post office in New York City, was titled “Black Trailblazers on Building Power, Legacy and Community.” (AOL is the parent company for HuffPost.) It included a discussion led by HuffPost’s new editor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen, former Global Director at The New York Times, and highlighted four individuals who work across the areas of business, media, activism and tech who discussed how they are empowering communities of color through their work. The panelists were: Tani Brown, head of partnerships at Jopwell, a company that connects the best and brightest minority candidates with top employment opportunities; Jonathan Jackson, co-founder and head of corporate brand at Blavity, a successful digital platform that caters to black millennials; Janel Martinez, co-founder of 2020Shift, a career development and skills-based learning startup focused on diversifying tech; and Ifeoma Ike, a strategist and co-founder of Black and Brown People Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement project that prioritizes underrepresented voices in the current political climate.Each panelist spoke about how their respective platforms are amplifying the black experience and helping people of color land opportunities in areas where they have been largely overlooked. The event was also livestreamed on HuffPost Black Voices’ Facebook page.Brown said one way Jopwell is by sustaining the important mission the founders of the business had when they launched it in the summer of 2014. The company was launched by two black men, Porter Braswell and Ryan Williams, who wanted to empower underrepresented ethnic minority professionals and students to successfully navigate their careers.”We serve over 50,000 members in our community,” said Brown, who oversees Jopwell’s exclusive partner relationships with over 50 leading companies. “My job is to run the client services team and to make sure that we are doing right by our partner companies and understanding their recruiting process so we can help them diversity their talent pools.”Jackson’s responsibility at Blavity is slightly different but just as important. As one of the co-founders of the brand, Jackson said he understands the need to provide a digital platform that caters specifically to black millennials and builds a strong sense of community. Since the site’s launch in 2015, Blavity, which publishes content that covers a wide-range of topics, has seen tremendous success in the digital space.  “You can create the environment that you want and actually tell the stories that matter to you,” Jackson said, adding that it feels meaningful to him to “own a platform where you have the freedom and authority to manage the platform in ways [you] think best without having to answer to or be handcuffed by anyone.”  Martinez shares this same sense of freedom in her role at 2020Shift. As one of the co-founders, Martinez works to help diversify the tech industry by providing people of color with the lessons and skills they need to thrive. Martinez, who is afro-latina, has always been committed to the tech space. She wants to broaden people’s knowledge of how vast the industry is and help people of color land and keep positions within it. “We focus primarily on teaching our demographic the skills needed [so that] once they get in the door, they can actually do the work,” she said.As for Ike, her main focus as a strategist and activist is centered around uplifting the black community by getting them better engaged with the political process both through and beyond voting. This is why she helped to launch Black and Brown People Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement project that prioritizes underrepresented voices in the current political climate. Ike is also a founding #SheWoke Committee member, Lehman College professor and co-laborer of two Congressional Caucuses: My Brother’s Keeper Caucus and the Congressional Caucus on Black Women and Girls. Ike, who has worked relentlessly to educate, empower and uplift black communities, says advocacy work like this is so important, especially now in the age of Donald Trump as President. However, she says she’s looking forward to what lies ahead because she has witnessed new levels of activism and intersectionality and encourages Americans to keep it up. “I’m really excited,”she said, “because I’m seeing the most creative forms of activism and collaboration and conversations between the intersection of so many different communities than we’ve ever seen before.”"
26,COMEDY,Ellen DeGeneres Zings Trump's Mar-A-Lago Security Bungle In Killer Spoof Ad,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/degeneres-mar-a-lago-ad_us_58af7a8ee4b060480e065ccd,"Enjoy “breathtaking views of classified government documents,” quips the TV spot.",2017-02-24,"Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at a dining room of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on Feb. 10.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af7f1e290000f616f28644.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sun-kissed sands, fine wines — and access to Donald Trump with a peek at classified documents. That’s what scads of money can buy Mar-a-Lago’s well-heeled guests, according to a slick spoof ad with a sarcastic twist on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”Along with “luxurious poolside massages,” the mock TV commercial touts “breathtaking views of classified government documents” at Trump’s Palm Beach 20-acre golf resort, which the president repeatedly refers to as the “Winter White House.”Then, “put on your best dinner attire,” a sultry-voiced woman urges in the ad. “And join our waitstaff in the dining room, where you’ll experience our world-renowned cuisine just a table away from a confidential national security meeting.” The ad flashes a photo of Trump dining with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in full view of resort guests earlier this month.DeGeneres’ ad, which also has the nation’s nuclear codes offered alongside imported chocolates on a guest’s pillows, aired Wednesday.It’s a lighter take on a situation that triggered national security concerns. During the visit by Abe, photos of Trump and his guests were snapped by curious club members on their cell phones. Documents were lying on the table in full view and easily photographed. The White House has insisted the two were not talking about classified information on the open-air terrace surrounded by club members and guests. But Trump, Abe and his aides did discuss a response to North Korea’s missile test Feb. 11 as they reviewed papers, and they held a news conference on the missile launch shortly afterward.Security protocol requires that any issues relating to sensitive intelligence be discussed only in rooms designated as “secure compartmentalized information facilities” (SCIFs).“HOLY MOLY !!! It was fascinating to watch the flurry of activity at dinner when the news came that North Korea had launched a missile in the direction of Japan,” Mar-a-Lago club member Richard DeAgazio wrote later on Facebook with photos of the scene.The man apparently toting the “nuclear football” bag holding codes to launch a nuclear attack also posed for a photo with DeAgazio. (All of the posts have since been removed, and DeAgazio’s entire Facebook page has been deleted.)After the photos appeared on social media, President Barack Obama’s former speechwriter Jon Favreau posted contrasting photos of how the two presidents dealt with security matters, showing Obama and his staff in a secure location, and Trump smiling blithely at a dinner table surrounded by milling aides.Democrats have insisted on a full rundown of security procedures at Mar-a-Lago, including details on all members and guests who have access to the president, who can overhear conversations during a potential crisis and who may even have access to classified information.“If it is just a high price of admission and anybody can come in, it’s important for us to know who those people are,” Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) told The Huffington Post. “They have unusual proximity to our president and apparently under this president are going to have close proximity to high security information and potentially classified information.”The membership fee to join Mar-a-Lago is $200,000, which was doubled from $100,000 after Trump was elected president. Trump still owns the resort.House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and ranking member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) also sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus asking for details on security at Mar-a-Lago and the vetting of members, guests and workers.“There’s no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like dinner theater,” tweeted House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) scoffed, “You can’t make this stuff up.”It was all fodder for DeGeneres’ spoof Mar-a-Lago ad. Her version of a commercial for Trump’s resort ends: “Mar-a-Lago, where luxury meets top-secret government information.”"
27,POLITICS,"Ex-Goldman Trump Adviser Can Deregulate Banks Because That Doesn't Directly Involve Goldman, White House Says",Ben Walsh,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gary-cohn-goldman-deregulation_us_58b07b02e4b060480e0793b6,That's a novel argument.,2017-02-24,"From left to right, Gary Cohn, President Donald Trump and Jared Kushner sit in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, Jan. 23, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b07e95290000f616f288b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump’s administration says its ethics rules require Gary Cohn, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, to recuse himself from changing derivatives rules he lobbied on while working at Goldman Sachs. But Cohn can work on gutting financial regulation in other ways, because slashing bank rules doesn’t directly involve Goldman Sachs, a White House spokesperson told The Huffington Post.“Throughout his entire tenure in the Trump Administration, Gary has been recused from taking action in matters in which Goldman Sachs is a direct party,” the spokesperson said in an email.Goldman stock is up 38 percent since the election, hitting record highs as investors bet that the Trump administration will slash both corporate taxes and bank regulations put in place since the 2008 financial crisis.The White House first said Cohn would recuse himself from Goldman matters when the Financial Times’ Barney Jopson and Ben McLannahan reported on Thursday that Cohn met with officials at the Commodities Future Trading Commission in 2015 and 2016 ― when he worked at Goldman Sachs ― to lobby the regulator about derivatives rules. Those rules are part of the 2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Frank. Cohn, who now holds a key position in the Trump administration, is leading the White House’s efforts to roll back critical portions of Dodd-Frank.The White House spokesperson did not respond to a HuffPost question about what other matters Cohn has recused himself from, besides the CFTC derivatives rules.Cohn worked at Goldman Sachs for 26 years. He was the company’s second most senior executive since 2010, and was its president and chief operating officer for a decade. As director of the National Economic Council, Cohn is the second most important financial policy adviser after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin is also a former Goldman Sachs executive, who, like his father before him, became a partner at the bank. Mnuchin left the company in 2002 and went on to found a hedge fund and run OneWest Bank, which foreclosed on tens of thousands of homeowners during the housing crisis. Cohn is driving Trump’s attempt to undo bank regulation and is leading efforts to craft a corporate tax cut. He was also at Trump’s side earlier this month as the president signed an executive order telling agencies to review Dodd-Frank. While the order was largely symbolic, its meaning was clear: Wall Street is now operating with a presidential permission slip. Financial deregulation is one of Trump’s priorities, and his advisers will make it happen, either by rewriting rules or simply failing to enforce existing ones.Trump also signed an executive order that will likely nullify a rule ― one that had never actually been implemented ― requiring brokers to act in the best interests of retirement savers. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) sent letters on Feb. 9 to Cohn, Goldman Sachs and the Department of Labor, the agency that wrote the retirement rule, asking if the bank had any contact with Cohn regarding the executive orders. Goldman’s general counsel Greg Palm responded on Wednesday, telling the senators that “we had no involvement in the drafting of any executive orders, nor did we receive any advance notice of their issuance.” A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment.

28,BLACK VOICES,Sidney Poitier And Denzel Washington’s Longstanding Connection Is About More Than Oscars,Brennan Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sidney-poitier-denzel-washington-oscar-history_us_58b0a2eae4b060480e07f369,A tale of two history-makers.,2017-02-24,Washington is on the verge of becoming the first black actor to win three Academy Awards.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b0a741290000f616f289a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Denzel Washington has always admired the historic achievements of Sidney Poitier. This year Washington made some history of his own by becoming the only African-African actor to land seven Oscar nominations, and is on the verge of becoming the first black actor to win three Academy Awards.Washington has often referred to Poitier as a mentor, and said that the actor was instrumental to his own career trajectory.In a 2010 discussion with TimesTalks, Washington credited Poitier for advising him to be prudent about his selection of movie roles, specifically referencing a offer he got in 1986 to star in film he referred to as “The N****r They Couldn’t Kill.”“I called Sidney and told him ‘man they are offering me $600,000 to play the ‘N****r They Couldn’t Kill,’” Washington recalled. “And he told me, ‘I’m not going to tell you what to do. But I will tell you this, the first, two, three or four films you do in this business will dictate how you are perceived.’ He didn’t tell me what to do, I give him credit for that. So I turned it down and 6 months later I got ‘Cry Freedom’ and got an Oscar nomination.”With the help of Poitier’s sage advice, Washington has evolved into one of Hollywood’s most bankable actors.Poitier’s daughter, Beverly Poitier-Henderson, sees Washington’s long relationship with her father ― the two actors initially met in 1982 during Washington’s role in the off-Broadway production “A Soldier’s Play” ― as having a indirect impact on the increasing diversity and inclusion in Hollywood.“Denzel has climbed that hill and he’s very instrumental in helping others come after him, that my father was very keen of as well,” Beverly Poitier-Henderson told The Huffington Post. “He [Poitier] would be the only black person on the set sometimes. He would inquire as to why there weren’t any black people working the set, all of that kind of stuff. So he helped open up not just the field of acting, but the movie industry in general.”In 2002 the actors shared a monumental Oscar moment when Poitier won the Honorary Award, while Washington and Halle Berry took home the awards for Best Actor and Best Actress. The trio’s triumphant win marked the first time in Oscar history that three black actors dominated the ceremony’s top three categories. In a 2008 interview, Poitier reflected on the significance of Washington winning Best Actor 38 years after he had broke barriers in the same category. “It represented progress. It represented dimensionalizing of the film industry. It meant the embracing of a kind of democracy that had been very long in maturing,” Poitier said. “It was an example of the persistence and the effort, and determination of young people of color...It was a spectacle evening. I paid then, and I pay now a great respect to Denzel Washington. He has been a quintessential element in the finest of all American actors.Poitier continued: “[Washington] had taken the concept of African-Americans in films to a place where I couldn’t, I didn’t. And he has taken it there with the same kind of integrity that I tried to articulate. So I thank him for that.”"

Fracking uses a high-pressure stream of water, chemicals and sand to tap into rock formations and extract oil and gas deposits. Many of the spills in the researchers’ tally include fracking fluids, wastewater and hydrocarbons ― all of which can contain chemicals hazardous to drinking water resources.The findings were published this week in the scientific journal Environmental Science & Technology and have escalated concerns for many environmental activists who have long opposed fracking. “We’re alarmed, but we’re not surprised [by the number of spills],” said Seth Gladstone, deputy communications director for environmental advocacy group Food and Water Watch. “We’ve seen the evidence and we’ve heard the stories about countless leaks, explosions, fires, human health effects, and employee safety issues all related to fracking.”Fracking has been a contentious issue for environmental advocacy groups and fossil fuel corporations for nearly a decade. The Duke study found up to 16 percent of fracked oil and gas wells have spills each year. While research has linked fracking to earthquakes and contaminated drinking water in some parts of the country, fracking proponents say the procedure is safe. Nicole Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Energy in Depth, an industry-funded research group, said the thousands of spills identified in the study are not a major concern. “It is important to keep studies of this nature in context,” Jacobs told The Huffington Post in a statement. She pointed out that not all spills associated with the fracking process were of hazardous material. “There were freshwater spills included in the study, including the largest spill in the report, and ... a vast majority of spills are small and contained on site.”The biggest takeaway from the study may not be the number of spills, but the way in which they are recorded, said Lauren Patterson, lead author of the Duke study and a policy associate at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.Currently, spill reporting requirements vary from state to state. Patterson said the report underscores the need for states to adopt uniform data collection standards to help determine how best to reduce spills.For instance, North Dakota, an oil and gas production stronghold, reported the highest number of spills, with 4,453 incidents. Pennsylvania had the second highest rate at 1,293, followed by Colorado with 476 and New Mexico at 426.Patterson said the disparity can be attributed in part to the states’ differing laws on spill reporting requirements, since North Dakota requires reporting smaller spills than Colorado and New Mexico do. Differences in data collection pose a challenge to regulators seeking a fuller understanding of where and when spills occur nationally.A 2015 EPA report on fracking found just 457 spills across these states and four others between 2006 and 2012, though that report had only accounted for spills related to rock fracturing, not the full production cycle, which also includes transport and storage. Fifty percent of spills recorded in the Duke study were related to storage or pipeline leaks.Some states aren’t explicitly required to report the cause of a leak, posing a challenge to regulators seeking to mitigate spills. Duke researchers hope their new study will prompt state lawmakers to revamp the data collection system to help regulators better understand the environmental impacts of fracking.“Analyses like this one are so important, to define and mitigate risk to water supplies and human health,” Kate Konschnik, director of the Harvard Law School’s Environmental Policy Initiative, said in a press release. “Writing state reporting rules with these factors in mind is critical, to ensure that the right data are available ― and in an accessible format ― for industry, states and the research community.”While fracking accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. natural gas output today, the process didn’t become common industry practice until a few years ago. In 2010, there were nearly 26,000 fracking wells across the country. By 2015, the number of wells had skyrocketed to roughly 300,000. Well proliferation is credited with creating the recent oil and gas boom in the U.S. ― much to the dismay of environmental advocacy groups.Despite the fact that the majority of American people believe the U.S. should focus on developing renewable energy over fossil fuels, it appears the proliferation of fracking wells isn’t slowing down anytime soon. President Donald Trump said last August he supported state-level fracking bans, before reversing course the following month.“You will get that business,” Trump told fracking executives at the Shale Insight conference in September. “You are going to like Donald Trump.”Democratic lawmakers have accused several of Trump’s cabinet members, including former ExxonMobil CEO and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and new Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, of prioritizing fossil fuel industry interests over environmental protections.Gladstone said it’s critical to have “up-to-date access and reporting on industry activities” under the Trump administration.“With this new administration so deeply tied to the oil and gas industry,” said Gladstone, “it’s more important than ever at local and state levels to build power and hold our local and state officials accountable and making sure they are resisting the pro-polluter agenda.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Bush's Daughter Barbara To Headline Planned Parenthood Fundraiser,"Abby Livingston, The Texas Tribune",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barbara-bush-planned-parenthood_us_58b0b709e4b0a8a9b7827066,"She previously called Planned Parenthood an ""exceptional organization.""",2017-02-24,Barbara Pierce Bush spoke at the 2013 Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b0b78a2900002200beaccc.jpeg?cache=P2m066KsFk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story was originally published by The Texas Tribune.Barbara Pierce Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush, will headline a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in North Texas on Wednesday. She will be the keynote speaker at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas’ annual Fort Worth luncheon, helping to raise money for an organization that provides an array of reproductive and sexual health services, including abortions.Bush’s public appearance before the group is striking, given that her father, President George W. Bush, was a staunch abortion opponent during his time as Texas governor and as president. But it’s not entirely unexpected. Bush’s mother, former First Lady Laura Bush, has expressed support for the legality of abortion on a handful of occasions. The younger Bush, the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps, called Planned Parenthood an “exceptional organization” in a June New York Times interview, and attended a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Paris in October.The lead donor of the luncheon is Sid R. Bass, the prominent Fort Worth billionaire. Bush’s health organization is, according to its website, a nonprofit that “mobilizes a global community of young leaders to build the movement for health equity.” It partners with organizations overseas to place fellows in year-long tenures promoting world health. Several Planned Parenthood branches are among those organizations. There’s a strong Texas connection in all of this: The president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is Cecile Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards. Bush’s father ousted Richards from the Governor’s Mansion in 1994. Many political observers viewed that campaign as — at least in part — revenge for Richards’ acerbic 1988 Democratic National Convention keynote speech mocking the GOP nominee. It was Bush’s grandfather, George H.W. Bush. Read more:Texas health officials have delivered a final legal notice to nix the funding Planned Parenthood receives through the Medicaid program.

It’s the best way to knock them down quickly,” said federal police captain Amir Abdul Kareem, whose units are fighting near Ghozlani military base.After ousting the militant group from eastern Mosul last month, Iraqi forces have sought to capture the airport to use it as a launchpad for an onslaught into the west of the city.The campaign involves a 100,000-strong force of Iraqi troops, Kurdish fighters and Shi’ite militias and has made rapid advances since the start of the year, aided by new tactics and improved coordination.Losing Mosul could spell the end of the Iraqi side of militants’ self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria, which Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared from the city after sweeping through vast areas of Iraq in 2014.U.S. special forces in armored vehicles on Thursday positioned near Mosul airport looked on as Iraqi troops advanced and a helicopter strafed suspected Islamic State positions.Counter-terrorism service (CTS) troops fought their way inside the nearby Ghozlani base, which includes barracks and training grounds close to the Baghdad-Mosul highway, a CTS spokesman told Reuters.The airport and the base, captured by Islamic State fighters when they overran Mosul in June 2014, have been heavily damaged by U.S.-led air strikes intended to wear down the militants ahead of the offensive, a senior Iraqi official said.The U.S. military commander in Iraq has said he believes U.S.-backed forces will retake both of Islamic State’s urban bastions - the other is the Syrian city of Raqqa - within the next six months, which would end the jihadists’ ambitions to rule and govern significant territory.Iraqi commanders expect the battle to be more difficult than in the east of Mosul, however, in part because tanks and armored vehicles cannot pass through narrow alleyways that crisscross the city’s ancient western districts.Militants have developed a network of passageways and tunnels to enable them to hide and fight among civilians, melt away after hit-and-run operations and track government troop movements, according to inhabitants."

Pictured from left to right in the front row are Yogitha Sunkara, Bryn Allesina-Mcgrory, Anne Lee and Fred Qin, and in the second row are Thomas Dulski (left) and Isaac Perrin.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58add6ab280000db9899a8f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two days after President Donald Trump’s stunning election victory in November, about 80 high school students crammed into the classroom of a suburban Seattle science teacher for an emergency meeting. The students from Tesla STEM High School were worried that Trump, an occasional climate change denier, would follow through on his campaign promise to abandon the 2015 Paris Agreement on reducing global carbon emissions, and cause irreversible harm to the environment. Rather than wait for the newly elected president to show a commitment to fight warming global temperatures and rising sea levels, the students opted for a more grassroots approach.The teens would hold their school to the same tough standards on greenhouse gas emissions that the accord had set for the U.S., even if Trump wanted to walk away from the agreement. With any luck, they figured, other schools and institutions would notice and follow their lead. Today, between 80 to 100 of the around 600 students attending the Tesla STEM High School in Redmond, Washington, have joined a project to enforce the agreement. They’ve called their group “Schools Under 2C,” a reference to the Paris deal’s stated goal of capping global warming at 2 degrees Celsius.“This is our future that’s being affected,” said the group’s president Anne Lee, a 16-year-old junior. “We wanted to show that kids care about climate change.”In December 2015, representatives of 196 countries gathered in Paris agreed to a landmark environmental agreement that would help reduce the effects of global warming by preventing the earth’s temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial levels. The countries agreed to reduce the use of fossil fuel and to set targets for greenhouse gas production for each country. The United States committed to cutting its emissions by 2025 to 26 percent to 28 percent below their 2005 level. But those goals appear to be at risk under a Trump administration, as the president campaigned to abandon the landmark treaty. He had also claimed that global warming was “an expensive hoax” perpetuated by China. Tesla STEM science and engineering teacher Mike Town had begun including the Paris agreement in his curriculum last year and knew that many teenagers felt passionately about its prospect for staving off worldwide disaster. Now, the hopes for the accord are in the hands of Trump, who had said he’d “cancel” the deal.“This is something they want to see and it gets taken away so fast,” Town said. “They were just devastated by the results of the election.” He organized the first student meeting about the Paris climate goals under Trump and what they would do.“The idea was that our students would do something that would be productive and get actual results,” said Town, who now serves as the group’s adviser.The students won faculty support with a Powerpoint presentation showing plans to reduce the school’s carbon emissions by targeting some of the largest sources of inefficiency and greenhouse gas emissions: food waste, lighting, transportation and heating.While drafting the program, the students began measuring energy usage and waste at the school. They learned there was lots of room for improvement by making simple behavioral changes. For example, about 75 percent of the school’s garbage could actually be recycled or composted, the students said. After three months of preparations, the green reforms took effect at the start of February. For the first time, the school has a composting program that reduces the quantity of trash hauled long distances to a landfill in Oregon. Electricity use is down as teachers have pledged to shut the lights when classrooms are not in use. Thanks to the composting and lighting conservation, the students estimated they could reduce their school’s emissions in those areas above their initial goal of 28 percent. That translates into 2 fewer tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere this month, according to their calculations. Plus, they say they’re saving the district money.“I’m really amazed at how this is going and how much we can do to help solve this issue,” said 17-year-old junior Fred Qin, who maintains the group’s data. University of California, Davis professor Kurt Kornbluth, who’s working to make the 35,000-student university campus carbon-neutral by 2025, applauded the Tesla STEM students for making an environmental impact, and, more importantly, for taking action themselves. “You get them the information and then they can do something about it,” Kornbluth said. To make an even bigger dent in the school’s carbon footprint will require coming up with more efficient heating and transportation options.And the Tesla STEM students are hoping to do just that. They are working with local transportation officials to develop an app to encourage carpooling, biking, walking and taking the bus to school. Rayan Krishnan, 15, who is involved in developing the app, said students may get incentives to participate from local shops. He hopes the app will foster competition among schools to have green transportation. “We’re going to be the ones who inherit this country,” Rayan said. “We can’t vote, but we can have an impact.”In some respects, the students’ initial fears over a Trump victory became realities. Soon after the election, Trump sought ways to withdraw from the Paris agreement. He’s since said he has “an open mind” about the climate agreement. Then, Trump picked former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency despite a record of opposition to environmental regulations and the agency. The Tesla STEM students’ actions fit in with the Pacific Northwest’s reputation as a hotbed for pioneering environmental causes. They’ve learned about former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, who in 2005 declared the Emerald City would meet the Kyoto Protocol goals even though then-President George Bush opposed the precursor to the Paris agreement.Town, had previously created an environmental challenge when he taught at neighboring Redmond High Schoo. The program, which won an EPA award and is now a program offered to 5,000 schools by the National Wildlife Federation.There’s also an ongoing lawsuit in the state filed by eight young people, 12-year-old to 16-year-olds, who allege that state officials have failed to protect them from pollution. Starting locally makes sense, according to Cooper Martin, program director of the National League of Cities’ Sustainable Cities Institute. He said that city and town officials are more responsive to environmental concerns than politicians in state and federal government.“It’s become an issue that local elected officials have to respond to like education and public safety,” Martin said, emphasizing that student activism pushes local environmental initiatives. The Tesla STEM students are doing what they can. The group developing the transportation app is hoping to launch before May, which is National Bike Month.

41,POLITICS,These Students Are Adopting The Climate Goals That Trump Dismisses,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/students-seattle-climate-change-goals-paris-trump_us_58ab5682e4b0f077b3ecfe80,"""We can't vote, but we can have an impact.""",2017-02-23,"Tesla STEM students have formed ""Schools Under 2C"" and pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by the targets set in the 2015 Paris climate accord.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58add6a3290000f616f2817e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two days after President Donald Trump’s stunning election victory in November, about 80 high school students crammed into the classroom of a suburban Seattle science teacher for an emergency meeting. The students from Tesla STEM High School were worried that Trump, an occasional climate change denier, would follow through on his campaign promise to abandon the 2015 Paris Agreement on reducing global carbon emissions, and cause irreversible harm to the environment. Rather than wait for the newly elected president to show a commitment to fight warming global temperatures and rising sea levels, the students opted for a more grassroots approach.The teens would hold their school to the same tough standards on greenhouse gas emissions that the accord had set for the U.S., even if Trump wanted to walk away from the agreement. With any luck, they figured, other schools and institutions would notice and follow their lead. Today, between 80 to 100 of the around 600 students attending the Tesla STEM High School in Redmond, Washington, have joined a project to enforce the agreement. They’ve called their group “Schools Under 2C,” a reference to the Paris deal’s stated goal of capping global warming at 2 degrees Celsius.“This is our future that’s being affected,” said the group’s president Anne Lee, a 16-year-old junior. “We wanted to show that kids care about climate change.”In December 2015, representatives of 196 countries gathered in Paris agreed to a landmark environmental agreement that would help reduce the effects of global warming by preventing the earth’s temperature from rising 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial levels. The countries agreed to reduce the use of fossil fuel and to set targets for greenhouse gas production for each country. The United States committed to cutting its emissions by 2025 to 26 percent to 28 percent below their 2005 level. But those goals appear to be at risk under a Trump administration, as the president campaigned to abandon the landmark treaty. He had also claimed that global warming was “an expensive hoax” perpetuated by China. Tesla STEM science and engineering teacher Mike Town had begun including the Paris agreement in his curriculum last year and knew that many teenagers felt passionately about its prospect for staving off worldwide disaster. Now, the hopes for the accord are in the hands of Trump, who had said he’d “cancel” the deal.“This is something they want to see and it gets taken away so fast,” Town said. “They were just devastated by the results of the election.” He organized the first student meeting about the Paris climate goals under Trump and what they would do.“The idea was that our students would do something that would be productive and get actual results,” said Town, who now serves as the group’s adviser.The students won faculty support with a Powerpoint presentation showing plans to reduce the school’s carbon emissions by targeting some of the largest sources of inefficiency and greenhouse gas emissions: food waste, lighting, transportation and heating.While drafting the program, the students began measuring energy usage and waste at the school. They learned there was lots of room for improvement by making simple behavioral changes. For example, about 75 percent of the school’s garbage could actually be recycled or composted, the students said. After three months of preparations, the green reforms took effect at the start of February. For the first time, the school has a composting program that reduces the quantity of trash hauled long distances to a landfill in Oregon. Electricity use is down as teachers have pledged to shut the lights when classrooms are not in use. Thanks to the composting and lighting conservation, the students estimated they could reduce their school’s emissions in those areas above their initial goal of 28 percent. That translates into 2 fewer tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere this month, according to their calculations. Plus, they say they’re saving the district money.“I’m really amazed at how this is going and how much we can do to help solve this issue,” said 17-year-old junior Fred Qin, who maintains the group’s data. University of California, Davis professor Kurt Kornbluth, who’s working to make the 35,000-student university campus carbon-neutral by 2025, applauded the Tesla STEM students for making an environmental impact, and, more importantly, for taking action themselves. “You get them the information and then they can do something about it,” Kornbluth said. To make an even bigger dent in the school’s carbon footprint will require coming up with more efficient heating and transportation options.And the Tesla STEM students are hoping to do just that. They are working with local transportation officials to develop an app to encourage carpooling, biking, walking and taking the bus to school. Rayan Krishnan, 15, who is involved in developing the app, said students may get incentives to participate from local shops. He hopes the app will foster competition among schools to have green transportation. “We’re going to be the ones who inherit this country,” Rayan said. “We can’t vote, but we can have an impact.”In some respects, the students’ initial fears over a Trump victory became realities. Soon after the election, Trump sought ways to withdraw from the Paris agreement. He’s since said he has “an open mind” about the climate agreement. Then, Trump picked former Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency despite a record of opposition to environmental regulations and the agency. The Tesla STEM students’ actions fit in with the Pacific Northwest’s reputation as a hotbed for pioneering environmental causes. They’ve learned about former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels, who in 2005 declared the Emerald City would meet the Kyoto Protocol goals even though then-President George Bush opposed the precursor to the Paris agreement.Town, had previously created an environmental challenge when he taught at neighboring Redmond High Schoo. The program, which won an EPA award and is now a program offered to 5,000 schools by the National Wildlife Federation.There’s also an ongoing lawsuit in the state filed by eight young people, 12-year-old to 16-year-olds, who allege that state officials have failed to protect them from pollution. Starting locally makes sense, according to Cooper Martin, program director of the National League of Cities’ Sustainable Cities Institute. He said that city and town officials are more responsive to environmental concerns than politicians in state and federal government.“It’s become an issue that local elected officials have to respond to like education and public safety,” Martin said, emphasizing that student activism pushes local environmental initiatives. The Tesla STEM students are doing what they can. The group developing the transportation app is hoping to launch before May, which is National Bike Month. Each day, student monitors check that teachers have switched off the lights before leaving their rooms. And after school, a team weighs what’s been tossed into the compost to tabulate the day’s carbon savings. “People think climate change is scary, but really you just need to make small changes,” Rayan said."

The Mexican leader scrapped a summit meeting with Trump in January as tensions rose.Both sides on Thursday pledged further dialog on migration, trade and security issues.Kelly and Tillerson were more measured in their words than either the Mexicans or Trump, who on Thursday said a military operation was being carried out to clear “bad dudes” such as gang members and drug lords from the United States.But Kelly said there would be “no use of military force in immigration operations,” and “no, repeat, no” mass deportations. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump’s comment was meant to describe the “flawless” manner that U.S. immigration and border authorities worked.‘A COMPLEX TIME’Looking stern as he stood beside the U.S. visitors, Videgaray said it is “a complex time” for U.S.-Mexican relations, which have gone downhill quickly since Trump’s election last November.Videgaray and Pena Nieto have been criticized at home for being too willing to engage with Trump, who has repeatedly cranked up tension with the country ahead of key meetings.Opposition politicians and a handful of protesters demanded that Pena Nieto should snub the visitors, and even Economy Minister Idelfonso Guajardo had said the meeting with the president on Thursday might not happen, depending on the tone of the talks in the morning.Mexico relies heavily on exports to its neighbor. But stakes are also high for the United States, not least because a breakdown in relations with Mexico could affect extensive cooperation on the fight against narcotics and on stemming the flow of Central American illegal immigrants that reach the U.S. border.The two countries need to strengthen intelligence sharing, as well as take more action to stem the flow of weapons and drug money from the United States and to shut down criminal organizations, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said.“Mexico needs the United States, and the United States also needs Mexico, our countries will always be neighbors so the best thing would be to have agreements that work for both equally,” Osorio Chong said.In a concession to Mexican concerns, both Kelly and Tillerson acknowledged the need to stop arms and drug proceeds moving south, and praised Mexico’s extensive programs to turn back Central American immigrants traveling north.“There is no mistaking that the rule of law matters along both sides of our border,” Tillerson said.None of the officials made direct references to the deportation of immigrants from third countries to Mexico, or to paying for the border wall planned by Trump, a red-flag issue for Mexico.(Additional reporting by Gabriel Stargardter, Christine Murray, Adriana Barrera and David Alire Garcia in Mexico and Ginger Gibson and David Shephardson in Washington; Writing by Frank Jack Daniel; Editing by Alistair Bell)"

The secretary, a retired general, said emphatically that the military forces would not carry out deportation efforts, which are a law enforcement priority. “There will be no ― repeat, no ― use of military forces in immigration operations. None,” Kelly said during a press conference after he and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with Mexican officials in Mexico City. “Yes, we’ll approach this operation systematically, in an organized way, in a results-oriented way, in an operational way, in a human dignity way,” Kelly continued. “This is the way great militaries do business. ... It is also the way great legal organizations ― police and federal police ― do business.” White House press secretary Sean Spicer also attempted to clean up Trump’s statement during a press briefing later Thursday, saying that the president was referring to the “precision” and “flawless manner” in which his executive orders on immigration were being carried out.“The president was using that as an adjective,” he said of Trump’s “military operation” comment. “It’s happening with precision and in a manner in which it’s being done very, very clearly. ... The president was clearly describing the manner in which this was being done.” Last week, White House officials said they were not considering mobilizing the National Guard to help enforce immigration law, which had been floated in a draft memo obtained by the Associated Press.Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as a DHS spokeswoman noted in an email on Thursday, is a “law enforcement agency and all operations are conducted by trained law enforcement officers and agents.” Kelly has been charged with carrying out and defending some of Trump’s most controversial policies, such as his plan to broaden the swath of people to be targeted for deportation and his executive order to suspend all refugee resettlement and ban some foreign nationals from the country. The latter order is currently blocked in the courts. Kelly said on Thursday that Trump’s policies were not “mass deportations.”“Let me be very, very clear: There will be no ― repeat, no ― mass deportations,” Kelly said at the press conference. “Everything we do in DHS will be done legally and according to human rights and the legal justice system of the United States. All deportations will be according to our legal justice system, which is extensive and includes multiple appeals. The focus of deportations will be on the criminal element.” Both Kelly and Tillerson emphasized the need to work together with Mexican officials, some of whom have balked at the president’s promise to force their government to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Rob Portman (R-Ohio) denied entry to Democrats at his event Wednesday in another instance of GOP lawmakers attempting to avoid protesters and contentious questions from constituents, attendees claim.Katie Finneran said she had planned to attend Portman’s speech at the Lincoln Day Dinner scheduled for Wednesday evening, but organizers informed her that morning that she would not be allowed to attend because she is a registered Democrat, according to the Columbus Dispatch. Several other attendees told the Toledo Blade that they were also barred and received refunds for their tickets.But Portman’s office denied the claims. “This story is false, neither Senator Portman nor his office controlled access to this event,” spokeswoman Emily Benavides said in an email. Justin Smith, chair of the Sandusky County GOP, which helped organize the dinner, told The Huffington Post that the private event “was purely a Republican fundraiser,” and organizers wanted to limit the potential for disruptions.“We wanted to show respect for the Senator,” Smith said. “We wanted a disruption-free event for Sen. Portman and the Republican faithful.”A local Republican official had earlier told the Dispatch that it was Portman’s office that decided to restrict access to the event. “It’s my personal opinion that these people should be allowed in,” said David Koehl, Seneca County Republican Party treasurer. “Portman and his office are afraid protesters will show up. They made this decision a week ago, but several people have been refunded on short notice.”Finneran, who said she identifies with the Green Party and voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in last year’s Democratic presidential primaries, told the paper that her entire table was also barred from attending, after being told it was a private event and then paying $30 for a ticket.She said she was initially told she couldn’t attend because it was a private event, and only later did organizers inform her it was because of her political affiliation.Before the dinner, Portman held a roundtable discussion on the opioid crisis, which Finneran said she was also blocked from attending.“Just because Republicans are in power does not mean Republican citizens have more of a voice than Democratic citizens or even independent citizens or Green Party citizens or Libertarian citizens,” she said. “He represents everybody, not just the Republican Party.”Across the country, GOP lawmakers have been curtailing or avoiding public town halls, amid protests and raucous crowds. Activists have mocked their absence and held their own town halls instead. In Ohio, the liberal group MoveOn.org created a petition demanding that Portman hold a public town hall. Members invited him to its own town hall, but they said he declined.About 100 protesters gathered outside Portman’s event on Wednesday, calling on him to hold President Donald Trump accountable. Some demonstrators chanted, “Hey, Portman, we’re here! Come outside and face your fear.”Portman said at the event that it was “perfectly appropriate for them to be there and express their views.”“I am listening,” he added.This article has been updated with comment from Smith and Portman’s office."

He was once a friend to Simmons, and a regular at the 68-year-old’s long-running exercise class in his Los Angeles studio Slimmons.Rumors swirled in 2016 that Simmons was being held hostage in his Hollywood home after two years had gone by without a peep from the typically extroverted celebrity. The news caused a stir, leading Simmons to assure fans that he was not in danger with a Facebook post on his personal page. The page is regularly updated in a cheery voice, encouraging followers to keep their spirits up and think healthy.Yet, listening to the podcast, we learn that everyone from decadeslong attendees of his class to close friends to fans across the country who leaned on him for support had long stopped hearing from Simmons. Taberski dutifully chronicles the many mysterious ways Simmons cut himself off from the public, even installing a security fence around the home where he once happily perched, waiting for vans of tourists looking for a famous face. The stories from the fans and friends paint a clear picture of the impact Simmons had long after his workout tapes became a VCR staple and the shockwaves his absence has left. Through these interviews, the podcast becomes a meditation on public figures, their obligation to their fans, and whether one can truly disappear.Who knows where Taberski’s investigation will lead — could an audio plea and renewed widespread interest in the star be the thing to lure him out once more? — but the journey is fascinating thus far.Subscribe to “Missing Richard Simmons” on iTunes."

Wonder was trained to help her balance, retrieve dropped items, open and close doors, turn on lights, take off her coat and other tasks.“I saw with my own eyes how Wonder helped my daughter grow more self-reliant and confident,” Stacy Fry, Ehlena’s mother, said in a statement. “We are thankful that the Supreme Court has clarified that schools cannot treat children with disabilities differently or stand in the way of their desired independence.”The justices sent the case back to a lower appeals court to determine whether Ehlena’s complaint involves the impermissible denial of a proper special education.The dispute arose in 2009 when Ehlena’s elementary school in Napoleon, Michigan refused to allow her to attend school with Wonder. The school said she already had a one-on-one human aide, as part of her individualized special education program.The family eventually moved to a different school district where Wonder was welcomed. They filed suit in 2012 in federal court, claiming discrimination under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which permits service dogs in public institutions.The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the family, said the ruling will remove unfair legal hurdles for victims of discrimination that prevent students from seeking justice guaranteed by the Americans with Disabilities Act.Napoleon Community Schools Superintendent Jim Graham said he had no comment.Ehlena and her parents sued the school district seeking money damages for emotional harm, claiming the school deprived Ehlena of her independence, including in intimate settings such as the bathroom.Wednesday’s ruling overturned a 2015 decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio upholding a dismissal of the lawsuit. The appeals court had said that under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a federal law governing special education, the family had to exhaust all of the administrative hearings in its service dog dispute with local and state officials before filing suit.Writing for the court on Wednesday, Justice Elena Kagan said that if the substance of a lawsuit does not claim the denial of a proper special education under IDEA, then exhausting the administrative remedies is not required."

Though residents living in the evacuation area have been allowed to return to their homes, they are still being told to remain vigilant in the event that another evacuation order is issued.The ongoing situation has served as the latest reminder of the need to invest in the repair of America’s infrastructure, particularly its water systems, but it appears that addressing this need has become a lower priority for President Donald Trump’s administration.On the campaign trail, Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure package to address the nation’s crumbling roads, airports, bridges and other projects. In response to the crisis in Oroville, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer reiterated that promise, calling the situation a “textbook example” of the need for a major infrastructure “overhaul.” But $1 trillion is, of course, a lot of money, and it appears likely that Trump will hold off on asking Congress for it. An Axios article Thursday says that, according to unnamed Republican sources, the president’s infrastructure plan will likely be pushed off until 2018. With the Oroville emergency, massive flooding in New Orleans and the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the need to rehabilitate the nation’s water infrastructure is urgent. On its latest infrastructure report card, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) rated the nation’s dams and its drinking water and wastewater systems as Ds — nearly failing. The nation’s levees earned a D-minus. To fix the problems will be a massively expensive undertaking. The cost to make needed repairs and expansions to the nation’s water systems alone has been estimated by utilities at $1 trillion between now and 2035, and, since federal spending on these systems has stagnated since the 1980s, the money to do what needs to be done is not there. The Association of State Dam Safety Officials puts the price tag to repair just the 2,000 most deficient, high-hazard dams at $21 billion. Even if Trump manages to push through a meaningful infrastructure package with the backing of Congress, the question of which types of investments it will prioritize remains an open one.A list of 50 “priority” infrastructure projects provided by the National Governors Association to the Trump transition team leaked earlier this year presented a mixed bag of projects. Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute think tank on water issues, said the list gave him both hope and concern.“The wish list is a combination of some important, needed projects and some terrible, uneconomic, environmentally dangerous projects,” Gleick told The Huffington Post. “My hope is the good projects, and others, get funded and that the bad ones get rejected, but I’m skeptical of Congress being able to figure out which is which in a rational way.”Some environmental groups are struck by the type of water-related projects included on the list.While the list contained no initiatives to replace lead water pipes in cities like Flint, for example, it does include the contentious Cadiz water conveyance project, which would involve the building of a 43-mile pipeline to take pumped groundwater from the Mojave Desert to Southern California communities.Despite being touted as a possible solution to drought-related water shortages in the state, the Cadiz project has run into a series of setbacks in recent years. In 2015, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management moved to block Cadiz Inc.’s push to build the project using an existing railroad right of way. That decision opened up the pipeline’s construction to a federal environmental review that will delay or even derail it. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has vocally condemned the project. And environmentalists, ranchers and other groups have also expressed their opposition. Aruna Prabhala is a staff attorney at one of those groups, the Center for Biological Diversity. Prabhala fears that the project, if completed, will harm the health of the Mojave Desert springs, as well as species that live in the area and rely on that water.“This is not an infrastructure project that is being pushed for public health and safety or to benefit the environment at all,” Prabhala told HuffPost. “This is the exact opposite direction of where we should be investing resources.”Despite that opposition, the controversial project’s inclusion on the Trump team’s infrastructure list has been a buoy to Cadiz CEO Scott Slater.Slater, who had downplayed environmental concerns over the project, told The Sacramento Bee this month that he believes it will benefit from the changes in Washington. Slater’s political connections clearly play a role in those changes.As noted by the Bee story, Slater is part of the politically connected law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, where he works alongside former Interior Department solicitor David Bernhardt. Bernhardt served on Trump’s transition team and has been rumored to be in line for another leadership post at the Interior Department. The law firm will also benefit if the Cadiz project succeeds — according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the firm will earn 200,000 shares of stock in the company if it is completed, which at today’s value would be worth about $3 million.The potential conflicts of interest are alarming to Kara Kaufman, press secretary of the Corporate Accountability International watchdog group. Kaufman called its inclusion on the transition team list as an indication that the Trump administration is “focused on maximizing benefits for corporations” instead of the American people at large.“This project clearly would prioritize the interest of a singular corporation over both people and the environment,” Kaufman said. “It’s troubling that the Trump administration seems to be providing an opening for this project to go through.”There has been no indication that the BLM decision on Cadiz will be changing anytime soon, and the Trump administration has yet to formally propose any of the projects listed on the leaked list.Still, Prabhala said, she and her colleagues will closely monitor any developments with the Cadiz project.“There is a reason this project has not been moving forward. It’s not sustainable.”CORRECTION: This article previously overstated the degree of damage to the Oroville Dam.

52,CRIME,Protests Erupt After Video Shows Off-Duty LAPD Cop Firing A Gun In Dispute With Teen,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anaheim-off-duty-officer-fires-gun-at-minors_us_58ae34aee4b057efdce8f729,"The white off-duty officer confronted the Latino boy after he walked across his property, police say.",2017-02-23,"In the video, an off-duty officer pulls a gun from his waistband in front of several minors.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae8269290000f616f283ca.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hundreds of activists protested near the home of a police officer in Anaheim, California, Wednesday over video allegedly showing the plainclothes cop firing a gun in front of a group of minors. Many chanted, “don’t shoot the kids,” and “arrest violent cops!”Police have arrested two teenagers in connection with Tuesday afternoon’s confrontation, but Gaby Hernandez, a spokesperson for a group that organized the protest, told The Huffington Post that activists want the “immediate arrest” of the officer for “child abuse” for the incident.Two videos that witnesses filmed of the dispute have attracted more than 5 million views since Tuesday. The footage shows a white man pulling a 13-year-old Latino boy by his collar as a group of minors watch, repeatedly asking the adult to let him go. Anaheim Police Department later identified the man as an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer, though they did not name him.In the video, the off-duty officer can be heard saying that the boy threatened to shoot him. The teen can be heard denying the officer’s claim. The teenager adds that the officer called another girl an offensive word for walking on his property. One kid rushes at the off-duty officer and the teen, causing them to fall in a bush. Another teenager tries to punch the man but misses. The officer then appears to pull a gun from his waistband and a single gunshot rings out. Police later arrive on the scene. The video does not show what led up to the incident, but authorities said it began when a group of kids walked across the officer’s property on Tuesday at 2:40 p.m., according to an official press release.Police allege that a 13-year-old boy threatened to shoot the off-duty police officer, “at which time the officer attempted to detain the teen.” Anaheim police confirmed that the off-duty officer fired the gun once, but said no one was struck by gunfire.The 13 year old’s father says he learned from the teen’s mother that their son had told the officer “I’m going to sue you,” but the officer heard “shoot” instead of “sue,” OC Weekly reported.At 2:05 in the video above, the teen can be heard insisting to the officer that he said “sue” and not “shoot.”Demonstrators assembled Wednesday night in the neighborhood where the footage was filmed condemned the officer’s behavior. Naui Ocelotl Huitzilopochtli, a protestor and Orange County resident who lives 5 miles from the officer’s house, said that the community was upset with the Anaheim police for arresting the teen and not the officer.“You can tell the people are mad,”Huitzilopochtli told HuffPost.“If it would have been a [white kid] this would have never happened,” he added. “White kids don’t go through this,” referring to the 13-year-old’s arrest. “Only people of Mexican descent or black people.”Anaheim Police Department Sgt. Daron Wyatt said Thursday that at least 24 people were arrested during a protest at the intersection of Palais Road and Euclid Street, including six people he described as juveniles.“All are misdemeanor charges for … variations of failure to disperse, resisting arrest, and battery on a peace officer,” Wyatt said. He added that there were reports of car or home windows being broken and “other acts of vandalism.”Police have arrested a 13-year-old boy they believe appeared in the video for criminal threats and battery. They also arrested a 15-year-old for assault and battery, according to an Anaheim police press release issued Tuesday. The off-duty officer was not arrested but is cooperating with the investigation.A spokesperson for the LAPD told HuffPost on Wednesday that it has launched an administrative investigation into the incident, adding that the off-duty officer is not currently facing any charges. However, he has been placed on administrative duty while the LAPD conducts their investigation, according to NBC4 News.The teen’s family said that their attorneys are examining the incident.Alma Jimenez, a woman claiming to be the teen’s mom, said on Facebook she’s asking for justice over the confrontation. The teen’s father told OC Weekly that the family is seeking legal representation and plans to sue.Matt Ferner contributed to this report.This article has been updated with information from Sgt. Daron Wyatt and the teenager’s father. "

These seven Earth-sized planets are located about 40 light-years away from Earth, scientists said Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58aeef22280000db9899abbb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Google is celebrating this week’s planetary discovery with a home page doodle that’s out of this world.In an adorable cartoon, Earth is seen peering out into space with a telescope as the moon ― a.k.a. “Earth’s little buddy,” as Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield described it ― watches from behind.That’s when Earth comes across one lone exoplanet smiling back at it, leading to an ambush of six other cosmic characters. One even waves back. The colorful doodle, which was crafted by Nate Swinehart, graced the home page one day after NASA announced the discovery of seven exoplanets some 40 light-years away, part of what scientists have named the TRAPPIST-1 system ― after the TRAPPIST telescope that found them. Exoplanets are planets orbiting a star that is not our sun. All seven are described as Earth-sized, and at least three of them are in the habitable zone of the star, where a planet is most likely to contain liquid water. However, scientists said that under the right conditions, all seven could potentially have water.NASA said the discovery is the largest of its kind.“This discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the agency’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Answering the question ‘are we alone’ is a top science priority and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal.”"

But at 21, he could have flamed equally quickly.Instead, Towns has emerged as one of the league’s premier big men.The Minnesota Timberwolves center is both humble and quick to deflect praise. He gives much of the credit to his coaches. And he thanks former T-Wolves teammate and now Los Angeles Clippers consultant Kevin Garnett, whom he keeps in close contact with. “KG talks a lot about accountability,” Towns told HuffPost about the man he calls “such a legend.”“When he does something, right away you pay attention,” Towns added. “If you make a mistake, he’s all about holding you accountable.”Towns, to be sure, has done his part. He’s averaged 24 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists, according to ESPN.com. No other player in the league boasts such numbers this season. He also ranks 13th in overall efficiency: His 24.55 rating slots him ahead of Stephen Curry, Blake Griffin, DeMar DeRozan, Hassan Whiteside, Marc Gasol and John Wall.Few players in just their second season have made such drastic improvements to their skill set as Towns has.One skill that doesn’t necessarily reflect in the box score is Towns’ superior footwork around the basket. His dexterity and his ability to let a defender encroach on his hip and air space have driven up his free-throw opportunities from year one to year two. At the All-Star break, Towns’ 302 free-throw attempts had already surpassed the 275 he managed over his entire rookie season.Of course, getting to the line and actually converting at the line are two very different things, particularly for centers. Just ask Shaquille O’Neal about that. Towns converts 83 percent from the stripe ― an outrageously high rate, better even than that of most guards and such well-known shooters as Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis. He’s also surpassing fellow emerging big men like Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.Towns’ silky shooting is what makes him such a dynamic offensive player. He converts a respectable 34 percent from the 3-point distance and is even more effective from 16 to 18 feet, where he asserts himself in three distinct ways: the pick-and-roll, the pick-and-pop and as a slip man.“I’m very comfortable in the pick-and-roll,” he said. “I like to do it. I’ve grown as a player, I’m glad to say that.”Towns’ rapid development stems in part from T-Wolves head coach Tom Thibodeau, who embraces the versatility of his young star.“His skill set is so unique for a 7-footer,” Thibodeau told ESPN.com in November. “He can shoot the 3 with ease from all over the floor ― from the corners, from above the break, from the top of the key. He can put it on the floor. He can change direction. He can Euro-step. He can play back to the basket. He can play a face-up combo game. You can pick-and-roll with him where he’s the screener. You can pick-and-roll with him where he’s the ball handler. He has guard-like skills. He has great vision. He has playmaking ability.”Towns appreciates that his coach lets him be himself, but also that Thibodeau insists the young T-Wolves follow the program.“He’s given us a lot,” Towns said of his coach, who took the Minnesota job last August. “Taking accountability ... we are more responsible and even tighter knit as a group.”Before he was drafted, the New Jersey native told HuffPost that he was “not just a basketball player” ― he likes playing golf and baseball, too. More recently, he has been bitten by the acting bug, something he hasn’t done since an assortment of church plays as a kid.In a recent ad for Jack Link’s beef jerky, he worked out with Sasquatch. “I kind of pinched myself,” Towns said. “I love acting and being able to show my personality.”This is all what makes Towns such an intriguing young star. He desperately wants to be great, but only within the framework of the team. He wants more opportunities like the Jack Link’s spot, but only when that doesn’t get in the way of his athletic development. He prizes everything about basketball, but he enjoys being well rounded as well.“I just find ways to take time,” Towns said. “Enjoying little things like being home, talking to family and seeing family grow up.” Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

56,LATINO VOICES,'OITNB' Star Jackie Cruz Explains Why She Wants The 'White Girl Roles',Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oitnb-star-jackie-cruz-explains-why-she-wants-the-white-girl-roles_us_58aef7b5e4b057efdce9a18c,The actress wants more from Hollywood.,2017-02-23,"""I just want to shake Hollywood and say hey<em>, anyone</em> can play <em>anyone</em>; there’s no reason they have to fit into a stereotype,"" Cruz said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af1b12280000db9899ac6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jackie Cruz isn’t satisfied with the roles Hollywood deems fit for Latina actresses. The “Orange Is The New Black” star recently spoke to Refinery29, as part of their “Beyond the Hashtag” initiative, which focuses on Hollywood’s diversity issues. The Dominican-American actress addressed how few roles there are in the industry for Latinas and explained why her goal is get cast in a “white girl role.” “I have another friend who’s Latina and tall like me — she’s from Cuba, and because there are so few roles for Latinas in Hollywood, we always find ourselves auditioning for the same thing,” Cruz told Refinery29. “The other night on the phone she said, ‘You know what? We just need to get that white girl role.’ And I’m like ‘Yeah, that’s what we need to get, that white girl role!’ It sounds funny, but it’s like, the fact is that the white girl is always the lead, right? So the goal is to get that gig.”Cruz highlighted how few roles there truly are for flourishing Latina actresses by pointing out that she often finds the “entire Latina cast from OITNB auditioning for one role,” and that it’s certainly difficult to have to always compete against your friends. “Like, why, can’t we have more than one Latin girl, one Black girl, one white girl? I try not to feel competitive, but of course I’m human,” she said. “It’s sad, but you just don’t see eight different Latinas in one show. I just want to shake Hollywood and say hey, anyone can play anyone; there’s no reason they have to fit into a stereotype.”Still, there are Latina-designated roles Cruz says she doesn’t get because she’s not the “glamorous ‘Hollywood Latina type.’” And in a 2015 interview with Complex, the actress explained the importance of her “OITNB” character’s diverse layers.“Just like me, Flaca’s an Americanized Latin girl who speaks Spanish and was born in the States,” Cruz said. “It’s important to me that Hollywood is showing that...

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) invoked the shooting of former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) on Thursday to explain why he doesn’t want to meet his constituents in a town hall meeting.“At this time, there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety,” Gohmert said in a statement, perpetuating GOP politicians’ unfounded claims that “paid protesters” are disrupting the meetings. Gohmert then mentioned Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011 during a meeting with constituents. She survived, but six others died in the tragedy. “Threats are nothing new to me, and I have gotten my share as a felony judge,” Gohmert said. “However, the House Sergeant at Arms advised us after former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot at a public appearance, that civilian attendees at Congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed — just as happened there.”Gohmert’s statement comes as angry constituents flood town hall events across America, demanding that their representatives stand up to President Donald Trump’s policies and explain the GOP’s plans to replace Obamacare. Trump has called the angry town hall attendees “Sad!” and said their participation is “planned out by liberal activists,” as if that somehow reduces their legitimacy.In a statement released Thursday, Giffords reminded Gohmert that she attended town halls despite the tragedy she faced.“I was shot on a Saturday morning. By Monday morning, my offices were open to the public,” Giffords said. “Ron Barber ― at my side that Saturday, who was shot multiple times, then elected to Congress in my stead ― held town halls. It’s what the people deserve in a representative.”“To the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations, I say this: Have some courage,” Giffords said. “Face your constituents. Hold town halls.”"

62,POLITICS,Elon Musk Digs In His Heels In Tesla Feud With United Auto Workers,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tesla-uaw_us_58ae3371e4b057efdce8f521,"The billionaire Tesla CEO, an adviser to President Donald Trump, firmly opposes his workers' efforts to unionize.",2017-02-23,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk (R) sits beside Senior Counselor to the President Steve Bannon (L) as U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a strategy and policy forum with chief executives of major U.S. companies at the White House in Washington February 3, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae3844290000f616f2836f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday brushed off efforts by workers at his California factory to unionize, insisting that joining the United Automobile Workers would yield no benefits. “There are really only disadvantages for someone to want the UAW here,” Musk said during a call discussing Tesla’s earnings with analysts and investors.The billionaire repeated claims he made to Gizmodo this month that an employee who wrote scathing blog post about conditions at the company actually worked for the UAW, one of the country’s largest unions. The worker, Jose Moran, 43, and the UAW both denied he was paid by the union.“There is quite a strong effort by the UAW to unionize Tesla,” Musk said Wednesday. “Actually, a lot of people at Tesla have been approached by the UAW and expressed concerns about this.” He called Moran a “de facto UAW employee.” “A lot of workers believe we have a right for union representation and a right to represent ourselves and our own interest,” Moran said during a conference call with reporters earlier this month. “We don’t believe the company is doing that for us.”The UAW said recently that it “can confirm that Mr Moran and others at Tesla have approached the UAW and we welcome them with open arms.” Reached by The Huffington Post on Wednesday evening, UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said, “Our statement stands.” Musk’s remarks, during the company’s first earnings call since November’s election, comes amid heightened public scrutiny of his political views. The South African-born entrepreneur, who also is CEO of rocket firm SpaceX, serves as an adviser to President Donald Trump, with whom he has cultivated what The New York Times described as a “budding bromance.” Moran, in a Feb. 9 post on Medium, described working long hours with machinery that leaves workers prone to injuries. Employees on the assembly line earn hourly wages of $17 to $21, he said, making it difficult to afford rent in the notoriously pricey Bay Area. He cited $25.58 as average pay in the auto industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics lists the average hourly wage for motor vehicle manufacturing in December as $29.53.“Preventable injuries happen often,” wrote Moran, who has worked at the Fremont, California, assembly plant since 2012. “In addition to long working hours, machinery is often not ergonomically compatible with our bodies. There is too much twisting and turning and extra physical movement to do jobs that could be simplified if workers’ input were welcomed.” Musk fired back on Wednesday, insisting his employees are hurt far less frequently than those at rival auto plants.“Tesla’s injury rate is less than half of the industry average, contrary to allegations made,” Musk said.He added that employee equity in the company, whose historically jittery stock price has hovered around $270 this month, places Tesla workers among the best paid in the industry.The labor feud wasn’t the only political topic Musk broached during the 73-minute earnings call. Musk said he urged Trump not to ax government incentives for renewable energy and electric vehicles unless he does the same to the oil, gas and coal industries.Musk, one of 17 executives advising the president, said Trump did not respond when he briefly raised the issue at a recent summit.“It’d be fine to get rid of incentives and subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries,” Musk said during the call. “It would be wrong to get rid of any sort of government intervention in sustainable energy while retaining it in fossil fuels.”Trump, who has repeatedly said he doesn’t believe in climate change, vowed to boost the U.S. economy by slashing environmental regulations and bolstering fossil fuel production. He stacked his Cabinet with climate science deniers and oil industry allies. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt cultivated a cozy relationship with oil and gas players during his tenure as Oklahoma attorney general, an office from which he repeatedly sued the agency he now leads. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson previously served as CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., the oil giant that bankrolled a decades-long disinformation campaign against climate scientists. Citizens for the Republic, a grassroots conservative group with ties to ring-wing radio commentator Laura Ingraham, launched a campaign last year calling on the new Republican-dominated Congress to pass a bill stripping the solar and electric vehicle industries of subsidies. The group made Musk its poster boy, setting up websites with names like StopElonFromFailingAgain.com. Tillerson, during his confirmation hearings, denied that oil and gas producers receive subsidies. The companies actually enjoy a vast array of incentives, including direct subsidies to offset the cost of extracting from wells that are nearly spent. Exxon Mobil alone receives between $700 million and $1 billion per year in deductions that tax analysts told HuffPost function like subsidies. “If the principle is to get rid of government intervention, that should be uniformly applied, not unfairly applied,” Musk said. “That was my comment, but there was no response given.”"

Ted Cruz on Thursday predicted that President Donald Trump will get another chance to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice as soon as “this summer.”Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual gathering of conservatives, the Texas Republican did not specify the circumstances.“I think we’ll have another Supreme Court vacancy this summer,” Cruz said.“If that happens, as much as the left is crazy now, they will go full Armageddon meltdown,” he said.Despite their ages, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83; Anthony Kennedy, 80 and Stephen Breyer, 78; have given no indication that they will retire any time soon. Last year, there were rumors that conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas would retire, but his wife quickly dismissed them as “bogus.”Cruz’s office did not return a request for clarification.Republicans held open the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia for more than a year. Senate GOP leaders refused to hold hearings on former President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland because they wanted to wait for a Republican president to nominate a conservative justice.In January, Trump nominated conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch to the seat. His confirmation hearings will begin on March 20.Cruz on Thursday described Democratic opposition to Trump as “bat-crap crazy.”“The anger on the left, I’ve never seen anything like this. They’re right now opposing everything. Democrats are filibustering everything. The Cabinet is still not confirmed,” he said. “There’s a technical term for their base.”When moderator Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, suggested “Moscow” for the Democrats’ base, Cruz offered another suggestion.“I was going a different direction, which was ‘bat-crap crazy,’” he said."

Spencer has stated his love of Depeche Mode on Reddit in the past as well. We reached out to Depeche Mode’s publicist, who made it clear the band wants absolutely nothing to do with Richard Spencer or anything he stands for. “Depeche Mode has no ties to Richard Spencer or the alt-right and does not support the alt-right movement,” the band’s representative said in a statement.Spencer, who the CPAC’s organizers called “repugnant” on Thursday, was famously punched in the face by a protester near President Donald Trump’s inauguration last month, leading to a national conversation about whether it is ethical to punch a Nazi."

Last year, the proof of citizenship requirement was blocked in federal court.In testimony found in a forthcoming report, Kobach told the Kansas Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights that he didn’t think either requirement posed a substantial obstacle to voters.“The photo ID part, I don’t think it’s a burden to reach into one’s wallet or one’s purse and pull out a photo ID. Someone could argue that you’re exerting calories when you’re doing that, and there is some process. I don’t think that’s a burden,” Kobach told the panel in January 2016.Going on to speak about the citizenship requirement, he said: “Is this step a burden? I guess it depends on how you define burden. Someone might say that it is to find your birth certificate or your passport and take a picture of it with your phones and email it in or send it in or carry it in. I don’t think it’s significant.”A draft of a report written by the panel features testimony from organizers and academics highlighting how the extensive requirements pose a barrier to voting. Based on its findings, the Kansas Advisory Committee suggested that the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights formally recommend a review of the SAFE Act’s voting requirements and its compliance with federal law to the Department of Justice. As states around the country push voter ID laws, the Kansas committee’s report demonstrates how strict voting requirements can have a disproportionate impact on certain groups. For example, the SAFE Act requires Kansas to provide free identification to any voter for voting purposes ― something that many other states pushing voter ID laws also promise. But Michael Byington, a disability rights advocate, told the committee that he had worked with several clients whom officials had tried to charge for a voting ID. While the law required Kansas to provide free birth certificates to people born in the state for identification purposes, residents born outside Kansas have to pay to obtain identification documents. Any kind of charge to be able to vote is effectively a poll tax, Richard Levy, a constitutional law professor at the University of Kansas, told the committee.One Democratic lawmaker has already introduced legislation to repeal the SAFE Act based on the report, according to the Kansas City Star.Kobach’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, he told the Kansas City Star the report “looks like it’s been written by a third-grader.”In Kansas, voters who registered but could not provide proof of citizenship documentation were placed on a “suspense list” and purged from the voter rolls if they did not provide adequate documentation within 90 days. The committee was presented with evidence showing that the “University of Kansas had the highest percentage of suspense voters of any census tract in the state.” Jamie Shew, the Douglas County Clerk, testified that in 2014 the largest group of suspense voters were aged 18 to 24, an age group, according to Shew, that was quick to drop attempts to register and say, “Forget it. I’ve got stuff going on.”The committee also considered evidence showing a correlation between areas with high African American populations and suspense voters. Women who changed their names when they married, or are single working parents, often have trouble finding the required documents for proof of citizenship or do not have the time to do so, the committee learned.The 12-member committee voted on Wednesday to publish the report. It is still pending a final legal review.Most of the testimony in the report came from a public meeting the committee held in January 2016. While Kobach testified in person, the committee wrote that “despite an active search and many outreach attempts,” it was unable to find any group to testify in support of the SAFE Act.The committee also urged Congress and the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights to further investigate voter suppression, voter fraud and the potential for setting up a national voter system."

Keith Ellison. At a live CNN-sponsored debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night, however, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison stood out for their animated performances. They are now fighting for the role of kingmaker in the deal-making that will dominate the race’s final days and it showed in their urgent demeanors. Buttigieg in particular was clearly on a mission to make an impression with DNC members ― and for that matter, Democrats watching at home.In an unusually tense moment for a race where public forums have been almost boringly amicable, Buttigieg interrupted Ellison during an answer about past remarks on gun policy. CNN’s Dana Bash had asked Ellison to explain why he had called for Democrats to oppose the second amendment of the Constitution. Ellison denied that he had ever said such a thing. When Bash confronted him with his exact words, he insisted they were being taken out of context.“It’s a false choice to say that you are either going to ban the second amendment or we are going to have some common sense gun safety laws,” he said. “I am for common sense gun safety laws ―”“Which is why it matters so much to use the right words when we’re talking about these issues,” Buttigieg interjected.It was a perfect opportunity for Buttigieg to highlight his main selling point: That as a Democrat who has won in Republican territory, he is best positioned to rebuild the party in the era of President Donald Trump.“In my part of the country, this is one of the reasons people tune us out immediately. But there are ways of talking about this,” Buttigieg said. He went on to list a string of personal stories he uses to explain his support for universal background checks, including one involving his own military service in Afghanistan.Later, Buttigieg made an appeal for his candidacy that warned of the consequences of not electing someone with his red-state mayoral experience.“If you do what you’ve always done, you’re gonna get what you’ve always got. This is a test of whether the DNC is ready for change,” he said.Harrison, for his part, insisted that his experience as the field’s sole state party chair made him uniquely equipped to head the DNC. (New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley dropped out of the race on Saturday and endorsed Ellison.)“I know the mayor likes to say he’s the ‘only person,’” Harrison said, referring to Buttigieg. “Well, listen, I’m the only person that is a party chair that is building a party right now in the state.”And Harrison, who has endured some scrutiny for his lobbying work on behalf of controversial industries, argued that his impoverished upbringing actually made him the candidate most prepared to understand the needs of the less fortunate.“I will be probably the only chair that has been on food stamps; the only chair that has lost their home, not once, but twice; the only chair that knows what the hardship that working people have to go through in this country,” he said in his closing remarks.It is not likely that either Harrison or Buttigieg tipped the scales of the race decisively in their favor on Wednesday night.But that was undoubtedly not the goal. Neither Perez nor Ellison has locked up a majority of the DNC’s 447 voting members. If that trend holds, then Saturday’s voting will proceed to multiple rounds where securing a third candidate’s supporters could make a difference.As a result, figures like Buttigieg, Harrison and Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton could barter their votes for some form of influence in the party. There is even an unlikely scenario in which Ellison and Perez are continually unable to secure a majority, and members coalesce behind another candidate who can transcend their differences. Harrison reportedly has the most DNC members’ votes of any candidate besides the top two. Buttigieg is armed with his self-proclaimed outsider status, unique life story, and, as of Wednesday, the endorsement of the respected former DNC chair Howard Dean.Many activists and operatives view the showdown between Perez and Ellison as a proxy contest between the establishment and progressive wings of the Democratic Party. Perez, who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, is the establishment favorite, while Ellison, an outspoken supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has gotten more traction among progressive stalwarts.But with an eye toward courting the party officials who decide the DNC race, Perez and Ellison have been focusing on their individual strengths, rather than their perceived roles in the party ecosystem. The two frontrunners continued to fine-tune those pitches on Wednesday night. Perez highlighted his executive experience at the helm of the Department of Labor, and the Department of Justice’s civil rights division before that.For every outrage-provoking Republican policy that came up, such as voter identification laws or draconian enforcement of immigration laws, Perez pointed to a lawsuit he brought or a regulation he helped write.“This organization has a crisis of confidence and a crisis of relevance. It requires someone with experience as a turn-around agent at scale,” Perez said.

Keith Ellison. At a live CNN-sponsored debate in Atlanta on Wednesday night, however, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and South Carolina Democratic Party Chair Jaime Harrison stood out for their animated performances. They are now fighting for the role of kingmaker in the deal-making that will dominate the race’s final days and it showed in their urgent demeanors. Buttigieg in particular was clearly on a mission to make an impression with DNC members ― and for that matter, Democrats watching at home.In an unusually tense moment for a race where public forums have been almost boringly amicable, Buttigieg interrupted Ellison during an answer about past remarks on gun policy. CNN’s Dana Bash had asked Ellison to explain why he had called for Democrats to oppose the second amendment of the Constitution. Ellison denied that he had ever said such a thing. When Bash confronted him with his exact words, he insisted they were being taken out of context.“It’s a false choice to say that you are either going to ban the second amendment or we are going to have some common sense gun safety laws,” he said. “I am for common sense gun safety laws ―”“Which is why it matters so much to use the right words when we’re talking about these issues,” Buttigieg interjected.It was a perfect opportunity for Buttigieg to highlight his main selling point: That as a Democrat who has won in Republican territory, he is best positioned to rebuild the party in the era of President Donald Trump.“In my part of the country, this is one of the reasons people tune us out immediately. But there are ways of talking about this,” Buttigieg said. He went on to list a string of personal stories he uses to explain his support for universal background checks, including one involving his own military service in Afghanistan.Later, Buttigieg made an appeal for his candidacy that warned of the consequences of not electing someone with his red-state mayoral experience.“If you do what you’ve always done, you’re gonna get what you’ve always got.

The former labor secretary is locked in a tight race with Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Harrison was the third-most popular candidate behind Ellison and Perez, according to an Associated Press report, and his support will now likely go to Perez.Neither Perez nor Ellison currently has a majority of the 442 party officials eligible to vote. If no candidate wins an outright majority in the first round of voting, there will be additional ballots until a candidate obtains one.The close state of the contest has set the stage for a scurry of dealmaking in the race’s final days. New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley exited the race and endorsed Ellison on Saturday. If Ellison wins, Buckley will lead the DNC’s efforts to revive state Democratic parties, according to the two campaigns. In addition to Perez and Ellison, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton; media strategist Jehmu Greene; Milwaukee attorney Peter Peckarsky and U.S. Air Force veteran Sam Ronan are still in the running.Harrison turned in one of his most forceful performances of the monthslong campaign at a CNN-sponsored debate on Wednesday night. But the former floor director for then-House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) has failed to gain traction in a race dominated by two figures with major national backing. Until entering the DNC chair race, Harrison worked as lobbyist for the Podesta Group, where he represented the coal, tobacco and financial industries.Democratic activists and operatives are closely watching the DNC race, viewing it as a proxy battle between the Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wing of the party and the Democratic establishment. Ellison endorsed Sanders in the 2016 primary and now has the blessing of Sanders and many of his most active backers. Perez backed Hillary Clinton in the primary, and has earned the endorsement of major figures from the Barack Obama administration, including former Vice President Joe Biden.But Perez also has strong progressive credentials, winning liberal praise for his leadership of the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. One of his only major policy differences with Ellison is his backing for the now-defunct 12-nation trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.In their pitches to the state party chairs and other insiders who will decide the race, Perez has emphasized his executive experience, while Ellison has focused on his organizing prowess and record of winning elections."

The president can't rescind those.,2017-02-23,"Gavin Grimm, 17, with his mom. Grimm is suing his school district to use bathrooms that match his gender identity. The case is going before the Supreme Court.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af16fb280000d59899ac57.jpeg?ops=crop_9_0_4919_3280%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump outraged LGBTQ rights supporters on Wednesday when his administration eliminated Obama-era federal guidance to schools aimed at protecting transgender students from bullying and discrimination.But it’s important to note that Trump’s action, while it sends the signal that his administration won’t stand up for transgender kids, didn’t change anything legally. The same federal and state laws that protect transgender people against discrimination are still in place, and Trump’s move has no effect on them.The guidance that President Barack Obama’s Departments of Justice and Education issued to school districts in 2016 was just that: guidance. It wasn’t legally binding. It directed schools to accommodate transgender kids’ desire to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that reflect their gender identity.The Obama administration issued that guidance based on its interpretation of Title IX, the 1972 federal law that bans sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. His agencies read the law to mean that schools have to treat a student’s gender identity the same as the student’s sex. “The guidance ... didn’t create law,” Vanita Gupta, the DOJ’s civil rights chief under Obama, told NPR on Thursday. “The guidance simply enunciated the Justice Department’s interpretation of Title IX and what federal civil rights law requires of schools. It was based on a decade of case law. It was based on proven best practices that, frankly, a lot of schools around the country were already implementing at the time that we issued the guidance.”So, for example, if a teacher told a transgender boy he couldn’t use the boy’s bathroom at school, the Obama administration would argue that that would qualify as discrimination based on that boy’s sex, which would be illegal. That direct tie between a student’s gender and sex isn’t explicitly spelled out in Title IX, but that’s how Obama’s team was interpreting the law, and that’s the thrust of the guidance they issued.Trump got rid of that guidance but he can’t get rid of Title IX. And Obama’s interpretation of that law ― that a student’s gender identity should be viewed the same as the student’s sex ― is the opinion of a federal appeals court and more than a dozen district courts that have tackled related issues over the last 15 years.The only difference now, without that guidance, is that transgender students would have to go through more of a hassle when suing a school for discrimination, because they’ll have one less tool to assert the right to use the restroom of their choice.“They have access to the courts, even without the guidance,” explained Sarah Trumble, deputy director of social policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank. “It’s just a heavier burden for them to vindicate those rights without the guidance.”It’s also worth noting that Obama’s guidance has been frozen since August, when a judge in Texas blocked it nationwide.Yet independent of that ruling, many states and localities have been mindful of students’ gender identities. As Third Way spells out in a handy explainer, 14 states, the District of Columbia and hundreds of local school districts already have their own policies that protect transgender students from discrimination.Transgender students are among the most vulnerable people in schools. More than half of them nationwide face verbal harassment, a quarter are physically attacked and 13 percent are sexually assaulted while attending school because they are transgender, according to the 2015 National Transgender Discrimination Survey. Seventy-seven percent experience mistreatment between kindergarten and 12th grade, the survey says.The big development to watch when it comes to discrimination against trans people comes in March, when the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender teenager who’s suing the Gloucester County School Board in Virginia for denying him the ability to use school bathrooms that match his gender identity. While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and other districts courts have deferred to the Obama administration’s interpretation of Title IX, applying the law’s protections to transgender students, this case could be the ultimate decider.The American Civil Liberties Union is representing Grimm before the Supreme Court. The organization was using Obama’s guidance as part of its argument in Grimm’s case, but with that gone, it’s now relying almost entirely on the text of Title IX to make the case that the law should apply to gender identity.Joshua Block, the lead ACLU attorney in Grimm’s case, said the slew of previous court decisions in favor of Title IX applying to transgender protections gives him a strong case.“While it’s disappointing to see the Trump administration revoke the guidance, the administration cannot change what Title IX means,” Block said. “When it decided to hear Gavin Grimm’s case, the Supreme Court said it would decide which interpretation of Title IX is correct, without taking any administration’s guidance into consideration. We’re confident that the law is on Gavin’s side and he will prevail just as he did in the 4th Circuit.”The Gloucester County School Board issued a statement praising Trump for rescinding the guidance, saying it shows why decisions about transgender students’ use of bathrooms should be decided at the local level.“This action shows ‘due regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing educational policy,’” reads the board’s statement. “We look forward to explaining to the Supreme Court why this development underscores that the Board’s commonsense restroom and locker room policy is legal under federal law.”The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Grimm’s case on March 28."

And the first lady’s put a lot of time into this event, in welcoming our nation’s governors to the capital, and I have a feeling that’s where the president and first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night.The former reality star has fired up feuds with the likes of Meryl Streep (who’s nominated) and has also gotten roasted at previous award shows, so he probably isn’t feeling chummy with show business right about now. Plus, given the anti-administration yuks that will likely spill forth at the Oscars, perhaps Trump wants to spare his ego.While he may not tune in, we have a sneaking suspicion that the commander-in-chief won’t tune out what transpires on Oscar night.

In general, this country still — for some insane reason — hasn’t accepted and institutionalized the idea of health as a basic human right. This is obvious in the way our healthcare system functions (or doesn’t) and its fundamental exploitative nature, particularly towards anyone who isn’t a white male with ample means.””When it comes to reproductive rights,” she continued, “the conversation often skews even further away from the idea of them as a right to health and safety and control over your own existence. And that’s if there’s a conversation at all. Doing this has made us even more aware of the lack of knowledge around these issues, even in our immediate communities.”Repro Rights Zine offers information on how to get an IUD, reproductive rights for trans and gender-nonconforming individuals, who to call to help protect the Affordable Care Act, and where to find the specifics of reproductive rights state-by-state. The first edition of the zine, published shortly before Trump’s inauguration, is available for free download on the Repro Rights Zine website. The goal is, with the help of social media, to get the reading material to anyone and everyone who might benefit from its contents, from a middle school girl in conservative Texas to a non-binary, queer teen in Middle America. For the second edition, the zine-masters enlisted artists Petra Collins, Meriem Bennani, Lola Ogbara, Ser Serpas, Alia Penner, Aidan Koch and Raina Hamner to create limited edition posters to stick inside the zines. These special artist editions sell for $20 each, with all proceeds going to the Center for Reproductive Rights.We reached out to contributing artist Ogbara to learn more. How did you get involved with Repro Rights Zine? What stood out to you about the publication, in relation to other material on women’s sexual health? I was approached by India Menuez. She sought me out via Instagram and emailed me about the project. I think what stood out the most for me was the way the Repro Rights Zine, compared to other publications, took on a strong political stance on the subject of women’s reproductive issues while simultaneously being current, timely and relatable.What can art teach women about reproductive rights and health that writing or scientific data cannot? I think there’s an important difference in the way we are learning and going about obtaining information. Art compared to scientific data/writing is more visual and, in today’s world, having a visual of anything grabs the attention of the masses. I think people, in general, are seeing the importance of art more and more each day. Hopefully when realizing that, women will take their reproductive health and rights more seriously. What better way to approach learning than through art? Who, in your opinion, is this zine meant for?I believe this zine is for anyone and everyone. Reproductive rights not only affect women but a whole family. It’s something everyone should be able to understand. The more we understand the more we can make strides toward progress.Can you talk about the work you contributed to the artist edition? Was this something you made specifically for the zine or decided to submit? What are you hoping to communicate through the piece? I had been working on a uterus drawing a few weeks back that I never finished and had been sitting in a folder on my computer. When the opportunity to create something outside my own personal interest came, specifically something with purpose, that’s when I thought of the drawing I had done. I revisited the drawing, added to it and expanded it.I aimed for a vintage psychedelic poster aesthetic and used simple line work to achieve it. I connected with the early 1960s and ‘70s era because that era birthed a more radical political stance on women’s rights. It was seen as the second wave of feminism. I wanted to send a message that was bold but clear from the beginning of the movement [1920s] to now. Nothing has changed — our bodies, our decisions. In your artist statement you write: “I gravitate towards a more literal and abstract functionality of the female aesthetic.” Can you expand upon what you mean by that? I work in multiple mediums — whether it’s drawing, sculpture or painting, my undertones tend to concentrate on the female form, aesthetic, or way of life. It could be as literal as a drawing of a female figure or more subtle and abstract as in my paintings using delicate shapes and certain color palettes. However we are functioning and evolving in today’s society, I am a storyteller of that process.How does the political climate we’re in right now shape your ideas regarding the efficacy of art activism? My art has always had a purpose; an activism rooted in any adversity I felt connected to. As a black woman living in America, there will always be some type of adversity for me so I will always feel inspired to express that. I think our current political standing expands to a demographic of artists that may not have been affected before and, as a result, more artists are participating in this new wave of art activism. To reach any change, I think it’s necessary that art activism grows to help make society better for everyone. What is one thing you wish everyone knew in terms of women’s health and reproductive rights?It’s not just an issue for women, it’s an issue for everyone. The idea that If you educate a man, you educate an individual; but if you educate a woman, you educate a family (nation) — applies to this situation, as well. If you tend to a woman, you tend to the family (nation). Download a free copy of Repro Rights Zine here and purchase an artist edition here. "

It is the pendulum. And when the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back.”While things look bleak, she believes the record levels of activism at events like last month’s Women’s March, which may have been the largest protest in U.S. history, bode well for the future. “[T]here’s hope in seeing how the public is reacting to it,” she said. “The Women’s March ― I’ve never seen such a demonstration, both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd. There was no violence; it was orderly. So yes, we are not experiencing the best times, but there is reason to hope that that we will see a better day.” Ginsburg noted that the U.S. has emerged from dark chapters in its history, like the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II.“That was a dreadful mistake,” she said. “It took a long time for the United States to realize how dreadful it was. But ultimately the president acknowledged that there was no reason to intern people of Japanese ancestry and Congress passed a bill providing compensation for the people who were interned or their survivors.”And the media is instrumental in holding the government accountable, she said.“Think of what the press has done in the United States,” she said. “[The Watergate scandal] might never have come out if we didn’t have the free press that we do.”The 83-year-old is optimistic about her own future on the Supreme Court, too.“At my age you have to take it year by year. I know I’m OK. What will be next year?” she said.“I’m hopeful however, because my most senior colleague ― the one who most recently retired, Justice John Paul Stevens ― stepped down at age 90. So I have a way to go.”"
77,POLITICS,This GOP Lawmaker Just Spent 90 Minutes Getting Yelled At By Constituents,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leonard-lance-town-hall_us_58ae8e6ae4b01406012fca12,"Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) decided to engage with voters in his district, and ended up getting an earful about President Donald Trump.",2017-02-23,"Protestors gathered outside a town hall meeting hosted by Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) in Branchburg, New Jersey, on Wednesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae92be2900002200bea659.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRANCHBURG, N.J. ― Most of Rep. Leonard Lance’s fellow Republican lawmakers have chosen to avoid their constituents during this congressional recess. Lance, who represents New Jersey’s 7th District, made a different choice Wednesday night. The congressman might have a better understanding of his colleagues’ thinking after enduring more than 90 minutes of hostile questioning from constituents. They were furious about President Donald Trump’s behavior and agenda ― and not very keen to hear their representative recite GOP talking points.The capacity crowd at Raritan Valley Community College welcomed Lance with applause and sent him off with more at the end. That was about as good as it got for the five-term lawmaker. “I never use the term yelling,” Lance told reporters afterward. “I thought it was vigorous.”That it was, but there definitely was yelling. A lot of it.This town hall lacked the kind of stand-out moment seen at other recent events, including a farmer handing Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) a bottle of antacid, a constituent telling Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that her cancer-stricken daughter could die if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, or vitriol on a multitude of topics being heaped on Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).But Lance, who comfortably secured re-election last year in a district that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won by a slender margin over Trump, didn’t have any easy night. He remained affable, even genteel, as the crowd jeered, booed and interrupted his responses to questions randomly chosen from numbered slips of paper.Lance attempted to explain his party’s repeal-and-replace strategy for the Affordable Care Act, promising the currently nonexistent “replacement” would guarantee coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, ensure young adults could remain on their parents’ policies until age 26 and prohibit insurers from establishing lifetime limits of benefits.“Sounds like Obamacare!”Then Lance called for Planned Parenthood to spin off its abortion services into a separate organization to avoid federal funding cuts.“That’s silly!”One constituent wanted Lance to push for investigations into Trump’s ties to Russia and the country’s interference with the presidential election, and demanded to know whether the congressman would support impeachment if evidence emerged that Trump’s campaign worked with the Russians. “I am a lawyer by trade and I certainly don’t want to prejudice ―” Lance began. He didn’t get to finish. “Then investigate!”Continuing, Lance assured his constituents, “I want you to know that I am very suspicious of the Russian government.”“Your president isn’t!”Even mundane praise for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) sparked an angry response. “I think Speaker Ryan is a very fine individual,” Lance said. “I think he’s a person of great integrity. And I am proud that he is speaker of the House of Representatives.” Choruses of boos punctuated each sentence.A man in the auditorium’s mezzanine called down to ask Lance if he opposed Trump’s “dopey” wall on the Mexican border. Lance meandered through a reply that included saying he opposed walling off the entire border and thought Trump’s plan was too expensive.“Answer the question! It’s easy. Yes or no!”One man questioned why Lance opposes a proposed natural gas pipeline in New Jersey but supports the oil-carrying Keystone XL Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline.“Hypocrite!”Another questioner raised Trump’s business conflicts of interest and his failure to release his tax returns. “President Trump should turn his tax returns over to the public. I urge him to do so,” Lance said. That wasn’t good enough for the questioner, who demanded to know if Lance supports the effort by Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) to instruct Trump to hand over his tax records to the House Ways and Means Committee for a review.“I don’t believe the Ways and Means Committee should be investigating the returns of private individuals,” Lance said. This really set off the crowd. “He’s the president!”As the evening wound down the final question, a woman pressed Lance on Trump’s erratic behavior, his penchant for lies and his attacks on federal intelligence agencies and the press. Lance’s response provoked the angriest reaction of the night.“I believe that when the president misstates ―”“Lies! He lies!”“Push back! Push back! Push back!”“We need someone who will fight for us!”Huddling with local and national reporters immediately afterward, Lance showed little sign that the berating had taken a toll, and insisted he was glad to meet with people in his district.“We were always going to have town hall meetings in person this year,” Lance said. He has another one planned at the same location Saturday morning.Lance attributed most of the hostility to voters who supported Clinton in the election, but he didn’t parrot the suddenly popular GOP line that the protests were manufactured. “Those in the audience were constituents. I don’t think they were paid. I think they came here in a manner of public-spiritedness,” he said. “I hope it was useful to the constituents. I know it was useful to me.”Outside the auditorium, two residents of nearby Tewksbury Township said they didn’t find their congressman’s contributions to the dialogue or his stance toward Trump to be very useful.“He made it through the evening. That’s about it,” said Susan Becker, who attended the town hall with other members of the newly formed Tewksbury Area Indivisible. The group, which is made up of about 60 locals, is affiliated with the loosely organized national Indivisible movement founded to oppose Trump’s agenda.Jennifer Robinson, who leads the group, said she wasn’t satisfied by Lance’s words or his actions to date.“He’s not protecting us,” she said. “He’s not speaking out against Donald Trump’s excesses and corruption and he’s not calling for independent investigation.”These novice activists instead found satisfaction helping their neighbors organize and put pressure on their elected representatives. “People are awake,” Robinson said. “Every day a new organization pops up here and here and here, and they’re connecting.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story understated the number of members of Tewksbury Area Indivisible."

She called the Obama guidance an example of “one-size-fits-all federal government approach,” and said the issue is “best dealt with and solved on a personal level and local level.”While DeVos emphasized her responsibility “to protect students and to do that to the fullest extent that we can,” she also said it is the Department of Education’s job to provide flexibility to parents and teachers and to “protect and preserve personal freedom.”The fight over how schools should treat transgender students has been months in the making. In May 2016, the Obama administration told schools that they should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. However, on Wednesday evening, the Trump administration’s Department of Education and Department of Justice withdrew this guidance, citing legal confusion.According to media reports, DeVos opposed the move but was railroaded by Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. She instead worked to make sure the letter from the departments emphasized the importance of protecting students from bullying and harassment, according to The New York Times. During the Q&A at CPAC, DeVos said she thinks the main responsibilities of the Department of Education are to protect special needs students and students’ civil rights. Other than that, she said, “the role of the federal government should be as light a touch as possible.”DeVos faced a difficult confirmation process in which she barely received enough votes to become a Cabinet secretary. After the Senate was tied in a 50-50 vote on her confirmation, Vice President Mike Pence made the tie-breaking decision in her favor.She referenced this controversy during a speech that preceded the Q&A.“The media has had its fun with me, and that’s OK,” DeVos said. “My job isn’t to win a popularity contest with the media or the education establishment here in Washington. My job as secretary of education is to make education work for students.”During the speech, DeVos also railed against the “education establishment” and Obama-era education policies, which she said “failed miserably.” She made her case for school choice policies that provide students with options outside of their neighborhood public school. DeVos has spent decades promoting school choice policies as an education philanthropist, focusing especially on voucher programs that give kids taxpayer funds to attend private schools. DeVos’ critics argue that she could emphasize these programs at the expense of traditional public schools ― which most students attend. In her Q&A, DeVos said school choice is a matter of justice. School choice policies provide poor parents with the same educational options as rich parents who can already choose where their kids go to school, she argued. DeVos received considerable applause when she suggested that political correctness on college campuses was damaging, both during her Q&A and in her speech. She called on conservative students to “keep talking, keep making your arguments.”“The faculty, from adjunct professors to deans, tell you what to do, what to say, and more ominously, what to think. They say that if you voted for Donald Trump, you’re a threat to the university community. But the real threat is silencing the First Amendment rights of people with whom you disagree,” she said."

While the Obama era guidance clarified that trans students are federally protected from sex discrimination under Title IX, the Trump administration said that it wants to leave LGBTQ rights to the states. Rescinding the guidance opens the door to discrimination against trans students at this level, and sends the message that the government will not stand up for the nation’s most vulnerable kids. A common claim that opponents of such protections for trans students make is that allowing transgender people into bathrooms endangers cisgender women and girls. In his much discussed appearance on “Real Time,” alt-right former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos told host Bill Maher that he “makes no apologies for protecting women and children from men who are confused about their sexual identity.” This argument perpetuates the myth that trans people are predators, when they are far more likely to face violence and harassment in restrooms at the hands of cis people.Yet, Yiannopoulos’s line is a common refrain that continues to be used by those who care little about real, not mythical, violence against women. When walking back LGBTQ protections or promoting so-called “bathroom bills,” proponents of such legislation have said that allowing trans people to use the appropriate restroom means men can “enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls,” and that businesses that allow trans people to use the appropriate restroom pose “a danger to wives and daughters.”But invoking women’s safety while ignoring real violence faced by women and girls on college campuses, on the street and within their own homes is nothing more than a veil for hate. This so-called protection is a justification for transphobia — and as cisgender women, we’re done being your excuse.There are no recorded cases of transgender people harming anyone in the bathroom. In fact, trans people are far more likely to encounter violence and harassment themselves. In 2016 alone, at least 27 transgender people were murdered, the majority being transgender women of color. A whopping 41 percent of transgender people will attempt suicide in their lifetimes, compared with just 4.6 percent of the general public, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Williams Institute. On top of that, trans women encounter structural sexism just as cis women do. Perpetuating the lie that transgender people are predators just feeds into this discrimination. And we cis women never asked for this kind of “protection” to begin with.Conservatives are right that the safety of women and girls is at risk, but certainly not because of trans people. One in five women will be raped in her life, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, and nearly 30 percent of women worldwide will experience intimate partner violence in their lifetime, according to the World Health Organization. Trans people face even more staggering rates of these types of violence. One in two trans people will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime, according to the Office for Victims of Crime. Meanwhile, the cis men who commit sexual assault ― if they face consequences at all ― face shockingly light sentences, like Brock Turner who served just three months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.If opponents of trans protections sincerely cared about the safety of women and girls, they’d care about ending rape culture. They’d care about holding President Trump accountable for more than 15 allegations of sexual assault and harassment against women. And they wouldn’t paternalistically tell us who we ought to fear when we proudly count trans and queer people as part of our communities. Rescinding the Obama administration’s guidance and rejecting similar protections is simply an act of hate against transgender people. To those who would use my body and the bodies of women like me as an excuse for violence and discrimination: It stops today. "
80,QUEER VOICES,Reactions: Trump Administration Rescinds Title IX Protections For Trans Students,"Sarah Toce, ContributorPublisher, Editor-in-Chief, The Seattle Lesbian",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reactions-trump-administration-rescinds-title-ix-protections_us_58af4383e4b0e5fdf6196f88,"On Wednesday, February 23, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice rescinded the guidance issued",2017-02-23,<p>Title IX Protections for Transgender Students Have Been Rescinded</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58af444d2900002400f285ab.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Wednesday, February 23, the U.S. Department of Education and U.S. Department of Justice rescinded the guidance issued by the Obama administration on accommodating transgender and gender nonconforming students under Title IX. The Obama administration guidance had helped ensure that transgender students were treated fairly in federally funded schools, including by having appropriate access to facilities consistent with their gender identity, having their names and pronouns respected, and having their privacy and dignity preserved. The original guidance had been requested by teachers and school administrators and provided clarification to current law.In a letter organized by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) “Parents for Transgender Equality Council,” more than 1,000 parents of transgender children from 45 states and Washington, D.C., recently urged Trump not to rescind this guidance.Research shows that trans students encounter high levels of discrimination and harassment on campuses. For example, the 2015 “Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct,” which involved 27 colleges, found that trans and gender-nonconforming students experienced greater rates of sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, and stalking than any other campus group. In the 2015 “U.S. Transgender Survey,” the largest study ever conducted of trans people in the U.S., nearly one-quarter of the college student participants who were out, or perceived as trans, on campus had been verbally, physically, or sexually harassed.Research has consistently shown that transgender students are more likely to face severe violence and discrimination at school than their peers, and at greatly increased risk of suicide and self-harm as a result,” said GLSEN’s Executive Director, Dr. Eliza Byard. “GLSEN’s ‘National School Climate Survey‘ has shown that 76 percent of transgender students felt unsafe at school simply because of their gender. We also know that transgender students who are allowed simply to be themselves at school are as healthy and happy and successful as their peers. Rescinding guidance designed to help schools help them makes zero sense.Byard added:The administration’s actions today do not and cannot change the well-established legal foundations upon which the federal Title IX guidance is based. Many federal courts have already determined that Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination and the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection extend to transgender individuals. Fairly applied, the law remains on our side.“We all know that Donald Trump is a bully, but his attack on transgender children today is a new low,” said Lambda Legal CEO Rachel B. Tiven. “The U.S. Department of Education’s decision to withdraw guidance clarifying the rights of transgender students endangers the well-being and safety of children across the country. Trump’s actions do not change the law itself – transgender students remain protected by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 – but abandoning the guidance intentionally creates confusion about what federal law requires. The law bars discrimination – the new administration invites it.”Matt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, said:Today’s action hurts thousands of young people and sends the message that President Trump and his administration do not value the well-being of our country’s transgender students. The guidance was aimed at ensuring transgender students – who already face exponentially higher levels of bullying and harassment than their peers – could participate fully and succeed in school just like their non-transgender peers. Although rescinding the guidance has zero impact on Title IX’s legal requirements, it does signal a disdain for the welfare of transgender youth that directly contradicts President Trump’s previous statements that he supports the fair treatment of LGBT Americans. We strongly urge President Trump to consider the people and families impacted by his policy edicts before taking any additional measures that will harm LGBT Americans.A statement by Campus Pride read:Every young person deserves a safe space to go to school. Colleges and universities have no reason to not continue offering safe, equitable public accommodations and transgender inclusive policies. The actions taken today to rescind the Obama administration’s guidance under Title IX is dangerous and sends a wrong message for ensuring safety in our schools. Institutions of higher education must stay the course and continue to do the right thing implementing and supporting actions to protect transgender students.“PFLAG hearts everywhere are with the worried parents who will be kept awake tonight, and the kids who will be scared to go to school in the morning,” said PFLAG National Interim Executive Director Elizabeth Kohm in a statement. “Tomorrow we will fight even harder for the protections that Title IX still affords all transgender youth across the country.”“Leaving the civil rights of our transgender daughter up to the states to decide places my family at the mercy of the state we are assigned,” said Jessica Girven, an AMPA member and mother of a transgender daughter whose Air Force family is scheduled to move back to the states from their duty station in Germany soon. “My husband has dedicated 15 years to his country, and it is the only life we have known as a family. But now, we feel like we are being forced to choose between service to our country and what’s best for our child. No parent should ever have to choose that.”AMPA is urging transgender students facing discrimination to file suit under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, vowed to “do everything I can to move us in that direction despite this reversal.”The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in the historic transgender equality case G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board on March 28. The case is being brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a Virginia transgender boy named Gavin Grimm. Grimm is challenging a policy in his local school district that singles out transgender students for discrimination and prohibits him from using the boys’ restroom at his school. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Gavin last year. It is the first-ever case on transgender rights to go before the Supreme Court."

She heads the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, a charitable foundation named after her husband’s father, the former leader of Azerbaijan.She was elected to the National Assembly of Azerbaijan in 2005, but reportedly attended parliamentary sessions very rarely and seemed uninformed about political issues, according to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy that WikiLeaks uncovered in 2010.The couple married in 1983 and now sit atop a regime that has fielded damning accusations of human rights abuses, muzzling dissent, repression and corruption. Aliyev assumed office in 2003, succeeding his father. The U.S. Embassy cable compared him to a mafia crime boss.Aliyeva’s sudden and controversial ascent to power was possible thanks to a constitutional referendum her husband triggered in September 2016 that expanded his power, extended his term from five to seven years and created the office of the vice president.Many people have noted that Aliyev’s stunning move bears similarity to a plotline in the fourth season of “House of Cards.”Frank Underwood, the show’s fictional U.S. president, is set to run for re-election next season with his wife Claire as his running mate.“Call for for advice on the whole wife-as-vice-president thing,” a Frank Underwood parody account tweeted at Aliyev on Tuesday.A married president-vice president duo is highly unusual, but it’s not unprecedented. Just last year, Nicaragua re-elected President Daniel Ortega while his wife, Rosario Murillo, became vice president.When Aliyev announced his wife’s appointment in the newly-created position of vice president, he gave no information outlining what her responsibilities would entail.

82,THE WORLDPOST,Trump's 'Us vs. Them' Politics Raises Warning Of Global Fallout,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-global-consequences-amnesty-international_us_58ac6973e4b098c5c2a674c9,"Amnesty International sees a dangerous model in his ""poisonous"" rhetoric and policies.",2017-02-22,"Donald Trump's rhetoric exemplifies “a global trend towards angrier and more divisive politics,” warns Amnesty International.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58acc2702900002200f27e6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The humanitarian consequences of President Donald Trump’s “poisonous” rhetoric will be felt far beyond U.S. borders, Amnesty International warned Tuesday.The nonprofit organization released its comprehensive annual report outlining the state of human rights in 159 countries around the world and the growing influence of populist leadership.Trump’s hateful rhetoric exemplifies “a global trend towards angrier and more divisive politics,” the report said. Other prominent watchdogs, including Human Rights Watch, have labeled Trump and other self-proclaimed “anti-establishment” leaders as international threats to human rights.Adotei Akwei, Amnesty’s managing director of government relations, pointed to the Trump administration’s evolving Muslim ban, which was introduced to restrict U.S. entry for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees, and its planned wall on the Mexican border, intended to curb illegal immigration, as clear examples of divisive policies.Beyond the direct effect on residents of the targeted nations, Akwei warned, the ban and wall set dangerous examples and could embolden other governments that have been watching closely.“We believe that Trump’s policies will not only become a model for governments to use, but also, by implementing them, the United States will sort of be giving a blessing or an encouragement that ‘this is acceptable for us, so you guys can get away with it also,’” Akwei told The Huffington Post.Speaking about the Muslim ban, he added, “That kind of exclusionary tactic ― and, in particular, one that uses faith as a criteria ― is something that could really be very scary and replicated in other countries.”Trump’s influence has already spread to Europe, where populism has been on the rise in countries such as France, Britain and Italy. A chief government spokesperson in Hungary said earlier this month that “a change of perspective in the U.S.” vindicated Budapest’s draconian refugee policies.Amnesty’s report details a “toxic, dehumanizing ‘us vs. them’” approach that politicians like Trump have used to divert blame and generate fear to advance their agendas.“I think one of the implications of [Trump’s] ‘America First’ foreign policy is that it will be purely transactional; if you are not with us [the United States], you are against us and there will be consequences,” Akwei said. Even before taking office, Trump received scathing condemnation for cultivating hateful and often false narratives about groups including Muslims, Mexicans and refugees for his political gain.“Divisive fear-mongering has become a dangerous force in world affairs,” Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement released ahead of the report. “Today’s politics of demonization shamelessly peddles a dangerous idea that some people are less human than others, stripping away the humanity of entire groups of people.”Trump’s presidential campaign, “marked by misogyny and xenophobia” as well as blatant pledges to roll back established civil liberties, foreshadowed a government that could be profoundly inimical to human rights, Amnesty warned. His election has also yielded “serious concerns” about U.S. human rights commitments domestically and globally.“This report comes as a reminder that the rest of the world is still out there, and that the world needs the United States to be a force for good,” Akwei said. “Hopefully discussions will be generated about what road the United States should be taking, as opposed to the one that it currently appears to be on.”"

84,POLITICS,Constituents Shame GOP Lawmakers Who Are Ducking Town Hall Meetings,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-lawmakers-trolled_us_58adb261e4b04a0b274ea532,They're putting congressmen's faces on milk cartons and billboards.,2017-02-22,A lost ad for Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) in North Carolina's News & Observer.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58adc5e92900002200f28101.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rather than face angry, frustrated and raucous crowds of constituents at town hall meetings this recess, a large number of GOP lawmakers are skipping face-to-face contact with voters and instead holding conference calls or other more manageable forums (if they do anything at all).But people who want their voices heard are calling their representatives out and shaming them, often in very public ways. Some are simply holding their own town hall events. In Pennsylvania, a group organized by the Pennsylvania Health Access Network held a citizens’ meeting and put an empty suit in place of Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Other constituents are simply showing up at events they know their lawmakers will be attending. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), for example, wasn’t planning to hold any town hall meetings this recess, so hundreds of protesters showed up at the state capitol building on Tuesday, where he was scheduled to give a speech to the legislature.Daines ended up canceling his address at the last minute and rescheduled it for Wednesday.Hundreds of people also turned out at Daines’ office last week to request that he meet with constituents.In western New York, constituents crowdsourced enough money to put up two billboards shaming Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), one of President Donald Trump’s biggest backers in Congress, for not hosting a town hall meeting.Collins recently told local NBC affiliate WGRZ that he never has and never will hold a town hall meeting because he believes they are “useless.”“Because what you get are demonstrators who come and shout you down and heckle you,” Collins said. “They are not what you hope they would be, which is a give and take from people actually interested in getting some facts.”There is now an effort to raise money for a second billboard design based on these comments.“People are not happy with Chris Collins,” Michelle Schoeneman, co-founder of the Facebook group Citizens Against Collins and organizer of the billboard campaign, told The Buffalo News. “People want their voices heard, and he refuses to do that.”In California’s 8th district, frustrated constituents have been putting Rep. Paul Cook’s (R-Calif.) face on milk cartons, saying he’s missing. People are also taking out ads in newspapers saying their senators are lost.The Republican push to repeal the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has been a hot topic at town hall meetings held by GOP members who do face voters. On Wednesday morning, Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) “was laughed at, booed, interrupted, scolded and, a few times, praised” by attendees at his event, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader.Barr heard from multiple people who said they benefited from President Barack Obama’s health care law and from one person who was hurt by it, the paper reported. But Barr said the testimonials hadn’t changed his mind and he was still in favor of repealing the law. “In fact, I mean, I’m reinvigorated to fix this broken health care system,” he told the paper. “I know my constituents who are flooding my office with calls and Obamacare is making life harder for them.” UPDATE: 3:19 p.m. ― A reader sent in a flyer targeted at Rep. Todd Young (R-Ind.) as well. Clarification: This piece was updated to note that Daines rescheduled his address before the legislature for Wednesday.What’s going on in your district? Email us here.

85,POLITICS,Dakota Access Protesters Arrested As Deadline Passes To Depart Camp,"Michael McLaughlin & Josh Morgan, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/time-runs-out-at-main-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-camp_us_58acc6a9e4b04a0b274df548,A few protesters who refused to leave remained at the site Thursday.,2017-02-22,Authorities in North Dakota arrest a man hours after a deadline for Dakota Access Pipeline protesters to leave a camp on Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae1bce2900002200bea5ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CANNON BALL, N.D. ― A few dozen Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have refused to leave a camp they have occupied for months, despite a deadline to evacuate.Between 25 and 50 protesters have refused to leave, according to The Associated Press, but can still avoid arrest if they leave by Thursday.“They will have every opportunity again to leave tomorrow without arrest,” North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) said at a press conference Wednesday.On Wednesday, a group of about 100 officers advanced on a group of protesters who had defied orders from Burgum and the Army Corps of Engineers to depart from Oceti Sakowin camp. Officers made “approximately 10” arrests Wednesday, North Dakota authorities told The Huffington Post.The camp was subdued and mostly empty Thursday morning, with protesters gathering in small groups. Law enforcement officials remained nearby, watching from the surrounding hills.Cleanup of the camp is set to resume Thursday morning, and is expected to cost over $1 million. A 7-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl were taken to a Bismarck hospital with burns from what state authorities said was one of two explosions that occurred Wednesday. Authorities provided no other information about the cause of the blasts or the extent of the minors’ injuries. A mediator working with law enforcement and the protesters had announced that any protester who surrendered would face only a misdemeanor charge. A HuffPost photographer at the campsite saw no one accept the deal.“I came here for this,” said protester Charly Grenau, 33, of Los Angeles, after the deadline passed. “I don’t want to be on the other side if people get hurt today. I’m here to stand with them.”Other protesters beat drums and sang songs as they trudged along a highway and over a bridge on their way to a charter bus that would take some of them home.The Army Corps and Burgum said health and safety risks necessitated shutting down the camp. Melting snows could flood the area and contaminate nearby rivers if debris and human waste at the camp aren’t hauled away, the officials said.On Wednesday morning, a few hundred protesters remained and there were still many tattered tents and other structures standing around the muddy, waterlogged camp. Some fires had been set to destroy yurts and other abandoned dwellings while a mixture of rain and snow fell. Piles of trash and dumpsters were scattered throughout the site earlier in the day, as the remaining protesters, also known as water protectors, hurried to meet the deadline. The Army Corps denied requests to extend the deadline, according to the Indigenous Environmental Network. At its height in December, the camp on federal land near the Missouri River bustled with the presence of thousands of Native Americans, military veterans and other environmental activists resisting the construction of an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux’s reservation. The tribe has argued that the 1,172-mile oil pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois violates their territorial rights from an 1851 treaty and that federal authorities failed to properly examine the pipeline’s environmental risks.Images showing clashes with law enforcement and pipeline security workers motivated thousands of Americans to support the tribe by donating money or joining Oceti Sakowin and the other water protector camps. It also provided a model for environmental protests that essentially went viral as camps sprang up to halt pipelines in Texas, Florida and other spots around the country.“The camp was the light in the middle of the dark,” said Indigenous Environmental Network organizer Dallas Goldtooth. “It was the fire that fueled so many fights across the country,”Law enforcement officials had complained of the strain on resources from the extended protests. The state National Guard had deployed 1,421 members ― at a cost of over $8.75 million ― to support the Morton County sheriff’s department and police in Bismarck, where protests have taken place.Former President Barack Obama’s administration handed the Standing Rock Sioux a momentary victory in December when the Army announced it would not allow the developer to build the pipeline near the tribe’s reservation. Following the Army’s decision, people began leaving the camp in droves. The Sioux officials also asked them to leave in January as the tribe shifted its strategy from the campsite to the courthouse and concerns arose about how protesters would endure a harsh winter on the Great Plains.The tribe stood by that approach in recent weeks as the Army Corps, under President Donald Trump, reversed course and issued a permit allowing Energy Transfer Partners to build near the Sioux’s water source. Construction is nearly complete. Energy Transfer Partners said in court filings this week that oil could begin flowing as soon as March 6, ABC News reported.Before Trump gave the upper hand to the pipeline company, many people went home, though smaller numbers relocated to other camps. They left behind hundreds of tents and other structures and an allegedly hazardous amount of human waste.A cleanup began weeks ago. More than 230 truckloads of garbage had been hauled away as of Monday, according to The Associated Press.Afnan Khan, 21, arrived four days ago from Montreal with friends to help clean the campsite.“I think this movement helped people feel empowered to take back control and to continue this fight in their communities,” Khan told HuffPost Wednesday.Officials from several North Dakota state departments announced that they had established a travel center providing bus fare, water, snacks and health assessment to protesters heading home. Some protesters were unhappy to leave and believed the claims about flooding and unsanitary conditions were overstated. Lewis Grassrope, 39, had been at Oceti Sakowin since August, but returned to his home on the Lower Brule Sioux reservation in South Dakota days ago. He worried that authorities would damage his tent and other property if he waited for the deadline to pass. He marveled at the collaborative decision-making process in the camp and thought that it had been run well, with huge kitchens, security, a medical clinic and other services.“It was freedom for everyone who came here and freedom from the way we lived our everyday lives at home,” Grassrope said. “People have been portraying it as an ecological disaster, but it’s still a beautiful place.”Photographer Josh Morgan contributed reporting from North Dakota."

87,WEIRD NEWS,Musician Accused Of Getting Onstage Enema During Cancer Benefit,David Moye,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-clemmons-onstage-enema_us_58adc353e4b03d80af7147a2,"The enema artist insists it was protein shake, not poop that covered the stage.",2017-02-22,Houston musician Michael Clemmons is accused of getting an enema onstage during a performance and defecating on the stage. He says it was protein shake.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58add850280000db9899a8fe.png?cache=MFb5EgE117&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Houston musician is under fire for reportedly giving himself an enema during a performance and then emptying his bowels onstage.However, the artist tells The Huffington Post that’s a bunch of crap. He admits to getting an enema, but says the material that spewed on the stage was just a protein shake in a leaky bag.The scatological scandal took place Friday at Avant Garden during a cancer benefit for a local artist. One of the bands scheduled to perform was Sonic Rabbit Hole, a two-piece noise rock act that includes elements of performance art.Singer Michael Clemmons said he and his partner, who has not been identified, decided an onstage enema would be the perfect statement against the venue, where they’ve had issues in the past.“It didn’t have anything to do with the person with cancer,” Clemmons told HuffPost. “It was a statement to the venue that ‘You’re not avant-garde.’”During the performance, Clemmons took a bag filled with the protein shake, pulled down his pants and, with the help of his bandmate, administered it into his nether regions.“We’re were going to do an endurance piece,” he explained. “I’d have the enema, do some light calisthenics and see how long I’d last before I had to go and then run to the bathroom.”Alas, both the bag and hose leaked, causing the contents to spill out onto the stage before it could go into Clemmons’ keister.But Avant Garden owner Mariana Lemesoff tells a different story: It was poop that covered her stage, not protein shake.“My bartender was throwing up behind the bar,” she told HuffPost. “Plus, it was indecent exposure. They made performance art look bad.”Lemesoff went into more detail for local station KPRC.“It was disgusting, it was a health hazard,” she said. “Everybody at that point was really shocked and then he proceeded to defecate on the stage and splatter feces everywhere.”Lemesoff said her staff spent hours cleaning up after Clemmons, and says there was fecal matter covering the bathroom floor and splattered against the wall.“My staff stayed and cleaned up their disgusting mess until four in the morning,” she told the Houston Press. Clemmons said he did evacuate himself in the bathroom, but made sure to flush afterwards.He also says he planned to clean up any mess, but didn’t get the chance because the owner was angry.“My art is about ‘what can you get away with and why?’” he said. “I don’t know how to spin it the right way, but I do my art and I don’t compromise.”To demonstrate his art, Clemmons provided this video to Huffington Post of an earlier performance. Hint: He’s the one in the cage.Meanwhile, Friday’s incident is raising such a stink in Houston that Clemmons is calling himself “one of the most loved and hated people in America,” a statement that seems a teensy-weensy bit hyperbolic.“Some people want to sign me because of it,” he said.Lemesoff told KTRK TV that the performance was an act of vandalism that “conveyed no artistic expression, and was particularly inappropriate for a charity event.She said the venue was forced to close, which meant the fundraiser didn’t make as much money as intended.A GoFundMe account has been set up to make up those funds and has raised $1,285 towards a goal of $100,000.Clemmons believes his “pooformance” actually helped raise more money for the charity than anyone expected, since the original goal of the event was $1,000.Lemesoff confirmed the $1,000 goal to HuffPost and says the GoFundMe page has raised more than that, but said people lost money in tips, sales of painting at the onsite art gallery and time in cleaning up the mess.Despite his newfound notoriety, Clemmons plans to bag similar performances.“I’m not a one-trick-pony,” he said. “You’ll never see Michael Clemmons with an enema bag again.”"

She named the effort Project Unicorn “because unicorns are awesome and sparkly,” Jordan’s mom Jen told The Huffington Post.On Feb. 10, Jordan appeared on “The Rachael Ray Show” and presented her glitter-shooting arm, which is shaped like a unicorn horn, to judges from “Shark Tank.”The Sharks loved the Missouri preteen’s invention. “Jordan, you are a superhero,” Mark Cuban told her.“I know some parents that would hate that and some kids that would love it!” added Daymond John.Indeed, Jordan’s mom is not a huge fan of glitter, but she’s come around to it and of course supports her daughter’s work wholeheartedly.“Jordan is a high-energy ball of girl power,” Jen told HuffPost. “She’s confident and has really grown into her own person this past year. Someone on Twitter said Jordan is a combination of Disney Princess and Ironman. I think that is very true.”The mom added, “Jordan’s overall attitude is: ‘Yeah, I’m different. So what?’ We are all different.

Together, they brought Jordan’s vision to life. They continue to have meetings via Google Hangouts to work on new iterations of the design.In addition to the unicorn horn that shoots glitter, Jordan is working on other prosthetic arm projects. “Since learning to work with 3D CAD programs, Jordan is working on a solution to those pesky two-handed paper towel dispensers in public bathrooms, and she’s worked with her prosthetist on a more traditional arm that can use different 3D hands,” Jen said.“I think Jordan plans to keep learning design and finding ways to have fun and do good with it,” she added. “I know she also really loves helping others learn. It’s possible she has a future as a designer and design teacher.”Jordan and her mom want to make sure other kids with physical differences have the opportunity to develop solutions. They are planning to launch a nonprofit to help more kids learn design and access the technology needed to create things that are “fun or helpful ― or both!” said Jen.“I hope Jordan’s experience growing up and taking ownership of her differences helps encourage everyone to know a physical difference isn’t the end of a world,” the mom explained. “Jordan and her designs can encourage us all to take advantage of what makes us different and see the world with a new perspective. We can all build new concepts. We can all design something that makes our lives a little brighter or a little easier.”"

90,POLITICS,You No Longer Need A License To Carry A Concealed Weapon In New Hampshire,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-hampshire-concealed-carry_us_58add620e4b03d80af7193e3,The state's licensing requirement had been in place for nearly a century.,2017-02-22,1981: The Attempted Assassination Of President Ronald Reagan,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a8abe1200002d00ad7981.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"New Hampshire residents no longer need any kind of license to carry a concealed handgun after the state repealed a nearly century-old law that allowed police to deny concealed carry licenses to people they believed could pose a risk to others.New Hampshire already permitted open carry, but local law enforcement long had discretion to deny individuals a license to carry a concealed weapon. The system, in place for 94 years, let police prevent people who they knew had a violent history from getting license.On Wednesday, Gov. Chris Sununu (R) signed a law that simply allows residents to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Similar legislation had been twice vetoed by former Gov. Maggie Hassan (D).“SB12 ensures New Hampshire citizens are guaranteed the fundamental right to carry a firearm in defense of themselves and their families, as prescribed by Article 2a of our state constitution,” Sununu said in a statement. “This common sense legislation aligns our concealed carry laws with that of our neighboring states of Vermont and Maine and states across the country. This is about safety. This is about making sure that the laws on our books are keeping people safe while remaining true to the Live Free or Die spirit that makes New Hampshire the great state that it is. This is a commitment I made to the people of New Hampshire and I am proud today to fulfill that commitment, signing SB12 into law.”Law enforcement groups across the Granite State had spoken out against the measure. Pat Sullivan, executive director of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, told The Huffington Post last month that the law already in place once allowed him to deny a concealed carry license to a man who came to his station in a tinfoil hat. Under the new law, that man won’t need to get a license to carry a concealed weapon.“There are many people that carry concealed weapons that are doing good, that aren’t doing bad things. However, there is an element that we deal with as law enforcement, in terms of a regular basis, that are no good,” Sullivan said. “They are committing crimes, violent crimes, and we don’t know whether or not they do or do not have a weapon on them. With the permits, you at least have an idea as to whether or not they have a legal weapon on them. You encounter someone roadside, you don’t know what you have. It kind of just gives that little bit of added security and safety.”Deidre Reynolds, a volunteer with the New Hampshire chapter of the gun safety group Moms Demand Action, said the measure would make the state less safe.“Shame on you, Governor Sununu. By signing SB 12 into law, you have made Granite Staters less safe. You and the state lawmakers who rushed this through are compromising public safety standards and making it easier for dangerous people to carry hidden, loaded weapons in public. In doing so, you have put politics over public safety, kowtowing to the extreme agenda of the national gun lobby,” she said in a statement. “Local law enforcement agencies now no longer have the ability to deny permits to potentially dangerous people.”New Hampshire becomes the 12th state where it’s legal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Similar legislation to roll back licensing requirements is pending in Texas, Kentucky, Utah and North Dakota. "
91,POLITICS,This GOP Congresswoman Sure Got An Easy First Question At Her Tele-Town Hall,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barbara-comstock-townhall-question_us_58adec9ae4b057efdce88931,Some Republican lawmakers are skipping constituent events altogether to avoid grilling over Trump's agenda.,2017-02-22,"Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock's constituents have questions for her about Obamacare. Some have been tough -- others, not so much.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ae09392900002200bea55f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) held a telephone town hall for her constituents on Tuesday ― and boy, was the first question more of a softball than Republican lawmakers tend to field these days.A caller introduced as Dr. Gary Maloney simply wanted confirmation that Republicans like Comstock have no intention of doing away with the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.“There seems to be a lot of noise about changes that are being yelled about, but really isn’t it true that there’s not a big movement, even among Republicans, to change things like pre-existing conditions and that sort of thing, that in fact, it is probably going to go in a different direction, as far as the likely final bill that’s going to emerge?” the caller asked.“Well, in fact, you’re right on ― thank you, Gary ― particularly on the pre-existing conditions issue,” Comstock responded. “When Republicans had passed a repeal and replace bill in the last Congress, we protected people with pre-existing conditions in that bill. And that is a principle and a commitment that we are going to continue to make. That’s a promise that’s in all of our working documents, that’s what [Health] Secretary [Tom] Price has made clear, and the administration has, and our leadership has.”“So that’s something there is bipartisan agreement on,” she added. “So for those who keep saying that that’s not the case, I would just ask, please take ‘yes’ for an answer.”The problem Republicans like Comstock face ― and that she didn’t address at the time ― is that there is virtually no way to maintain coverage and reduce costs without preserving the individual mandate and continuing income-based subsidies for individuals to buy private insurance on the exchanges. Those are the same features of the law that Republicans most oppose.It is also unclear how private insurers would distribute the cost of covering people with pre-existing conditions if Americans were no longer required to purchase insurance.Listen to the exchange with Maloney below:Gary Maloney is the name of a veteran Republican political consultant who donated $350 to Comstock’s 2016 re-election campaign. His Northern Virginia consulting firm, Jackson-Alvarez, took in over $250,000 from advising Republican candidates and groups in the 2016 cycle, although Comstock’s campaign was not one of their clients.A biography on the website of the Leadership Institute, a conservative group for which this Maloney was once a guest speaker, indicates that he has a Ph.D. in politics from the University of Oxford but not a medical degree. When The Huffington Post called Jackson-Alvarez to inquire about the town hall call, the man who picked up said, “not interested” and hung up. Comstock’s staff did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the identity of the caller.Comstock is one of several Republicans for whom outrage over President Donald Trump and the Republican agenda could prove a political liability in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats tried mightily last year to unseat Comstock, who represents a swing district that includes many Democratic-leaning suburbs of Washington, D.C. She ultimately won by nearly 6 percentage points. Comstock did not show up to two scheduled in-person constituent meetings earlier this month, angering some of the more liberal residents of her district. Her office did not respond to a request for information on her next in-person town hall. Just 19 Republican members of Congress scheduled traditional town hall meetings for the congressional recess this week, according to Town Hall Project, a site that publicizes information about the meetings.The decision not to hold the public events or conduct them by phone comes amid a wave of activists using town halls to aggressively confront members, particularly over their plans to replace Obamacare and investigate Trump’s ties to Russia. Indeed, the two questions Comstock got immediately after Maloney’s query were about these two issues.A caller who identified herself as Amy said she was a small business owner who wanted to know why Comstock wanted to repeal, rather than fix, the Affordable Care Act.“Every major bill has to have a couple of changes. Why do you think we need to just scrap it and not keep what we have?” Amy asked.Comstock emphasized that she was most interested in repealing aspects of Obamacare that are unpopular among members of both parties, like the tax on so-called “Cadillac” health care plans and the medical device tax.She suggested those features of the law could be stripped without limiting people’s access to affordable health insurance plans.“We want to actually increase those plans for small businesses, have, you know, more risk pooling, buying across state lines, making it easier for small businesses to maybe get lower deductible plans or at least have the flexibility of that,” Comstock said. “That’s why we are carefully working on this and transitioning to a new system, get that up and running, but protect people and talk to people.”Suggesting that consumers should be allowed to buy insurance in states other than where they live is a common Republican proposal. But it would likely to lead to a race to the bottom among states, leaving sicker people especially vulnerable. And it is so impractical, even insurers are not clamoring for it.Neither the White House nor Republican leaders in Congress have proposed a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare. Both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced last week that they would unveil a proposal in March.Listen to Comstock’s entire town hall below:"
