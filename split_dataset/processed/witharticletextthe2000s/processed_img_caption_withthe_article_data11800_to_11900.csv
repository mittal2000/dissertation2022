0,POLITICS,GOP Quietly Tanks Effort To Include Women In The Draft,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-military-draft_us_583e10c4e4b04fcaa4d598f8,"It had bipartisan support, but some Republicans just didn't like the idea of sending daughters into war.",2016-11-30,Women like Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver are already training to serve in combat. But some Republicans don’t think it’s right to draft women into fighting for their country.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583e37cc1700002600e7cec3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A surprisingly strong and bipartisan effort to require women to register for the draft failed Tuesday, as negotiators on a defense bill indicated the provision would not be included in the final legislation.The language had been tucked into the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act, which overwhelmingly passed that chamber in June. The provision also cleared a House committee, but GOP leaders later scrambled to remove it from their version of the NDAA before it reached the floor, as some in their party protested. That left its fate up in the air for months as negotiators worked behind closed doors to hammer out a final bill.Top aides from armed services committees told reporters in a Tuesday briefing that the proposal was ultimately axed and, in its place, there will be the legislative equivalent of sending a policy idea to its grave: commissioning a study.“We still require the study,” said one senior aide. “There’s a study and a commission to look at selective service and look at the structure and what it does and everything like that.”Lawmakers who had been pushing for months to include women in the draft acknowledged it would have little practice impact, at least anytime soon; the United States has relied on an all-volunteer military force for decades. But many felt it was important to do anyway, to reflect the growing consensus that women are as capable of serving and leading in the military as men.“There should not be one standard of what you have to be capable of to do certain jobs in the military ― one for men and one for women,” Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) told The Huffington Post earlier this year. “But as long as we’re vigilant about that, women are just going to make us better.”“I don’t think you want to take half your population off the sidelines in case of a national emergency,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who served in the Air Force for years, also said at the time.The Obama administration already lifted the ban on women in serving combat units in 2015. Since then, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff endorsed expanding the draft to women, and the Congressional Budget Office found that doing so would actually reduce federal spending.In the end, though, conservatives in Congress won this round, with their complaints about having to see women sent into combat.“I cannot in good conscience vote to draft our daughters into the military, sending them off to war and forcing them into combat,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said earlier this year. “I will continue my efforts to speak out against the effort to force America’s daughters into combat.”"

(He does not plan to attend the prize-giving ceremonies.) The others represent a reminder of how being open to the world has allowed the U.S. to excel.At an event at the Embassy of Sweden on Wednesday, four of the laureates talked to The Huffington Post about the anti-immigration rhetoric that became so prevalent during the divisive campaign of President-elect Donald Trump.Each of the four became American citizens after coming to the U.S. from the United Kingdom to advance their studies. As white men from an English-speaking country, they acknowledged that they aren’t being targeted by the current xenophobic rhetoric. Still, they said they could draw parallels between what they’re seeing in the U.S. and what they have seen elsewhere in the world — and recognize that such talk could deter future talent from heading stateside.“If people had been unfriendly toward us because we were not originally from this country, I suppose we wouldn’t have stayed here,” said F. Duncan Haldane, who won the Nobel Prize in physics. “You certainly wouldn’t want to go to a country if people were hostile to you.”“No, we wouldn’t have come,” said J. Michael Kosterlitz, a joint recipient of the physics award. Oliver Hart, who won the prize in economic sciences and has lived in the U.S. for about 45 years, said he is disturbed by the racist and xenophobic attitudes he has seen many Americans express in the last two years. “I always thought of America as much better than that,” he said, reflecting on his early years in the U.K. “I think if you’re a young person who wanted to make their way … America is still probably the place. But that could change. Depending on where you’re from, you might decide that there are just too many negatives.”Both Hart and Sir J. Fraser Stoddart, a recipient of the Nobel Prize in chemistry, compared Americans electing Trump to U.K. citizens approving the so-called Brexit referendum in June.In the referendum, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. It was a complicated issue, but many residents indicated that their votes were driven at least in part by anti-immigrant sentiment. Britons experienced a rise in nationalism as the global refugee crisis raged. Many feared that foreigners coming into their country would threaten their safety and culture, and they no longer wanted the whole of Europe to make decisions on their behalf.“This depresses me a lot,” Stoddart said. “It’s not just an American phenomenon. We witnessed the same expression of xenophobia earlier this year [with Brexit]. I’m nervous about what lies ahead, as I think many American citizens are. We just don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, and that’s scary. It shouldn’t be this way.”But Stoddart, who teaches and mentors students at Northwestern University, said he thinks there is reason to be hopeful that Americans will come out stronger than before.“This is the signal for someone to set the ‘reset’ button and see the country rise again,” he said. “I’m still optimistic that, out of what we’ve experienced of late and what we might have to experience in the immediate future, there will be a good situation — maybe even better than we could ever imagine.”"

5,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Transportation Secretary Pick Would Inherit Crumbling Roads And Robotic Cars,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elaine-chao-transportation_us_583f239fe4b0c68e047e5108,Elaine Chao has her work cut out for her.,2016-11-30,"A Google employee stands next to a prototype of the company's self-driving vehicle during a media preview in Mountain View, California, on Sept. 29, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583f255c1a00002500cca824.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Roads, bridges and tunnels across the United States are in disrepair. Tech giants are already rolling out self-driving vehicles in cities, sending regulators and insurance companies scrambling to write new rules. Ride-hailing apps are reshaping how passengers get around and how drivers are paid to shuttle them there. Elaine Chao, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for transportation secretary, has her work cut out for her. But her biggest challenge may be finding the money to do it all.“If transportation becomes a priority in the Trump administration and they want to put together a big, bold bill and a big, bold plan, they will need money to fund it,” Ray LaHood, who served as President Barack Obama’s transportation secretary from 2009 to 2013, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday. “It’s one thing to have a big vision, it’s another to have a pretty big vision for how to fund it. The funding has always been the issue.”Already, Trump’s $1 trillion proposed infrastructure plan ― panned by critics like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as a corporate welfare scam ― may not be enough to cover all the critical projects awaiting funding, according to new estimates by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The cost of fixing all the roads, bridges, public transit, railroads, energy systems, schools, public parks, ports, airports, dams and other facilities is likely closer to $3.6 trillion.And that’s just the maintenance backlog.Chao, who served as labor secretary under President George W. Bush and deputy transportation secretary under President George H.W. Bush, will take office amid one of the fastest-paced transformations of the transportation industry in almost a century. Apple, Google, Uber, Tesla, General Motors and a bevy of other tech giants and automakers are producing autonomous driving systems. For years, Google has been testing its bug-like cars around its Mountain View, California, headquarters. In August, Uber began putting driverless SUVs on the road in Pittsburgh. In October, Tesla vowed to send a car from Los Angeles to New York’s Times Square without ever having a driver touch the wheel. But unless regulations suddenly allow cars to drive themselves with no supervision, there will still be a person capable of driving in the car. That’s because transportation officials have been slow to hand down rules on self-driving technology, which is limited in scope and restricted to highways in a handful of states. Chao now inherits that responsibility.“Autonomous vehicles are coming to America,” LaHood said. “And the Department of Transportation is smack-dab in the middle of rules and regulations around that.”Like her predecessors in the Obama administration, Chao seems unlikely to put major restrictions on ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. Last November, she made a speech supporting the business model pioneered by so-called “gig economy” services that classify workers as contractors instead of employees, skirting laws that would require them to provide certain employee benefits.“Literally millions of people today participate in the digitally-enabled, peer-to-peer economy,” Chao said. “Despite its attraction for workers, however, some suggest the sharing economy is not a 21st century construct at all, but a new version of the 19th century ‘piece work’ economy. This ignores some basic realities, including who is working in the new economy, what type of work they are performing, and why.”On Tuesday, Uber and Lyft ― the two biggest ride-hailing startups in the United States ― returned the favor. Uber, the $68 billion titan, applauded her “depth of knowledge on transportation issues.” Lyft, the industry’s struggling runner-up, congratulated Chao’s nomination and said it looked “forward to working with her on an array of transportation issues.”“There has been a lot of concern in Silicon Valley that, outside of tax policy, the Trump Administration will be hostile to disruptive technology companies,” Dan Primack, a former top columnist at Fortune who is launching a new media startup, wrote in a post on the self-publishing platform Medium. “At least for those in the transportation sector, those fears may have just been allayed.”Chao may have less influence over the future of electric cars. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a Department of Transportation agency, handed down new rules this month requiring hybrid or electric vehicles ― which lack the rumbling noise of a combustion engine ― to have sound alerts so pedestrians can hear them approaching. The transportation secretary is unlikely to weigh in on electric cars unless gas prices are significantly higher than they are now, according to LaHood.Still, Chao’s record on supporting the fossil fuel industry has drawn scorn from environmental groups. During her two-term tenure as labor secretary from 2001 to 2009, Chao gutted funding for coal mine safety regulations. Last year, she resigned from the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies after the foundation ramped up its campaign to end the use of coal, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels. Chao’s husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), represents Kentucky, a major coal-producing state, and has blamed regulations for shrinking the industry.“Avoiding the worst impacts of climate change will require a radical reshaping of our transportation system to move us away from fossil fuels,” Ben Schreiber, climate and energy program director at the nonprofit Friends of the Earth International, said in a statement. “She is the wrong choice to lead the transition to a green energy economy that will provide lasting jobs and protect the planet.” Trump, for his part, has repeatedly called climate change “a hoax,” threatened to pull out of the historic Paris climate accord and vowed to scrap the Clean Power Plan, Obama’s top tool for reducing carbon emissions. The president-elect’s transition team is stacked with oil and gas executives and climate science deniers, including Myron Ebell, who is overseeing the incoming leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency.Chao, widely praised as one of Trump’s most competent choices so far, doesn’t provide much reassurance on that issue.“Trump’s pick for transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, would be wise to convince her potential new boss that urgent action on climate change and innovation of public transit will protect American lives,” said Cassady Craighill, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace USA, before referencing Chao’s most recent post at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “Chao’s connection to institutions that manufacture climate denial, like the Heritage Foundation, requires the public demand she prioritize both public health and the impacts of climate change when managing our transportation infrastructure.”Trump’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

(Police are unsure if the third shooting is related.)Ten months earlier, Godfrey spoke out at a town hall hosted by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), where he expressed frustration at the scourge of guns in his community and the tremendous toll they’ve taken.“In 2015, I lost about eight friends to guns,” he told the crowd. “That was probably the worst year of my life.”As he continued, Godfrey recalled an additional two friends who had been shot in the face but survived, and the anguish of his mother after his own brother was also shot. Speaking of the five friends he had who were killed before the age of 18, Godfrey broke down and couldn’t continue. “It shouldn’t even be like that,” he said later. “Especially when our kind can’t grow up to see the age of 21. We can’t even see what it feels like to be grown.”Later in the forum, moderator Lateefah Simon noted that Godfrey had wondered aloud to her why “it’s easier to get a gun in Oakland as a child than to get a laptop.”In a Facebook post Tuesday remembering Godfrey, Lee expressed condolences for the teenager’s family and criticized Congress’ inaction on common sense gun reform, calling it a “disgrace.”“Treyvon lost his life to the senseless violence he was working to prevent,” she said.Monday’s three homicides bring the total number investigated by Oakland Police this year up to 75, notes the East Bay Times."

8,POLITICS,Top Congressional Watchdog Uninterested In Trump's Conflicts Of Interest Before He Takes Office,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chaffetz-trump-conflicts-of-interest_us_583e27b0e4b0ae0e7cdac310,"Rep. Jason Chaffetz wants to give Trump ""some time.""",2016-11-30,"Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House oversight committee, doesn't think now's the time to look into the conflicts of interest presented by the business empire of President-elect Donald Trump. ""He's not a federal employee yet,"" he said. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583e44791a00000b03cca61a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump’s election to the presidency has raised serious questions about a web of potential conflicts of interest. Democrats are already calling for congressional probes. But there’s one Republican who seems unconcerned: House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah).Chaffetz told The Huffington Post Tuesday night that Trump hadn’t even been sworn in yet. “So give him some time to organize, get their staff and their counsel all situated,” he said.Chaffetz added: “It’s sort of ridiculous to go after him when his financial disclosure is already online.”That financial disclosure, which Trump himself has said is inadequate in evaluating his wealth, offers broad ranges for a politician’s assets, and allows Trump to roughly approximate his net worth, which he pegs at more than $10 billion. (Forbes says it’s closer to $3.7 billion.)The real issue, however, isn’t what Trump is worth. It’s the businesses that come in contact with the government and can be used by foreign governments to influence him.Take, for instance, Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. Foreign diplomats are already saying they’ll book rooms in order to curry favor with the incoming president, and, perhaps more troublingly, Trump is about to violate the lease for the hotel, which is in the historic Old Post Office. The lease states that no elected official “shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”As soon as Trump takes office on Jan. 20, he will be in violation of that agreement, but the agency tasked with enforcing the lease, the General Services Administration, will report to Trump. He’ll even appoint the next administrator of the GSA.When HuffPost raised this conflict of interest with Chaffetz on Tuesday night, he shrugged it off as nothing out of the ordinary.“I think that’s true of every president,” Chaffetz said. “That’s not a unique situation.”When HuffPost disagreed ― again, presidents are not normally renting out government properties ― Chaffetz doubled down. “Yes, because what you find is that most presidents, including, and I think Vice President Biden, gets a check from the Secret Service,” Chaffetz said.“Joe Biden and others,” he continued, trailing off. “So we’ll examine those issues. We’ll be vigorous in our oversight.”Chaffetz seems to be referring to payments from the Secret Service when agents are housed on the property of their protectees, and Chaffetz seems to believe those contracts are precedent for Trump’s arrangement with his hotel in Washington.The ranking Democrat on the oversight committee, Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), totally disagrees.“They’re clearly unprecedented,” Cummings told HuffPost Tuesday night. “I’m really trying to help Trump avoid a phenomenal minefield.”Cummings said he had asked Chaffetz for an investigation into Trump’s conflicts of interest because the president-elect should “clear up” these situations before he takes office. “The Trump Hotel at the Post Office is a perfect example,” Cummings said.Presented with Chaffetz’s comment that the Trump Hotel issue was akin to the Secret Service paying rent, Cummings just shook his head.“He’s operating 111 companies in 18 countries,” he said. “Come on!”Trump also owes a foreign bank over $300 million, and construction on one of his foreign properties might have been expedited after he talked with the president of that nation. Cummings did say he thought the pressure for Chaffetz to investigate Trump would become untenable, and that the committee would eventually hold a hearing.That would be consistent with Chaffetz’s own statements, in fact.When HuffPost suggested that he seemed unconcerned, Chaffetz disagreed. “I said we’re going to look into them. He’s not a federal employee yet, so,” Chaffetz said.Asked what “look into” these issues meant ― a hearing, a formal probe? ― Chaffetz said that wasn’t “defined yet.”“We’ll see what the issues are,” he said."
9,POLITICS,Trump Claims He's Leaving His Company 'In Total' -- But Doesn't Provide Any Details,Alexander C. Kaufman and Paige Lavender,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-business_us_583ed744e4b04fcaa4d5d3a3,"""The Presidency is a far more important task!”",2016-11-30,"President-elect Donald Trump may turn over his business to his children, which presents conflicts of interest in and of themselves. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583ee1391a00002500cca6e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he’s leaving his business “in total,” but provided no details about who would take over.“While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses. ... Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!” Trump said in a series of tweets posted Wednesday morning.Trump said he would hold a news conference with his children on Dec. 15 to discuss the move away from his business.It’s unclear whether he intends to turn daily control of the Trump Organization over to his three oldest children ― Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric ― to run the privately owned conglomerate, or set up a blind trust. In a blind trust, the owner of a business relinquishes management of the company’s assets to an independent party to avoid conflicts of interest in public office.Trump’s lawyer said this month that the three adult children would control the blind trust. But then the president-elect enlisted all three to serve on his presidential transition team’s executive committee. Ivanka, widely seen as one of Trump’s closest surrogates, sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and on a call with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, casting doubt over the blindness of any trust led by the 35-year-old. Transition team spokesman Sean Spicer said working through the details is taking time, but that Trump is keeping his promise of devoting his full attention to the presidency. “He’s always been very clear that he was going to turn over the business to his adult children to run the family business, and that transition is what’s occurring right now,” Spicer said. But when asked whether Trump intended to divest himself of ownership of his various properties or merely managerial control, Spicer said the president-elect would provide that information next month.“Mr. Trump will walk through the details on the 15th of December. So stay tuned,” Spicer said.What Trump should do is appoint a truly independent trustee to sell his business and manage the trust while he is in office, periodically reporting only the value of the company’s assets, according to an op-ed by two former chief White House ethics lawyers under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama.“A blind trust is defined by federal law as one in which a federal official selects an independent trustee (with no familial ties) who sells the official’s known assets and purchases investments unknown to the official,” Richard Painter and Norman Eisen wrote. “That is what makes it blind.”The nature of the Trump Organization’s business also makes it difficult to eliminate conflicts of interest in the White House. The company is largely a real estate and licensing company, with an empire of properties across the United States and a portfolio of buildings around the world that pay to brandish the Trump name. Trump’s companies operate in at least 20 countries, according to a hefty New York Times analysis published on Nov. 26.That makes it harder to erase conflicts of interest, or at least the perception of them. Trump may not oversee the day-to-day activities of his company, but a local official eager to curry favor with the White House could easily identify a Trump property to lodge in, host events at or fast-track for development.It’s already happening. Three days after Trump received a congratulatory call from Macri, a long-stalled tower in Buenos Aires got the green light from city officials. Both Trump and Macri denied reports that the incoming president asked for help clearing the permits to build the office tower. But it’s hard not to be skeptical. On a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Trump touted his Turkish business partner as “a close friend” and passed on remarks that he is “your great admirer,” as The Huffington Post reported last week. The Embassy of Bahrain on Tuesday said it plans to host its annual National Day celebration at the newly opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., next month. The hotel became a flashpoint of the president-elect’s conflicts of interest when it suggested this month that foreign officials should stay there during official trips to help their relationship with the White House.Trump’s business interests represent an unprecedented web of conflicts of interest, particularly when compared to his predecessor. Obama’s assets, worth between $2 million and $7 million, are mostly tied up in Treasury bills and index funds. He and first lady Michelle Obama are still paying off a 30-year mortgage on their home in Chicago. S.V. Date contributed to this report.

11,POLITICS,Congress Is About To Pass A Bill That Shows D.C. At Its Worst -- It May Also Turn Around The Opioid Crisis And Cure Cancer,"Sam Stein, Ryan Grim, and Matt Fuller",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/congress-21st-century-cures_us_583e3d98e4b0ae0e7cdaca32,The 21st Century Cures Act has some incredible upsides to go along with a shady underbelly. There's a reason lawmakers both love and hate it.,2016-11-30,Vice President Joe Biden with Collins discussing the Cancer Moonshot initiative.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583e40081700002600e7cecd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In 1996, Purdue Pharma introduced a new painkiller it said carried a low risk of abuse or addiction. It called the drug “OxyContin.”In reality, of course, OxyContin was extremely addictive — and Purdue knew it. A decade later, three Purdue executives, and the company itself, pleaded guilty to criminal charges tied to OxyContin’s marketing and agreed to pay more than $600 million in fines. But the executives dodged prison time, and the prosecution did little to slow the rise of opioid use. The pharmaceutical industry had spent the past 10 years and billions of dollars pushing the medical community to ramp up the use of OxyContin and other opioids. By 2013, the number of annual opioid prescriptions, including short term and multiple, had nearly tripled, topping 200 million — in a country of just over 300 million people. Use of OxyContin and other opioids grew to crisis levels. As federal and state governments cracked down on doctors who dispensed pills and prescriptions indiscriminately, users turned to heroin instead: Four out of five new heroin users started out by abusing prescription painkillers. The results have devastated and overwhelmed first responders and an ill-equipped and ideologically hidebound treatment system. From 2010 to 2012, heroin overdose rates doubled in 28 states, according to a 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. In 2014, more than 28,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses, an all-time high, according to the agency. There’s no reason to think the death rate has slowed since then.Congress, however, has finally done something. On Nov. 30, the House approved the 21st Century Cures Act by an overwhelming 392-26 vote. This Wednesday, with a 94-5 vote, the Senate did the same, sending the bill to President Barack Obama’s desk for his signature. The bill commits billions of dollars to medical research while sending $1 billion to states to help combat heroin and painkiller addiction and assist with recovery.But there’s a complication: Instead of cracking down on the pharmaceutical companies that fueled the boom in opioid abuse, lawmakers rewarded the industry. No health care-related bill of this size could move through Congress without the support of Big Pharma. The authors of the 21st Century Cures Act earned the industry’s support by including regulatory rollbacks that drugmakers have long sought and creating cheaper and quicker paths for drug approval by reducing safeguards. It’s as if the fire department had to pay off the arsonist to get permission to put out a fire.Lawmakers were left with a Hobson’s choice. The bill would make billions of dollars available for medical research. It would fund lofty goals, such as precision medicine, a White House initiative to map the human brain and Vice President Joe Biden’s “Cancer Moonshot.” It would save lives. But it would also undermine regulations that patient advocacy groups say are essential for making sure medical and drug research is conducted ethically and safely — meaning it could cost lives, too.Some politicians thought the choice was clear. On Nov. 28, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) denounced the measure in aggressive terms, calling it the result of “corruption” — fighting words on the Senate floor — and singling out Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for taking millions from a donor with an interest in the bill’s passage. Warren was hoping to make a battle around the Cures Act the moment that Democrats announced, in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, that they were standing up and fighting against a broken and corrupt system.“The American people didn’t give Democrats majority support so we could come back to Washington and play dead,” she said on the floor. “They didn’t send us here to whimper, whine, or grovel. Now they are watching, waiting and hoping ― hoping we show some spine and start fighting back when Congress completely ignores the message of the American people and returns to all its same old ways.”Others read the politics around the bill differently. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), one of the bill’s supporters, called Warren’s floor speech “the most irresponsible statement anybody can possibly make,” adding: “She pontificates as if she knows everything, when in fact she knows nothing.” Isakson and his allies won.But the debate surrounding the 21st Century Cures Act came to embody a larger dispute about how government can and should operate. Some 1,455 lobbyists, acting on behalf of more than 400 companies and other organizations, lobbied on the legislation, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Over the past year and a half, companies known to have lobbied on the Cures Act spent half a billion dollars to influence Congress. The resulting bill was packed with politicians’ pet projects and sops to industry. The 2016 election, like every one prior, was run on a promise to change this sort of legislating ― to drain the swamp. But those pledges, like ones before, are already coming into conflict with how Washington actually works: by blending good motives, bad compromises and giveaways to interest groups ― and holding your nose as you vote on the result. Rep. Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, became convinced of the need for a Cures-type bill in 2011, after he met Brooke and Brielle Kennedy, two sisters (ages 8 and 9, respectively) with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare disease that destroys the nerves that control voluntary muscle movement.“I remember when they first came to my office in Kalamazoo,” Upton told The Huffington Post last week. “I said, ‘What’s your name?’” One of the girls answered that she was Cinderella and told Upton that her sister was Sleeping Beauty. “So that’s who they’ve always been, those two,” Upton said. “But whether it’s that, whether it’s Duchenne, whether it’s Alzheimer’s, diabetes, lupus, cancer. I mean, we’re all impacted by these things.”Gabe Griffin, an 11-year-old with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, became another inspiration for the bill. As did Upton’s family members. His wife has lupus, an autoimmune disease, his mother is a cancer survivor, and his father has diabetes. “I’m no different than anybody else,” Upton said. “We all have those stories.”When Upton set out to craft the bill to help people like Griffin and the Kennedy sisters in December 2013, he knew he had to balance certain interests. Lots of politicians were pushing for more government funding for biomedical research. But Republicans didn’t want to raise taxes to pay for it — and argued the same result could be achieved by cutting regulatory red tape. The congressman saw an opportunity for a bargain in which both sides could get what they wanted.In December 2013, he partnered with Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) to begin painstakingly assembling draft legislation. They, in turn, worked with the chairman and the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health Committee, Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.).Upton and DeGette pulled together language from proposals intended to bring to market much-needed medical therapies that weren’t economically viable and from bills to stimulate investment in new infectious disease remedies. They added measures tinkering with the Food and Drug Administration’s approval processes and streamlining clinical trials. They proposed the creation of an administrative working group to address the hurdles scientists face when applying for federal research grants. Most important, at a time when Congress was pinching every penny, the bill found revenue sources to fund more research. Upton and DeGette’s draft legislation devoted $8.75 billion to the National Institutes of Health and $550 million to the FDA over a five-year period — offset by selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and cuts to the payments Medicare and Medicaid make to states, insurance companies and providers.In April 2015, after eight hearings, 24 roundtable discussions and several white papers, the bipartisan pair released a discussion draft. The formal bill passed through committee by a 51-0 vote in May. In July of that year, the full House approved the bill by a vote of 344 to 77. PhRMA, United for Medical Research, Newt Gingrich and Katie Couric all applauded its passage. House and Senate supporters of the legislation were working out the differences between their bills well before the Senate actually passed its own version. But the Senate was the Senate: slow to act. By the time that chamber took up the bill at the beginning of 2016, Congress had already used a chunk of Upton and DeGette’s funding sources on other things, forcing lawmakers to find new ways to pay for the bill or decrease its cost. They decreased its cost: bringing funding for the NIH from $8.75 billion over five years down to $4.8 billion over 10 years. At the urging of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who became House speaker after the bill passed that chamber, they also changed the funding from mandatory spending, which is paid out automatically unless Congress votes to change it, to discretionary spending, which lawmakers have to vote to spend each year. For biomedical research advocates, this shift complicated the part of the legislation that they actually loved. The NIH’s budget has grown slightly since taking a major hit in 2013: from $30.07 billion in fiscal year 2014 to $31.3 billion in FY 2016. But funding isn’t keeping up with inflation, and other countries are increasing the amount they spend on medical research at a much higher rate. An infusion of $4.8 billion “isn’t anything to take lightly,” said one senior official for a biomedical research advocacy group. But by making the funding discretionary, the lawmakers also endangered it. Congress, for example, could decide to fund NIH at a lower level in 2017 by arguing that the funding made available from the 21st Century Cures Act justifies the cut. Congress could also choose to raid the $4.8 billion in NIH funding for unrelated purposes — fighting the next infectious disease outbreak, for example. And then there is the matter of the incoming president, Donald J. Trump, who has promised to take advantage of low interest rates and borrow to invest in research and infrastructure, but whose commitment to science is not exactly sterling. Two Democratic senators said they spoke to Michael Botticelli, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, about concerns that Trump might not spend the opioid-related money for its stated purpose. Botticelli assured them that he could get the money out the door and to the states before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. It would be a bureaucratic feat, but “if anybody can do it, he can do it,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).Still, believing that lawmakers and bureaucrats will keep their promises requires “an awful lot of putting faith in the process,” a second medical research advocate told HuffPost. And “faith” is not a sound foundation for science. Biomedical research relies, instead, on stability. Grants are awarded over several years and if a grant-awarding agency is worried that its funding pool might shift or dry up, the type of research it funds will be shorter-term investments.“I am concerned that we’re talking about $6 billion of offsets, and of cuts, for only one year of guaranteed funding,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) told The Huffington Post. “I don’t know that I want to give the Republican majority 6 billion in cuts when I only have one year of funding.”Republicans on Capitol Hill say they understand and recognize the worry about discretionary spending for the bill’s initiatives. But they argued it is overblown. As the congressional GOP aide noted, even mandatory funding isn’t guaranteed because no Congress can bind a future Congress. Far more important, he added, was that the research priorities funded by the 21st Century Cures Act enjoyed seemingly unshakeable bipartisan support.“The concern is like saying, ‘OK, you won the lottery. But are you going to spend the money?’” the GOP aide said. “Everyone spends the money.”The aide has a point: Despite their concerns about the vulnerability of the discretionary spending, most medical research advocacy groups support the bill. Many people in Washington are coming to the same conclusion as the medical research advocates: The bill is far from perfect, but it includes something for just about everyone. Its authors designed it that way. In the legislation’s earliest forms, for example, some Republicans worried the NIH funding was akin to signing a blank check for the administration. But the bill’s backers recognized that if they took too much money out, they’d lose Democratic support. They came up with a workaround. Alexander, after meeting with Upton and White House officials, suggested targeting most of the money at three or four specific projects that could use a cash infusion. They settled on the brain-mapping program and the precision medicine initiative, which is designed to track how factors like lifestyle, wealth and even environmental variables affect diseases. And they included a parting gift for Biden ― $1.8 billion for the national Cancer Moonshot.Biden lost his son Beau to brain cancer in May 2015. Five months later, when he announced in an emotional Rose Garden statement that he would pass on a run for president, he expressed a desire to make “an absolute national commitment to end cancer as we know it today.” Obama formally unveiled the “moonshot” campaign in his 2016 State of the Union address, when he declared it as ambitious as sending a man to the moon — hence the name. He tapped his VP to lead the effort.For the rest of the year, Biden met with physicians, researchers, families, tech leaders and even Pope Francis to come up with the best ways to put government money to use to accelerate cancer research, prevention and detection. So far he has singled out efforts to make it easier for patients to get into clinical trials and pushed for more open data and collaboration between researchers. The vice president submitted his final report to Obama last month, outlining what his team accomplished over the year and offering a five-year plan “to unite and marshal every resource of the federal government.” And, according to sources, he is now calling his friends in the Senate, making a passionate case on behalf of the cancer research funding that is contained within the 21st Century Cures legislation.“A lot of them [Democrats] see this a sort of a last thing for Biden,” one Democratic staffer told HuffPost. “But if he weren’t pushing for it, it would probably fail,” the aide said, speaking anonymously to offer candid insights.Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Biden’s home state of Delaware, said Biden’s appeal to him was decisive. “Perhaps the increase in spending on opioid prevention and reduction, and the increase in spending on treatments and cures, is dwarfed by the cuts, but I’ve heard from the vice president, who feels very strongly that this is an important next step in the fight against cancer,” Coons said. Money for Biden’s cancer moonshot was the largest carrot meant to maintain support for the bill. But it was not the only one. The first two parts of the legislation include a host of intriguing funding initiatives of programmatic changes. There is a EUREKA prize competition (the Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer’s Act) that directs the NIH to establish a competition for innovative work to combat serious biomedical diseases. There are requirements for the institute to support opportunities for young researchers (a major problem in the field of science, where funding tends to go to established names). There are even sections designed to support the national Pediatric Research Network and accelerate therapies and preventions for tick-borne diseases. But assembling a broad, bipartisan coalition often requires including ethically suspect giveaways. And this bill has those, too. The bill incorporates ideas from the so-called REGROW Act (Reliable and Effective Growth for Regenerative Health Options that Improve Wellness), introduced by Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and co-sponsored by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.).While the language of REGROW and Cures are different, the driving idea is the same. Both bills would speed up the delivery of adult stem cell therapies to patients by allowing those therapies to go to market before they’re definitively proved to be safe and effective.Such a strategy would “negatively impact the development of stem cell therapies, the integrity of the emerging regenerative medicine market, and the health and safety of people using stem cell products,” the International Society for Stem Cell Research, a coalition of medical researchers, warned in September.REGROW was backed by a range of stem cell companies and patient support groups. But its most important backer is W. Ed Bosarge, a super-wealthy Texas entrepreneur who made huge contributions to the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC linked to Sen. McConnell, in the 2016 election cycle. Bosarge, who runs the stem-cell firm Bosarge Life Sciences, had given $3 million through the company Petrodome Energy LLC, an oil and gas business he operates, as of Oct. 19 ― the most recent date for such disclosures. These contributions made him the fourth-largest supporter of McConnell’s successful effort to keep the Senate in Republican hands. The stem-cell exec has donated at least $4.7 million to Republican super PACs since 2010, including $175,000 to Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, a super PAC that solely supported McConnell’s re-election in 2014.The Bipartisan Policy Center, a corporate- and foundation-funded Washington think tank that is lobbying Congress in support of REGROW, thanked Bosarge for his “contributions” in a key policy paper backing the bill. In February 2015, the bipartisan lobbying firm Bockorny Group registered to lobby on behalf of Bosarge Life Sciences. As part of that lobbying, Bosarge met with Kirk’s staffers to discuss the legislation, according to a report by Politico. The lobbyists’ plan of action was to convince Congress to slip REGROW into more immediate legislation — like the 21st Century Cures Act.Although they were unsuccessful in inserting the exact language, the bill still includes substantial provisions on regenerative therapies. The inclusion of those sorts of lobbyist and donor-backed provisions are exactly the sorts of deals that have some opponents of the Cures Act — including Warren — fuming. In her floor speech on Nov. 28, the Massachusetts Democrat decried the inclusion the regenerative language as a “special deal” for a “major Republican donor” — i.e., Bosarge — who “stands to benefit financially from selling cellular and regenerative medical therapies.” Her charge against McConnell inspired Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) to rise in his defense and accuse her of violating the Senate’s “decorum.”But Warren didn’t find a lot of allies in her fight. “I understand that there’s a desire to immediately show some backbone and some fight,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a major supporter of the bill, who authored significant mental health policy legislation that was included as part of it. “I think this is the wrong place to make that stand... There’s going to be plenty of life or death fights once Donald Trump is president.”Last Tuesday, Senate Democrats gathered for a private lunch to hash out strategy around the bill. It was, according to sources, less tense than expected, as Warren’s effort lost steam, but it was still a much feistier meeting than customary. “I think that tension is productive,” Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said as he was leaving the meeting. “In the last several hours, we just won some more concessions.”Both parties did compromise. A manager’s amendment to the final version of the bill struck the rollback of the Sunshine Act. And Upton made another concession about a month ago when he removed the so-called Open Act, which would have given drug companies an additional six months of exclusivity for orphan drugs.“We took out a couple provisions that actually would have helped the pharmaceutical industry,” Upton said, responding to Warren’s criticism.Republicans also pulled a bipartisan provision ― authored by Sens. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) ― promoting evidence-based prevention services to help keep more children out of foster care after Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) demanded it be stripped out.The bill had passed the House unanimously in June when it came up for a standalone vote, and it’s backed by more than 500 child welfare groups. But Republican leaders backed down Tuesday after Burr, along with Republican Sens. Thom Tillis (N.C.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Dan Coats (Ind.), pressed McConnell and Ryan to remove it from the larger Cures Act. With those demands met, Republicans easily got behind the bill.It’s those sorts of trade-offs that win votes. But so too does money. Shaheen, the New Hampshire Democrat, has seen her home state ravaged by the opioid crisis. And she has pushed unsuccessfully for the past year to win $600 million in emergency funding to address the epidemic. She had no luck until 21st Century Cures came along. “Listen, I appreciate that Senator Warren has some concerns with the bill,” Shaheen said. “I have concerns with the bill.” But, she added, the deal was too good to pass up.“My goal has been trying to get funding to address the heroin and opioid epidemic,” she said. “And there is significant funding in this bill.”This article has been updated throughout to reflect the bill’s passage in the House and Senate.With reporting by Jen Bendery, Laura Barron-Lopez, Jason Cherkis, Paul Blumenthal and Michael McAuliff.Use the form below, powered by PopVox, to write your member of Congress to let him or her know how you feel about the Cures Act.CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, a previous version misstated the full name of the EUREKA Act; it was misidentified as Exceptional Unconventional Research Enabling Knowledge Acceleration, a separate grant program.

This is the inclusive, populist principle upon which American environmentalism was founded almost five decades ago, and a path forward during the difficult years ahead.The 2016 presidential election drips with the sweat of political cynicism. Campaigns put aside the majority of the voting populace and narrowed their sights, and money, on ten states that would assure an Electoral College victory. Although Donald Trump won the electoral race, Hillary Clinton now leads the popular vote by more than 2.2 million and climbing. Of greater significance, 100 million eligible voters, 43%, did not even vote. Follow the math and some 70% of eligible voters were not willing to support one or the other of the two main candidates. Though many political observers expected a record turnout, a lower percentage of voters participated this year than in either of the two previous presidential races. As is usual, boundaries were carefully drawn around selected populations identified by Big Data. Television ad buys, social media messaging, videos and endorsements were designed accordingly. National non-profit organizations use much the same demographic approach – drill down to that segment of likely public support and mine the vein. It is a proven method that produces members and donations. But, like the presidential race, it discounts the nation at-large — a strategy environmental groups can no longer afford, given what lies ahead.Throughout the campaign and since, Mr. Trump has made clear his environmental stance. He believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by China, based on fabricated science. He plans to radically retool the Environmental Protection Agency. To oversee transition at the EPA, he appointed a climate change antagonist, Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute who called Newt Gingrich’s proposal to abolish the EPA “bold and visionary.” Mr. Trump has promised to reinstate the Keystone Pipeline project. Chuck Todd reports Sarah Palin is still under active consideration for Secretary of the Interior, an indicator of trouble ahead whether she is chosen or not. The Trump administration can set back American environmental progress two generations just through the use of its executive authority.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump anticipated the same election outcome, and both were surprised by Mr. Trump’s victory, as were the pundits, pollsters, analysts, media, and even unions, no strangers to the hard work of getting out the vote. In the course of the campaign, Mr. Trump’s supporters were foolishly demeaned as hate mongers, uneducated and anti-environmental. Now the stereotypes are crumbling, and for good reason. A campaign season obsessed with the middle class largely ignored the poor and the struggling. The Rust Belt, the South, and rural America are credited with giving Mr. Trump the win, and Secretary Clinton has been criticized for ignoring that slice of the nation, in favor of the narrow demographic she believed would eke out her victory. The environmental movement can take a lesson from her mistakes — and from sober reflection about a forgotten America and the founding principles of American environmentalism.There is a common theme in the political post-mortems: the election did not address “all of America” — a phrase that should ring in the memories of those familiar with the nation’s environmental roots. In a speech steeped in the tradition of the late Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and a nation riven by the War in Vietnam, Earth Day founder U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson  addressed a standing room crowd in Denver, Colorado, on the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970:“Environment is all of America and its problems. It is rats in the ghetto. It is a hungry child in a land of affluence. It is housing that is not worthy of the name; neighborhoods not fit to inhabit.. . . Earth Day can — and it must — lend a new urgency and a new support to solving the problems that still threaten to tear the fabric of this society — the problems of race, of war, of poverty, of modern day institutions. . . . Our goal is not just an environment of clean air and water and scenic beauty. The objective is an environment of decency, quality and mutual respect for all other human beings and all other living creatures.”We are closing-in on five decades since Nelson’s speech, and approximately 43.1 million people in the U.S. still live in poverty. 42.2 million live in food insecure households. 7.8 million are officially unemployed, with the real number reaching 9 million, according to some experts. On any given night, more than 500,000 people may be homeless, and advocates say greater than 3 million people experience homelessness at some time during the year; more than half are children. Minority Americans are of course disproportionately represented in all these grim data. Sometimes the numbers crash together in a downwardly spiraling community, such as McDowell County, West Virginia, the heart of coal country and therefore a flash point in the climate debate. There the population has plummeted from 100,000 to 19,000, local stores are shuttered, unemployment is twice the national average and poverty is at 35%. Or Camden, New Jersey, where the poverty rate is 39%, per capita income is less than $14,000 and 8% of the population has a college degree. 82% of its residents are from minority populations. Four years ago, 20 million eligible voters earning less than $20,000 did not vote for president, a number that likely rose in 2016. President-elect Trump’s upset victory should prompt soul-searching within the environmental movement. It has at The New York Times, where Public Editor Liz Spayd was unsparing. In her column, “Want to Know What America’s Thinking? Try Asking,” she wrote, “As The Times begins a period of self-reflection, I hope its editors will think hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers.” Margaret Sullivan, media critic for The Washington Post, wrote, “Although we touched down in the big red states for a few days, or interviewed some coal miners or unemployed autoworkers in the Rust Belt, we didn’t take them seriously. Or not seriously enough.”A modern presidential campaign is about analytics and demographics, and the doggedly cynical pursuit of 270 Electoral College votes. But environmental organizations are not burdened by such strictures. They needn’t favor certain constituencies over others. They do no have to ignore the majority of Americans in order to build a successful campaign. Nor should they — the environmental issues before the nation affect “all of America.” Here are three of many examples: children in crowded urban neighborhoods are more likely to die from asthma; 19.5 million Americans are made ill by drinking water yearly; 4.5% of U.S. deaths are attributable to poverty. Add in climate change, a proliferation of substandard water bodies, unremediated toxic sites, threatened public lands, and disproportionate environmental degradation in poor communities. As national organizations fight vigorously to hold the line on these issues and more, the human species should be their priority. They should launch a joint campaign that reaches out to all of America, across all social, political, economic and geographic borders, environmentalists or not. They should together build a movement based on all ages, races, ethnicities and classes, and all the disempowered who believe that casting a vote will make no difference in their lives — and offer a $1 membership to anyone willing to join.

This is the inclusive, populist principle upon which American environmentalism was founded almost five decades ago, and a path forward during the difficult years ahead.The 2016 presidential election drips with the sweat of political cynicism. Campaigns put aside the majority of the voting populace and narrowed their sights, and money, on ten states that would assure an Electoral College victory. Although Donald Trump won the electoral race, Hillary Clinton now leads the popular vote by more than 2.2 million and climbing. Of greater significance, 100 million eligible voters, 43%, did not even vote. Follow the math and some 70% of eligible voters were not willing to support one or the other of the two main candidates. Though many political observers expected a record turnout, a lower percentage of voters participated this year than in either of the two previous presidential races. As is usual, boundaries were carefully drawn around selected populations identified by Big Data. Television ad buys, social media messaging, videos and endorsements were designed accordingly. National non-profit organizations use much the same demographic approach – drill down to that segment of likely public support and mine the vein. It is a proven method that produces members and donations. But, like the presidential race, it discounts the nation at-large — a strategy environmental groups can no longer afford, given what lies ahead.Throughout the campaign and since, Mr. Trump has made clear his environmental stance. He believes climate change is a hoax perpetrated by China, based on fabricated science. He plans to radically retool the Environmental Protection Agency. To oversee transition at the EPA, he appointed a climate change antagonist, Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute who called Newt Gingrich’s proposal to abolish the EPA “bold and visionary.” Mr. Trump has promised to reinstate the Keystone Pipeline project. Chuck Todd reports Sarah Palin is still under active consideration for Secretary of the Interior, an indicator of trouble ahead whether she is chosen or not. The Trump administration can set back American environmental progress two generations just through the use of its executive authority.Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump anticipated the same election outcome, and both were surprised by Mr. Trump’s victory, as were the pundits, pollsters, analysts, media, and even unions, no strangers to the hard work of getting out the vote. In the course of the campaign, Mr. Trump’s supporters were foolishly demeaned as hate mongers, uneducated and anti-environmental. Now the stereotypes are crumbling, and for good reason. A campaign season obsessed with the middle class largely ignored the poor and the struggling. The Rust Belt, the South, and rural America are credited with giving Mr. Trump the win, and Secretary Clinton has been criticized for ignoring that slice of the nation, in favor of the narrow demographic she believed would eke out her victory. The environmental movement can take a lesson from her mistakes — and from sober reflection about a forgotten America and the founding principles of American environmentalism.There is a common theme in the political post-mortems: the election did not address “all of America” — a phrase that should ring in the memories of those familiar with the nation’s environmental roots. In a speech steeped in the tradition of the late Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. and a nation riven by the War in Vietnam, Earth Day founder U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson  addressed a standing room crowd in Denver, Colorado, on the first Earth Day, April 22, 1970:“Environment is all of America and its problems. It is rats in the ghetto. It is a hungry child in a land of affluence. It is housing that is not worthy of the name; neighborhoods not fit to inhabit.. . . Earth Day can — and it must — lend a new urgency and a new support to solving the problems that still threaten to tear the fabric of this society — the problems of race, of war, of poverty, of modern day institutions. . . . Our goal is not just an environment of clean air and water and scenic beauty. The objective is an environment of decency, quality and mutual respect for all other human beings and all other living creatures.”We are closing-in on five decades since Nelson’s speech, and approximately 43.1 million people in the U.S. still live in poverty. 42.2 million live in food insecure households. 7.8 million are officially unemployed, with the real number reaching 9 million, according to some experts. On any given night, more than 500,000 people may be homeless, and advocates say greater than 3 million people experience homelessness at some time during the year; more than half are children. Minority Americans are of course disproportionately represented in all these grim data. Sometimes the numbers crash together in a downwardly spiraling community, such as McDowell County, West Virginia, the heart of coal country and therefore a flash point in the climate debate. There the population has plummeted from 100,000 to 19,000, local stores are shuttered, unemployment is twice the national average and poverty is at 35%. Or Camden, New Jersey, where the poverty rate is 39%, per capita income is less than $14,000 and 8% of the population has a college degree. 82% of its residents are from minority populations. Four years ago, 20 million eligible voters earning less than $20,000 did not vote for president, a number that likely rose in 2016. President-elect Trump’s upset victory should prompt soul-searching within the environmental movement. It has at The New York Times, where Public Editor Liz Spayd was unsparing. In her column, “Want to Know What America’s Thinking? Try Asking,” she wrote, “As The Times begins a period of self-reflection, I hope its editors will think hard about the half of America the paper too seldom covers.” Margaret Sullivan, media critic for The Washington Post, wrote, “Although we touched down in the big red states for a few days, or interviewed some coal miners or unemployed autoworkers in the Rust Belt, we didn’t take them seriously. Or not seriously enough.”A modern presidential campaign is about analytics and demographics, and the doggedly cynical pursuit of 270 Electoral College votes. But environmental organizations are not burdened by such strictures. They needn’t favor certain constituencies over others. They do no have to ignore the majority of Americans in order to build a successful campaign. Nor should they — the environmental issues before the nation affect “all of America.” Here are three of many examples: children in crowded urban neighborhoods are more likely to die from asthma; 19.5 million Americans are made ill by drinking water yearly; 4.5% of U.S. deaths are attributable to poverty. Add in climate change, a proliferation of substandard water bodies, unremediated toxic sites, threatened public lands, and disproportionate environmental degradation in poor communities. As national organizations fight vigorously to hold the line on these issues and more, the human species should be their priority. They should launch a joint campaign that reaches out to all of America, across all social, political, economic and geographic borders, environmentalists or not. They should together build a movement based on all ages, races, ethnicities and classes, and all the disempowered who believe that casting a vote will make no difference in their lives — and offer a $1 membership to anyone willing to join. This is not a ploy to multiply support, nor is it a pitch for a new brand of environmentalism. Rather, it is a revival of the inclusive, populist principle upon which contemporary environmentalism was founded almost fifty years ago, and the best path to an American environmental movement that can succeed in the hard years ahead.Portions of this article first appeared on EarthDesk, the online journal of Dyson College Institute for Sustainability and the Environment at Pace University."

17,BUSINESS,Workers Across U.S. 'Fight For $15' In Strikes For Wage Hikes,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-protests-fight-for-15_us_583df76ee4b0ae0e7cda8333,Dozens of arrests for civil disobedience mark the campaign's 4th anniversary.,2016-11-29,"Workers nationwide advocated for a minimum wage of $15 an hour Tuesday, including this group at Los Angeles International Airport.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583df7b118000093143107a2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2012, Alvin Major was earning the minimum wage of $7.25 per hour when he went on strike at his KFC restaurant in New York City. Four years later, he’s earning $10.50 per hour, a 45 percent increase. But Major isn’t done striking.“I’m feeling proud for the work we’ve done,” said the 51-year-old Guyana native. “But our fight has to keep going on. We won’t stop until we’ve won what we deserve.”Major’s bigger paycheck is evidence of the victories notched by the “Fight for $15,” a union-backed worker campaign that turns 4 years old this week. But for Major, it’s also a sign of the work that remains. With four children, including two in state college, he still needs food stamps, and he has nothing left in his bank account at the end of the month. “I’ve got to be making choices: putting food on table, paying the bills and paying rent,” he said.On Tuesday, Major was joined by workers from around the country in the latest Fight for $15 strike. Protests hit dozens of cities to mark the anniversary, and images of workers and their allies being arrested for civil disobedience popped up on Twitter throughout the day. Dozens were arrested blocking traffic in Detroit, Manhattan and Chicago.The Fight for $15 campaign began in 2012 with fast-food employees like Major but now includes day-care workers, airport baggage handlers and even some Uber drivers. The high-profile protests have helped drive minimum wage increases in cities and states around the country, including an aggressive one in New York that has boosted Major’s pay.But four years on, the endgame for the Fight for $15 is still no clearer. The campaign aims to win workers not only $15 per hour but also union representation. The fast-food industry remains union-free. The Service Employees International Union, which has poured tens of millions of dollars into the campaign, has not attempted to unionize individual restaurants. It would much rather unionize fast-food workers en masse, which would require regulatory changes, or pressure industry giants like McDonald’s into implementing its own major wage increases.The campaign shouldn’t expect any help from Washington under a Donald Trump administration. The National Labor Relations Board, which has refereed the workers’ disputes during the Fight for $15, will become a Republican majority much likelier to side with businesses. Regulators probably won’t be as receptive to workers’ arguments that the major fast-food chains are “joint employers” alongside franchisees. And the likelihood of a federal minimum wage hike has become even dimmer with Republicans controlling both the legislative and executive branches. President Barack Obama has been a public supporter of the Fight for $15, as has Hillary Clinton, who was likely to continue Obama’s policies on the labor front had she defeated Trump in the presidential race. But Mary Kay Henry, the president of SEIU and a Clinton supporter, said Tuesday that the Fight for $15 would continue regardless of who holds the reins on Capitol Hill or at the White House.“The movement has never relied on any type of politicians,” Henry said. “We think that working people have been at war for decades. The destruction of unions has been going on for 40 years. But when people join together, good things can happen.”With fewer friends in Washington, Henry said fights on the local and state levels will become even more important. The last four years have seen a wave of new laws pushing local wage floors as high as $15 an hour, with voters keen on approving minimum wage referendums and paid leave proposals. A majority of states now have higher minimum wages than the federal level, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009.The National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group that has supported the Fight for $15, released a report Friday estimating that 19 million workers are covered by minimum wage increases that have been enacted since the campaign began. The biggest beneficiaries, NELP said, have been workers in jurisdictions that passed $15-an-hour ordinances: California, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Seattle, and SeaTac, Wash. Many business groups and local chambers of commerce have opposed the minimum wage proposals only to be bowled over by their popularity. The industry-backed Employment Policies Institute, a vocal opponent of the Fight for $15, released a series of videos ahead of Tuesday’s protests blaming minimum wage hikes for closures of small businesses. The institute called them “cautionary tales.”Major hasn’t lost his job due to the increases in New York. His current wage of $10.50 per hour is the mandated minimum for fast-food employees in New York City at the moment. That will eventually reach $15 at the end of 2018, under an agreement reached by state officials last year. He says he plans to continue protesting even after he’s won his $15 per hour, to earn job security and union recognition.“I used to be scared when I first went on strike. Not anymore,” Major said. “We don’t have a union, but we’re acting like one.”"

ARTAN SPOKE OF “BOILING POINT”Investigators were looking into a message posted on Facebook by Artan that contained inflammatory statements about being “sick and tired” of seeing Muslims killed and reaching a “boiling point,” a law enforcement source said.“Stop the killing of the Muslims in Burma,” Artan said in the Facebook post.Violence in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has sent Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the border to Bangladesh amid allegations of abuses by security forces.All of Artan’s Facebook postings have been removed from the social media website.Artan on Facebook also called Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born radical cleric linked to al Qaeda’s Yemen wing, “a hero.” Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011.In its claim of responsibility for Monday’s attack at Ohio State, the Islamic State news agency AMAQ posted a photo of Artan wearing a blue shirt and sitting with greenery in the background. It described him as a soldier of the group.“Brother Abdul Razak Ali Artan, God accept him, implementer of the Ohio attack, a student in his third year in university,” the caption read.Artan, who was born in Somalia, arrived in the United States in 2014, said a federal official, who also asked not to be identified. Ohio State University Police Chief Craig Stone said Artan was 20 years old.Investigators believe Artan may have lived for as long as seven years in Pakistan, said the federal official, who declined to be named because of the ongoing investigation. Somali refugees often spend some time in Pakistan before coming to the United States, another official said.Investigators were trying to assemble a full picture of Artan’s associates and recent activities, according to federal officials.Two people remained hospitalized at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Two others were at Riverside Methodist Hospital, according to a spokesman. None of the victims have life-threatening injuries, officials said. Seven people have been released.The attack rattled students at the state’s flagship public university, which had been placed under a campuswide alert as people barricaded themselves in rooms and police with rifles searched for a possible second suspect.Members of Columbus’ Somali community have denounced the attack.Ohio Governor John Kasich and other officials have praised Ohio State police for quickly reacting to the rampage.(Additional reporting by Amy Tennery and David Ingram in New York and Ali Abdelatti in Cairo; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler)"

This isn’t appropriate. We don’t tolerate it. Even if it isn’t a crime there are other things we can do to expose this person to healthier intervention.”Each copy of the letter bears the same fake name and address and is clearly postmarked in Santa Clarita, just outside of Los Angeles, the LAPD said. The Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations is asking local and state authorities to find charges to file against the suspect, as some of the language in the letter appears to make threats in President-elect Donald Trump’s name. “There’s a new sheriff in town — President Donald Trump. He’s going to cleanse America and make it shine again. And, he’s going to start with you Muslims,” the letter reads. “He’s going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews.”Masih Fouladi, a legal advocate with CAIR, said the office has always received hate mail. This particular letter is egregious, he said, because it invokes images of the Holocaust and ethnic cleansing while using Trump’s victory as a platform.“Since the election there’s no doubt that a lot of Trump supporters have become empowered and emboldened to make these statements,” Fouladi said. “We’re happy that authorities are trying to assess whether this person poses a credible threat ... but we want to see the FBI and U.S. attorneys use hate statutes to find credible charges.”The letter’s recipients find it both baffling and terrifying.The Islamic Center of Savannah in Georgia received a copy late last week for no apparent reason, said Mohammad Masroor, the center’s chairman.The institution is more dedicated to working with the community than engaging hate, Masroor said. “We want the community to know that Muslims are good people, not bad,” he told HuffPost. “We want to be good citizens. We should project an image of someone who is honest, hardworking and peaceful. We really want to do good.”It appears that his community agrees. Religious leaders woke up on Monday to find that locals had left them letters of support and flowers.The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified more than 800 acts of similar bias intimidation and harassment targeting Muslims, black people, Latinos, immigrants and the LGBTQ community in the 10 days following the election, although not every incident has been independently verified. HuffPost’s Christopher Mathias has identified at least 13 times in which apparent Trump supporters have attacked, harassed or plotted to kill Muslims."

In its place, Republicans were advocating a broad exemption that opened the door to contractors discriminating against LGBTQ people based on a contractor’s religious beliefs. It would have affected every grant, contract and purchase order made by every federal agency, including contracts with hospitals, homeless shelters, colleges, schools, domestic violence shelters and adoption agencies. The House passed its bill in May, with that amendment from Rep. Steve Russell (R-Okla.) in it. But the Senate passed its own NDAA in June without that language. That has left a final bill ― and the fate of that amendment ― in limbo for months as House and Senate negotiators went behind closed doors to hash out their differences.Ultimately, Republicans agreed to take out Russell’s measure amid protests from Democrats, top committee aides told reporters Tuesday.“The Russell amendment was in response to the executive orders. The NDAA was always an imperfect remedy for that problem,” a senior aide said in a background briefing. “Subsequent to the election, new paths have opened up to address those issues. It’s still a very important issue for the members and they intend to pursue those other paths.”“Other paths” likely means that some Republicans will turn to President-elect Donald Trump to repeal Obama’s executive order, which he can do with the stroke of a pen if he wants. It’s unclear where Trump stands on this issue.Obama previously threatened to veto the NDAA over several of its provisions, including the anti-LGBTQ amendment. But committee aides said Tuesday they think Republicans have taken out all of the major items that were problems for the White House, which means Obama may sign it into law.Lawmakers often load up the NDAA with controversial measures, only to pull them out at the last minute. That’s because they know the bill has to pass ― it authorizes all of the nation’s defense spending for the next fiscal year ― so they want to make a statement on a particular issue while the bill is moving. Once it gets close to the time to send the bill to the president, they strip out the things the president opposes and send him cleaner legislation."

Hosted by actress Rosie Perez, the special event is part of the non-profit organization’s series of global initiatives to take place in commemoration of World AIDS Day (on Dec. 1).The event will also honor legendary activist and entertainer Harry Belafonte with AHF’s Lifetime Achievement Award for his history of humanitarian work.Despite the advancements for HIV/AIDS research and treatment, LaBelle ― who’s a known advocate of raising awareness for HIV/AIDS ― wants to encourage everyone not to lose sight of ridding the immunodeficiency virus from the world’s population. “It’s sort of like the election when we knew Hillary was gonna win and she didn’t because some of us just dropped all thought about having her as president,” she told The Huffington Post. “It’s like if we dropped our thoughts and care about the AIDS epidemic, then more lives will leave this planet. So I’m there to use my voice and celebrity in any way to help it get better.”Since its inception in 1987, AHF has provided cutting-edge medicine and advocacy to “more than 641,601 people in 36 countries,” making it the largest provider of HIV/AIDS medical care, according to the organization’s site.And Michael Weinstein, the president of AHF, also hopes the series of events will serve as a “potent reminder” and a “clarion call to action” that the fight against HIV/AIDS isn’t over.“The irony is that we are the victims of our own success: As the AIDS situation improves, with better treatments and more people being able to access them, the urgency of winning the war against AIDS here in the U.S. and around the globe has diminished,” Weinstein said in a press release for the event.“As a result, HIV/AIDS is increasingly pitted against other important issues as far as funding as well as for the attention of policy makers,” he added. “It is critical that we continue to speak out through events like KTP in order to remind governments, public health officials and other stakeholders to keep the promise on AIDS and other key public health issues.”Participants can register to attend “Keep the Promise” 2016 here."

Raquel Calderón de Hildago died at Banner Casa Grande Medical Center in Arizona after a series of seizures, according to an ICE press release. Border Patrol agents caught her crossing into the U.S. from Mexico illegally on Nov. 17, according to ICE. She did not have a criminal record.  Calderón was sent to Eloy Detention Center on Nov. 23 to await deportation proceedings, but was rushed to the hospital by ambulance after the seizures started, ICE said. Some 15 immigrant detainees have died while confined at Eloy since 2003, according to The Arizona Republic ― the most of any immigrant detention center. Five deaths at Eloy since 2005 have been suicides, Latino USA reports. One was José de Jesús Deniz Sahagún, a 31-year-old Mexican national who was found dead at Eloy three days after being locked up there in May 2015. He was found with a sock stuffed down his throat in solitary confinement in an apparent suicide, according to two-part series by Latino USA. “We’re deeply disturbed by reports of another death at Eloy, where the U.S. government’s own investigations reveal poor oversight and follow-up after problems are identified in medical care and other aspects of detention,” Grace Meng, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, wrote in an email to HuffPost. The Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, “should publicly release the results of investigations into her death and all other death reports that have not already been released.”Eloy Detention Center is run as a for-profit business by CoreCivic, the country’s largest private prison contractor. The company recently changed its name from Corrections Corporation of America. A spokesman for CoreCivic wrote in an email that the company was not the medical services provider in Calderón’s case and declined further comment. "

The cull will continue until Dec. 2, the official said.Further north in the prefecture of Aomori, about 16,500 ducks were being culled in the city of the same name after some tested positive for bird flu, according to a statement on the prefecture’s website.This is the first time that highly pathogenic avian influenza has been confirmed in Aomori prefecture, it said. The agriculture ministry said the outbreaks are the first for nearly two years in poultry farms in Japan.Taiko Pharmaceutical Co, which makes infection-control products, surged 3.2 percent, and mask maker Daiwabo Holdings, jumped 5.1 percent.Protective clothing maker Azearth Corp, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s second section, soared 17 percent to its daily limit of 681 yen.Meanwhile, grilled-chicken restaurant operator Torikizoku Co dropped 2.8 percent.“The news about bird flu is affecting these shares, but these moves tend to be short-lived,” said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.South Korea last Friday announced a temporary nationwide standstill order for poultry farms and related transport over the weekend in a bid to contain a spread of H5N6 bird flu, a severe strain of the disease.Another severe strain of bird flu, H5N8, has hit several countries in Europe and led to the culling of thousands of poultry after being detected in wild ducks in Northern France.In recent weeks there have also been outbreaks in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Romania and Germany. Dutch authorities destroyed about 190,000 ducks on Saturday at six farms following an avian flu outbreak.Farmers located in humid regions, where the risk of transmission is higher, are advised by health authorities to keep poultry flocks indoors or apply safety nets preventing contact with wild birds.The H5N8 virus has never been detected in humans but it led to the culling of millions of farm birds in Asia, mainly South Korea, in 2014 before spreading to Europe.The World Organization for Animal Health had warned in an interview with Reuters mid-November that more outbreaks of H5N8 were likely in Europe as wild birds believed to transmit the virus migrate southward.(Writing by Aaron Sheldrick Editing by Michael Perry)"

ARTAN SPOKE OF “BOILING POINT”Investigators were looking into a message posted on Facebook by Artan that contained inflammatory statements about being “sick and tired” of seeing Muslims killed and reaching a “boiling point,” a law enforcement source said.“Stop the killing of the Muslims in Burma,” Artan said in the Facebook post.Violence in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, has sent Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the border to Bangladesh amid allegations of abuses by security forces.All of Artan’s Facebook postings have been removed from the social media website.Artan on Facebook also called Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born radical cleric linked to al Qaeda’s Yemen wing, “a hero.” Awlaki was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011.In its claim of responsibility for Monday’s attack at Ohio State, the Islamic State news agency AMAQ posted a photo of Artan wearing a blue shirt and sitting with greenery in the background. It described him as a soldier of the group.“Brother Abdul Razak Ali Artan, God accept him, implementer of the Ohio attack, a student in his third year in university,” the caption read.Artan, who was born in Somalia, arrived in the United States in 2014, said a federal official, who also asked not to be identified. Ohio State University Police Chief Craig Stone said Artan was 20 years old.Investigators believe Artan may have lived for as long as seven years in Pakistan, said the federal official, who declined to be named because of the ongoing investigation. Somali refugees often spend some time in Pakistan before coming to the United States, another official said.Investigators were trying to assemble a full picture of Artan’s associates and recent activities, according to federal officials.Two people remained hospitalized at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, a spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Two others were at Riverside Methodist Hospital, according to a spokesman. None of the victims have life-threatening injuries, officials said. Seven people have been released.The attack rattled students at the state’s flagship public university, which had been placed under a campuswide alert as people barricaded themselves in rooms and police with rifles searched for a possible second suspect.Members of Columbus’ Somali community have denounced the attack.Ohio Governor John Kasich and other officials have praised Ohio State police for quickly reacting to the rampage.(Additional reporting by Amy Tennery and David Ingram in New York and Ali Abdelatti in Cairo; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Leslie Adler)"

According to The New York Times, Mr. Bromberg’s father purchased the painting at a Berlin auction in 1912. His son and daughter-in-law sold it as they were escaping Nazi Germany for the United States. Before being recovered by allied forces in 1945, the painting was sold to the German government in 1941, according to Jewish Telegraphic Agency, with plans to display the artwork in Hitler’s hometown. Since the war, it has been considered one of 2,000 “orphaned” art pieces in France, with its original owners unknown. The Associated Press reported that Henrietta Schubert, the Brombergs’ granddaughter, thought she was being scammed when she was first contacted about the painting belonging to her grandparents.  “The painting doesn’t even have to have any monetary value,” Schubert’s cousin, Christopher Bromberg, told the Associated Press. “It’s about connecting us to our past and the story of our family that was lost.”Schubert, who lives in Vienna, was born in the same Austrian town as Adolf Hitler. The painting is one of thousands that were sold, seized or stolen during World War II and given to the German government."

We’re here to answer your most pressing, puzzling, even politically incorrect questions, about all things related to the Chinese in Africa and Africans in China.It is a widely-held perception that Chinese investment in Africa is guided by a strategic foreign policy agenda focused on securing vast amounts of natural resources. This narrative fits nicely with an outdated Western colonial stereotype of how foreign countries engage Africa. However, in the case of the Chinese, this narrative is only partially correct.Earlier this year, the China-Africa Research Initiative, or CARI, published its findings from an in-depth survey on what African countries received the most Chinese loans over the past 15 years. Not surprisingly, Angola with its huge oil reserves topped the list at $21.2 billion. Interestingly, Ethiopia ($12.3 billion) and Kenya ($5.2 billion) were second and fourth respectively in the top five list and, for the most part, neither of these countries is considered extremely rich in natural resources.The pattern and flow of Chinese loans in Africa, according to CARI, suggests that the Chinese have a much broader strategic agenda on the continent than is often presumed by outsiders. While natural resources are no doubt important, they are clearly not the only priority as the Chinese seek to open new markets, build manufacturing operations, deploy aid and development initiatives and so on.Rwanda is another example of a country that at first glance would have little to offer Chinese investors. After all, this is a landlocked country with barely any natural resources and unlike Kenya or Ethiopia, Rwanda is so small that its domestic market isn’t very enticing. However, after emerging from the horrors of the 1994 genocide, Rwanda has become an island of stability in the Great Lakes region with its strong infrastructure, stable government and close proximity to vital markets in east and southern Africa.In a recent reporting assignment to Rwanda, Nairobi-based Quartz Africa correspondent Lily Kuo traveled there to investigate why the country is increasingly becoming a magnet for Chinese money and migrants. Lily joins Eric & Cobus ― in the podcast above ― to discuss what kind of Chinese investor is attracted to Rwanda and how people from both countries are sometimes struggling to adapt to one another.Join the discussion. What do you think about the growing Chinese presence in countries like Rwanda? Do you think it brings badly-need investment or new problems to countries that are already struggling?

A Kellogg spokesman told The Huffington Post that consumers alerted the food company to its ads on Breitbart. “We regularly work with our media buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren’t aligned with our values as company,” Kellogg spokesman Kris Charles said. “This involves reviewing websites where ads could potentially be placed using filtering technology to assess site content. As you can imagine, there is a very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed.”Breitbart did not immediately return a request for comment. Its executive chairman, Steve Bannon, has been named chief strategist and senior counselor to President-elect Donald Trump.Kellogg is only the latest company to sever relations with Breitbart, whose incendiary headlines include “Birth Control Makes Women Unattractive And Crazy” and “Bill Kristol: Republican Spoiler, Renegade Jew.” Last week, the massive ad distributor AppNexus deactivated Breitbart’s access to its advertising tools. Other companies to pull advertising from the site include Allstate, Nest, EarthLink, Warby Parker and SoFi, Bloomberg reported.UPDATE: Nov. 30 ― Breitbart launched a #DumpKelloggs counter-campaign Wednesday afternoon in response to the company removing advertising from the site.In an article published on the site, Breitbart editor-in-chief Alexander Marlow encouraged readers to boycott Kellogg products and described the decision to pull advertising as a “spit in the face” of readers:“Breitbart News is the largest platform for pro-family content anywhere on the Internet. We are fearless advocates for traditional American values, perhaps most important among them is freedom of speech, or our motto ‘more voices, not less.’ For Kellogg’s, an American brand, to blacklist Breitbart News in order to placate left-wing totalitarians is a disgraceful act of cowardice. They insult our incredibly diverse staff and spit in the face of our 45,000,000 highly engaged, highly perceptive, highly loyal readers, many of whom are Kellogg’s customers. Boycotting Breitbart News for presenting mainstream American ideas is an act of discrimination and intense prejudice.

Bastian said flight attendants made “the best decision they could given the information they had” by allowing the man to remain on the flight, but he admitted the airline made a mistake.“If our colleagues had witnessed firsthand what was shown in the video, there is no question they would have removed him from the aircraft,” Bastian wrote.The CEO told employees that Delta has issued refunds to all the passengers on the flight and that the decision to ban the passenger came after Delta received a wave of criticism for not kicking the man off at the time of the incident.Many people commented on the company’s Facebook page, pointing out the hypocrisy of airlines who boot Muslim passengers from flights for doing virtually nothing wrong while letting disruptive white passengers, like the man on the flight to Allentown, slide.In a video that went viral last week, the passenger can be seen in the aisle of the airplane cheering for President-elect Trump and insulting Clinton supporters.“We got some Hillary bitches on here?” the man yells to the passengers. “Donald Trump, baby!” he says later in the video. “It’s y’all president. Every goddamn one of you. If you don’t like it, too bad.”Emma Baum, who sat next to the loud Trump supporter, said she first noticed the man chanting “Make America great again” outside of the airport terminal before boarding, The Morning Call newspaper in Allentown reported.The passenger continued to talk about Trump when they were seated on the plane, so Baum filmed his rant and posted it to Facebook. The video has been watched more than 2.4 million times and shared nearly 19,000 times in less than a week. Before takeoff, a flight attendant escorted the man from his seat after his obnoxious monologue, questioned him, then allowed him to return to his seat. “This is what I get for being a patriot,” Baum quoted the passenger as saying when he returned, according to The Morning Call.Delta initially issued an apology to customers on Nov. 26, admitting that the offending passenger should not have been allowed back on the plane.In Monday’s internal memo, Bastian told Delta employees that he wanted to make sure they knew “we have your backs.”“The heightened tension in our society means that now more than ever we must require civility on our planes and in our facilities,” the CEO wrote. “We will not tolerate anything less.”The identity of the obscene Trump supporter has not been released, but video of his rude speech to passengers continues to circulate online."

Tom Price's spokesman later said he does believe President Barack Obama was born in the U.S.,2016-11-29,"Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, once said he wasn't sure if President Barack Obama was a citizen, a journalist said Tuesday. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583d8f7318000093143105e4.jpeg?cache=0YxAg06shp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), the Obamacare opponent President-elect Donald Trump has picked to head the Department of Health and Human Services, once balked at a question about President Barack Obama’s birthplace.In July 2009, The Huffington Post sent reporter Mike Stark to ask Republican congressmen on camera whether they agreed with the racist conspiracy theory gaining traction at the time that Obama was not born in the United States and therefore not permitted to serve as president.Many of the Republican House members HuffPost spoke to either refused to answer or implied that the questions about Obama’s birthplace were legitimate.Price’s response was to run away from HuffPost and up the stairs of the Capitol building in a move Stark dubbed “The Rocky.” You can see it about two minutes into the video below.The New Yorker staff writer Jelani Cobb tweeted on Tuesday that Price once told him on a flight that he was not sure if Obama was a citizen.But after HuffPost’s video came out, a spokesman for Price told the Atlanta-based site Creative Loafing that Price believed Obama was a natural-born U.S. citizen. He avoided HuffPost because he was “running to catch a vote,” the spokesman said.“It had nothing to do with what [the reporter] was asking,” the spokesman said. “He completely believes the president is a U.S. citizen who was born in the United States. There’s nothing to it. We have no concerns over the president’s citizenship or nationality. I don’t know why we were included in this video.”Asked to respond to the statement from Price’s spokesman, Cobb insisted that the conversation nonetheless took place. They were discussing the case of Terry Lakin, an Army doctor who refused to deploy to Afghanistan because of his birther beliefs, according to Cobb. Price suggested Lakin might have raised questions worth investigating, Cobb recalled.In fact, there is demonstrable evidence from the time period that Price considered questions about Obama’s birthplace legitimate. After Obama released the long-form copy of his Hawaiian birth certificate in April 2011, Price expressed his dismay that the president had not produced the document earlier."

38,POLITICS,Bahrain To Hold Major Celebration At Donald Trump's D.C. Hotel,Paul Blumenthal and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-bahrain_us_583de2a5e4b0c33c8e1282d0,Yet another potential conflict of interest for the president-elect.,2016-11-29,"President-elect Donald Trump attends the opening of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583de34c1a00000b03cca4f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The Embassy of Bahrain plans to host its annual National Day celebration at President-elect Donald Trump’s lavish Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.Set to take place on Dec. 7, the Bahrain National Day celebration would add yet another bullet point to the ever-expanding list of potential conflicts of interest facing the president-elect as he seeks to balance his new role and his global real estate empire. His D.C. hotel already emerged as a point of concern after it suggested to foreign dignitaries that staying there during their official visits could help their relationship with the president-elect.Last year, the Embassy of Bahrain hosted its National Day party at the Ritz Carlton, a swanky hotel located about a mile from Trump’s new space.The embassy did not respond to a request for comment on why it opted to change locations or how much it had paid host a private event at Trump’s hotel. The Trump International Hotel’s sales team declined to comment.“They know that they will be currying favor with Donald Trump,” said Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School. “Around the world it’s regarded as an ordinary way of business that you favor the enterprises and businesses of the head of the government in order to get ahead of everybody else.”In an interview with The New York Times last week, Trump affirmed that payments to his hotel could be seen as a conflict of interest.“They’ll say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, so every time somebody stays at that hotel, if they stay because I’m president, I guess you could say it’s a conflict of interest,” he told the publication.But Trump also said he believed he will be immune from conflicts of interest once he enters the White House.“The law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” he told the Times.In some respects, Trump is correct. Federal conflict-of-interest laws requiring government officials to place their assets into a blind trust do not apply to the president. However, previous presidents have placed their assets into the hands of independent trustees to ensure no real or perceived conflict could be alleged.Trump has done no such thing. Despite promising to cut ties to his global business empire if he won the election, he has made little progress in disassociating himself from his vast holdings.He named three of his adult children ― Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump ― as heads of the business. But he also placed them on his presidential transition team, thus negating any separation of business and state. Ivanka has participated in at least three discussions with world leaders while in her joint role as a temporary Trump Organization head and presidential transition adviser. Trump has also continued to meet with his international business partners and praised them in phone calls with foreign leaders.Although federal conflict-of-interest laws do not apply to the president, the Constitution does. In particular, its Emoluments Clause forbids government officials from receiving beneficial payment from a foreign government, a foreign government official or a business owned by a foreign government. The Kingdom of Bahrain paying to host its annual gala at the Trump hotel in D.C. could very well qualify as such a payment.Norm Eisen, former ethics adviser to President Barack Obama, previously told The Huffington Post that foreign governments and their embassies paying to use the Trump hotel could violate the Emoluments Clause.“Do we really think all these embassies would have shown up before he ran for office or before he was elected?” Eisen asked rhetorically. “Is it a coincidence that they had that meeting now after he was elected?” Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly tried to portray his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as corrupt for meeting with foreign leaders who had also given money to the Clinton Foundation. One example he cited was a meeting she held with Bahraini Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa in 2009, when she was the top U.S. diplomat. State Department emails suggest Clinton was initially hesitant to commit to a meeting, but that she eventually agreed after being contacted by a Bill Clinton aide who helped set up the Clinton Foundation. Bahrain, a country with a poor human rights record, has donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton family’s nonprofit organization.As a key Gulf ally, Bahrain is a top purchaser of U.S.-made weapons. The U.S. placed a hold on the sale of some heavy weaponry to the kingdom after a brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011, but the restrictions have since been lifted.The suggestion that Clinton was influenced to meet with al-Khalifa because of his country’s generosity to the Clinton Foundation always rang a bit hollow. Bahrain is a major non-NATO ally and home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet. It is one of the key countries in the U.S.-led fight against ISIS. High-level meetings between officials from the two countries are commonplace.But that didn’t stop Trump and his surrogates from latching onto the story.After The Washington Post ran its article on the meeting between Clinton and Khalifa, Trump called on his opponent to return the donations.“They should give the money back to a lot of countries … countries that influenced her totally and also countries that discriminated against women and gays and everybody else,” he said. A pro-Trump super PAC accused Clinton of selling access to the U.S. government while serving as secretary of state, citing the Bahrain incident.One of Trump’s sons also tweeted an article about the incident.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

39,QUEER VOICES,"Donald Trump Was About To Make Jerry Falwell, Jr. Education Secretary. Let That Sink In.",Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-was-about-to-make-jerry-falwell-jr-education-secretary_us_583c8cebe4b0860d6115e649,"""Gays and lesbians,"" Falwell Sr. said, were partly to blame for the 9/11 attacks",2016-11-29,"Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. introduces U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally at Liberty University, the world's largest Christian university, in Lynchburg, Virginia, on January 18, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583d8d5d1a00002500cca383.jpeg?cache=N1n5oXZz09&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump has settled on billionaire Betsy DeVos as his choice for Secretary of Education, a woman with her own, long anti-LGBTQ record. I’ll get to her further down, but first it’s important, because it reflects on Trump’s first instincts, to focus on the man who appears to have been Trump’s initial choice for the job, and who says he passed on it: Loyal supporter and campaigner, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell, Jr. ― a man whose late father and mentor said the attacks of 9/11 were God’s wrath against the United States for its acceptance of homosexuality. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I’d like to once again point to New York Times political reporter Maggie Haberman, who early this year wrote a story that set a false narrative for much of the media during the election campaign, headlined, “Donald Trump’s More Accepting Views on Gay Issues Set Him Apart in G.O.P.” Though Trump consistently opposed marriage equality (since 2000) and suggested to evangelical leaders (and later confirmed) that he’d sign the anti-LGBTQ First Amendment Defense Act, Haberman’s weak evidence for her assertion included Trump sending his congratulations to Elton John upon his civil union in 2005 and Trump having “nuzzled” Rudy Giuliani while the former New York City mayor performed a drag skit at a political roast 16 years ago. (Trump only bolstered this media-created notion about him during the general election by publicly claiming without evidence that he was better for “LGBT people” than Hillary Clinton, while he more quietly made his promises to anti-LGBTQ forces.)So, here we are now, during the transition of Trump’s presidency ― which includes anti-LGBTQ crusader Mike Pence as transition team chair and as a likely most powerful vice president ever ― and religious zealot and enemy of LGBTQ rights Jerry Falwell Jr. says that he was offered, and turned down, the job of Secretary of Education by Trump.Now, I think I can safely say that neither Mitt Romney, nor John McCain, nor even George W. Bush, would have considered Jerry Falwell Jr. or any other hard-core religious leader ― not someone who is merely devoutly religious while at least minimally qualified for the job, but rather someone who is a leader in a religious movement and president of a university with the motto, “Training Champions for Christ since 1971” ― to establish policy for, and administer federal assistance to, America’s public education system. I think I can also safely say that Ronald Reagan wouldn’t have made his ardent supporter, Jerry Falwell, Sr., founder of the Moral Majority as well as of Liberty University, head of the Education Department either.But here is Trump, ready to hand the job to a religious zealot whose sole goal, certainly by his actions and statements, would likely be to infuse evangelical Christian doctrine into public schools while silencing and instilling fear in students of minority faiths entirely, such as Muslims. Falwell, you’ll remember, called for students at Liberty University to carry guns on campus to protect themselves against terrorists ― in the context of the San Bernardino mass shooting ― whom he referred to as “those Muslims”:I’ve always thought that if more good people had concealed-carry permits, then we could end those Muslims before they walked in...and killed them.Over the past eight years the Obama Education Department, through its Office of Civil Rights, has embraced LGBTQ rights. In 2010 it launched a campaign to fight anti-gay and anti-trans bullying in public schools. The Education Department collaborated with five other agencies to form stopbullying.gov, which includes resources for LGBTQ youth.The Department of Education hosted five summits focused on ways to protect students, including queer students, from bullying and harassment. These summits included an LGBT Youth Summit in 2011 and a meeting with transgender students in 2015. The Obama Education Department also urged schools nationwide to allow LGBTQ student groups and alliances to form and meet on school grounds. And this year it issued a directive to high schools for the treatment of transgender students. During those same years, according to Nico Lang in The Advocate, Falwell’s Liberty University hosted a two-day conference, “Understanding Same-sex Attractions and Their Consequences,” which included panelists from various anti-LGBTQ “conversion therapy” organizations. Kevin Roose, who went undercover for a semester at Liberty University in 2007, wrote in New York magazine that condemnation of homosexuality and praise for conversion therapy were also promoted on campus and taught in the classroom there:While I was on campus, no political issue inspired more voluminous and one-sided debate than same-sex marriage. It was a frequent topic of sermons and convocation speeches, and the evils of same-sex marriage were taught in the classroom. (My Gen Ed textbook had a chapter called “Myths Behind the Homosexual Agenda.”) A campus pastor even started a support group, called “Masquerade,” for male students who felt the pull of gay attraction but wanted to cure themselves of it.With all that in mind, plus the fact that Falwell’s father, whom he emulates in word and deed, said about gays after 9/11, “I point the finger in their face and say ‘you helped this happen,’” it’s hard to believe Falwell would continue the Obama administration’s pro-LGBTQ programs if he actually became Secretary of Education, nor would he likely take the job with any stipulation that he must so. (For the record, Falwell told the Associated Press the reason he turned down the job is that he only could commit to two years away from Liberty University, but Trump wanted a four- to six-year commitment.)After Falwell passed on it, Trump offered the job to Amway billionaire Betsy DeVos, a Trump campaign backer whose family’s foundation is one of the largest contributors to the anti-equality National Organization for Marriage, giving $500,000 to the group. DeVos herself and her husband, fixtures of Michigan’s GOP, donated $200,000 to Michigan’s successful ballot initiative to ban marriage equality.That was in 2004. Michigan LGBTQ activist Stephanie White, of Equality Michigan, believes it’s possible DeVos has evolved. As Politico reported:[White] noted that DeVos doesn’t speak out against gay rights, and even called on Dave Agema, a Michigan Republican National Committee member, to step down from the RNC in 2014 after making comments highly critical of gays.Still, DeVos and her husband have given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the virulently anti-LGBTQ Focus on the Family ― labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center ― which also promotes “conversion therapy.” National LGBT groups have been demanding answers from the Trump transition team and from DeVos herself about her agenda. But Eliza Byard, president of GLSEN, which advocates for LGBTQ students, notes that even if the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights initiatives are kept intact, DeVos’ promotion of vouchers and tuition tax credits also threatens students’ civil rights, including LGBTQ students:True educational equity requires schools that serve the most at-risk students, including students of color; students with disabilities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or questioning (LGBTQ) students; and English-language learners. Vouchers and tuition tax credits do not advance this cause.No matter Trump’s actual beliefs on LGBTQ rights, it’s clearly not something he’s taking into account while offering cabinet posts to his most loyal supporters (and don’t forget, anti-LGBTQ Mike Pence is heading up the transition team.)That’s true whether they be billionaires who supported anti-LGBTQ efforts but backed Trump’s campaign, or religious extremists like Falwell, who helped turn out white evangelical voters for Trump and who would be hellbent on ending the separation of church and state, in public education and beyond."
40,POLITICS,North Dakota Governor Orders Pipeline Protesters To Evacuate,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/army-corps-engineers-dakota-access-pipeline-evict_us_583cb3e1e4b04b66c01b832b,"He blames ""severe winter weather"" but says no one will be allowed back.",2016-11-29,"Snow blankets the Oceti Sakowin camp, site of protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583cc5a71a00000b03cca25d.jpeg?cache=z78Ylidysm&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered Dakota Access Pipeline protesters Monday to immediately evacuate the main camp they’ve maintained on federal land for months because of “severe winter weather.”Snowfall, which began blanketing the region Monday, is expected to stop on Wednesday, according to a winter storm warning from the National Weather Service.The Republican governor, however, ordered the protesters not to return. “Winter conditions have the potential to endanger human life, especially when they are exposed to those conditions without proper shelter, dwellings or sanitation for prolonged periods of time,” Dalrymple’s order said. “These persons are ordered to leave the evacuation area immediately, and are further ordered not to return to the evacuation area.”Protesters, who call themselves water protectors, who violate the order “[do] so at their own risk, and assume any and all corresponding liabilities for their unlawful presence and occupation of the evacuation area,” Dalrymple said. Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault said late Monday: “This state executive order is a menacing action meant to cause fear, and is a blatant attempt by the state and local officials to usurp and circumvent federal authority.”Members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and their allies, sometimes numbering in the thousands, have camped in tents, yurts, tipis and other makeshift lodgings on federal land near the pipeline’s route.A coordinator at the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, which runs medical and other services at the sprawling Oceti Sakowin camp and others, told The Guardian that they are prepared to continue providing care without government assistance. The evacuation order came after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has oversight of the camp area, announced Friday that it would close the area to the public on Dec. 5.The Army Corps softened its stance Sunday by saying it “has no plans for forcible removal” of protesters who disobey the deadline to leave. Overstaying the cutoff carries legal risks, however, as the Army Corps warned that protesters could be punished for violating federal, state or local laws. The Standing Rock Sioux had quickly vowed to disobey the Corps’ deadline to leave.The Oceti Sakowin camp is the main base for protesters who oppose the 1,172-mile pipeline, which begins in North Dakota and crosses through South Dakota and Iowa on its way to Illinois. Safety concerns also prompted the Army Crops’ decision last week to ban people from the area, Col. John Henderson, district commander of the Army Corps, said in a letter to Archambault last week. Recent clashes between protesters and police have become more violent, and the onset of North Dakota’s harsh winter will make it tough to deliver emergency services to anyone north of the Cannonball River, Henderson wrote.The Army Corps had encouraged the Sioux and its allies to relocate to a “free speech zone” for peaceful protest on the other bank of the Cannonball River, which is more accessible for police, fire and medical services. “We fully support the rights of all Americans to exercise free speech and peacefully assemble, and we ask that they do it in a way that does not also endanger themselves or others, or infringe on others’ rights,” Henderson said. Perhaps the most serious confrontation occurred last week when a woman was hit with an explosive device that witnesses said was thrown at her by police. Sophia Wilansky, 21, may lose her arm, her father said last week. The presence of protesters also interferes with a rancher’s grazing rights, according to Henderson. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, whose office has arrested more than 500 protesters, had criticized the Army Corps for backing off.The Army Corps “is basically kicking the can down the road, and all it is doing is taking the liability from the Corps and putting it on” the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, he told the Associated Press.The $3.8 billion privately built pipeline is largely complete except for a 20-mile section that would cross beneath Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux’s reservation. The tribe has sought to block its completion, saying that the Army Corps did not conduct a proper environmental review of its impact.The Obama administration will not grant a permit for the disputed section to Energy Transfer Partners, the developer, until a review of the tribe’s concerns that began in September is completed.

Have a tough time getting things done? You may have Mom and Dad to thank for that.Having a freewheeling, unpredictable daily home life as a child may have long-lasting negative effects, according to new research. The University at Albany study, published in the November-December issue of the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, found that children who grow up with predictable daily routines are less likely to have time management or attention problems as young adults. For the study, psychologists asked 292 undergraduates to assess the level of regularity of a variety of activities and routines from their childhood, including meals, extracurricular activities, sleeping habits and time spent with friends and family. They found that students who reported having more consistency in their daily lives as children tended to have fewer issues with attention and time management. In other studies, the same research team showed that children with a more regular routine also have better self-control and reduced anxiety and depression as adults. “This study is part of a broader line of research exploring the relationship between the stability of the family environment and adjustment in children, adolescents and emerging adults,” Dr. Jennifer Malatras, a psychologist at the University of Albany and the study’s lead author, told The Huffington Post. “Our research suggests greater regularity in family activities and routines is associated with fewer problems overall, and, importantly, we believe it may be possible to improve the regularity of family routines even when it may be less feasible to alter more global aspects of family stability.”Routines are likely to contribute to a sense of security and control over one’s environment. Children who know what to expect on a day-to-day basis are more likely to feel a sense of stability in their family than those whose daily schedules are more erratic, the researchers explain.This seems to be particularly true for children undergoing family hardships: Malatras’ previous research showed that consistency of daily activities had a positive impact on children who experienced major family changes like death or divorce. “A family going through divorce ... may be able to maintain or even increase the regularity and predictability of the family environment by ensuring that their children have consistent daily routines, such as a consistent bedtime routine or participation in extracurricular activities, which may serve as a protective factor,” she said. A number of other psychologists have also suggested that routines give children a sense of stability and comfort, and recommend that parents establish a rhythm of daily activities and traditions early in a child’s life.“Building routines with your children helps them feel safe,” Australian child psychologist Danielle Kaufman said in a recent interview. “They know what to expect when they go home, and it provides them with clear boundaries, expectations, and consistency.”Of course, an obvious limitation of the current study is that it relies on young adults’ memories of their childhood rather than actual data about their childhood routines. Still, the research suggests that routine is an important area for psychologists to explore further. “It is important to recognize the complexity of child development and the multiple influences that affect a child’s developmental trajectory,” Malatras said. “Promoting family stability during childhood and adolescence may enhance the development of skills that may be important in promoting adjustment and overall functioning.” "

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said Tuesday that the president-elect should either provide evidence of his claims that millions of people voted illegally or stop spreading a false message. “I don’t know what [Trump] is talking about,” Graham told The Huffington Post. “If he has evidence, bring it forward. If he doesn’t, he shouldn’t say things like that.”Graham said he plans to introduce a bipartisan resolution in the Senate to show confidence in the integrity of the 2016 elections.“I want people to believe — at least, the Senate be on record — that we believe the election is fair,” Graham said. “I’m sure there was problems, but it was free and fair.” Trump, in a string of tweets Sunday afternoon, made the astonishing ― and false ― claim that millions of people voted illegally on Nov. 8, allowing his opponent, Hillary Clinton, to win the popular vote. He alleged that without those illegitimate votes, he would have dominated the popular vote in addition to his victory in the Electoral College. There is absolutely no evidence to support Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud. He mentioned “serious voter fraud” in Virginia, New Hampshire and California — all states that voted for Clinton. Representatives from all three states have since come out to debunk Trump’s unfounded assertion. Graham emphasized that Trump, as president-elect, must understand his words now carry more weight than when he was a candidate. “He’s gotta realize he’s just not a normal person anymore,” Graham said. “He’s not a billionaire TV star — he’s the president of the United States. His words really resonate.”HuffPost asked several Republican senators about Trump’s claims of voter fraud, but Graham was the only one to answer directly. Sens. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), Dan Coats (Ind.) and Johnny Isakson (Ga.) are among those who said they didn’t want to discuss it.Some, like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), not only didn’t want to talk about it, but were outraged that reporters even asked. “I will not talk about Donald Trump,” McCain said Tuesday. “Tell all your friends, OK?”Asked another way about voter fraud claims, McCain answered: “I think the election has been decided, and I don’t even think about it.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) dismissed Trump’s claims of voter fraud when asked by reporters on Tuesday. “Secretary Clinton conceded the election and it appears to me she thinks the election is over,” McConnell said. “The American people think the election is over, and I think the election is over. So it’s an interesting discussion, but it strikes me as totally irrelevant and I’m gonna move on.”"
43,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi Torches Democrat Trying To Unseat Her As Party Leader,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-tim-ryan_us_583cb834e4b04b66c01b8498,"She called it ""pathetic"" that Rep. Tim Ryan says she just wants more power.",2016-11-29,Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) thinks the future of the Democratic Party hinges on fish fries. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) disagrees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58a912d2290000f616f2755b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tore into fellow Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) on Monday for suggesting she can’t lead the party with working-class voters, and called Ryan’s claims that she’s focused on empowering herself within their caucus “almost pathetic.”Both Pelosi and Ryan are vying for the job of House Democratic leader, whom the caucus will elect on Wednesday. Pelosi has led the party since 2003, and Ryan is making a long-shot bid to unseat her. He’s advocating a major shakeup in leadership and an expanded role for rank-and-file members after Democrats took a drubbing in the elections, due in large part to white working-class voters showing up in droves for President-elect Donald Trump.They are precisely the kind of people leaders like Pelosi have been ignoring, Ryan argues, and precisely the kind of people he represents in his district.“This election is not going to be won at fundraisers on the coasts,” the Ohio Democrat told The Wall Street Journal last week. “It’s going to be won in union halls in the industrial Midwest and fish fries in the Midwest and the South.”Ryan made the point again on NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday: “We’ve got to have someone who cannot just go on MSNBC, but go on Fox and Fox Business and CNBC, and go into union halls and fish fries and churches all over the country and start a brush fire about what a new Democratic Party looks like.”Pelosi mocked Ryan’s argument in an interview with The Huffington Post on Monday.“He didn’t even carry his district for Hillary Clinton,” Pelosi said with a laugh, “so I don’t know why he’s saying that.”“I have strong support from our friends in the unions, including steelworkers, which I guess are his area,” she continued. “You know what? If you want to come interview me, I’m happy to answer your questions about how we go forward. I’m not going to pay attention to, ‘I can’t step in a union hall.’ I’m a woman of steel in there. … I’m constantly invited by the unions to go to their meetings. That’s just not, it’s just not true.”“I don’t have enough time to receive all the invitations I have,” Pelosi added.The California Democrat is expected to remain the party’s leader; she’s said she already has the backing of two-thirds of the caucus. Ryan has six or seven Democrats publicly backing him. But heading into Wednesday’s election, he’s going after Pelosi for not doing enough to reform the caucus structure.Pelosi has advocated adding a freshman member to leadership and opening up the job of assistant Democratic leader to more members, but she doesn’t appear to be on board with some requests to make the leader of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee an elected position. The leader currently taps someone for this post.Pelosi is falling short of making the necessary internal changes, Ryan argued Monday, adding that she’s just trying to preserve her grip on the party.“It is evident that Leader Pelosi’s proposed reforms will only serve to further consolidate her power over the Caucus,” he said in a statement.Pelosi torched Ryan for suggesting as much.“It’s so completely not true that it’s almost pathetic,” she told HuffPost. “You know, it’s just not― it’s not what it is.”She said members have come to her and told her what kinds of changes they want. The process has been “liberating for me,” Pelosi said, because it’s given her the chance to shape leadership roles based on their input. “That gives legitimacy to whatever we do.”Pelosi added that she’s “heartbroken” and “shaken” by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s loss in the elections, but is ready to move forward as a unified party and push back against Trump’s policy plans that Democrats fundamentally oppose.“I’m so energized by the support of my colleagues and the commitment they are making to work,” she said.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to note that Nancy Pelosi has led the House Democratic caucus since 2003, not 2007."
44,POLITICS,New York Times Editorial Board Moves Gun Safety Conversation In The Wrong Direction,"Mike Weisser, ContributorMike the Gun Guy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-editorial-board-moves-gun-safety-conversation-in-the-wrong-direction_us_583dc9a6e4b0860d6116a8cc,"It’s official. The newspaper of record, a.k.a. the New York Times, has just announced its support of a new government statement",2016-11-29,"Pistols made by weapons manufacturer CZ sit on display inside the ExCeL centre in London on September 15, 2015, during the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583dd4221a00000b03cca4a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s official. The newspaper of record, a.k.a. the New York Times, has just announced its support of a new government statement on safe-gun technology which probably represents the last thing the Obama administration has to say about guns. And if the New York Times believes that this report is the non-plus-ultra statement about safe guns, then this must be a very solid and very impressive report. In fact, it’s not. The report is an amateurish cut-and-paste job which was obviously put together so that someone deep inside the bowels of the Department of Justice could complete some end-of-year checklist and get on with looking for a new job. But of course once the New York Times gives this report its official imprimatur you can bet this shabby effort to make something out of nothing will become the new argument for adoption of safe-gun technologies, an argument that has been floating around for more than 20 years under the guise of how digital innovation can help us be safe with guns. Entitled “Baseline Specifications for Law Enforcement Service Pistols with Security Technology,” the report is an effort to nudge the safe-gun discussion a little further by setting out design and performance standards that would have to be met by any manufacturer hoping to sell such a product to any federal agency whose personnel carries guns. Actually, since the document is not any kind of official RFP, it represents no legal or practical advance at all. For the most part, the text consists of nothing more than a combination of the government’s handgun performance criteria which will be used to possibly adopt a new military handgun sometime in the future, along with design specifications which were taken from an RFP issued by the FBI for a new pistol awarded to Glock.Buried near the end of the report is a brief section which describes the safe-gun technology itself except that all it basically says is that some kind of ‘security device’ will be a permanent part of the gun, will be programmable and may include something worn by the operator, like a wristband or a ring. By the way, if the security device ‘malfunctions’ the gun will still work.Now I thought the whole point of safe-gun technology is to prevent a gun from being used at any time except by someone digitally authorized to use the gun. But the problem with these digital gizmos is they need some kind of power source which comes from a battery and batteries wear out. Is the average cop going to check to make sure while he’s on the job that the gizmo is always ready to go? He won’t, which is exactly why the gun defaults to being used by anyone which is exactly why nobody’s going to adopt this gun.The NYT Editorial Board says this report is a positive step forward in the development of safe-gun technology because it creates “industry standards for reliable battery power in a smart gun, for ensuring unhindered speed in drawing the weapon and for the distance allowed between the gun and its owner’s ID device.” In fact, what the report does is give the gun lobby an excellent opportunity to once again claim that gun-grabbing bureaucrats will find any reason to take away our guns. The NRA called the report another example of “empty gestures meant to placate a gun control constituency that was disappointed Congress had spurned efforts to restrict Second Amendment rights,” and went on to list several parts of the report (beyond what I mentioned above) which demonstrated the lack of substance and understanding about the actual use of safe guns.The gun industry opposes safe-gun technology because it fights any effort to reduce gun violence through government mandates, government regulations or anything else that interferes with the industry’s ability to control the kinds of products it decides to put out for sale. But the gun violence prevention community shouldn’t make it any easier for the gun lobby to pursue its aims, and the decision of the NYT Editorial Board to promote this report moves the safe-gun argument in a direction it shouldn’t take."

The night before Thanksgiving 2016. I am dining at a posh Italian restaurant just two blocks from the famed Richard Rodgers Theatre. At the table are my wife, three children, and a former student who sat in my World History class over sixteen years ago. Before I explain the details of the gathering, it is important to note at the outset that, in retrospect, I consider this dinner to be, perhaps, one of the highlights of my life. The reason has nothing to do with the awkwardly loquacious waiter or the exquisite pasta we consumed that night. Instead, it has everything to do with the fact that this dinner served as a brief but lovely intersection of virtually everything I revere and love in this life: The ineffable affection I feel for my extraordinary family. My passion for teaching and the faith I have in the power of the classroom to transform lives.My unwavering hopes of watching students achieve their own dreams.My reverence for America and the fire of potentiality it never fails to stoke.You see, this wasn’t just any former student and it wasn’t a mere coincidence that we were eating just a few blocks from Broadway. My former student, Voltaire Wade-Greene, is an original cast member of perhaps the greatest American artistic triumph in the past decade, Lin Manuel Miranda’s resplendent Broadway smash, Hamilton: An American Musical. In my memory, however, Voltaire is still a somewhat awkward but extraordinarily kind 14-year-old freshman high school student. He is a wonderful mental relic from the beginning of my teaching career, a young man with a ubiquitous smile who never uttered a negative word or sentiment about anyone or anything. I was a young teacher when he sat in my classroom, a newly wed with no children and no sense of where my teaching career might lead me someday. Indeed, I was a neophyte to adult life itself, gleeful to simply have a job and only vaguely aware of just how much I would grow to love the life of a teacher.Voltaire is now a thirty year-year old man and yet he still radiates a glow of authentic humility and kindness. It quickly becomes apparent that he has grown to be impressively urbane and cerebral. He regales my two daughters—who have been singing/rapping/speaking the words from Hamilton, ad infinitum, for months now—with tales about celebrities who come back stage, the serpentine tale of how he came to be in the show, and what life is like when one is a part of a certified cultural phenomenon. My oldest daughter teeters on the border of tears when he starts the meal by announcing that he has come “bearing gifts,” and presents everyone in my family with a copy of the Hamilton Playbill bearing the autographs of the cast on the cover.Indeed, Voltaire has hung out with President Obama, performed at the Tony Awards, and has been in the presence of everyone from Mike Tyson and Kareem Abdul Jabbar to Ben Stiller and Madonna. We laugh about his time in my class and of my antics as a young teacher. But there was something else about this older and impressive Voltaire that I found utterly exalting and laudatory, something it has taken me a few days to recognize and mentally digest. During our conversation he didn’t simply remember a few details from specific lessons or recall the finer points of the World History curriculum. No, he remembered many of my words verbatim, as if they had been etched into a Greek column instead of written on a chalkboard, more Delphic oracle than novice high school teacher. He passionately quoted back to me expressions and lessons that had particularly impressed him, utterances that I honestly do not even remember making.I was already thankful to Voltaire for giving my family and me the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to attend Hamilton in New York City. The power of the play is almost beyond elucidation for those of us who are unabashed lovers of the American creed, who are apostles of this experiment in self-government, and who truly believe that the advent of liberal democracy is perhaps the greatest development in all of human history. But as I reflect on the day my family and I attended Hamilton, my thoughts turn not to a towering historic figure, but to my former student and friend. Without realizing it, since Voltaire has left my classroom I have lowered my expectations of what education can and should be. My younger self would have expected him to remember and recall impactful classroom moments and articulate how the lessons of human history affected him for the better. However, after a decade of teaching in an era of high stakes testing—for both state tests and Advanced Placement exams—I now realize how timid I have become in middle age, how saturated I now am in the membrane of pedagogic practicality. Would Voltaire even recognize this forty-year old teacher who now plays it safe, never venturing too far from the curriculum or the syllabus? Saint Paul used the Areopagus to prod the slumbering souls of Athens. Cicero stood at the rostrum to jar the ennui out of his fellow Romans. Great teachers use their classrooms to lionize the consequential and substantial elements of life, hoping to forge horizons of higher purpose within their students. Somewhere along the way I have come to expect my students to forget most of the content I teach, cynically assuming many of them are more Machiavellian test-takers than Socratic truth-seekers. In the midst of my conversation with Voltaire, I was reminded of the youthful optimism and vitality I once embraced at the dawn of my teaching career, believing that one day, one class, or one lesson might transform the life of a student.Perhaps I had forgotten what I once knew to be true: education is not a form of secular sermonizing nor is it a therapeutic conditioning of one’s students to set sanitized goals or pursue prosaic passions. Education, at its best, is expansive and aspirational in nature, pushing the intellectual and emotional frontiers of what young people know or are comfortable considering, all in the hopes of ennobling their character and cultivating their minds.But beyond his kind words and generosity, Voltaire’s success is a powerful reminder that all students are a work in progress. In a truly democratic chorus, a teacher never knows whose voice will someday rise above the rest, whose words will resonate or whose actions will inspire. Indeed, it is not always the valedictorian who writes the great American novel. It is not always the test-taking maestros who show the most grit or who embrace the most arduous grind. Often it is the student who labors in quiet isolation, whose imagination is unformed but vast. It is the student who asks the earnest question, not the one who exudes haughty certainty. One never knows what will become of our students as they grow and mature. But once in a while the faith of a teacher is vindicated by the radiance of a former student’s words and character. My dinner with Voltaire was a poignant and powerful reminder that as I reach the mid-point of my career I should embody the spirit of Hamilton, a spirit that was perpetually “young, scrappy, and hungry.” "

Sisneros said in August that he was considering voting against Trump if the real estate mogul were to win the popular vote in Texas. But he told Politico Monday that he would instead resign.The rest of the country’s 538 electors will choose Sisneros’ replacement when they convene on Dec. 19 to officially elect Trump as the next president. All of Texas’ 38 electoral votes are expected to go to Trump, who beat Hillary Clinton in the state by more than 800,000 votes.“The people will get their vote,” Sisneros wrote. “I will sleep well at night knowing I neither gave in to their demands nor caved to my convictions. I will also mourn the loss of our republic.”"

OSU police said an officer fatally shot the student, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, less than a minute after the attack began.Students and staff were milling around outside a science building after a fire alarm had gone off when man drove his car over a curb and plowed into them, authorities said. The man then left the vehicle and began attacking people with the knife.None of the 11 victims sustained life-threatening injuries, but one is in critical condition. Authorities declined to speculate on the suspect’s motive or a possible connection to terrorism. The FBI has joined as a partner in the investigation.The school sent out an emergency alert at 9:56 a.m., telling students: “Active Shooter on campus. Run Hide Fight.” The campus remained on lockdown for about 90 minutes. “Run, hide, fight” is the phrase that the Department of Homeland Security advises as the default response to an active-shooter situation. The order suggests that people in danger should run if they’re able to and seek shelter if they cannot. A person’s last resort is to fight in order to “incapacitate” an attacker approaching them. “I was sitting in my dorm room and heard gunshots and 10 seconds later heard sirens,” Stephen Yunker, an OSU freshman, told The Huffington Post via Twitter. “Looked outside to see a fire truck + cops a couple streets away and a body laying on the ground.” “Smelled what was like gun smoke as people rushed into buildings,” Mackenzie Bart, another student at the university, said over Twitter. “Police and fire were everywhere. Got locked into a building with just 4 other girls and pushed everything we could find against a door.” OSU student Jake Bowers said he was “100 feet from the guy with the knife” when the suspect drew the weapon. He was outside between the science buildings Kolffolt Labs and Watts Hall as the scene unfolded, he told HuffPost over Twitter. “The man just stared at the cop, didn’t say anything,” Bowers said.

And it summed up parenthood pretty well. Kara Lewis Newton posted a photo of herself holding a container of chopped celery on Facebook. In the caption, Newton explained she was taking the celery to her son’s school because she missed a note in his folder instructing them to send it to school with him that day. “So I’m driving it to him praying that he gets it on time,” she wrote.Newton and her husband, Luke, have three kids ― 11-year-old Silas, 10-year-old Lila and 6-year-old Jack.In her post, she opened up about her imperfections as a parent.“I miss things,” she wrote. “My kids don’t always have clean socks. We ate at Wendy’s last night. I forget to RSVP to parties. We never have cash when we need it. My kid doesn’t always have his coat. There might be Halloween candy in their lunches. I sign without reading sometimes. And I don’t always check my kids folders.”But, she added, she loves her children and works “dang hard” to support and care for them. “I’m banking on the fact that 20 years from now, they won’t remember that their mom forgot the chopped celery,” she wrote.“I am praying they remember how hard I fought for them everyday to have a good life ... one where they know they are fiercely loved no matter what,” she concluded. Newton’s post received over 55,000 likes. It also appeared on the Love What Matters Facebook page, where it received almost 100,000 likes. The mom told The Huffington Post she shared the post because she’d been feeling overwhelmed and guilty after some recent mess-ups. “I knew that if I were struggling to keep up, other moms had to be, too,” she said. “I figured my ‘real life’ confessions might encourage someone else.”Newton thinks her post resonated with other parents because these small failures and feelings of inadequacy are common. The mom said she has a hard time juggling a full-time job, marriage, three children, a house and non-stop activities.“No matter how organized and together we may be, we always feel like we’ve missed something,” she explained. “Every mom at some point in time feels like she is failing. In a world of social media, where everyone posts the ‘highs’ of their day, we are often left feeling like we don’t measure up.”Ultimately, she thinks parents just need to know they’re not alone. “We all feel the insane pressure to be perfect, and yet … at the end of the day, the most important thing is that our kids know we love them,” the mom said.Newton told HuffPost she’s received lots of messages from fellow moms thanking her for her honesty. “So many women are doing this every day, just like me, and I think its just nice to feel like we are all in this together,” she said.She added that she believes her post reminds parents that “what we do isn’t as important as how we make our children feel.”Said Newton, “Yes, I forgot the celery, but when they comes home from school, I smother them with kisses. I tell them I love them every day. I snuggle before bed, and I make sure all three of them know that I love them fiercely.”"

Julia Jones, a screenwriter who had a working relationship with Bannon, told The New York Times on Sunday that the chief executive of Breitbart News would discuss the genetic superiority of certain people and expressed that perhaps it wouldn’t be bad to disenfranchise people who didn’t own property.“I said, ‘That would exclude a lot of African-Americans,’” Ms. Jones recalled. “He said, ‘Maybe that’s not such a bad thing.’ I said, ‘But what about Wendy?’” referring to Mr. Bannon’s executive assistant. “He said, ‘She’s different. She’s family.’”Allowing only property owners to vote wouldn’t just disenfranchise black people. It would also limit the rights of Latinos, poor people, students and two-thirds of the U.S. population.The idea that only a certain class of people should vote is one held by Trump himself. He has advocated for a literal interpretation of the Constitution, which would limit the right to vote to wealthy white men like himself and Bannon. He also has said on multiple occasions that his success is a direct result of his “good genes” and “breeding.” Genetics granting the intellect that ensures financial success is an idea deeply ingrained in white nationalism. Before being appointed to a senior position in Trump’s White House, Bannon served as the chief executive of Trump’s campaign, and his nomination did little to help Trump raise his dismal approval numbers among black voters since Breitbart.com is a refuge for white supremacists.

An aimless radical who had yet to find his path in life, he had come to see firsthand the liberal reforms being carried out by Guatemala’s democratically elected leader, Jacobo Arbenz. The most consequential of them, it would turn out, was his effort at land redistribution. Arbenz proposed seizing the uncultivated land held by the company United Fruit, and compensating the firm by paying it the full amount it had claimed the land was worth in its latest tax filings. Unfortunately for Arbenz, then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother, Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA, were both effectively paid agents of United Fruit, which was represented by their law firm, Sullivan and Cromwell. They were also zealous Cold Warriors, and believed deeply that Arbenz was a communist, regardless of whether he admitted it.The CIA launched a coup, led by several hundred U.S.-backed rebels, and backed by U.S. bombs and a substantial propaganda campaign both in print and on the radio. Stephen Kinzer, in his dual biography of the Dulles brothers, writes that the Eisenhower-approved coup left a lasting impression on the young man, Guevara, who happened to be in the capital as the coup was carried out: Later he told Castro why it succeeded. He said Arbenz had foolishly tolerated an open society, which the CIA penetrated and subverted, and also preserved the existing army, which the CIA turned into its instrument. Castro agreed that a revolutionary regime in Cuba must avoid those mistakes. Upon taking power, he cracked down on dissent and purged the army.None of this means the U.S. is directly responsible for the decisions Castro made, or for the path he took Cuba down. None of it justifies or excuses human rights abuses or the subjugation of an entire people. What Castro did is his own.But the conditions he operated under matter, and if Arbenz was an example for Guevara and Fidel Castro of what not to do, his successor regime offered a different lesson. The U.S.-backed military dictatorship that took over killed tens of thousands and crushed dissent. The debate over Castro’s legacy is being waged on familiar grounds, with his opponents condemning him as an irredeemable tyrant and his defenders arguing that the good he did around the world and for the Cuban people outweighs the black mark of his human rights record and his leveling of Cuban civil society.The conversation in the U.S. often goes on, however, as if Castro were operating in a vacuum. It may well be that Castro’s own personality, or pressure from the Soviet Union, would have pushed him regardless toward the hard-line communism that came to dominate Cuba. But when Castro took over, observers in Cuba, the U.S. and around the world felt there was a chance Castro would be a nationalist reformer rather than an orthodox communist. Looking back at the experience of Arbenz, Castro and Guevara had good reason to believe the U.S. would do whatever was in its power to overthrow the new government, whether the regime was in the camp of liberal reform or hard-line communism. Arbenz, after all, had been elected and his term in office was nearly up when the U.S. came for him. The CIA had done the same the year before to the democratically elected Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran, who was by no means a communist.And, in 1961, the same planners of the Guatemalan coup organized a new one against Cuba, this one ending in the debacle known as the Bay of Pigs. It came just a few months after a U.S.-backed plot had brutally assassinated the elected leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Patrice Lumumba, another nationalist the Dulles brothers believed was a secret communist. If the United States had been serious about wanting to spread democracy around the world, perhaps it should have shown more respect for and to democracies.Sign up here to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox."

Part of the road that was rebuilt after a massive sinkhole in downtown Fukuoka, Japan, was closed off over the weekend when authorities noticed the pavement had sunk slightly. Authorities said the road had lowered by nearly 3 inches and the area was closed for a few hours to perform a safety check. No injuries were reported or damage done, so the road was reopened.Earlier this month, it took just two days for workers to fill the sinkhole that left a space measuring 98 feet long and 49 feet deep. Authorities kept the road closed for a week as they tested the pavement to ensure the area was safe for traffic and pedestrians. According to The Japan Times, city officials said the mix of soil and cement used to fill the sinkhole could have compressed a layer of ground underneath the road, causing the pavement to sink slightly. CNN reported that Fukuoka’s mayor Soichiro Takashima apologized in a message posted to Facebook for not warning residents that the road could sink again in the future. At the time of the road’s reopening, the mayor had said the ground was now 30 times stronger than before."

The patient, a 43-year-old woman from Brownsville, had not traveled anywhere with ongoing Zika transmissions, including Mexico.“Based on the information we have, this patient has a negative blood test which indicates that she can no longer spread the infection by mosquito,” Dr. James Castillo, Cameron County health authority said in a statement provided to HuffPost. He continued:This is a reminder that everyone should remain vigilant about Zika. If a woman is pregnant or is considering becoming pregnant, she should be evaluated for possible Zika virus exposure during each prenatal care visit. Each evaluation should include an assessment of signs and symptoms of Zika virus disease such as fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis.The local health department is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health authorities to investigate the Cameron County case, including door-to-door screening and mosquito control efforts, such as spraying.The Texas patient, who is not pregnant, has the first locally acquired case in the United States outside of Florida. As of Nov. 23, Florida has 238 locally acquired Zika cases on record and 170 cases of Zika virus in pregnant women, according to the Florida Health Department. Zika virus, which spread rapidly through Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015 and 2016, is especially dangerous for pregnant women because it is linked to the birth defect microcephaly, which can cause brain damage, seizures, deafness, blindness and other neurological problems.This article image has been updated to include a female Aedes aegypti mosquito, the type that carries Zika virus."

The northern region of the reef, off the coast of Queensland in northeastern Australia, lost an average 67 percent of its shallow-water corals in the last eight to nine months, the Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies reported. The news confirms predictions experts have been making since the spring, when scientists first noted that the 1,400-mile-long reef was experiencing its third and most severe coral bleaching event in the past 18 years, giving the structure little time to recover in between. Coral bleaching, in which the usually vibrant corals fade to white and algae is driven out, occurs in response to the stress of changing habitat conditions. This bleaching is caused by higher water temperatures linked to climate change, the ARC center’s director, Terry Hughes, told The Huffington Post. While corals can recover from bleaching, they’re prone to die if temperatures stay high for too long.“Most of the losses in 2016 have occurred in the northern, most-pristine part of the Great Barrier Reef,” Hughes said in a news release. “This region escaped with minor damage in two earlier bleaching events in 1998 and 2002, but this time around it has been badly affected.” A die-off of this scale, he told HuffPost, is unprecedented.“To lose two-thirds of the coral along [the northern region] is a huge loss,” he said. “It’s far bigger than any individual cyclone would cause. The path of the cyclone has a destructive track of maybe 50 miles wide. We’re talking about something that’s eight times bigger than that.”Recovery in the northern region could take as long as 15 years, but the center worries another bleaching event could occur sooner than that.Despite the dire news, Hughes maintains that it’s not too late. He told The Huffington Post last month that declaring the reef dead ― as Outside Magazine did in a viral obituary for it in October ― would be speaking too soon. “The message should be that it isn’t too late for Australia to lift its game and better protect the GBR, not we should all give up because the GBR is supposedly dead,” he said. Other parts of the reef, Monday’s report noted, presented some hopeful news: Just 6 percent of the central region’s bleached corals and 1 percent of the southern region’s were found to have died in 2016. In one swath of reefs along the eastern edge of the continental shelf in the far north, die-off was much lower than the other northern reefs, likely due to the “upwelling of cooler water from the Coral Sea,” Hughes said. UPDATE: This post has been updated with comments on the cause of the bleaching event by ARC center director Terry Hughes."

59,POLITICS,Study Seeks To Measure 'Scalia-Ness' Of Donald Trump's Supreme Court Picks,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supreme-court-antonin-scalia_us_583c7d0fe4b01ba68ac57c58,"It's not a perfect science, but it adds substance to the president-elect's ""definitive"" list of candidates.",2016-11-28,Some say Justice Antonin Scalia is irreplaceable. But is he really?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583c9d981800009314310444.jpeg?cache=Zkvs6gOQDj&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump won the election in part because he convinced conservative voters that he was the only one who could preserve the Supreme Court legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.A new study seeks to put that notion to the test by measuring the “Scalia-ness” of the 21 candidates the president-elect put forth ahead of the November election ― a shortlist he promised to abide by if Americans chose him as the next appointer in chief.“This list is definitive, and I will choose only from it,” Trump vowed in September, persuading even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who had declined to endorse him at the Republican National Convention, to finally jump on board.Unmoved by Trump’s rhetoric, the authors of the forthcoming “Searching for Justice Scalia” looked at each of his pre-nominees’ judicial record and assessed it against variables that could be attributed to the late justice, who died in February and whose seat has remained vacant.The three key variables are adherence to the doctrine of originalism, citations to Scalia’s non-judicial writings and how often the candidate was willing to dissent or write separately from his or her colleagues on whatever court he or she sat ― something Scalia was known for.“We thought there must be some way to at least put a number on it ― a quantifiable measure so we’re not throwing out catchphrases,” said Mercer University law professor Jeremy Kidd, one of the study’s coauthors.To get there, Kidd and fellow empiricists Riddhi Sohan Dasgupta, Ryan Walters and James Phillips scoured published opinions from a legal database and crunched the instances when each of Trump’s potential nominees paid homage to Scalia ― by, say, writing about the Constitution’s so-called original meaning or citing his treatise on interpreting the law. The study acknowledges these benchmarks are “less than perfect” and offers areas where metrics fall short. But the goal, Kidd said, was to try “to add some substance to what otherwise has been a substance-less discussion” and to pinpoint which of Trump’s picks might “fill [Scalia’s] space in terms of the jurisprudence well enough.”Once all was said and done, each judge in the study was given a Scalia index score:Unrivaled at the top of Trump’s list is Thomas Lee, a justice on the Utah Supreme Court and the brother of Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) ― who, ironically, was left out of the study because he lacks a judicial record. (A staunch Trump critic, Lee didn’t seem impressed by his high court nod.)Also high up on Kidd’s analysis are federal appeals judges Neil Gorsuch and William Pryor, relatively young jurists who are leading lights in conservative legal circles. The study authors are quick to note a number of caveats to their methodology.

60,POLITICS,Study Seeks To Measure 'Scalia-Ness' Of Donald Trump's Supreme Court Picks,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supreme-court-antonin-scalia_us_583c7d0fe4b01ba68ac57c58,"It's not a perfect science, but it adds substance to the president-elect's ""definitive"" list of candidates.",2016-11-28,"The ""Scalia-ness"" of 15 of Donald Trump's Supreme Court candidates, based on their references to originalism, reverence for his writings and solo opinions. Not everyone on Trump's shortlist had enough of a record to measure.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583c9bc31a00000b03cca1b6.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump won the election in part because he convinced conservative voters that he was the only one who could preserve the Supreme Court legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.A new study seeks to put that notion to the test by measuring the “Scalia-ness” of the 21 candidates the president-elect put forth ahead of the November election ― a shortlist he promised to abide by if Americans chose him as the next appointer in chief.“This list is definitive, and I will choose only from it,” Trump vowed in September, persuading even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who had declined to endorse him at the Republican National Convention, to finally jump on board.Unmoved by Trump’s rhetoric, the authors of the forthcoming “Searching for Justice Scalia” looked at each of his pre-nominees’ judicial record and assessed it against variables that could be attributed to the late justice, who died in February and whose seat has remained vacant.The three key variables are adherence to the doctrine of originalism, citations to Scalia’s non-judicial writings and how often the candidate was willing to dissent or write separately from his or her colleagues on whatever court he or she sat ― something Scalia was known for.“We thought there must be some way to at least put a number on it ― a quantifiable measure so we’re not throwing out catchphrases,” said Mercer University law professor Jeremy Kidd, one of the study’s coauthors.To get there, Kidd and fellow empiricists Riddhi Sohan Dasgupta, Ryan Walters and James Phillips scoured published opinions from a legal database and crunched the instances when each of Trump’s potential nominees paid homage to Scalia ― by, say, writing about the Constitution’s so-called original meaning or citing his treatise on interpreting the law. The study acknowledges these benchmarks are “less than perfect” and offers areas where metrics fall short. But the goal, Kidd said, was to try “to add some substance to what otherwise has been a substance-less discussion” and to pinpoint which of Trump’s picks might “fill [Scalia’s] space in terms of the jurisprudence well enough.”Once all was said and done, each judge in the study was given a Scalia index score:Unrivaled at the top of Trump’s list is Thomas Lee, a justice on the Utah Supreme Court and the brother of Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) ― who, ironically, was left out of the study because he lacks a judicial record. (A staunch Trump critic, Lee didn’t seem impressed by his high court nod.)Also high up on Kidd’s analysis are federal appeals judges Neil Gorsuch and William Pryor, relatively young jurists who are leading lights in conservative legal circles. The study authors are quick to note a number of caveats to their methodology. For one, some candidates simply could not be assessed because they didn’t have a paper trail, had no experience in a multi-member appeals court or were simply too old to realistically have a shot at leaving a lasting impression on the Supreme Court.This meant several names were not given a score for Scalia-ness and thus were crossed out: Mike Lee, Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Robert Young, Florida Supreme Court Justice Charles Canady, U.S. District Judge Amul Thapar of Kentucky and U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno of Florida.It’s also quite a different ballgame to work on a state’s highest court ― as do almost half of Trump’s candidates, who may not get as many chances to interpret the U.S. Constitution ― than working as an intermediate appellate judge, who is constrained by precedent and may have less freedom to wax romantic about Scalia’s legal contributions.“Comparison of the two very different types of judges is a bit of an apples-to-oranges scenario: Not only are the two types of judges constrained differently by precedent, they also are unlikely to hear the exact same mix of cases,” the study said.Other judges, like Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen, simply don’t have enough of a tenure to measure their Scalia-ness, and thus their numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.

Charlie Smith told KSLA. “She just has a couple scratches on her,” Johnson said. “She did not cry until she got into the ambulance.”Johnson credited Smith and fellow firefighter Josh Moore with finding the child, with the help of a good Samaritan at the scene. The station said Moore was visibly emotional as he spoke to reporters. “Up until we heard her, I was just worried about it being more of a recovery rather than a rescue, but once we heard her, it was just a sigh of relief,” he told the local TV station. “They were just relieved,” Johnson said, “and I believe one of the firefighters described it as a miracle.”Moore echoed that sentiment.“There had to be some kind of divine intervention for her to end up being OK,” he told the station.No injuries were reported in the crash, which involved an 18-wheeler. The driver of that truck was cited for an improper and unsafe lane change, KSLA reported.Police told the station that the infant was sitting in a car seat at the time of the crash, but the seat was not properly installed and the baby was not properly fastened. There were no citations related to the lack of restraints. "

Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), to look into President-elect Donald Trump’s financial entanglements and make sure he’s not breaking the law.“The scope of Mr. Trump’s conflicts of interest around the world is unprecedented,” the 17 Democrats on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee wrote. “Over the past two weeks, new revelations have raised serious concerns about the intermingling of Mr. Trump’s businesses and his responsibilities as president.”Trump’s potential conflicts of interest are staggering, with business interests across the globe and no clear firewall between those businesses and the office of the presidency. Trump had said previously that he would enter into a blind trust, which would require him to sell many of his businesses and be unaware of his holdings, but he’s backed away from those promises. Trump also said he would step away from his dealings and have his children run day-to-day operations. But several of Trump’s children are intimately involved in his political operation ― Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. are all on the presidential transition team ― and simply handing over the businesses to his children wouldn’t disassociate Trump from his enterprises. He still knows what businesses he owns.Trump’s potential conflicts of interest have already raised serious questions about his actions and the actions of foreign governments. Just three days after a phone call between Trump and Argentine President Mauricio Macri, the development company building the $100 million Trump Tower in Buenos Aires said construction could begin as soon as June 2017.Trump also owes a foreign bank over $300 million, and has foreign diplomats booking hotel reservations at his hotel in Washington, D.C., so they can curry favor with the president.Trump himself seems unconcerned about the potential conflicts of interest. In an interview with The New York Times last week, the president-elect offered the Nixonian thought that “the president can’t have a conflict of interest.”As the letter noted, no one truly has a handle on Trump’s finances, since his exorbitant wealth has allowed him to list assets in overly broad financial disclosure categories, and he’s kept his tax returns private.“Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns has already demonstrated a troubling lack of transparency and accountability, making it even more critical that the Committee conduct rigorous oversight right away ― before he is sworn in as President,” the letter said.The ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), asked for a congressional probe of Trump’s potential conflicts of interest two weeks ago. Democrats say they have yet to hear back from Chaffetz. A Huffington Post request for comment from an Oversight spokeswoman on Monday was not returned.Chaffetz had promised a thorough investigation of Hillary Clinton when she was expected to win the presidency. Even after the election, Chaffetz said he still wanted to investigate Clinton’s handling of a private email server to determine if she had broken the law. (An FBI investigation determined that she had not.)“You acted with unprecedented urgency to hold ‘emergency’ hearings and issue multiple unilateral subpoenas to investigate Secretary Clinton before the election,” the letter said Monday. “We ask that you show the same sense of urgency now.”Chaffetz promised rigorous oversight in August, saying he didn’t care which party won the White House. “My job is not to be a cheerleader for the president. My job is to hold them accountable and to provide that oversight,” he said then.“If you’re going to run and try to become the president of the United States, you’re going to have to open up your kimono and show everything, your tax returns, your medical records,” he went on. “You are... just going to have to do that.”Here’s the full letter:November 28, 2016"

It recommended modernizing registration systems. It did not state that illegal immigrants were voting.Trump’s critics said his latest remarks were yet more evidence that Trump lacks the emotional maturity or temperament to perform the duties of the office he is about to hold.Tony Schwartz, Trump’s ghostwriter for his Art of the Deal best-seller that was the basis for his reality TV show “The Apprentice,” answered Trump’s Sunday tweets with: “Trump loses it whenever he feels vulnerable, which is often. Must recognize reality: We have a president-elect who is mentally unbalanced.”And Evan McMullin, a Republican who ran as an independent candidate, responded to Trump’s “millions” of illegal votes tweet with the warning: “It should not go unrecognized that @realDonaldTrump’s effort to inflate his election performance without cause is typical of autocrats.”But the RNC member ― who like most in the RNC was not originally a fan of the New York City businessman ― said he has come to see that Trump is a master of reading the national landscape and manipulating it to his own ends.“It’s clear to me, at this moment, that he understands the public, the media, and the left better than I ever imagined,” he said, adding that “the left’s” push for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were designed to weaken Trump. “He is concerned that weeks will drag on with discussions about the legitimacy of his presidency. ... So once again he changes the discussion.”Green Party candidate Jill Stein is asking for recounts in those three states. The Clinton campaign has stated that it believes the results, while close, will not change in a recount, and that it has seen no evidence to question the tallies.

But a castaway rescue turned into a heated custody battle when González’s father in Cuba demanded the United States return the boy to the island.

He also praised the late revolutionary leader and asked that he remain “omnipresent,” according to the Associated Press. “Fidel began to be a father, initially they all start as fathers but what’s difficult is to have a father become a friend,” González said holding back tears. “And he was a father who, like with my father, I wanted to show him everything I achieved.

González not only spoke about his close relationship with Castro over the years but also assured viewers that his legacy would live on. “Fidel’s legacy is each Cuban and person in the world who has been touched by the revolution,” he said, according to USA Today. “Fidel’s legacy is in each person affected by our programs, in every life saved from Ebola, in every Haitian saved with our missions, in every Latin American who has had eye surgery.”Watch a clip of González’s interview above.

Jeb Bush.Florida’s “stand your ground” law protects people who use deadly force when citing self-defense ― even if escape is an option. The law received increased scrutiny in the wake of George Zimmerman’s fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager. Although Zimmerman’s lawyers did not invoke the law during his defense, a juror told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that it affected the jury’s “not guilty” verdict.The National Rifle Association pushed for and helped draft the legislation. Following its passage, then-Miami Police Chief John Timoney called the law a “license to murder” and warned it could drive an increase of lethal force “where it shouldn’t be used.”Florida was the first of more than 20 states to expand similar self-defense legislation. While some experts are skeptical of the link between these laws and increased killings, “a 2013 academic study that compared 20 ‘stand your ground’ states with states where the duty to retreat still exists found an 8 percent increase in homicide associated with the laws,” according to The Wall Street Journal.CLARIFICATION: Language has been changed to reflect more accurately the role of Florida’s “stand your ground” law in the Martin trial."

Prevalent throughout each of these discussions is the notion of normalization—less formally known as the ways in which American media culture will try to convince us this isn’t the massive national fuck-up that it actually is. Already we’ve seen disturbing examples of news organizations trying to treat Trump’s regularly disturbing remarks (such as falsely suggesting that he lost the popular vote as the result of a legion of fraudulent ballots or all but celebrating the death of a prominent world leader on Twitter) as though they were--at worst--gaffes and--at best--examples of the president-elect’s worldview, meant to be absorbed without scrutiny. In short, they have already put the lipstick on the pig. We are now in the process of convincing us that that pig is the belle of the ball. Perhaps even more distressing than the way in which this attitude has manifested with regards to Trump is the way in which media has employed it as a way to soften his more radical supporters and appointments, such as newly minted chief-strategist and old school bigot Steve Bannon. Bannon—a prominent figure among white nationalists, and a man who looks as though he has no sheets clean enough to make a Klan robe colored anything remotely resembling white—has a storied history of racism and Anti-Semitism, not to mention domestic violence. If Donald Trump peddles white supremacy like a sleazy used car salesman, Bannon does so like a pornographer on the Silk Road, making zero effort to polish the rancid shit that he has chosen as his product. He’s unrepentant and gleeful.But you wouldn’t know this from the way the largest of news organizations have chosen to discuss him. In most “mainstream” coverage, Bannon is simply unorthodox, a political newbie who just so happens to have some unconventional proclivities. He is nothing more to the likes of CNN than the latest of Trump’s maverick decisions, where “maverick” ultimately translates to fundamentally socially repellant. This treatment is not unique to Bannon, however. In fact, the entire ‘alt-right’ has received this makeover. A movement predicated at best on anti-democratic prejudice and at most realistic on openly violent white supremacy has been rebranded as the new kids on the block, with Mother Jones and the Los Angeles Times going so far as to try to play up the hipness of its adherents as those there was something glitzy and entrepreneurial about treating the ugliest currents of American history as if they were political oil wells. Apparently, racism can be dolled up with the same ease as a homely Rachael Leigh Cook: lose the overalls, glasses, and ponytail (or in this case, unapologetically violent rhetoric, penchant for merry online harassment and rape threats, and undisguised fascism kink) and you’ve got yourself a perfectly suitable lead. It should go without saying that this is a trend Americans should condemn without hesitation, but, beyond that, what can we do to combat attempts to make the politically aberrant (if historically enabled) normal? Here’s an easy one: cut out the ‘alt-right’ bullshit.Unless you’re discussing the history of the movement, there is absolutely no reason to call this latest incarnation of social rot anything other than what it is: racism, white nationalism, white supremacism, politically coalesced and organized hatred. Do you go around calling Hitler’s groupies the National Socialist German Worker’s Party? How often do you refer to members of the Klan as Loyal White Knights? If you think addressing Bannon and his ilk as the ‘alt-right’ is a matter of accuracy, you should consider just how much the title does to erase what the movement actually stands for. You should also do a deep dive into American conservatism and try to find out what the social views of men like Bannon are actually an alternative to. Because ultimately, ‘alt-right’ is simply window dressing. It’s a linguistic grab for legitimacy, as if any of the anti-black, anti-queer, anti-woman, anti-immigration views these Americans espouse even border on legitimate. To refer to these men and women by their chosen moniker is simply a matter of conducting their PR for them, to fit them into a historical and political legacy while denying the legacy to which their actual views belong. If this seems like a trivial concern to you, you should take a moment to think about the way in which any given group weighs and absorbs ideas. Because the purpose of calling a movement such as this by a title that does so little to address what that movement actually supports is nothing more than salesmanship. It’s the racist equivalent of formalizing previous job titles on a resume: a way to promote something other than what actually exists. Judging by its innocuous title, you might be forgiven for thinking that the ‘alt-right’ really is the movement that networks like CNN or publications like Politico refer to it as: an alternative to the conventional American right. It’s not, of course. It’s more an alternative to decades of social progress--an ideological framework centered around white supremacy so shamelessly that it’s nearly indistinguishable from the other similar organizations that our culture has already trained us to see as abhorrent.But by calling themselves the ‘alt-right’ men like Bannon are able to dodge these associations. They are discussed not in terms of what they believe but in terms of how they identify. And while their essence may be composed of things that most Americans might identify as repugnant, their branding enables them to present themselves as something other than that essence, a coalition for whom those views by which they might otherwise be disqualified can be reframed as incidental, rather than a full-fledged raison d’etre.Ultimately, normalization is the route to acceptance, and language is the material of normalization. The more lenient we are with how we identify a movement such as the one we call the ‘alt-right,’ the more willing we become to ignore what it is we talk about when we center our conversation around this movement. We center the discussion around political ascendants and rebellious Washington outsiders as opposed to avowed bigots, for whom violence is both in the rhetoric and in the cards. We distance ourselves from the impact of white supremacy and white white nationalism, allowing ourselves to continue to view such forces as historical relics and sociological phenomena as opposed to contemporary and visceral currents poised to directly impact people’s lives in tangible and horrible ways. Furthermore, we allow ourselves to remand the ugliest of these currents to the territory of a political other: a circumscribed collective of which we can say we are certainly not a part. When we do choose to discuss the ugly things men like Bannon believe, we give ourselves an out, labeling the purview of a club to which we do not claim membership. Political views can be disavowed and rebuked. Social forces can not be so simply disassociated from. If we say that Trump and his goons are members of the ‘alt-right,’ we can distance ourselves from them without much scrutiny. If we honestly acknowledge that they are products and agents of white supremacy, then our attempts to simply report we’re not on the roster is slightly less sustainable, and might ultimately give way to sincere reckoning with the ways in which the forces they have been so keen to ride to power might empower us (consciously or unconsciously) as well.It’s simply absurd that we can make a fuss about rightly calling racism “white supremacy” and still try to excuse our refusal to identify white nationalism by its proper title, without gussying it up for the public forum. It’s deeply and culturally irresponsible to allow our journalistic media to try to avoid the discomfort of acknowledging the political, social, and historical chemistry of this moment in America for the sake of making the devil to which we have given to keys to our government slightly less disgusting. This is not a matter of semantics. This is matter of honest appraisal and the difficult but necessary assumption of responsibility for the social havoc we have directly enabled. If there was ever a real issue of “political correctness,” this is it: the cowardly willingness to rebrand the morally vile as civically acceptable. Do away with the niceties. Do away with the bullshit. Call a spade a spade. Call the ‘alt-right’ what it truly is, deep in its ugly, worthless core. "
68,GREEN,Thirty Years Of Third-Stage Environmentalism,"Joshua Galperin, ContributorResearch Scholar and Lecturer in Law, Yale Law School + Yale S...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thirty-years-of-third-stage-environmentalism_us_583c7fc5e4b037ba5d6ae4ad,"In November 1986 the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, Fred Krupp, authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal",2016-11-28,"<p>Fred Krupp, President of the Environmental Defense Fund and early champion of third-stage environmentalism.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583c85f01700001c00e7c9e3.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In November 1986 the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, Fred Krupp, authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal championing a “new strategy” in environmentalism. An emphasis on “economic well-being” and “coalitions of former enemies” were hallmarks of the strategy. Krupp christened the movement “third-stage environmentalism.” In the thirty years since the third-stage emerged it has become the norm. But Krupp’s project is now twice as old as mainstream, second-stage, environmentalism was when he first confronted it. With decades of experience, it is time to concede that the third stage has not lived up to expectations.In Krupp’s essay he described “first-stage” environmentalism as Teddy Roosevelt’s wilderness conservation, which led to our national parks and forests. The “second stage” was Rachel Carson’s ecological awakening, which motivated our traditional environmental laws, those characterized by robust federal regulations, science-based standards, and to the chagrin of some, litigation.The “third-stage” environmentalism that Krupp outlined would adopt more diverse tactics, welcoming in economic concerns and corporate partnership. It would “not accept ‘either-or’ as inevitable,” instead striving for win-win solutions for profit and environmental protection.Krupp was prescient. Today, market-based solutions are a starting point for environmental policy, from pollution to extraction (for example, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here). Some environmental groups are more likely to consult on corporate operations than to sue for environmental misdeeds. This transition stems from some astonishing early successes of third-stage environmentalism.Perhaps the greatest triumph occurred in 1990 when Environmental Defense Fund worked with the Bush Administration on a market-based program to reduce acid rain. Since this cap-and-trade law took effect, acid rain pollution plunged faster and at a far lower cost than anyone predicted. Industry won new revenue opportunities and humans won a cleaner environment.This achievement was the product of a new political context in which third-stage environmentalism could thrive. In 1986, environmental protection remained popular even while President Reagan’s agenda weakened political support for regulation. Third-stage environmentalism offered tactical pluralism that would address environmental goals without alienating political factions.But during thirty years of the third stage something changed. By focusing the environmental movement more on conciliation and less on strengthening the underlying consensus of values, the third-stage constrained the type of political strategies that are available to environmental advocates. Today, if there is manifest need for environmental protection—as with climate change—but a proposed solution does not obviously and immediately deliver win-win outcomes, regulated industries and their political allies can too easily dismiss the policy as old-fashioned, as “second-stage.”By promising abundant collaborative solutions, third-stage environmentalism has fostered new expectations of what counts as acceptable environmental policy. The 1990 acid rain trading program was a pathbreaking solution that grew from Krupp’s 1986 OpEd. It was bi-partisan, low cost, and effective. But in its greatest successes, third-stage environmentalism has cemented expectations of win-win outcomes and, in turn, fostered intolerance for regulatory costs, for policies that are a win for the environment but not for industry. Today, cap-and-trade is as iconic a political failure for climate change as it was a success for acid rain.The third stage, with its emphasis on cooperation, has also increased tolerance for policies that weaken environmental safeguards. By endorsing industry self-governance as a sign of good environmental policy, we now often fail to see past industry engagement and towards environmental outcomes. Last spring, for instance, a court allowed an industry-led, market-based, conservation plan for the imperiled Dunes Sagebrush Lizard to substitute for robust Endangered Species Act requirements even though the plan is voluntary, unenforceable, and confidential, even to the federal government. The plan has allowed significant new habitat destruction. Third-stage environmentalism promised collaboration and market mechanisms would help achieve win-win solutions, but now we praise them for their own sake.By helping regulatory opponents dismiss any policy that does not provide economic benefits or make room for industry self-governance, third-stage environmentalism has facilitated erosion of environmentalism rather than the global consensus that it promised.The upshot is that the downsides of third-stage environmentalism are not without precedent and solutions are already available. Expansive flexibility, control of regulatory decisions by regulated entities, and limited judicial enforcement were common before the environmental laws of the 1970s. Like today, we offered vested interests generous control over their own governance. But standards, transparency, and public enforcement through the judiciary were auspicious solutions. Congress specifically integrated these features into the nation’s foundational environmental laws. Thus, second-stage environmentalism wasn’t just a response to new notions of the human-environment relationship; it was also a response to political failures. The third stage presented a new cooperative emphasis, but it inadvertently undercut this political pillar of environmental law.What third-stage environmentalism offers is a deeply held commitment to environmental protection but without confidence in and attention towards the values necessary to maintain and grow that commitment. As a result, for the last thirty years, we have developed a diverse policy toolbox but we have lost the consensus that generates the political power necessary to use these tools effectively.But there is no need for another reinvention. Luckily, as Krupp promised, third-stage environmentalism was not “in any way a repudiation of the second stage.” Today, thirty years later, traditional environmental laws still exist and we can renew our focus on them, and new laws in their image. We can renew our focus on the strong and effective tactics they establish. And we can renew our focus on the deep commitments to environmental protection that they embody. This may seem impossible in today’s political climate, but environmentalism has always been about the long-run."

That is why you tell me that everything will be alright, nothing will actually happen. When I fear the Muslim registry, you tell me to stop freaking out. When I fear the total reversal of my rights as a woman, you tell me to stop being so paranoid. When I fear my position in America as an immigrant, you tell me to calm down. When I fear living in this country, you tell me to stick around. When I fear the rise of white nationalism, the men standing tall on our ground saluting Nazis, you tell me everything will be alright.My perspective, my Muslim female immigrant perspective is a bit different than your’s, your liberal white American-born, American-bred. I say “terrified”, you say “hopeful.” What is the total infringement upon my civil liberties is “troubling” to you. I say “but this is our reality,” you say “I don’t think so.” You explain things to me, but you don’t ask me to speak. When I stand up, you tell me to sit down, I’m wrong. I say “people of color,” you say “is that all you can talk about?” What I say has happened before, history repeats itself, you call “jumping to conclusions.” When I speak out, you silence me.Dear College-Educated Liberal White Men,I cannot give Donald Trump a chance. I cannot believe that Donald Trump does not mean what he says. I cannot accept that he will not be able to enact his threats, that Sessions, Higbie, Spencer, Bannon, Pence won’t really be able to do anything, but I understand that my perspective is difficult for you to comprehend. After all, you are the silent benefactors of white supremacy. You compliantly live on the land stolen for you. You compliantly accept your rights that precede all others. Historically, you have never been persecuted for your race, your religion, your sexual orientation. Your rights have been bestowed upon you. The conservative white men you loathe have maintained the order of things in your favor. You are caustically “casually” racist because of your privileged, stature. You are systematically sexist because you have never struggled for what is yours; you are empowered. You cannot conceive the actualities of the other because you have never been. Your right to be who you are has never been in jeopardy. So perhaps it is a bit difficult for you to understand why I am afraid.Dear College-Educated Liberal White Men,You may have taken a women’s studies class in freshman year and majored in the theology of pan-Africanism, your best friend might be Asian and your girlfriend a feminist, you may protest in marches and rally for immigrants, but you are the reason we are here today, your deafening, problematic silence, your compliance in the white supremacy that has divided America today. You are an immense part of the problem. You have done nothing to make us feel safe. Instead of spewing your elitist pseudo-intellectual theorems on why everything will be alright at us, go home. Go home and make everything alright. Go back to your South, your mid-West, your conservative Red states, your white suburban communities you congratulate yourself on escaping. Face the fear you have been so elegantly hiding from behind a mask of elite liberalism. Educate your people, not me.You said it would never come to this, but now here we are, Donald Trump as our 45th president-elect, and now again you tell me that nothing will actually happen. So I think it’s best if you sit down, shut up and start taking notes.Best regards,Tasnim"

The man who was about to challenge him for his title, Sergey Karjakin of Russia, was no doubt a tough opponent. But Karjakin had only ever managed to beat Carlsen once in their nearly two dozen encounters. Magnus had a fight ahead of him, sure. But like the rest of the chess world, he must have fancied his chances.Things didn’t go as planned. Over the next few weeks, the champion’s attacks crashed against his challenger’s defenses like waves against a brick wall. In the first seven rounds neither player was able to draw blood. The games were frequently tense, complex, 6+ hour struggles but again and again they ended in draws. By this same point in his first title match against Viswanathan Anand of India in 2013, Carlsen was up by two wins to zero and appeared to be coasting to victory. In the rematch the following year, by game seven he was up by two wins to Anand’s one. In both cases the momentum was clearly on the Norwegian’s side.But this time, to the shock of the chess world, Magnus cracked first. In game 8, Karjakin gained a small advantage and pressed it home for hours, with relentless accuracy. In the latter phase of the game, the “endgame”, the champion overestimated his position, a cardinal sin in chess. Carlsen went down.He shocked chess fans again a few minutes later, when, flustered by his defeat, he stormed off the press-conference stage where the players are meant to talk to the press after each game. The press conferences are a contractual obligation for both players, and Magnus faces a potential 5-figure penalty for his tantrum. Agon Unlimited, the company putting on the championship, has been cagey about details, but they have revealed that Carlsen has appealed the fine. Two rounds later, Magnus hit back to level the score. As the players prepare for the final game, it sits at an even 5.5 - 5.5. If Monday’s game is a draw, the match goes to rapid tie-breaks, the chess equivalent of penalty kicks. Magnus Carlsen, whom many had considered almost unbeatable, is confronting a brand new reality: he might lose the world championship.Way back on November 12th, day two of the match, I spoke with a Spanish chess journalist named Leontxo García. Himself an accomplished chessmaster, García is a veteran of the world championship circuit; for 30+ years he’s covered the sport for his country’s biggest newspapers and for Spanish radio and television. I asked him if he felt the 26-year old Karjakin would be capable of challenging Carlsen more than the 44-year old Anand had.“Probably he will,” García told me. “It’s a question of age. Anand is a genius - he’s a five-time world champion. But when he played Carlsen, he was already in decline as a chess player. Karjakin is at the height of his career. Energy is very important in a contest like this one.”People often laugh when they hear about chess grandmasters engaging in physical fitness training or cross-country running. When the English player Nigel Short was preparing for his 1993 match against Garry Kasparov, he was chatting with a trainer about his weight-lifting regimen and the latter quipped, “Ha! Are the pieces that heavy?” But there’s a reason that the world chess champion tends to be between the ages of 22 and 35. Cardiovascular fitness and physical endurance have a direct effect on a player’s ability to sustain their concentration during the marathon-length games a world championship entails. Playing at the level of Carlsen or Karjakin takes a type of mental exertion that the average person can scarcely comprehend. When Carlsen played Anand, the crucial moments in the games often came after 5, 6 hours of play. The middle-aged Anand, pushed to his mental breaking point by the stress of endless concentration, would finally snap and make some terrible mistake. Then Carlsen would clean up.When Magnus Carlsen first appeared on the international chess scene in the mid ’00s, it soon became conventional wisdom that the prodigy from Norway was a future world champion. Year after year he scored dazzling wins against the world’s most established and dominant players. In an earlier era, when Garry Kasparov dominated the game, there was a saying in the chess world. “When Garry plays in a tournament, the question is not who will come in first but rather who will come in second.” By 2010 it seemed that the same could be said of Magnus. And he was only 19.Carlsen has faced challenges in his still-young chess career. He has faced losses - bitter ones, even. But the prospect he faces today - that one wrong move could cost him his coveted seat atop the chess world - is something entirely new. Today we’ll see whether this is a psychological disadvantage for the champion or whether it will provide him with the motivation he needs to play his best. “Magnus is known to like challenges,” Leontxo García had told me earlier in the match. “He doesn’t like lying low and being very cautious. He now sees that he’s facing a tough rival, but I don’t think he’s going to back off. He’s going to take risks.”The are some chess players who simply can’t tolerate the thought of not being #1. When Garry Kasparov retired from competition in 2005, he still held the top spot in the world rankings. For thirty years, the name Kasparov had been synonymous with chess genius. His matches against Anatoly Karpov had become legend, the most intense and thrilling rivalry in the game’s history. His match against the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue in 1997 captured the attention of the world unlike any previous chess event. It came as a surprise when Kasparov lost his title to a fellow Russian, Vladimir Kramnik, in 2000, but Garry retained his #1 ranking (as for the arcane distinction between being #1 and being world champion, for now let’s just say that they’re not the same). Five years later, he was still a top performer on the tournament circuit and could have continued to make a comfortable living from the game. So why’d he step aside? The simplest explanation is that Garry simply saw the writing on the wall; if he stuck around, he would soon be #2. After thirty years, Kasparov’s self-image was said to be so fundamentally wrapped-up in his status as #1 that the mere idea of being anything else just didn’t compute.Then there’s the game’s most famous premature retiree: the American world champion Bobby Fischer. He won the championship from the Soviet Boris Spassky in Reykjavik in 1972, in the most famous championship match in chess history. Three years later, he abdicated rather than defend his title against a younger Soviet challenger, Anatoly Karpov. If you ever meet a chess player and you’ve got some time to kill, ask them why they think Fischer walked away. Everyone has their own theory. Personally, I wonder if Fischer just felt he had too much to lose.It’s clear Carlsen wants very badly to remain champion. But how badly?The first match between Karpov and Kasparov, in 1984, lasted 5 months and 48 games before it was abandoned out of fear for the players’ health. Leontxo García covered that match, early in his chess journalism career. When I talked to him after game two, I asked him for his predictions about how this month’s match might unfold. The rules have since been changed to prevent the games from dragging on endlessly, but twelve rounds at this level is still a marathon. “I think we’re going to see a much more even and exciting match than many thought, myself included,” he told me. Yesterday in the first game, Karjakin showed that he is extraordinarily well-prepared. [In game 2] he showed that he’s no longer afraid of Carlsen. Because today there were a few moments in which Karjakin could have simplified the position and forced an easy draw, but instead he invited Magnus to complicate the game. That’s very significant. It indicates that Karjakin has a lot of faith in himself.”“You say he no longer fears Carlsen,” I asked García. “Do you think he used to?”“I suppose so,” he said. “It’s a matter of numbers. If we look at their previous games, there have been four wins for Carlsen, one for Karjakin, and sixteen draws. Those numbers probably wouldn’t make one feel very confident.”Yet during the match the Russian has showed supreme confidence. Very few players can resist Magnus in this kind of endurance format; his great strength is his ability to maintain a flawless standard of play late into the game when his opponent’s powers begin to fade from exhaustion. Many simply wilt before the Norwegian’s sheer presence and their fear of his reputation. Karjakin has done neither.“I can’t be sure,” Leontxo García told me, “but probably during Karjakin’s training he’ll have had a psychologist, specialized in sports, who will have helped him in that regard… he has total support from Putin’s government, an army of Russian grandmasters that have helped him train, and a lot of money for his period of training and preparation.”“And today he sent Carlsen a message,” García added. “Magnus, I’m not afraid of you.”Game 12 begins today, Monday, November 12th, at 2 p.m. EST. You can find my previous coverage of the championship here, here, here, here, and here. You can read Leontxo García’s writing for El País here or watch his chess analysis video series on youtube."

Power plants have been turned away from coal burning due to government regulations trying to stay ahead of growing concerns of greenhouse gas emissions.The study shows that between 2004 and 2012 the mercury concentrations declined by 19 percent over this time span. The research team analyzed 1,292 samples of Atlantic bluefin tuna caught by commercial fishermen, mostly in the Gulf of Maine. This is the first evidence that suggests the relationship between the reduction of emissions and lower concentrations in large, advanced-aged fish. These declines have also been observed in the air above the Atlantic and concentrations dissolved in surface waters.“The fish are responding in what seems like real time to the changes in loadings of mercury coming from the coal-fired power plants,” Dr. Nicholas Fisher, a marine biogeochemist and co-author of the study said. “Some fish, particularly the slow-growing species near the top of the food chain, can have muscle tissues with high methylmercury concentrations.” Methylmercury is the form of mercury that tends to build up in marine animals, and poses the greatest risk for consumers, especially for people who eat large quantities of seafood.Mercury levels in seafood has been recognized to be a potential public concern for over 50 years. The highest levels are found in various kinds of tuna, such as bluefin and albacore, swordfish and shark. The main concern focuses on pregnant women or women looking to become pregnant. There are some estimates that between 300,000 and 600,000 babies are born with cognitive impairment in the United States per year from consumption of seafood containing high levels of mercury. Although there remains considerable uncertainty about this issue.Dr. Fisher emphasized that consuming fish with high mercury concentrations is best avoided in large quantities, but seafood consumption is generally healthy for people of all ages, including fetuses. The trick is to choose wisely, and there are many seafood items with low mercury levels, such as salmon, flounder, sardines, and shellfish.The findings of this study come at a time when public policy could be taking a turn with President-elect Donald Trump has openly discussed reviving the coal industry. Trump also is considering walking away from the Paris Climate agreement to reduce greenhouse emissions. President Obama has been a supporter of the deal since its inception and the deal became international law earlier in November.The mounting evidence between coal burning and the consequences it has on the environment and public health continues to be shown. The question now is what will be done about it."

The next to put on your radar: Black Fashion Designers, which opens on December 6, and explores the creative and cultural impact that designers of African descent have had in fashion.Spanning six decades—from the 1950s to the present—the show is organized into eight themes such as “Breaking Into the Industry,” which includes pieces by New York City-based designers Arthur McGee and Wesley Tann, who faced discrimination in the '50s and '60s, and “The African Influence,” which highlights the work of modern designers like Aisha Ayensu, who spins traditional Ghanaian wax-print textiles into ready-to-wear pieces. “The Rise of the Black Fashion Designer” section, pays a disco-focused homage to the '70s, highlighting Stephen Burrows’s gold evening pajamas and Scott Barrie’s body-conscious, silk wrap dresses. “Experimentation” presents Andre Walker’s of-the-moment, deconstructed cape-jacket and Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air’s gender-fluid elongated shirtdresses.Models also take center stage. There’s a flashback to the Ebony Fashion Fair, which started in 1958 and created opportunities for black models in an era of segregation, and an original short film that features a conversation about diversity led by The Washington Post fashion critic Robin Givhan with runway stars Bethann Hardison, Veronica Webb, and Riley Montana.To mount the exhibition, Ariele Elia, FIT’s assistant curator of costumes and textiles, and Elizabeth Way, curatorial assistant, spent two years deeply researching the topic. “We really wanted to revise fashion history to include designers that have been overlooked,” says Elia of the inspiration behind the show. Of the approximately 75 garments in the exhibition, Elia and Way are particularly excited to showcase those by Ann Lowe—best known for designing Jacqueline Kennedy’s wedding gown. “She had her own dress shop and specialized in society clients,” says Way. “She was a really influential designer but, for a lot of people, she’s completely unknown.”Another favorite is Olivier Rousteing, the 31-year-old creative director of Balmain. “If you look at the history of black fashion designers, they often worked under manufacturers and didn’t get the credit,” says Elia, pointing out that Rousteing was able to make a name for himself with his super-glam designs and #BalmainArmy of models, celebrities, and pop-culture icons.Although it’s not officially open yet, the exhibition is already sparking some debate. “On the one hand it’s nice to be included, because I think our voices are often overlooked but there’s the question of, should we separate black designers from designers in general?” says Tracy Reese, who contributed two dresses to the exhibition and also filmed a Q&A with André Leon Talley for the museum, as well. “A lot of us feel that we shouldn’t, but you have to start somewhere.” Reese adds, “I’m a designer who wants to appeal to all races and as many sizes as I can cover. And I’m a designer who happens to be black.”Still, Reese and many of her counterparts would welcome more multicultural designers at the helm of major labels and filling the upper ranks of fashion. “We’re underrepresented in mainstream and executive positions in retail and throughout this industry in positions of power,” she says. “It helps to have champions to help open doors because I think discrimination still exists and we have to push for change.”For a new generation of emerging talent, Brandice Daniel is that champion. As the CEO and founder of Harlem Fashion Row (HFR), Daniel produces annual fashion shows that have become a platform for designers, stylists, models, and hair and makeup artists of color. Since its inception in 2007, HFR has launched the careers of more than 35 designers, including Kimberly Goldson and Meagan Wellman of M-Sew. “A lot of a designer’s success comes from having the right relationships and support,” she says. “I love that FIT is doing this, and fashion institutions are engaging in this type of conversation, even if it can be seen as controversial.”To keep the conversation going, FIT is hosting a Black Fashion Designers Symposium on February 6, 2017 with talks by stylist June Ambrose, designers Grace Wales Bonner, Dapper Dan, and Mimi Plange, among other influencers in the industry. The ultimate goal of the exhibition, says Elia, is to inspire creativity among up-and-comers across all ethnicities. “It’s hard to become something if you can’t identify and see others who have been successful in history,” she says. “It’s about going out and pursuing anything—not just in fashion but anything.”More from Allure:The 10 Best Mascaras Under $20The 9 Prettiest Date-Night Makeup LooksFind the Best Haircut for Your Face Shape20 Celebrities Who Look Surprisingly Different Without Their Signature Looks7 Weird Tricks for Looking Great in Photos10 Celebrity Hairstyles That Make You Look 10 Years Younger"

The actor didn’t do television interviews or magazine spreads, which might have helped raise “Allied’s” profile. The film also drew a much older crowd, with 39 percent of ticket-buyers coming in over the age of 50. Paramount suggested that might mean that its core group of ticket buyers may be slower to embrace the picture, even as it acknowledged that the results were disappointing.As many new releases floundered, Warner Bros.’ “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” continued to draw crowds.

These things need to change in order to have open and free relationships. And that’s what President-elect Trump believes and that’s where he is going to head,” Priebus told Fox News’ Chris Wallace on Sunday.Wallace pressed Priebus on the matter, asking whether he meant that Trump would stop at nothing short of a revolution in Cuba before agreeing to preserve the new ties. Priebus clarified that revolution would not be necessary, but that Trump would “absolutely” roll back Obama’s bilateral economic and diplomatic reconciliation with Cuba if there are not new concessions from Raul Castro’s government.“There has to be something. And what that something is, Chris, has yet to be determined,” Priebus said. “But I can assure you he is going to require some movement or some schedule of movement in order to then schedule some kind of relationship with Cuba.”During his campaign, Trump appealed to hardline Cuban-American voters in South Florida with promises to get tougher on the Castro regime. On Saturday, Trump acknowledged some of those voters in his comments on the death of longtime Cuban leader Fidel Castro. His statement was notably harsher in its criticism of the Cuban government than Obama’s remarks on Castro’s death."

But he has his default position which, most of it is a bunch of bunk,” Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday.”“But he’ll have an open mind and listen to people,” he added.The full transcript of his remarks to the Times reveals that Trump appeared to have little knowledge of the issue and continued to express skepticism at the near-universal scientific consensus on climate change.“You know the hottest day ever was in 1890-something, 98. You know, you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind,” he said, later adding that “it’s a very complex subject. I’m not sure anybody is ever going to really know.”Environmentalists warn that Trump’s presidency will be disastrous for global efforts to combat climate change. Trump has vowed to undo President Barack Obama’s signature policy achievements on the issue, including mandating lower carbon emissions from power plants, preserving more public land and negotiating the landmark United Nations Paris Climate Change Agreement.Trump’s personnel picks confirm these fears, as he has named climate change denier Myron Ebell to oversee the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump has also suggested gutting the agency altogether.To head the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and the preservation of endangered species, leading candidates include Sarah “Drill Baby Drill” Palin and oil executive Harold Hamm. And Trump’s adviser on space policy wants to end NASA’s climate change research programs.Like he has on the campaign trail, Trump told the Times last week that combating climate change would “cost our companies.”“We’re not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive,” he said. “We’re not competitive for a lot of reasons.”And to demonstrate his “open mind” on the climate change issue, he touted his “great, great, very successful golf courses.”"
78,QUEER VOICES,Mariela Castro Brings The Fight For LGBTQ Rights Home In Cuba,"David Hinckley , ContributorEntertainment and pop culture writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mariela-castro-brings-the-fight-for-lgbtq-rights-home_us_583b2644e4b050dfe6187d1e,The promise that Marxism would level the playing field of human dignity never quite worked out for the LGBTQ community,2016-11-27,<p>Activists see the Cuban flag and the rainbow flag as wholly compatible.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583b2753180000821431015c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The promise that Marxism would level the playing field of human dignity never quite worked out for the LGBTQ community in Cuba.Until they found a friend in a high place: Mariela Castro, a member of the National Assembly and also, oh yes, the daughter of President Raul Castro. Mariela Castro has made it her life’s mission to change not just laws, but hearts and minds. Mariela Castro’s March: Cuba’s LGBT Revolution, which premieres Monday at 9 p.m. ET on HBO, follows Castro across the island as she encourages the gay community to live without shame and patiently explains to homophobes that someone else’s sexual preference threatens nothing in their lives. It’s a compelling argument, but despite this documentary’s optimism, it clearly has not yet completely carried the day. In Cuba as in almost every other nation, favoring a same-gender partner can expose a person to danger, and not so long ago, the Cuban government was an active participant in that oppression. Luis, one of several interview subjects here, describes how, as a young man, he was sent to a “work camp” that was really incarceration to segregate men suspected of homosexuality. When he was released, his national ID card was stamped with the information he had spent time at that camp. Luis found it almost impossible to continue his education or be hired for a job.As that experience suggests, discrimination was practiced both by fearful individuals and Cuba’s all-powerful state. Margarita, a lesbian, recalls how she was kicked off the national tennis team and how it devastated her life. With that sort of official sanction, it’s hardly surprising that bias sometimes took extreme forms. One interview subject here had acid thrown in her face, leaving her blind in one eye, and the producers show a brief contemporary interview with a Cuban man who spits his disdain for the familiar homophobic f-word. The picture painted here of attitudes in the late 20th century makes Cuba seem neither measurably more nor less enlightened than most other societies. Happily, the new century has brought sometimes rapid change in many nations, and the premise of Mariela Castro’s March is that Cuba too has awoken. The surface evidence does sound promising, from open LGBTQ rallies, parades and celebrations to Mariela’s own public crusade. What’s lacking is evidence that the government has embraced or encouraged these changes. It may not be sending suspected gay men to labor camps any more, but if there has been any official shift in policy, starting with Mariela’s powerful father, we don’t hear about it here. It’s hard to believe, in fact, that Cuban society doesn’t still harbor some of the irrational fear and loathing that have plagued the LGBTQ community in much of the world. If that’s the case, it’s downplayed here, perhaps because Mariela’s effort seems so tireless and hopeful that the filmmakers prefer to accentuate the positive. It is, in truth, impossible not to admire her. She mixes deep passion and at times indignation with a disarming tone of conciliation, and she forcefully links the cause of LGBTQ equality with the higher human aspirations of the Cuban revolution. She could have found easier causes, and she chose this one. However far she has pushed it, things are better for her efforts. Mariela Castro’s March follows an 8 p.m. ET documentary on Cuba titled Patria o Muerte: Cuba, meaning Fatherland or Death. Obviously filmed before this weekend’s death of Mariela’s uncle Fidel, Patria o Muerte talks about the evolution under way on the island today, both in attitude and policy. You have the feeling that the success or failure of Mariela’s crusade will reflect in an important way how deep the changes run elsewhere. "

It is awful & worthy of criticism and commentary but it is far from the worst thing Trump said or did during his campaign and quite frankly the obsession with putting it forward as the quintessential example of how horrible Trump is, is deeply hypocritical.First, let’s remember why Trump was mocking Kovaleski in the first place. He was angry that Kovaleski pushed back against Trump’s exaggerated interpretation of an article that Kovaleski had written about reports that Muslims were seen celebrating on 9/11.The mockery of Kovaleski completely overshadowed the fact that Trump was in fact trying to fan the flames of Islamophobia at the time. He was doing that because he had already called for a registry of Muslims.First question, why wasn’t declaring a registry for an entire religious group not big enough of a horror to be the last straw?Second question, why is the mocking of an individual (even if that mockery is grounded in bigotry) worse than the Islamophobia Trump was defending and the actual suggestion of registering Muslims, an action that if taken would hurt millions?Mocking Kovaleski was bad but it wasn’t a suggestion of action against disabled people, even Trump knew enough to deny that he was mocking Kovaleski’s disability. He knew better than to double down on that.

He’s threatening the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and disabled people are very worried about what a Trump presidency will mean for them. However, simply holding up Trump’s mockery of Serge Kovaleski doesn’t help them. It doesn’t acknowledge how gutting the Affordable Care Act will hurt disabled people. It does not show Trump’s track record of dealing with disability issues (like that his properties have been sued at least 8 times for ADA violations).It does not come with an active call of solidarity for disabled people with demands for greater access and ACA protection or plans on how to help disabled people when Trump implements harmful laws.It doesn’t do those things because it isn’t actually based in the idea that disabled people are fully human. It’s based in the idea that disabled people are perpetual children who require coddling and protection. We are not people to be worked with but to be heroically saved.This kind of focus also ignores the double standard of lambasting Trump for his ableism but ignoring the ableism used against the Trump campaign.Apparently, Trump mocking Serge Kovaleski is beyond the pale but the widespread and concerted efforts to label Trump with a hypothetical mental illness were righteous and in no way totally stigmatizing of people with psychiatric disabilities.Right-wing pundit Ann Coulter defended Trump by claiming he wasn’t mocking Kovaleski’s specific disability but was rather “he was just doing an impression of a ‘standard retard’”. As much as I hate to agree with Coulter in any way, particularly when she’s doing her level best to normalize slurs against people with intellectual disabilities, she may well be right. It is all to common to attempt to discredit someone by suggesting they are like someone with an intellectual disability. Trump was even the target of such associations.During the campaign I came across images like this,Associating people with disability, particularly intellectual disability to discredit them is very common, but the hypocrisy of focusing on the Kovaleski incident goes beyond that. It completely ignores the social reality of being disabled and that those realities were created or maintained by both political parties and extend beyond the borders of the United States.Consider the fact that as soon as it became clear that Trump was going to win; a post that I had written back in April on disability and immigration to Canada started getting a lot of traffic. It actually maintained the top viewed item spot on my blog for over a week.

The government has more or less dismissed these concerns.Socially on an international level it is entirely acceptable to treat disabled people like second class citizens. None of this reality is addressed by focusing on that one time Trump mocked a single disabled person. Lambasting just the mockery suggests that the world is supposed to be above treating disabled people badly but the lived experience of disabled people does not bear this out.By simply suggesting the world should be above mocking disabled people without contextualizing it with the harms of ableist actions and policies, people are in fact covering up the fact that those things are widespread realities.If the concern was a genuine concern for disabled people then the question wouldn’t be “why didn’t Trump’s mocking of a disabled person stop his campaign in its tracks?” but rather “Why didn’t ads like this one for Hillary Clinton which affirms the humanity of disabled people and the importance of inclusion guarantee her the presidency?”The reality is that people are all to permissive of policies and laws that discriminate against disabled people regardless of political affiliation and fixing those problems or even acknowledging their scope is harder than calling Trump out for a single incidence of ableism.This originally appeared on the blog crippledscholar and can be found here"

Lambasting just the mockery suggests that the world is supposed to be above treating disabled people badly but the lived experience of disabled people does not bear this out.By simply suggesting the world should be above mocking disabled people without contextualizing it with the harms of ableist actions and policies, people are in fact covering up the fact that those things are widespread realities.If the concern was a genuine concern for disabled people then the question wouldn’t be “why didn’t Trump’s mocking of a disabled person stop his campaign in its tracks?” but rather “Why didn’t ads like this one for Hillary Clinton which affirms the humanity of disabled people and the importance of inclusion guarantee her the presidency?”The reality is that people are all to permissive of policies and laws that discriminate against disabled people regardless of political affiliation and fixing those problems or even acknowledging their scope is harder than calling Trump out for a single incidence of ableism.This originally appeared on the blog crippledscholar and can be found here"

Then you kissed her on the cheek as you pulled her in to embrace her. Tears came to my eyes too. I cried in part because of all that Ellen means to Americans in general and to the LGBTQ community in particular. But I also cried because I realized in that moment just how much I am going to miss you.You weren’t always a supporter of gay marriage ― something Ellen has long advocated for and championed. I felt the sting of your position on that issue when you first ran for office. I canvassed and campaigned for you anyway. I logged hours making phone calls and knocking doors not because your position on LGBTQ equality wasn’t important to me, but because I trusted something about you. It’s the same thing I felt as I watched you embrace Ellen: you are a man of compassion. And what I trust about compassion is that it allows us to see where we’ve been wrong. It gives us the opportunity to change.I saw your compassion in the tears that lined your face and the heartache that swallowed your words as you spoke to parents across this nation who were afraid to send their children back to school after the incomprehensible massacre in Newtown. I saw your compassion as you knelt down to let a little black boy place his hand on your head so he could see that your hair was, in fact, like his. I saw your compassion as you fought for healthcare reform so people like me wouldn’t be denied access to coverage because of preexisting conditions. I saw your compassion as the weight of so many hate-fueled mass murders, this time in a church like those where you’ve worshipped, rose up in you as a mournful song:“Amazing grace, how sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like me.I once was lost, but now am found;Was blind, but now I see.”I’ve never heard a president sing before. It seemed fitting that you would be the first.I’ve also seen you dance. If I may say so, you’ve got some moves. I will miss seeing you dance on “The Ellen Show,” and with the First Lady. It is clear how much you love Michelle. We love her too. A man wise enough to choose to walk through life with Michelle is a man I can get behind and believe in. It is unmistakable to me that no passion, concern, or interest takes priority over your fierce dedication to Michelle, Malia and Sasha.I haven’t always agreed with your decisions. There are multiple times over the course of the past eight years when I have felt disillusioned by unfulfilled campaign promises and thwarted policy proposals. I imagine you have felt that way too. Even now, I believe you could take more direct action to protect and defend those at Standing Rock who are fighting to preserve our land and our water. I hope the compassion I see in you will lead you to do just that.I don’t see that compassion in the man who will be taking your place in January. What happened in this country with the recent election broke my heart. I was devastated to see the reins of power transferred to someone so unlike you in so many ways. But I have also watched in admiration as you have set aside profound differences in order to remain in a mentoring capacity as long as it takes to ensure this transition can be as successful as possible. To do so requires another trait I value in you, one lacking in your successor: humility. Not the brand of humility which kowtows and acquiesces to muscle-flexing and insults, but rather the humility which necessitates that ego and indignation give precedence to the greater good.This example of dignity and grace in the face of grave disappointment has been foremost in my mind as I’ve considered how to express my gratitude to you. I’ve come to realize that my thanks will best be shown, not spoken.President Obama, I will show my thanks by continuing to fight for the causes we both believe in.I will march. I will rally. I will donate. I will volunteer. I will organize. I will write, call, and petition my legislators. I will canvass and campaign.I will vote. I will vote. I will vote.And this refrain from Amazing Grace will be singing in my heart as I do:“When we’ve been there ten thousand years,Bright shining as the sun,We’ve no less days to sing God’s praiseThan when we first begun.”Most of all, I promise to never forget what I felt on the night of Tuesday, November 4th, 2008 ― the night we elected our first African-American president. As I listened to you speak that night, with tears streaming down my face, anything seemed possible.And in spite of it all, I still believe it is.Your rallying cry from the start will remain your legacy in the end:We must never give up on the audacity of hope.Thank you for igniting that in me, President Obama. No matter what lies ahead, I promise to carry hope forward.With love,John"
82,HEALTHY LIVING,When The Doctor Becomes The Patient: What I Learned From Having A Surgical Complication,"Lora Shahine, MD, ContributorReproductive endocrinologist at Pacific NW Fertility in Seattl...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-the-doctor-becomes-a-patient-what-i-learned-from_us_583b5dbee4b050dfe6187d61,"""I’ve never seen this before” is never something you want to hear.",2016-11-27,<p>Lessons Learned when the Doctor Becomes the Patient</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/583b5fab1a00001a00cc9ed4.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was supposed to be a simple procedure, taking less than an hour out of my day and a week away from work. Weeks later, I am back at work – not yet fully recovered but forever changed… for the better.I had ptosis, or lid lowering, left eye worse than the right. I had noticed subtle changes over time, but in recent months, by the end of the day, my vision was blurred and my eyelids were tired. I started having headaches in the evenings after using my eyebrows all day to lift my eyelids up in order to see clearly. It’s genetic. I saw my dad’s eyelids lower throughout his life, and I knew I needed to take care of it sooner rather than later.I did my research, found the right surgeon, and felt confident going into the procedure. Recovering was tough the first few days, with swelling, ice packs, and discomfort, but I knew after a week that my left eyelid was not recovering like my right – I couldn’t lift it at all.At the postoperative follow-up visit, my doctor was obviously surprised. “I’ve never seen this” is not something you want to hear your surgeon say…ever. Long story short, the muscle in my eyelid was in shock from the procedure – there had either been significant swelling or a toxic reaction from the numbing medication used. An expected complication from this surgery. I was told it would most likely return to full function but that it could take 8-12 weeks.It’s been a month now since my surgery, and I am starting to see some improvement in my lid function. I am hopeful for a full recovery, but I’ve been taking it one day at a time. I have to say that being in the role of the patient rather than the doctor role I’m used to has really changed my perspective, and I’m glad to say that I’ve learned a few things from the experience…1. I learned that complications can happen even if you do all the right things.I did my research and found the right doctor with lots of experience and personal recommendations, and I still had a surgical complication, which goes to show that sometimes these things just happen. It surprised me how many people blamed the surgeon right away when I told them what happened, but complications can happen to anyone when they do enough surgeries. My procedure is one my surgeon had done thousands of times over the years, and we just both got really, really unlucky. I realized that if I blamed him, I would be left mad at myself for ‘choosing the wrong surgeon’ and angry at him when I knew he did his best. As a surgeon myself, I’ve had the same experience. When you do the same procedure thousands of times over several years, a complication is bound to arise sooner or later. Of course, while medical malpractice and negligence does happen, in most instances of surgical complications, I’ve found that this is not the case. Things just happen.2. I gained empathy for people with disabilities. Even though it was temporary, I lost the ability to drive, work, and do many everyday tasks that I had always taken for granted. By coincidence, my daughter got her upper mouth expander during this time, and she had difficulty eating and speaking clearly with the new hardware. We went back to work and school for the first time on the same day and got to reflect together on how nervous we both were about seeing friends and colleagues with the new way we looked as well as returning to our responsibilities with limitations. Going through this together was an incredible opportunity to reflect on what it must be like for people with permanent disabilities, and we gained a new perspective together.3. I realized that people didn’t really care about how I looked. My daughter said this to me on the first morning we went back to work and school, and I heard her saying these words to me in my head for the next few weeks while my lid kept drooping. It was tough at first to see patient after patient and explain why I looked different from the last time they saw me, but it got easier and easier, and the more comfortable I got with how I looked and what I said, the more comfortable everyone else did too. I also found comfort in humor. I told people to pretend I was just winking a lot and made a few pirate jokes. Breaking through the discomfort and ending in a laugh saved me daily. Laughter really is the best medicine for healing.4. I learned how to be more patient and understanding with my patients. This is the best lesson I’ve learned from this experience. It is incredibly humbling to take on the patient role when I am usually the doctor. I felt what it was like to be scared of what may happen. I felt frustrated when I wanted to have my questions answered but couldn’t get ahold of someone quickly. I mixed up my medications! I took steroids to decrease the inflammation and help the healing process, and I mixed up the dosage a few days and had to ask my doctor for another prescription. I’ve had patients mix up medications and been bewildered since I had reviewed the dose with them and the instructions are on the bottle. Well, guess what – when you’re stressed out of your mind and scared about what might happen to your health, anyone can make a mistake – even a doctor. Back at work now, I find myself more patient with my patients’ questions and more understanding of their mistakes, and that is a true gift.When my eyelid finally opened enough to allow me to drive and go back to work, I realized how incredibly fortunate I am to have my health. I try to practice gratitude in my life, but nothing makes you appreciate something more than when you lose it. Although I can’t say I’m glad it happened, upon reflection, I can honestly say I am grateful for all I learned from this experience. I cannot control what happens to me, but I can control how I react and what I take away from all my experiences, both good and bad.Twitter @lorashahine and More blog posts at lorashahine.com"
