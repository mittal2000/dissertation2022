Courthouse, Nov. 12, 1898 </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2eb3a51e00002a000c3313.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Toward the conclusion of Charles Chesnutt’s great American novel The Marrow of Tradition (1901), at the culmination of his fictionalized depiction of the 1898 Wilmington (NC) coup and massacre, Chesnutt writes one of the most incisive sentences ever put to paper about the dark realities of American history, community, and identity. A rampaging white mob has burned down the city’s African American hospital, and Chesnutt’s narrator reflects:The flames soon completed their work, and this handsome structure, the fruit of old Adam Miller’s industry, the monument of his son’s philanthropy, a promise of good things for the future of the city, lay smoldering in ruins, a melancholy witness to the fact that our boasted civilization is but a thin veneer, which cracks and scales off at the first impact of primal passions.The “primal passions” that have throughout American history revealed the dark realities beneath “our boasted civilization” have taken many forms, but to my mind they have consistently been driven by a particular, discriminatory vision of that civilization itself. That is, it is when definitions of America as a white (or Anglo, or European, or Christian, or English-speaking, or…) nation—what I’m calling in my new book the exclusionary vision of American identity—have been most overtly challenged that the primal passions of white supremacist hate and violence have become most prominent and destructive.In the last few months I’ve seen such white supremacist primal passions strike at many of the communities I hold most dear. My childhood hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia has of course been the site of some of the most overt displays of white supremacist exclusion, hate, and violence, culminating—if frustratingly not concluding—with August’s rally and the act of domestic terrorism it featured. It’s no coincidence that the Charlottesville rally centered on a statue of Robert E. Lee, as attempts to revise mythologized and false narratives of American history in favor of more inclusive visions represent precisely the kind of challenge to white supremacy that produces exclusionary and violent responses.This fall, the town of Needham, Massachusetts, where my sons attend school, has featured its own acts of white supremacist hate. In September at my younger son’s elementary school graffiti featuring both expletives and the n-word was written in a boy’s bathroom; a few days ago very similar graffiti was carved into the walls of boys’ bathrooms at Needham High School. As the Boston busing riots reflected with particular (but not at all singular) clarity, attempts to diversify our educational spaces, to have them reflect and highlight an inclusive vision of America, have consistently been met with exclusionary hate and violence, one of many histories that makes clear the truly national scope and scale of these conflicts.Last week, the walls of Fitchburg State University, where I am in my 13th year as Professor of English Studies and American Studies, featured their own white supremacist expressions. An anonymous community member or members posted signs around campus featuring the white supremacist hashtag “It’s OK to be white” ― the signs were posted directly next to publicity materials for multicultural campus organizations such as the Latin American Student Organization (LASO) and the Black Student Union (BSU). College campuses have of course become a particular space in which white supremacist spokespeople like Richard Spencer and Milo Yiannopoulus seek to advance their exclusionary rhetoric and vision of America, in an attempt to (among other effects) sway young people to these perspectives.I believe these exclusionary primal passions can also help explain one of the most frustrating current political stories: that the people of Alabama seem quite likely to vote tomorrow for an alleged child molester as their next Senator. In recent days other troubling statements of Moore’s have received media coverage, including his opposition to the 14th Amendment and all the other Constitutional Amendments after the first ten and his belief that America was “great” during the era of slavery. While those statements might seem further disqualifying to those of us who advocate for an inclusive vision of America, they also can help inflame the exclusionary primal passions of those for whom a white supremacist vision rings most true.What Moore reveals most clearly, that is, is that even the most seemingly basic and shared tenets of “our boasted civilization”—such as protecting young people from predators and threats—can crack and scale off when the primal passions of exclusion and white supremacy are hottest. There is indeed apparently no shared value or ideal that is not expendable in the campaign to produce such an exclusionary and white supremacist community, to “make America great again” in that telling way.Yet America has never been solely or centrally that white supremacist ideal—instead, that has always represented just one vision, in conflict with alternative, inclusive definitions of our national community and identity. As 2017 comes to a close, it seems clear to me that we are in the midst one of the most heated such conflicts between exclusionary and inclusive visions, and that this battle to define America is one of the most crucial we’ve faced. Whatever happens in Alabama, indeed whatever happens with Trump’s presidency, those of us fighting for an inclusive vision of America will need to keep up our efforts."

Despite this comment, the FCC did not correct its misunderstandings.”The comment referred to in the letter detailed numerous technical mistakes in the FCC’s proposed order, including a flawed understanding of the differences between ISPs and edge providers (content companies like Netflix), and how firewalls function (described in the document as “a stunning lack of technical knowledge”).The engineers and experts who wrote the comment warned that repealing net neutrality could have “dangerous consequences, including stifling future innovation and depressing future investment in the wealth of Internet services that drive such a large part of the U.S. economy.” Those concerns were reiterated in Monday’s letter, whose signatories included Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Mozilla Foundation Executive Chairwoman Mitchell Baker and Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle.The letter detailed how the FCC has not just ignored experts’ warnings but also the millions of public comments that have been submitted on the issue. The FCC, the letter noted, has also not “held a single open public meeting to hear from citizens and experts about the proposed Order” ― a break from “established practice.”The letter’s authors urged lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet, and the House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology to push FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to “cancel the FCC’s vote,” scheduled for Thursday.Should the vote go as expected, companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon (which owns Oath, HuffPost’s parent company) would be able to do things like block “content, websites and applications, slowing or speeding up services or classes of service, and charging online services for access or fast lanes to Internet access providers’ customers.” Protests against the vote have cropped up around the country, and celebrities have also been speaking out in an effort to delay the vote or prevent it entirely.“The FCC’s rushed and technically incorrect proposed Order to abolish net neutrality protections without any replacement is an imminent threat to the Internet we worked so hard to create. It should be stopped,” the letter concluded."

3,EDUCATION,How One California School District Is Leading The Way On New Science Standards,"EdSource, ContributorNonprofit news site focused on education policy and its effects",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-one-california-school-district-is-leading-the-way_us_5a2ee705e4b0cf10effbaf84,"By Carolyn Jones As schools nationwide take on the most comprehensive overhaul of science standards in 20 years, a school",2017-12-11,<p>Fifth graders in Torrance Unified practice the Next Generation Science Standards.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ee8471600002600cf0901.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Carolyn JonesAs schools nationwide take on the most comprehensive overhaul of science standards in 20 years, a school district in a quiet suburb of Los Angeles has become a pace-setter. Without relying on outside funding, or major grant money, Torrance Unified has trained more than 500 teachers and has unveiled the new standards to all 24,000 students in the district. By devoting thousands of hours to teacher training, the district has shown teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade how to explain a scientific phenomenon in a new way to their students — by letting the students discover the answers on their own, instead of memorizing facts from a textbook.“We feel science is the center of a good education, so this has been a priority for us from the beginning. But there are fundamental things we’ve done that all districts can do,” said Amy Argento, one of three classroom science teachers the district assigned to train their colleagues. “What we’ve done is replicable anywhere. Any district can do this.”Torrance is an ethnically mixed, middle class city of 145,000 a little over 20 miles south of Los Angeles. Twenty-five percent of the students in its public schools qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, and 16 percent are English learners. About 29 percent are Latino, 29 percent are Asian, 22 percent are white, 8 percent are Filipino and 4 percent are African American.The new standards, called Next Generation Science Standards, were introduced nationally in 2013, in response to concerns among science educators, political leaders and many others that K-12 science instruction in the United States trails behind many other industrialized countries.So far, 19 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, California was among the first. Stressing hands-on projects and critical thinking, the new standards represent a significant shift for most teachers — not just a change in subject matter, but to a new way of teaching, with less emphasis on textbooks and classroom lectures and more on open-ended scientific inquiry.That shift has required additional professional learning for even the most veteran teachers. Districts across California are preparing teachers now, either by sending them to off-site seminars, sitting in on colleagues’ classrooms or going to multi-day workshops over summer or school breaks.At the trainings, teachers learn the standards’ core ideas, such as “cause and effect"" or “relationships in ecosystems,” which are incorporated into all grade levels, as well as practical tips such as how to make lesson plans and oversee regular science experiments in class. The goal is for students to understand the broad scientific concepts that link all scientific disciplines and to learn those concepts through hands-on classroom projects.In California, all students are expected to be taught using the new standards by spring 2019, when schools will administer standardized tests based on the new standards. Students in some grades have already begun taking a pilot version of the test. Torrance’s jumpstart began with a handful of science teachers, who were impressed with how the new standards focused on “doing science, not just listening to a teacher talk about it,” said Marissa Stillittano, a former classroom teacher who’s now one of the district’s Next Generation Science Standards trainers.California had not updated its science standards since 1998, and some states hadn’t revised theirs since the 1980s. The new standards include recent scientific research breakthroughs as well as technology and engineering components, which were lacking in the previous standards.“There hadn’t been a lot of attention given to science education until Next Generation came along,” Stillittano said. “To see this national focus on science education and everything it could be was just very exciting, a chance to clean the slate. It was like, ‘OK, we can get this right.’ ”Stillittano, Argento, colleague Tera Black and other science teachers pushed the district to get an early start on training. The district agreed to fund two new positions to oversee the training and pay for substitutes so teachers could attend training throughout the year.Stillittano, Argento and Black started by learning the new standards themselves, then began organizing trainings in the district. They hold several trainings a week for small groups of teachers, divided by grade or subject matter.They try to keep the trainings focused and practical, encouraging teachers to collaborate, share curriculum ideas and resources, such as beakers, scales and microscopes for classroom science projects.They also give teachers materials they’ll need for classroom projects, such as balloons or baking soda, and give teachers tips on how to share supplies and where to buy materials at the lowest prices.But the most important aspect, they said, is the element of fun — the same thing that makes the new standards so popular with students. To help colleagues feel welcome and relaxed, Argento, Stillittano and Black wear matching outfits (during one recent training, all three wore black dresses and yellow sweaters), bring baked goods and lead the teachers in the same science experiments they’ll be overseeing in their classrooms during the school year.That means teachers make their own topographical maps of California using homemade play dough, or go outside to learn about energy transference by tossing dried pinto beans at each other.“You don’t learn swimming by reading a book. You jump in the pool. So we jumped in the pool,” said Katie Schenkelberg, a former science teacher and current principal at Carr Elementary, who was among the original teachers who championed the new standards.There are also evening sessions for parents to learn about the new standards, and trainings for other districts as well.In a 5th grade classroom at Towers Elementary, the new standards were in full swing on a recent Wednesday afternoon. Students were learning about properties of matter by dragging Q-tips soaked in iodine across Russet potato slices.One student, Gavin Ashley, dropped his jaw and gasped when his potato turned from creamy white to ashy gray.“I was not expecting that!” he said, scribbling his observations in a notebook. “I thought it would turn orange, the same color as the iodine. … I like how in science there’s so many different things you can try. It’s not boring.”Torrance Unified has drawn the attention of the nation's science education leaders, who praised the district’s efforts to fully implement Next Generation Science Standards ahead of schedule and on a limited budget.“I haven’t heard of another district of that size that has completed multiple trainings for all of their teachers,” said Chad Colby, spokesperson for Achieve, an education research nonprofit that helped craft the standards. “Torrance Unified — the educators, school leaders, the superintendent and school board — should be commended for making science education a priority.”Torrance is not the only district to get a jumpstart on the new standards. Elsewhere in California, eight other districts and two charter organizations are part of an “early implementer” program overseen by WestEd, the research and consulting firm headquartered in San Francisco, but Torrance has made its advances on its own.“What sets Torrance apart is that, I far as I know, they did it without major grants or outside funding,” said Kathy DiRanna, statewide director of WestEd’s K-12 Alliance, which provides professional development workshops to science teachers. “I know they have a dedicated group of science leaders that have helped pave the way. They are to be commended for the advancements that they have made.”Although all students are now learning the new standards and nearly all teachers have undergone multiple trainings, the process is not complete, said Ramona Chang, the district’s curriculum director. Because science is always changing and teaching techniques constantly evolve, professional development — especially related to something as nuanced as the Next Generation Science Standards — should be ongoing, she said.“In a perfect world, this would never terminate,” she said. Over the next few years, the district plans to pay for continued teacher training using state funds designated for this purpose in its Local Control Accountability Plan and small grants to teachers from the Torrance Education Foundation, as well as bond money to build science laboratories in its elementary schools. ""We have been fortunate to have the support of our community.""West High School biology teacher Nikki Chambers, who was on the science expert panel that helped California adopt the new standards, said switching to Next Generation Science Standards is not a simple or fast shift. Extensive teacher training, patience and administrative support is crucial for a rollout to be successful.“These standards are not what we were taught as children, and the teaching style is not the way we were taught to teach. It is a monumental change,” she said. “But what validates it for me is the buy-in from kids. The sense of wonder I see in my kids’ faces makes it worth every moment. I am convinced that this is the right way to teach science, and for districts, it’s the right thing to do.”California’s Next Generation Science Standards describe a new set of learning goals based on research on how students learn best. Teachers are expected to support more student-centered learning that helps students to think on their own, problem solve, communicate and collaborate. The new standards emphasize critical thinking over rote memorization, more hands-on science projects, and common scientific concepts present in all scientific disciplines such as “cause and effect” and “structure and function.” The standards also require students to investigate, collect and use data, and give evidence-based explanations for what they discover.The California standards require science to be taught in every grade from kindergarten through 12th grade to build understanding and skills systematically year by year. Beginning in the spring of 2019.students in grades 5 and 8 and in one high-school grade will be tested on a new California Science Test, or CAST, which the state is currently developing. It will be up to each high school to decide in which grade they administer the test.This story originally appeared on EdSource.org"
4,POLITICS,Super PAC's Facebook Ads Back Roy Moore Because Doug Jones Supports NFL Kneelers,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-super-pac-facebook_us_5a2ef809e4b078950282e0aa,Abortion and Nancy Pelosi are the other two topics of the group's targeted digital ads.,2017-12-11,The Facebook posts from America First Action go to a targeted group of Alabama voters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2efa2b1500001f0049b13d.png?cache=M8KCThkLs3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A pro-Trump super PAC is encouraging Alabama voters to support Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore because, it says on Facebook, Democratic rival Doug Jones is a liberal puppet of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi who supports abortion and NFL players who kneel during the national anthem.America First Action launched a $200,000 digital advertising campaign on Dec. 6. The digital ad buy came alongside a $500,000 television ad campaign and a direct-mail campaign costing nearly $400,000. Unlike the television ad campaign, the Facebook ads are not publicly posted to the group’s official Facebook page. Instead, they are seen only by the voters targeted to receive the message.HuffPost found four different Facebook ads exhorting conservative voters in Alabama to back Moore. Jones’ pro-abortion rights position was the most common message across these non-public ads. The second most common theme was that the former prosecutor supported NFL players who kneel during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice.The super PAC entered the special election in its final week after President Donald Trump officially endorsed Moore’s candidacy. Trump initially endorsed appointed Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) in the Republican Party primary, but Moore defeated Strange. Already unpopular among party elites both in Alabama and nationally, Moore was accused by multiple women of either hitting on them, dating them or molesting them while they were teenagers.The Republican National Committee pulled out of the race for nearly a month after the accusations were reported. With Trump’s backing, however, the RNC and the pro-Trump super PAC re-entered the race to back Moore ahead of the election, which is Tuesday.“We fight for our unborn,” one ad that had been viewed 201,000 times and shared 545 times as of Monday said. “We honor our Vets every time we play the Nation Anthem. But not Doug Jones… Jones is so liberal he supports abortion even at 20 weeks, when you can hear a baby’s heartbeat. Jones says he supports the players who kneel for the Anthem. GO VOTE December 12.” A very similar ad with an image of the Alabama flag was viewed 138,000 times and shared over 400 times as of Monday.Another ad leads with an image of a kneeling football player and says, “In ALABAMA we honor our Vets every time we play the Nation Anthem… But not Doug Jones. Jones says he supports the players who kneel for the Anthem. GO VOTE December 12.” This ad was viewed 230,000 times and shared over 700 times as of Monday.“We certainly don’t want to have a liberal Democrat that’s controlled by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,” a third ad says. (Schumer is Senate minority leader.) “We don’t want to have that for ALABAMA.” This ad was viewed 126,000 times and shared 928 times as of Monday.America First Action will not disclose most of its donors to the public until after the election. The only reported donation to the super PAC is $200,000 in April from Ronald Weiser, head of the Michigan Republican Party. "

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on Monday rejected the Trump administration’s request to issue a stay on an October ruling that had blocked President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender people in the military while the legal challenge made its way through the courts.The Pentagon has to honor the court order but also may continue to seek a stay, according to Joshua Block, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. The stay that the administration sought in the case of Doe v. Trump would have allowed the military to delay accepting transgender enlistees, according to a release from LGBTQ rights group GLAAD.“Today’s legal victory is the latest step towards preventing Trump’s bigoted trans military ban from ever going into full effect,” GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said Monday in a statement. “The Trump administration is struggling to provide any evidence that open trans enlistment be must be delayed because none exists beyond their own hate-fueled anti-LGBTQ agenda.”Two prominent LGBTQ advocacy organizations, the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, filed Doe v. Trump in August on behalf of five transgender service members.The suit came in response to the president announcing in July that transgender people would no longer be allowed to serve in the military. Trump signed a memo in August banning any new transgender people from enlisting ― a move that provoked widespread backlash. "

African Americans make up well over half of Flint’s population. We have passed the peak of the crises, but the damage has been done: a recent study found that fetal death rates in the area have risen by nearly 60 percent and residents are still being advised to drink bottled water.Pollution is first and foremost a public health problem — and the most vulnerable are low-income families, our children and communities of color. Recent investigative journalism uncovered almost 3,000 areas across the country with contamination rates far higher than in Flint; more than 1,100 of which had a rate of elevated blood tests at least four times higher than that of Flint at the peak of their crisis.To our organization — representing more than 50,000 African American physicians and our communities — those facts are more than numbers on a page, they represent suffering patients in our hospital rooms and worried families in our doctors’ offices.Still, many of these suffering communities are getting little attention or funding. Now is not the time to weaken public health protections or obstruct the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ability to do its job and help our communities in need. Yet, in less than a year after taking office, the new administration’s EPA continues to turn its back on clean water.Just this past summer, the new EPA Administrator announced rolling back the Clean Water Rule, which protects waterways that provide drinking water for one in three Americans. Water with high nitrate levels from runoff — the exact kind of pollution protection provided by the Clean Water Rule — is linked to low oxygen levels in babies and lead contamination. The National Medical Association (NMA) amassed hundreds of comments opposing the decision because we’ve seen the effect of water pollution on our communities’ health.For our patients, our doctors, and our communities, this is not a far-off-problem. It’s a present-crises that demands an answer, today. Instead, the administration plans to strip the EPA’s budget by nearly a third, which will decimate the agency’s ability to catch violators, clean up toxic pollution, and invest in badly needed water infrastructure. Unfortunately, fighting to keep our water clean is just one part of the extra burden on our vulnerable communities. An African American child in America is 10 times more likely to die from asthma than a white child; and compared to their white peers, African Americans have a nearly 40-percent higher exposure rate to air pollution. But the Administration has continued to weaken vehicle emissions regulations and push back deadlines to meet stricter standards for ground-level ozone pollution, which aggravates lung disease and asthma. In April, the EPA signaled weakening mercury and air toxics standards at power plants, which help avert tens of thousands of heart attacks and premature deaths a year.We all depend on the EPA to hold polluting industries accountable. However, instead of being the cop on the beat we need, the Administration is turning the EPA into an inside-man — answering to the political persuasion of special interest industry demands instead of to the public health needs of and the demands of the American people.By slashing protections for clean air and water, muzzling EPA scientists, cutting EPA funding, and disregarding facts, the administration is betraying its duty to the American people and making our jobs as medical professionals much harder. And it’s the most vulnerable Americans — minorities and low-income families — will pay a higher price for the misguided decisions by a backwards EPA.We at the National Medical Association (NMA) will continue to be a voice for justice in medicine and the elimination of health disparities, and we will continue to hold the administration accountable. The people in Flint deserve better. Every American deserves better. All we ask is that this administration do its job: protect public health and answer to the people’s need first, not polluters.

Six women — two of whom spoke on the record — said Judge Alex Kozinski had “subjected them to a range of inappropriate sexual conduct or comments” over the years, as recently as 2012, The Washington Post reported. One ex-clerk said Kozinski, 67, a veteran jurist and former chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, repeatedly showed her pornographic images on his computer and asked if she was sexually aroused by them.“I was in a state of emotional shock,” Heidi Bond, who clerked for Kozinski in 2006 and 2007, told the Post. “What I really wanted to do was be as small as possible and make as few movements as possible and to say as little as possible to get out.” Kozinski ― still a judge on the 9th Circuit, the country’s largest federal appeals court ― dismissed the accusations in an interview with the Los Angeles Times over the weekend.“If this is all they are able to dredge up after 35 years, I am not too worried,” said the judge, who is well known for his candid and colorful court opinions. He said he didn’t remember ever showing porn to his staffers.Another former clerk, Emily Murphy, told the Post that Kozinski once made a sexually inappropriate comment about her while they were chatting with a group of coworkers. He suggested she exercise naked at the gym, Murphy said, and when others attempted to change the topic, Kozinski continued to belabor the point. “It wasn’t just clear that he was imagining me naked, he was trying to invite other people — my professional colleagues — to do so as well,” said Murphy, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. “That was what was humiliating about it.”In a detailed blog post, Bond, now a novelist who writes under the pseudonym Courtney Milan, described some of her interactions with Kozinski.She recalled the judge calling her into his office and asking her to look at “pictures showed a handful of naked college-age people supposedly at a party where other people were clothed and drinking beer. In one of those photos, a man and a woman were sitting naked on a couch.”He asked if she thought the images were Photoshopped (she did). And then, she said, he asked: “Does this kind of thing turn you on?” “I remember feeling that I needed to not move, either physically or emotionally, that if I just treated this like this was normal it would stay normal and not get worse,” Bond wrote. She added that Kozinski showed her pornographic material on at least two other occasions. Another former staffer told the Post that she, too, had been asked into Kozinski’s chambers and shown porn.Bond wrote of another occasion when Kozinski showed her a “piece of paper listing all the girls that he and his friends had banged while they were in college, tracking their conquests.”“I don’t remember everything he told me. I do remember him talking about how terrible the focus on STDs today was, because nobody was willing to just fuck anymore,” she said. In a statement to The Washington Post and The New York Times, Kozinski said it was “regrettable” that some of his former staffers had been offended by his behavior. “I have been a judge for 35 years and during that time have had over 500 employees in my chambers,” he said. “I treat all of my employees as family and work very closely with most of them. I would never intentionally do anything to offend anyone and it is regrettable that a handful have been offended by something I may have said or done.”Back in 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported that Kozinski kept sexually explicit images and video footage on his private, but publicly accessible, website.At the time, a judicial council rebuked the judge for being careless in allowing the website to be accessed publicly, and for “exhibiting poor judgment ... [that] resulted in embarrassment to the institution of the federal judiciary.”UPDATE: On Dec. 15, seven more women came forward in The Washington Post alleging that Kozinski had subjected them to groping, sexual comments or other forms of misconduct. Four women told the Post that the judge had touched them inappropriately. The women all had worked with Kozinski or met him at an event. That brings the total number of women who have accused the judge of inappropriate sexual comments or conduct to 15.Through a statement read by one of his lawyers, the Post reported, Kozinski disputed the veracity of the allegations. He added, “I deeply regret that my unusual sense of humor caused offense or made anyone uncomfortable.” "

On Sunday, the actor revealed the name during an interview with Entertainment Online at the Los Angeles premiere of his new animated film, “Ferdinand.” Cannavale explained the name was, at least partly, inspired by his Cuban roots on his mother’s side.“I hadn’t given one of my children a Latin name yet, so I wanted to honor my mom’s side of the family,” the 47-year-old actor told ET. “And, you know, [tennis champion] Rafael Nadal had such a great year and we were constantly keeping up with him and watching all his matches so we were like, ‘How about Rafa? That goes well with Rocco.’ And that was it.”Cannavale and Byrne welcomed Rafa to their world last month, nearly two years after the birth of their son Rocco. The “Ferdinand” actor is also father to 22-year-old son Jake from a previous relationship. The actor shared a photo of himself hugging his two youngest sons on Monday via Instagram, and in the caption he wrote: “Winning.” "
9,BUSINESS,Sexual Harassment Comes At A Cost. So Does Speaking Up About It.,"Yassmin Abdel-Magied, Guest WriterGuest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/workplace-sexual-harassment_us_5a26ca50e4b0f104475e23cf,And the price is often steepest for the women who can least afford it.,2017-12-11,Demonstrators at the #MeToo Survivors' March in Los Angeles last month. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a26cc18140000f36fb6b8ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why do people leave organizations? Reasons often include dealing with bad management, finding a higher paid role elsewhere, or not seeing opportunities for promotion and growth. Workplace sexual harassment is rarely treated as an issue of retention, but it affects morale and career satisfaction at least as drastically as an issue like a difficult boss. Sexual harassment is one of the many ways workplaces are a hostile environment for women, pushing them out of organizations and sometimes entire industries. And sexual harassment clearly reflects the power structures that define our society. It exacts a high cost on all individuals and communities, but the price is disproportionately shouldered by women who can least afford it. Women of color and other marginalized women are among those hit hardest by a culture that for generations has turned a blind eye to the epidemic. Workplace sexual harassment comes with a steep cost: the cost of participation.A 2008 study by the American Psychological Association found a correlation between “work withdrawal” and the aftermath of sexual harassment for black women. And in a 2016 survey of the Chicago leisure and hospitality industry, where the majority of women are of color, 49 percent of housekeepers said a guest had answered the door naked or exposed themselves. The most damning result? Of those housekeepers, 56 percent said they did not feel safe returning to work after the incident. The system was failing these women. Formal report numbers were low, partly because the workers didn’t believe it would make a difference to tell their stories. In fact, 43 percent of respondents said they knew someone who had reported harassment and seen nothing change. Unfortunately, their fears are well-founded. Two-third of employees who spoke out against workplace mistreatment faced some sort of retaliation, according to a 2003 study cited by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And although times are changing, they might not be changing for women in certain workplaces just yet. The outpouring of recent allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent consequences for some perpetrators have prompted many to say we’re in the middle of a turning point in how sexual harassment is dealt with. This is true for some women, but not for all.When allegations against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men turned Hollywood upside down, Jane Fonda pointed out the obvious: The women speaking out were being listened to because they were famous and white.Fatima Goss Graves, the CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, agreed, saying, “Class and race and stature play into whether someone is believed.”Ironically, the #MeToo movement was started a decade ago by black social activist Tarana Burke. It took Alyssa Milano, a white actress, using the hashtag for it to go viral ― among other white women, at least. We’ve seen this before, such as in the racism of the suffragettes, FEMEN’s attempts to “liberate” Muslim women despite protests, and the exclusive nature of the Women’s March. When marginalized women, particularly women of color, need solidarity, their white sisters don’t often show up.We have seen this play out in the cases of black actresses like Lupita Nyong’o and Aurora Perrineau. The implication is clear: Yes, women who allege sexual harassment and other forms of abuse are to be believed ― if they’re the right kind of woman. The majority of women don’t fit that criteria, and those who live and work at the intersections of marginalization ― whether due to race, religion or disability ― are often hardest hit by harassment. Unfortunately, they’re also the least supported. The eventual outcome is dismal. For women who are not famous, wealthy or otherwise influential, socioeconomic, cultural and historical disadvantages compound to make it more likely that harassment will occur and less likely that it will be taken seriously. The history of sexual exploitation through slavery has created a culture where black women are more likely to be sexually harassed but less likely to be perceived as victims. They are therefore less likely to report, and the cycle continues. Socioeconomic status exacerbates this vulnerability; the majority (58 percent, as of 2013) of low-income families in the U.S. are a racial or ethnic minority. Low-income women of color often lack bargaining power, face language and financial barriers to accessing legal services, and in some cases, are not even aware of their rights. Undocumented workers also face unique additional challenges, as fears of retaliation or deportation may deter them from taking legal action.It is imperative to acknowledge that efforts to improve the lot of one group of women may only tangentially affect women in other groups. If we are truly interested in building a world where all women feel safe, supported and able to fully participate in their communities and workplaces, we must remember a rising tide does not lift every woman’s boat. We need to be proactive in our advocacy for low-wage women and women of color. We must ensure vulnerable women are provided adequate training, in the language they are most comfortable in, so they understand their rights. The more educated a workplace is, the less likely potential perpetrators will be to think they can get away with harassment. We need to find ways to support these women ― legally, financially, emotionally ― when action is taken. The #MeToo moment will be incomplete if it serves only the white, wealthy and otherwise privileged among us. Look around in your own workplace and make sure no woman is being overlooked. Failing to do so will not only affect the women as individuals, but will ultimately damage our workplaces, our communities and our societies. We will all be poorer for it."

Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) is taking steps to protect the teenagers in the Senate Page Program from predatory members. The congresswoman asked the Senate Sergeant at Arms in a letter on Monday to “take steps to prepare the Page Program for the possible election of Roy Moore,” the Alabama Republican accused of pursuing sexual relationships with girls as young as 14. The 30 Senate pages, who are essentially interns, are mostly rising high school juniors and seniors, some as young as 16.“I write you today to share my urgent concern regarding the threat to the safety of the young men and women working in the United States Senate Page Program if Roy Moore becomes the U.S. senator to Alabama,” Rep. Moore wrote. “The nature of life on Capitol Hill necessitates long hours in close proximity to lawmakers and staff that can create power dynamics of which young people are not fully aware,” she added.The congresswoman noted that in 2006, then-Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) resigned from Congress after it came out that he had sent sexually suggestive texts and emails to teenage boys in the Congressional Page Program. Roy Moore denies having sexually pursued teenage girls, but at least 10 accusers have come forward so far to make claims against him. Polls still show him leading his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, in Alabama’s special election.Gwen Moore’s office said she is waiting to hear what steps the Sergeant at Arms will take to protect the pages, and then she will work with child abuse experts and social workers to determine whether those measures are adequate. “It would be unconscionable for Congress not to be vigilant and proactive in taking precautions to safeguard these children given the well sourced allegations against Moore,” she wrote."
11,POLITICS,Ted Cruz Challenger Picks Up Key Environmental Endorsement,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/beto-orourke-cruz-environment_us_5a2c44c3e4b0a290f0513f93,"After being rocked by Hurricane Harvey, will Texas pick Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke over an oil industry-funded climate change denier?",2017-12-11,Rep. Beto O'Rourke shown with supporters of single-payer health care.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2c96b6190000be3503575d.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The county judge gave Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke a dire warning earlier this year when the three-term El Paso congressman leaned down to sip from a water fountain outside the Lasalle County courthouse, a roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive from San Antonio.Don’t drink the water.A gas drilling company contaminated the water table, the judge told him, and no one trusted the water to be safe. It’s a story of industrial pollution that’s become familiar to O’Rourke since he began barnstorming the state in March in a bid to unseat incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.“We hear these stories around the state,” O’Rourke told HuffPost by phone on Sunday, calling during halftime at his daughter’s soccer game. “It becomes this very personal, critically important public health issue. They want to know someone is fighting for their water and their air.” For at least one major environmental group, the 45-year-old congressman is that someone. On Monday, the League of Conservation Voters plans to throw its support behind O’Rourke, giving him its fourth Senate endorsement yet for the 2018 election cycle. “He’s had a really strong record in Congress on our issues,” Craig Auster, League of Conservation Voters’ political action committee director, told HuffPost. “We’re excited that in a state like Texas that someone is running on our issues and has done so much for the environment in his legislative career.” The League of Conservation Voters Action Fund spent a record $4,461,552 in 2016, including on 22 Senate candidates, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive Politics. Total campaign spending across the organization’s various funds and campaign groups topped $45 million. Ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, the group has endorsed Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), as well as Doug Jones’ campaign for Tuesday’s Alabama special election. Cruz, who raised more money from oil and gas companies in 2016 than any other industry, is one of the most virulent climate change deniers in the Senate. By contrast, O’Rourke’s voting record earned a 94 percent lifetime score on the League of Conservation Voters’ national environmental ranking.At a time when President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed shrinking 10 national monuments and gutting at least two, O’Rourke stands out as a champion of public lands. He introduced legislation last year and pushed the Obama administration to establish a 7,081-acre national monument at Castner Range, near El Paso. Last month, he successfully included a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act to protect the area, which includes a historic U.S. military training facility.Over the past year, O’Rourke became a vocal critic of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt’s plans to drastically shrink the agency’s budget and eliminate greenhouse gas regulations, and came out against the Keystone XL pipeline. On Sunday, he told HuffPost he supports putting a price on carbon emissions and wants to jumpstart Texas’s transformation into a renewable energy powerhouse. This year, the state became the nation’s top wind energy producer, but lags behind other states in solar production.Climate change is already taking a major toll on Texas, he said, pointing to historic droughts in north Texas and the devastation left after Hurricane Harvey made landfall over the Houston area last August. Sixty-nine percent of Texans recognize global warming is happening, though just 52 percent understand that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are the main cause, according to 2016 survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Seventy-one percent in the state support regulating carbon dioxide emissions as a pollutant.“Folks get it, we all get it,” O’Rourke said, referring to the recent disasters. “This is connected to climate change, which is connected to the personal and political decisions we make.”Meanwhile, Cruz has convened fossil fuel industry scientists to refute climate change, dismissed global warming as a costly “religion,” and urged Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. When Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in August, the former Republican presidential candidate refused to answer questions about the link between climate change and the storm, which scientists said was made worse by rising temperatures.Cruz raised over $2 million for his re-election campaign and its allied groups in the third quarter of this year alone, The Texas Tribune reported in October, outpacing O’Rourke’s $1.7 million haul during the same three-month period.Phil Novack, a spokesman for Cruz, did not respond to a request for comment.O’Rourke hasn’t eschewed corporate donors. Executives from cable giant Time Warner, Google parent Alphabet Inc. and the investor-owned hospital and clinic chain Tenet Healthcare rank among his top campaign contributors, though those came from individuals and not from the companies’ political action committees. But Cruz is unquestionably the fossil fuel industry favorite. Oil and gas companies alone contributed at least $965,062 to his campaign committee and leadership PAC during this election cycle, once again securing the industry’s status as his top donor.“When you think of Texas and energy, you think of oil and gas, which is certainly part of it, but it’s increasingly wind and solar and geothermal and the science and innovation around carbon capture and sequestration,” O’Rourke said.“There’s all this good stuff happening in Texas where you might not expect it to come from,” he added. “What we need now is public leadership that can take this great set of conditions and really lead nationally and make the most of the best of Texas.”"

We don’t like it. And attitudes such as these must change if we ever hope to see change.There are reasons why coal miners have voted for pro-industry politicians, and naïveté and gullibility are not foremost among them. A common misconception is that today’s miners are old style traditionalists dedicated to mining coal as a continuation of the way of life they’ve inherited. This may be the case for foreman wearing white hardhats who receive invitations to the White House, but the rest of us are not quite so obtuse. When mining families defend the industry outside the confines of sheer economic necessity, they do so in response to the assault on their culture by outside elitists and out-of-touch environmental groups. Those of us who entered the mines during the coal market upswing of the 2000s were facing difficult, if not impossible choices. Some of the men I worked with were tired of being away from home, spending weeks on the road to earn a living as construction workers or commercial truck drivers. Others were prison guards who could no longer handle the mental stresses of working in the region’s super maximum-security prisons. Relocating one’s family was no easy option either. Real estate values in an economically depressed region do not compare to areas with better job opportunities. Even if we had the financial ability to relocate, we were still faced with the prospect of competing for jobs in areas where public schools are better funded and there are more people with college degrees. In Appalachia, we at least had a sense of place that reaches back generations, and the support of friends and family. When you have that, coal mining doesn’t seem quite so bad, but it no way means you are unaware of your standing within the grand scheme of things.Miners are still keenly aware that their labor is doing more to benefit outside investors and corporate executives than it is their communities. We have all witnessed friends and family fight in vain for compensation after suffering from permanent injuries and black lung. We have seen the companies file bankruptcy to shirk their financial obligations to our forefathers. Everyone also understands that they must walk a straight company line or else risk finding themselves among the next group to be laid off in a market downturn. Few people seem to realize the lack of choices miners face. They do not realize that many miners would jump at the chance to earn a decent living without risking their life and sacrificing their health. The problem is, even with re-training, there are no jobs waiting that can match the salaries and benefits they have now. The last thing coal miners need to hear are promises of economic development from environmental organizations and politicians looking for votes and funding. This is all obvious to us “ignorant hillbillies.” It is also obvious to us that we are frequently characterized as simple-minded white trash in the national media and by faux hillbilly authors like J.D. Vance. And we know why this happens: because this kind of caricature makes it seem to be our fault. Like we were too dumb to leave when the coal industry crashed. Like we are the ones too stupid to understand the environmental costs. Like we were the ones who foolishly believed Trump would bail us out. For many Appalachians, the coal industry is a necessary evil for both our economic and cultural survival. We are quite literally damned if we do, and damned if we don't. We know we don't have a choice. Why doesn’t the rest of the nation understand this too?"

Due to a request for privacy, we are not commenting further.”Lizza, an on-air contributor for CNN and The New Yorker’s Washington correspondent from 2007 to 2017, made headlines in July for a bombshell interview with Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director. CNN announced in a subsequent statement that Lizza “will not appear on CNN while we look into this matter.”In a statement, Lizza denied that he had done anything inappropriate.“I am dismayed that the New Yorker has decided to characterize a respectful relationship with a woman I dated as somehow inappropriate,” the statement read. “The New Yorker was unable to cite any company policy that was violated.”The law firm representing an unnamed woman it identified as “the victim of Mr. Lizza’s misconduct” pushed back on the reporter’s version of events.“In no way did Mr. Lizza’s misconduct constitute a ‘respectful relationship’ as he has now tried to characterize it,” Wigdor LLP partner Douglas Wigdor wrote in a statement to media on Monday. The law firm said that the woman reported Lizza’s actions both to ensure he would be held accountable and to help other potential victims by coming forward.Over the past year, a number of prominent men in broadcast, print and online media have been accused of sexual misconduct. In April, Fox News forced out cable news host Bill O’Reilly after a New York Times report revealed a number of sexual harassment allegations against him ― months after the network had ousted chairman Roger Ailes amid his own sexual harassment scandal.Since October, when news broke of sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, women have been coming forward with stories of sexual harassment and abuse across industries, from entertainment to politics. In media, NBC “Today” show host Matt Lauer, one-time ABC journalist Mark Halperin and CBS and PBS host Charlie Rose ― to name a few ― were all recently fired after sexual misconduct allegations."

Earlier this year, actress Mila Kunis echoed many parents’ sentiments about holiday gift-giving. In October, she clarified her comment that she was adopting a new Christmas tradition that involved “no presents for the kids” from her and her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher. During an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Kunis explained that she’s not “anti-gifts” but that she wants to scale back when it comes to showering her kids with presents.“They get so many wonderful gifts from my family and my husband’s family so he and I give her literally one present,” she said.We asked the HuffPost Parents community to share their similar holiday traditions ― ones that don’t involve piles of toys for the kiddos. Some prefer to invoke the phrase “quality over quantity,” others choose to gift experiences rather than toys, and many moms and dads decide to show their kids what it means to give instead of offering presents to them.Here are 19 holiday traditions that focus on more than giving kids tons of toys:“We are getting away from toys and a ridiculous amount of presents for useful things and experiences. This year, my 10-year-old daughter asked if we could redecorate her bedroom, so that will be her big gift.” ― Jamie Braithwaite“I always make my kids pick out a few toys each that we then donate to less fortunate children (not to the Red Cross or Salvation Army, but locally), even though we aren’t that fortunate ourselves. I guess it is cliche, but I’m hoping to instill a desire to give and sacrifice potential presents to give to others.” ― Kyle Taylor“Instead of stocking stuffers, Santa brings us tickets to see a play or a musical so that we can plan on going together and enjoying the theater as a family.” ― Jessica Hoho“Instead of gifts for the grown-ups, we each bring grooming items for the homeless and less fortunate (razors, shaving cream, feminine products, lotion, shampoo, baby diapers and wipes). The children get one present each. Christmas feels so much better since we started this.” ― Lynnda Armstrong Owens“This is how we do presents: Something you want, something you need, something to wear, something to read and then Santa’s gift (something special).” ― Christine Simpson“We do three gifts under the tree: something to wear, something to read and something they asked for. Then we do an experience. This year it’s a trip to Myrtle Beach for the first time. One is getting tickets to dinner theater, and one is getting tickets to the aquarium so we’ll be making memories.” ― Covey Denton“My dad passed away in 2008, and my mom wanted to do something different for Christmas that year. So my husband, two sons and I took Mom to Florida over Christmas (we’re in Indiana). We did a few presents and stockings there, but focused on having fun and making memories. My mom climbed a lighthouse to see the view with her grandsons! Kept that up for three more years until she passed. We still go. Last couple of years we added a visit to Universal Studios over New Year’s as their big present.” ― Susan Burleigh“Every year a different adult family member chooses a charity and in lieu of gifts, we donate money to that well-researched charity. It brings a sense of awareness outside of ourselves and fosters a spirit of gratitude and generosity. My kids and niece and nephew start participating at 10 years old, but they still receive gifts.” ― Julie Lampert Franks“Make cookies, drink hot cocoa, wear matching PJs, pop popcorn and watch a movie on Christmas Eve. Then plan a summer vacation as a big ‘Santa’ gift.” ― Kaitlyn Kambestad“Twenty-five days of Christmas books ― every morning in December, my kids open up a different Christmas book that we read together. It’s our version of an Advent calendar, and I enjoy it as much as the kids.” ― Eileen Conlon Blanco“We have adopted a quality over quantity rule. It’s better to have something nice, valuable, sentimental ... than lots of little things that you’ll forget about in a week. So we do two to three really thoughtful and nicer gifts. The girls love it, and I think it makes Christmas more magical when it’s important. Plus it’s even better when the gift you give relates to an inside joke you have been babying along all year!” ― Brianna Freeburn“We do give and receive presents, but we open a couple on Christmas Day plus a stocking, and the rest get opened on the other 11 days of Christmas. We had a rule growing up that you couldn’t open another present until you had appreciated the one you already have. I’m keen to make sure I continue this rule with my children; too many Christmases are all about a commercially driven mountain of presents being ripped open and discarded. We still always place a walnut and a satsuma [a citrus fruit] in the stockings, too, and it’s still one of my favorite presents!” ― Alice George“We try to do presents that are all experiences and spending time together. We do get a few extra presents that my son wants. We give books about what experiences we are doing. We always give as a present one ornament for our tree, which my son will get when he goes off and has his own. We always pick a charity in giving back and donate to them. We make cinnamon rolls, which my son loves. They are a treat during the holidays.” ― Kathy Fulham“I’m from northeast Philly and every year around Christmas we go into town and get our meat for Christmas dinner at the Reading Terminal Market. We then visit the light shows in town. We also cut our tree down three weeks before Christmas. The place we go to has a store, train sets, Santa, a big fire pit and hot chocolate. It’s so much fun. Glad I started these traditions so my kids can carry them on!” ― Jennifer Vaughn“Mom gets her books, Dad makes her something (out of wood) and Santa gets her one gift.” ― Kimberly Ballinger“Christmas light tour of the city!” ― Corin Ramos“We are doing a family vacation this year.” ― Mandee Kanikula“We started the tradition of giving our son experiences/adventures instead of toys. Last year, we gave him a Christmas-themed picnic on a lake with his little friends. He’s now a picnic enthusiast! This year, we may give him a year pass to a local children’s museum as a gift that keeps on giving.” ― Ivette Palomera“We always ‘adopted’ a family in need. We would buy presents, clothes, food, hygiene items ... and deliver them anonymously. We also would bake/make meals and take them to police stations/children’s hospitals for those that had to work the holiday. My favorite Christmas memories are all doing things like this!” ― Mackenzie SchmidThese submissions have been edited and condensed for clarity. "

Gavin Newsom and education leaders are urging the University of California to address allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct by University of California regent and radio mogul Norman Pattiz, nearly a year after several people said Pattiz made them uncomfortable in the workplace. One of the women, comedian Heather McDonald, released a tape in November 2016 of Pattiz asking her if he could hold her breasts. Pattiz has confirmed that it’s his voice on the tape and apologized. Another employee accused Pattiz, a Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department reserve officer, of brandishing his firearm in a threatening manner. Pattiz denies those allegations.In a letter dated Nov. 29, Newsom, California Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson and UC Student Regent Paul Monge asked university officials to make clear what they have done or will do about Pattiz, whom Gov. Jerry Brown reappointed to a 12-year term in 2014.The issue is complicated by the fact that it’s not possible for anyone ― including the board itself, any California legislative body or the governor, who appoints most regents ― to remove Pattiz. Instead, Pattiz would need to voluntarily resign.In a statement, Marvin Putnam, a lawyer for Pattiz, said the McDonald incident had been resolved and that if Newsom “took a moment to learn the facts, then he would not have sent the letter he did.”“As Napolitano stated at the time, the matter is now closed,” Putnam said. “There is an American tradition of not rushing to judgment without knowing the facts; hopefully, we are not losing that august tradition in the midst of the important national conversation and reevaluation that is now underway.”Brown wants Pattiz to resign, according to two sources familiar with his thinking. He has had a senior staff member request Pattiz’s resignation at least once, the sources said, but Pattiz refused.The UC Regents, more formally known as the Regents of the University of California, is a governing board charged with overseeing the University of California system, including over 200,000 students and over 150,000 faculty and staff members. It has broad powers and helps to oversee a multibillion-dollar budget. The scandal-plagued University of California system has been working to improve its handling of sexual harassment cases by speeding up investigation timelines. And earlier this year, the Board of Regents also strengthened its own ethics policies, addressing procedures for investigations into alleged misconduct and providing options for sanctioning a regent if allegations are proven.In the Nov. 29 letter, sent to University of California President Janet Napolitano and UC Board of Regents Chair George Kieffer, the signatories ask whether there has been, or will be, an investigation into Pattiz’s conduct. If an investigation is not allowed, they ask if the board has the power to retroactively enact sanctions created earlier this year, which could include censure or removal of Pattiz from all chairmanships and committees.Pattiz serves on the Academic and Student Affairs, Governance and Compensation, Public Engagement, and Development committees. He has served as the chair of the National Laboratories committee, but former Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher, who now serves on the Board of Regents, is taking over that position, and Pattiz recently chaired his last committee meeting.“This has been a matter of deep concern at many levels of the University of California (UC) especially in light of the systemwide work we have done to address sexual harassment and sexual violence,” the letter reads.Pattiz, a successful radio and podcast entrepreneur, has served on the UC Board of Regents since 2001. He has been under fire for more than a year over numerous allegations of workplace sexual harassment and other misconduct.The letter cites an incident from May 2016, in which Pattiz was recorded asking if he could hold comedy writer Heather McDonald’s breasts during a taping of her podcast “Juicy Scoop.” McDonald was part of a podcast network Pattiz founded, PodcastOne, and recorded her show at the network’s Los Angeles-based studio.As McDonald finishes recording a commercial for a bra company, she says, “You’re making me nervous now, OK.”Pattiz then says, “Wait a minute ― can I hold your breasts? Would that help?”McDonald responds with an emphatic, “No.” Pattiz then says, “These are memory foam” ― a reference to his hands. He laughs and adds, “My memory.”McDonald left PodcastOne shortly after the incident. The LA Times reported on the exchange and also detailed accounts of several other former PodcastOne employees, some anonymous, who have worked with Pattiz and said he would make remarks about women’s bodies and their looks in the workplace, at times making them feel uncomfortable.Ji Min Park told the LA Times she left PodcastOne in 2016 after working there for a year, largely because of sexually inappropriate comments from Pattiz. Park told the LA Times Pattiz said she was the “hottest Asian” and told her, “If I wasn’t married, I’d be chasing you down a hallway right now.”Pattiz told Park she looked like a schoolgirl and that he had watched “too many videos” with schoolgirls in them, according to the account she gave the LA Times. She and others assumed he was talking about pornographic videos.Emilia Dantes, a friend of Park’s, told student newspaper The Daily Californian in 2016 that Park was often afraid of going to work, concerned Pattiz would potentially assault or harass her.“She was miserable and felt sick to her stomach every day,” Dantes said. “Wondering, is he going to come upstairs today? What will he say? Is this the day he grabs me or touches me?”Pattiz’s lawyer said there is no Emilia Dantes.Raymond Hernandez, a former producer at PodcastOne, told the LA Times that he frequently witnessed Pattiz making comments about women’s breasts and bodies, including the size of the breasts of two podcasters who were pregnant. Hernandez also alleged that at one point, Pattiz asked several employees if they wanted to see revealing photos on his phone of a female executive at PodcastOne. Other PodcastOne staff members corroborated Hernandez’s allegations to the LA Times.Pattiz apologized for making McDonald feel uncomfortable, but did not address any other allegations.“There is no excuse for any such comments or making anyone feel uncomfortable,” he told the LA Times. “If I did that, I sincerely apologize, and it will be a valuable learning experience. I can assure you that you can teach an old dog new tricks.”McDonald told the outlet she did not accept Pattiz’s apology.The recent letter also cites a 2016 incident in which Hernandez said Pattiz brandished a loaded firearm and belt knife at Hernandez to force him to report false numbers of downloads for various podcasts to advertisers. In a lawsuit Hernandez filed against Pattiz in September in Los Angeles Superior Court, he alleges Pattiz displayed the weapons at PodcastOne “to intimidate” him into complying with Pattiz’s orders. Hernandez also said Pattiz would take out his LA County Sheriff’s Office badge and brag about his connections in law enforcement.Pattiz’s lawyer called the allegations in the lawsuit “fantastical.”“As to those few that we can decipher, they are completely false,” he said. “The allegations will be met with a vigorous defense and countersuit, and will be litigated in court where they properly belong.”Responding to the recent letter, Kieffer, the UC Board of Regents chair, said that former Chair Monica Lozano had sent a letter to Pattiz expressing her concern about his inappropriate comments to Heather McDonald. He added that the board established a requirement for regents to follow an anti-sexual harassment training, as is required for other university employees. Pattiz was in the process of taking the course, Kieffer said. Kieffer added that the university was currently not investigating the incident involving Hernandez, as it is part of an ongoing lawsuit. In response to the numerous allegations against Pattiz, the University of California Student Association passed a resolution in January calling for his resignation.The student association strongly condemned Pattiz’s behavior, and said keeping him as a UC regent “is an insult to the students by which they claim to serve, especially students who identify as survivors of sexual harassment or sexual violence.”But a defiant Pattiz told students just last month they should be “ashamed of themselves” for demanding he resign. When asked by The Mercury News if he would consider stepping down from the board, he told the newspaper, “Not on your life.”Newsom and the other signatories of the letter say they share the students’ concerns about Pattiz, which have been compounded by the host’s “degrading comments” aimed at students.“Regents are expected to show respect for the opinions of our students,” the letter reads. “These students – some of whom are survivors of sexual assault and harassment themselves – deserve to be heard, not silenced or told to be ‘ashamed.’”This story has been updated with comments from Pattiz’s lawyer and UC Board of Regents Chair George Kieffer."

Tom Higham and Georges Kazan, directors of the Oxford Relics Cluster, used radiocarbon dating to investigate a pelvic bone fragment thought to belong to the saint. The tests showed that the bone fragment dates to the fourth century ― the period when some historians believe St. Nicholas died. Higham, a professor who works with Kazan and others at Oxford to apply scientific techniques to the study of relics, told HuffPost that it’s rare for relics to date back to the time period matching when a saint is believed to have died. He estimated that only one of every 20 relics he’s encountered stands up to this kind of scientific scrutiny. It’s much more likely for the relics to come from a somewhat later historical period.But this bone fragment appears to have defied the team’s expectations, suggesting a possibility the bones may have belonged to St. Nicholas himself. “We are always surprised when, despite all of the possible opportunities for material to be lost or replaced by something else, that the age we measure for relics such as these come out to be the same age as historically attested,” Higham told HuffPost in an email. “It doesn’t always happen. In this case the date we measured in the laboratory overlapped perfectly with the age expected for St. Nicholas.”Christian religious relics are physical objects that have an association with a saint or with Jesus Christ. They can be fragments of a human body, pieces of something the saint owned ― a shirt or a book ― or something the saint touched. In the Catholic tradition, relics are believed to be vehicles through which God brings healing and works miracles. As a result, relics are often kept in churches and “venerated” by the faithful, who come to touch, kiss, or pray next to these sacred objects. St. Nicholas is believed to have lived in the fourth century in Myra, Asia Minor, an area now part of modern-day Turkey. Legends about the bishop paint him as a generous soul who gave freely to the poor.He was buried in Myra, but in 1087, his remains were apparently stolen and transported to Bari, Italy. His relics are still buried in a crypt at the Basilica San Nicola in Bari.After the Protestant Reformation, devotion to the saint remained strong in Holland, where he was known in Dutch as Sinterklaas. His myth was eventually tangled with Nordic folk tales of a magician who punished bad children and rewarded good children with gifts.The legend crossed the Atlantic with Dutch colonists in the 17th century. Sinterklaas was eventually adopted by America’s English speakers as Santa Claus and became known as the jolly, generous fellow who presented children with gifts at Christmastime.While most of St. Nicholas’ relics remain in Bari, pieces associated with the saint have dispersed to other regions of the world. Other parts are at the Chiesa di San Nicolo al Lido in Venice, Italy.The bone that the Oxford researchers analyzed came from Lyon in France, and is now owned by the Rev. Dennis O’Neill, a Catholic priest in the Chicago area who collects Christian relics. The Oxford researchers’ interest in O’Neill’s collection was piqued when they heard that the pelvic bone fragment owned by the Chicago priest is from the left pubis (the lower part of the bone), while the remains in Bari only have the left ilium (from the upper part of the bone). This suggested both fragments could potentially belong to the same person. Higham said his team is now seeking to study the relics held in Bari, to see if the Chicago bone can be linked to that skeletal material and DNA. In the future, they’re hoping to use palaeogenomics and stable isotope analysis to figure out the deceased’s gender, age at time of death, and the geographic area in which the person lived.“With science we can’t definitively prove it is [St. Nicholas], only that it is not, but we are aiming to continue with our work on other bones from the saint to see whether we can link this bone and others genetically,” Higham said."

It’s not yet known if they found anything of interest.Each of the shootings occurred during the early morning hours of Dec. 7, along a tangle of interstate highways.Police say the drivers were lucky: A Chesterfield Township man who was shot in the leg while driving on I-94 was the only person known to sustain an injury. The victim told police he was heading westbound near Gratiot Avenue when an unknown vehicle pulled alongside him and opened fire.Bullets or projectiles hit two other cars that morning along I-96, near Detroit’s west side. One of those drivers told police he believed the shooter was inside a silver Impala that had pulled alongside his vehicle.Currently, there is no known relationship between any of the victims.Michigan police have been saturating the freeways where the shootings occurred, looking for suspicious activity. But there have been no additional shootings since Dec. 7The case is somewhat reminiscent of a similar spate of shootings along Detroit-area highways in October 2012. In that case, Raulie Casteel, then 44, was arrested and ultimately convicted of terrorism after committing 23 shootings. Casteel is currently serving 18 to 40 years in prison.Anyone with information about Thursday’s shootings is asked to call Michigan State Police at (313) 237-2450.Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

20,POLITICS,There Are Huge Obstacles To Casting A Ballot In Alabama's Special Election,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-special-election-voter-id_us_5a2ee40ee4b04617543278f2,"Advocates are worried the state's voter ID law, and confusion over another law, will suppress voter turnout.",2017-12-11,"Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones waves to reporters as he leaves a restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama, Dec. 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a2ee52a150000490049b0b8.jpeg?cache=EaGkpQQ8x3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The last-minute push to focus on voter turnout in the Alabama special election for a U.S. Senate seat has brought the state’s restrictive voting policies into renewed focus, prompting concern that many eligible voters who wish to cast a vote on Tuesday will not be able to.Democrats have focused on mobilizing black voters in the state, a constituency they believe they need if Democrat Doug Jones is going to pull off an upset victory over Roy Moore, his Republican opponent. But voting advocates in the state worry that voters of color, along with the poor and the elderly, may face disproportionate obstacles to casting a ballot.One of those hurdles, advocates say, is the state’s voter ID law. Passed in 2011 and in effect since 2014, the law requires Alabama voters to show one of 10 acceptable forms of identification when they vote.The state offers free IDs to anyone who needs one, but civil rights groups say the law discriminates against people of color, the poor and the elderly, who are less likely to have an acceptable form of ID. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund sued the state over the law in 2015.Deuel Ross, an NAACP LDF lawyer involved in the voter ID suit, said his organization estimates black voters in Alabama are twice as likely to lack an acceptable form of ID as their white counterparts. In total, Ross said, the group estimates 118,000 people in Alabama don’t have an acceptable form of ID to be able to vote.“We think there are going to be a group of people who either will show up to the polls and not be able to vote, or who will not turn out because they don’t have the right ID that’s needed in order to vote,” he said.It’s difficult to gauge the impact of voter ID measures on turnout, because people have any number of reasons for not making it to the polls. One study in Wisconsin earlier this year, however, estimated that more than 20,000 people in the state’s two largest counties didn’t vote because of the state’s voter ID law.Alabama offers free voter IDs to people who need them, but discrimination can still persist. To get a free voter ID in Alabama, eligible voters have to present legal documentation like a birth certificate, marriage record or Social Security document. Getting those documents can be difficult, both financially and logistically.“It is very complicated, it’s very time-consuming,” said Kathleen Unger, the president and CEO of VoteRiders, a group that assists people in getting the ID they need to vote. Unger’s group has been active ahead of the Alabama election. “Obviously these are people who don’t have a current driver’s license in their state, so getting around is a big issue. And it’s expensive.” As of Monday morning, a link on the Alabama secretary of state’s website, directing voters to places where they could get a free ID, led to a blank page. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) told HuffPost on Monday that was because his office has completed all of its free voter ID drives for the year, but Alabamians can get a free ID from the local registrar’s office any day of the year. The link on the secretary’s website was updated later that day.“The lack of information, the lack of clear information, frankly, at times in certain states, the lack of correct information or internally consistent information online, it’s a big problem,” Unger said. “Sadly I am not surprised.”Merrill denies there are suppressive laws in place in Alabama, and said his office has set a record number of voter registrations.“I have one goal. And it’s been stated hundreds and hundreds of times when it comes to voter registration,” he said. “I want to ensure that each and every eligible U.S. citizen that’s a resident of Alabama is registered to vote and has a photo ID.”“If you’re eligible, then all you have to do is take the application and you’re going to be eligible to vote,” he went on. “That’s it. If you’re not eligible, and you make the application, then we’ll notify you and tell you why it was denied. There’s no question about it. It’s never been easier in our state to register to vote.”After implementing the voter ID law, Alabama officials closed 31 Department of Motor Vehicles locations in mostly black areas, where people would have been able to get the kinds of ID needed to vote. The Department of Transportation investigated the closures to assess whether they violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by intentionally targeting black Alabamians. DOT eventually reached a settlement with the state to add 2,000 hours of operation to the DMVs in the affected counties.The state has also closed polling places. One analysis found that Alabama has seen a 7 percent decrease in its number of polling places from 2012 to 2016 ― a period during which its population grew by 2 percent.Voting advocates argue the state isn’t doing enough to clear up confusion about what kinds of crime result in losing the right to vote. Until May, Alabama stripped voting rights from anyone who had committed a “felony of moral turpitude,” but it was never specified exactly what crimes were disqualifying. The law had roots in a Jim Crow measure deliberately designed to suppress the black vote, and the ambiguity gave local election officials wide discretion to tell people they were ineligible.Facing a lawsuit over the law, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed legislation in May that laid out about 50 crimes that would disqualify someone from the right to vote. The new law raised confusion among many people who’d previously been told they couldn’t vote, and people who hadn’t heard about the change. Merrill told HuffPost in June that his office didn’t have an obligation to invest in education efforts about changes to the new law, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has estimated could affect thousands.Merrill’s office sent out a press release about the new law in August. John Bennett, a Merrill spokesman, told Mother Jones his office worked with state prisons to put up posters encouraging people to apply to restore their voting rights, with a list of the disqualifying felonies. Merrill also told ThinkProgress that his office told wardens and sheriffs to get absentee ballots to incarcerated people who hadn’t lost the right to vote.Advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, Legal Services Alabama and the Campaign Legal Center have held clinics over the past few months to educate people about the law. Moore took notice and accused the groups of trying to swing the election for Jones. The people the groups are assisting are eligible voters.Blair Bowie, a fellow at the Campaign Legal Center, spent the week ahead of the registration deadline for Tuesday’s election educating people about the new law through clinics and workshops. Bowie said she met people who had received mailers from the state telling them they were ineligible to vote because of a past conviction, even though they were in fact eligible. The Alabama voter registration form requires applicants to swear under penalty of perjury that they are a qualified voter, but it does not include a list of crimes that are disqualifying.“The state has not taken any action to correct the misinformation that it has spread,” Bowie wrote in a blog post at the CLC.Merrill dismissed concerns that his office hasn’t done enough to clarify the new law. He said the idea that people would be scared away from filling out voter applications is a “well-laid excuse by liberal minions from around the world.”“We know that everybody knows that there’s an election, so the people that want to participate are gonna participate,” he said. “I doubt very seriously there’s a single person that’s unaware that there’s an election tomorrow... If that person is not registered in the election tomorrow and they want to be registered to vote, all they need to do is fill out the application electronically.”That application is available online, but it notes that it is already too late to register to vote in Tuesday’s election."
