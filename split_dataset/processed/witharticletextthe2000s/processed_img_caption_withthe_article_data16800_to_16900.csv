Each of his movies features a downtrodden protagonist who finds a glimmer of hope in the offing: Laura Dern’s pregnant druggie in “Citizen Ruth,” Reese Witherspoon’s ruthless go-getter in “Election,” Jack Nicholson’s driftless retiree in “About Schmidt,” Paul Giamatti’s defeated wino in “Sideways,” George Clooney’s troubled workaholic in “The Descendants,” Bruce Dern’s stubborn boozehound in “Nebraska” and, now, Matt Damon’s begrudging bachelor in “Downsizing.” Usually, Payne’s movies stay relatively small in scale, but “Downsizing” is far larger, which is sort of ironic since it’s about people becoming small. Imagine an adult “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” ― more on that below (spoiler: Payne doesn’t relish the reference) ― pitched as a fable about overpopulation and climate change. Scientists have concocted a procedure that shrinks humans to about five inches tall, after which they move to a miniaturized world. Damon, playing a spiritless office drone, elects to become little. He isn’t very happy with what happens afterward. But, of course, there’s a glimmer of hope somewhere in the distance ― maybe. The plot of “Downsizing” zigs and zags, requiring the most visual effects of Payne’s career, as well as the largest budget ($70 million).Before Christmas, I sat down with Payne at Paramount Pictures’ New York office, where we talked about casting lead roles, why “Election” is his most popular film and what he gets out of doctoring scripts like “Meet the Parents” and “Jurassic Park III.” In person, Payne is frosty, articulate and wry. He speaks with a screenwriter’s poise, as if his sentences have been scripted. There’s a sardonic edge to the way he comports himself, but, just like his characters, it doesn’t come without a morsel of optimism.We’ve spoken before, on the phone. I wrote an oral history of “Election” a few years ago.For whom?For HuffPost.Oh, right. That’s you? Whoa! I would have been happy to bring you, as a gift, the new Blu-ray of “Election.” It just came out a couple of days ago.It’s the Criterion Collection, right?Criterion, with a bunch of extras. I’m very proud it’s on Criterion.You said recently that “Election” is still the movie you’re most complimented on, and I started wondering why that is. I don’t know if you’ve read your own Wikipedia page ―Yeah, a while ago. It’s been a while. I don’t go there often.One of the bullet points is about the themes of your work, and a big part of that talks about how many men are at the center of the stories you tell. The term “crises of masculinity” is used. Yet your first two movies were about women. Strong, feisty women.And then you went in a different direction. What prompted that?It’s stuff I can look at only in hindsight, I think. But when conceiving a film, I’m just thinking, “What’s good story?” It was just the luck of the draw that “About Schmidt” came my way by way of an adaptation ― I was able to use a screenplay I’d written 10 years before. And then I got the unpublished book of “Sideways,” which was the biggest gift I’d had since getting the unpublished manuscript of “Election.” And then of course we wanted to do “Downsizing,” but that took forever to get made. Then I made “The Descendants.”I’m not consciously looking for the white male schnook. It’s just, “What’s a good story?” I certainly hate being pigeonholed. “Oh, you’re the chronicler of middle-aged white men.” I guess there’s a certain degree to which ― from Mr. McAllister [in “Election”] to Warren Schmidt to Miles Whatever His Name Is in “Sideways” ― there is this white male in crisis, but it’s kind of the luck of the draw. I mean, my career is a work in progress — just in slight slow motion.You know, after I wrote the oral history of “Election,” you sent me an email. You wanted me to add an exclamation mark at the end of, “You hear stolen spaghetti-Western music earlier than you do in any Tarantino film. I got there first.”[Nods and smiles] Well, he told me himself. I ran into Tarantino. One of the first times I met him, he said, “I’ve always wanted to use [composer Ennio] Morricone, but you beat me to it.”I wonder if you have a theory as to why “Election” is your most popular movie. You’ve had higher-grossing titles than that, and Reese Witherspoon wasn’t as big of a star then as she is now. I also get a lot of positive comments about “Sideways,” more from a bourgeois crowd — the wine crowd. That’s kind of a minor classic in another way. But I think “Election” has a ferocious cynical bite, which keeps it alive. Not only does it date the film, but it keeps it fresh. And also it’s the only film I’ve made which I feel isn’t too long. It has an extremely good, almost musical rhythm to it. It’s like a shark — it never stops moving forward. As far as high school movies go, it has a real verisimilitude to people’s actual high school experiences, in the casting and the lighting and the feel of the drab school. It has a lot of funny, ribald laughs in it. Pretty good music. And the novelty of multiple voice-over. It has an off-kilter, “Rashomon”-like structure to it.I have another theory: I think it also has a music-video quality. It’s made during a period in the late ’90s when the aesthetics of MTV were influencing movies. “Go” also came out in 1999, and Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo & Juliet” was a few years before. “Election” has a bit of that too, with the freeze frames and the surreal visuals.That had nothing to do with how I shot it. The visual style that most influenced “Election” was “Casino.” I loved the whole film, and particularly the first half. I was drunk with the elixir of the roving camera in “Casino.” “Goodfellas,” too, to a certain degree. But the way he distilled that style in the first half of “Casino” was important.Your actors have a very good track record with awards. Each movie since “About Schmidt” has earned at least one Oscar nomination for its acting. Here we are on the day of the SAG Award noms, and Hong Chau got a nomination for “Downsizing.” Do you consider yourself especially adept at directing actors?Well, that’s the most important job of a director in narrative cinema, is it not? To make sure the story is sound and well-told, and that the actors are good. Look, our favorite directors — often the greatest visual stylists — are the ones who are also most adept at getting good performances. Think of Kubrick with Ryan O’Neal. Perfect casting, perhaps the best performance he ever gave. Or those Peter Bogdanovich films, too. But when was John Wayne ever better than with John Ford? Or Toshiro Mifune than with Kurosawa?It’s up to directors to ensure that the performances are good, and I accept the compliment, and I thank you for the compliment of the question. There’s nothing more richly satisfying than discovering the perfect actor for an idiosyncratic part like this one, so you know the old pros — Matt Damon and Christoph Waltz and Kristen Wiig — will deliver the goods. You know that. But to find, as I say, exactly the right actor for that bizarre part of the one-legged Vietnamese monomaniacal dissident is richly satisfying.You’re someone who has consistently worked just left of Hollywood. Your movies do make money ―Not all of them.Not all of them, but you have some hits on your hands, especially for the types of movies you make.“The Descendants,” “Sideways” and “About Schmidt” opened pretty well.There was a big shift during the years between “The Descendants” and “Nebraska” in terms of franchises taking over Hollywood and movie stars’ box-office power declining. Do you think there’s been a big shift in what sort of casting is required for getting a project made?I don’t really know what to say about that. Are you asking me to observe the industry, or to talk about my own experiences?Your own experiences within a changing industry.My experience has not changed. “Downsizing,” just to pluck one example, was very standard trajectory of trying to get a film financed. It’s a sui generis film. The screenplay was called “too intelligent” by a couple of studio chiefs to merit the budget I was asking for, and I knew I needed a big star from a very short list of bankable stars. In his age range, I had only Matt Damon, and thank god he said yes. We also had Reese Witherspoon for a while, but she dropped out and Kristen Wiig took the part. So I did have to build in some insurance policy with stars, which is super old-school.And then similarly with “Nebraska,” I was able to cast exactly who I thought would be right for the part. No one’s going to run out and see a movie today simply because Bruce Dern and Will Forte are in it; they will know them and respect them, but it’s not a huge insurance policy for the studio. But that movie only cost $13 million — a lot by European standards, not by American studio standards. So I was able to get the film made.“The Descendants,” George Clooney, great. And then the rest of the financing just fell into place. And he’s right for the part. Even if I didn’t need a star, I feel Clooney was the right guy for that part. But I’m not sure that George Clooney today is as much of a selling point for a studio as he was in 2010, purely in terms of a movie’s opening-weekend potential. So you’re saying that film may not be made, or you’re saying I’d have to use a different star?Probably more the former. Or it would still get made, but it’s less likely to waltz its way to $83 million at the box office. People’s moviegoing habits have changed dramatically over the past seven years.Taking this discussion to a slightly larger tangent, I lament the disappearance of the adult drama with visual scope. All the quote-unquote adult intelligent films are given shrink-wrapped budgets. I don’t know what “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” cost, or what “Mudbound” cost, but they were as small as possible and they had to be shot in as few days as possible. Where is “The English Patient” today? Where is “Out of Africa” today? Can’t a studio spend $40 to $60 million on something that’s going to have a richly classical-movie feel? That’s what I miss.A-list movies now are all what used to be Roger Corman films. Rather than what you’re talking about — the change of stars in the last eight years or something — for me the bigger thing is how A-list and B-list have switched. “The Fast and the Furious” used to cost $300,000. Now it costs $200 million. And “Out of Africa” used to cost $50 million, and now you have to make it for $20 million. Anything adult, contemporary, literate is considered an indie, fourth-quarter release. They’re all making Roger Corman films now. “It” is considered an A-list film now.Do you think that trend will eventually reverse itself again?No.You don’t think Marvel will burn out eventually?I don’t know. That leads to the larger question, as you know — and I’m starting to say the obvious — that American movies are so expensive to make and then so expensive to distribute.And expensive to get into. For many people, $16 a ticket is a lot to ask.Look, it’s even $10 or $12 in India. Even in India, where they’re great moviegoers, it’s a little pricey to go. So all of that contributes to lowest-common-denominator, getting-butts-in-seats thinking. Where is the artist? Now, I hear the new “Star Wars” is very good and has artistry within it, but they have the insurance policy. They’re freed within the context. I mean, they needed some artistry after making some stinkers in the series.With “Downsizing,” the scale is larger than your previous movies, but it doesn’t announce itself as a huge movie. Your work tends to have a certain quirkiness, and given the premise about shrunken people, I expected more of an adult “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,” if you will.I won’t. But I’ve never even seen “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.”Have you gotten that reference a lot while doing press?Oh yeah, but I’ve never seen it.When you’re devising a parallel world, do you make a list of real-world analogues? Are you thinking, “Well, how does money work? How do neighborhoods work? How is labor divided?”Not consciously, not schematically like that. It just fell into place naturally when Jim Taylor and I were writing the script. It took a lot of time to write because of all the things we had to imagine, and delightfully so. The movie idea offers an endless chain reaction of what-ifs. What if this? Oh, then what if that? How would they [shrink people]? Oh, they’d have to take fillings out of the teeth. And what would money be? We thought about a lot of that, and of course you can’t get it all into the film because then the film becomes too much about that. You’ve got to have a story to tell.But the first part of your question was about the visual effects, and of course you have to fill in the production design as well because you build as much as you can afford to, and then do digital extension beyond that. I told both the productions designer and the visual-effects supervisor that I wanted the look of the film to be so real as to be banal. It needed to have the same texture of reality that all of my previous films have had, which are all shot on found locations and unchanged locations as much as possible. I wanted even this highly designed film ultimately to feel like that. And then with the overall visual texture of the film, I wanted it to feel like a movie made in about 1978.Does this inspire you get even bigger in scale going forward?It doesn’t matter. Every story’s different. Now I have the experience of doing this one, so I know what all the kids are talking about when they do visual effects and build large sets. This movie required it. My team and I did a pretty fair job, but no movie too big, no movie too small. I’d be delighted to make a $3 million movie next, or a $100 million movie. It really doesn’t matter. In general, though, I grow frustrated by the machinery of American filmmaking. I always wanted intimacy between myself, the camera and what’s being shot.Among the directors with whom you keep company, do others feel the same way?I don’t know. I think David Fincher does. I haven’t talked to a lot of directors about it, but I know Fincher’s always thinking about how to have at least less machinery on set. That’s all I know.I’m surprised by how much script doctoring you’ve done along the way. Not in a while.When you were revising “Meet the Parents” and “Jurassic Park III,” was that just because you needed a paycheck?Hell yes. And it’s fun.Those aren’t movies that seem like your wheelhouse.Well, “Meet the Parents” does.Yeah, I guess you’re right about that. I can see that as an Alexander Payne movie.We wrote the last draft of “Meet the Parents” uncredited, and we did such a good job, they felt, that they, meaning Universal, came to us with a “Jurassic Park III” rewrite, which doesn’t seem like a movie within our wheelhouse. But they needed help with the characters, not the dinosaurs. And then we did “I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,” we did a draft of “Baby Mama,” and we did something else that was never made. I may be blanking on something else we might have done. But it’s good to get a paycheck, and it’s also good to feel like a professional, rather than a struggling artist in a garret. The Coen brothers do it all the time. It’s nice to feel like, “Oh, we have these skills, and rather than stretching this out over six months, we have four weeks to do this, so let’s burn the midnight oil.” You feel like a professional.You’re not barking at someone’s door waiting for a yes.No, not just that — but, “Oh, what are we going to do? Does this feel right? is this good enough for us?” It’s like, no, you’ve just got to keep plowing forward. It gave us some skills to where we then wrote “Sideways’ in about 16 weeks, which was shorter than we’d written “Citizen Ruth” or “Election.” It’s good to go to boot camp once in a while.It’s funny how many ties you have to “Big Little Lies.”All my bitches! Four of my bitches be in that show: Reese, Shailene, Laura and now Hong. And I haven’t watched the show yet.Now you just have to put Nicole Kidman in something one of these days.Right. I hear she’s very good in it.It may be the best work she’s done, and that’s saying a lot for Nicole Kidman. That’s great.You do have a small company of players you’ve used in multiple movies: Laura Dern, June Squibb, Reese Witherspoon had she kept the “Downsizing” role.Phil Reeves. He plays the principal in “Election,” and he plays Kristen Wiig’s father in “Downsizing.” I love Phil Reeves. I wish I used this company more. It would be so delightful — like Fellini had Marcello Mastroianni, and Antonioni had Monica Vitti, and John Ford had John Wayne, and so forth — to have an alter ego. I haven’t had that yet.“Downsizing” is currently in theaters."

Creative differences are a common element of any project but usually remain private. All I wanted was to make good movie. I got more than that- @rianjohnson made an all-time GREAT one! #HumbledHamill”Warning: Spoilers below!In “The Last Jedi,” Skywalker is in hiding, and Hamill just couldn’t see the iconic character he originated four decades ago doing that.“I said to Rian, I said, ‘Jedis don’t give up.’ I mean, even if he had a problem, he would maybe take a year to try and regroup, but if he made a mistake he would try and right that wrong; so right there, we had a fundamental difference, but it’s not my story anymore,” the 66-year-old actor said in his interview posted by SensaCine. “It’s somebody else’s story, and Rian needed me to be a certain way to make the ending effective.”He also added: “I almost had to think of Luke as another character. Maybe he’s Jake Skywalker, he’s not my Luke Skywalker.”To be fair, around the same time as his SensaCine interview, Hamill told IMDb that he changed his mind about Skywalker’s character arc after seeing the new movie.“I’ve had trouble accepting what [Johnson] saw for Luke but again, I mean, I have to say, having seen the movie, I was wrong.

FX has ordered a full season of the ’80s-themed dance musical, which explores the “juxtaposition of several segments of life and society in New York: the rise of the luxury Trump-era universe, the downtown social and literary scene and the ball culture world,” according to a news release sent to HuffPost. Much of the early buzz on “Pose,” which is scheduled to begin on FX next summer, has focused on its inclusivity. The show is slated to make TV history by featuring the largest cast of transgender actors in regular roles, as well as the largest recurring LGBTQ cast ever, for a scripted series.Executive producer and co-creator Ryan Murphy (“Glee,” “American Horror Story”) said Wednesday he was “thrilled” to present the show, which he praised as “a game changer” about “the universal quest for identity, family and respect.”“Along with being a dance musical and an affirming look at American life in the 1980s, I’m so proud that ‘Pose’ and FX has made history right from the beginning by featuring the most trans series regular actors ever in an American television production,” he said in a news release. “I can’t wait for people to see this incredibly talented, passionate cast.”In November, Entertainment Weekly got an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at trans cast members Hailie Sahar, Indya Moore, Dominique Jackson, Angelica Ross and M.J. Rodriguez on set. New to the cast is Charlayne Woodard, who replaces previously announced Tatiana Maslany in a “reconceived” role. The show’s inclusive aims don’t end with its stars. Not only have transgender writers Janet Mock and Our Lady J been brought on board to create the “Pose” script with co-creator Steven Canals, but the series will also be mentoring transgender directors through Murphy’s Half Foundation.“Pose” will begin production in February.

All of those tested fled North Korea before the country’s fourth nuclear test in January 2016.Ministry officials who spoke with South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency cautioned that the tests, while indicative of radiation exposure, weren’t necessarily definitive. Other environmental factors like age and smoking could also cause similar damage.“The possibility of radiation exposure can be suspected,” the unnamed official said, “but it has not been verified whether nuclear tests affected the person as there is a lack of information assessing living environments in North Korea.”The accounts nonetheless align with anecdotal tales from Kilju defectors, who described a heavily contaminated region in interviews with The Research Association of Vision of North Korea earlier this year.Residents in the area told the group that after the sixth nuclear test, some 80 percent of the trees planted in the area have died, underground wells have dried up and babies have been born with health defects.That’s consistent with what could be expected from repeated underground nuclear explosions, Suh Kyun-ryul, a professor of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University, told the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.“Due to the collapsed ground layer, fissures must have formed underneath, leading to contamination of the underground layer and water supply.”After North Korea’s sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3, unnamed sources told the Japanese TV broadcaster Asahi a collapsed tunnel at the Punggye-ri site potentially killed as many as 200 people.

Multiple people approved for medical release have already died in the rebel-held enclave, which has been under government siege for four years.One Syrian infant who had been waiting for transfer was reported dead on Wednesday, according to Mohamad Katoub, an advocacy manager for the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS). Six-month-old Katr Alnada “was supposed to be evacuated today in the list of urgent 29 people,” he wrote on Twitter. “When [a] local team reached her, they found that she died weeks ago.”SAMS had coordinated with local medical workers in Syria and international humanitarian organizations, including the United Nations, earlier this year to produce a list of 29 people in Eastern Ghouta who were in desperate need of medical care. The list included at least 18 children. Four patients were transported to Damascus hospitals on Tuesday night, and the rest are set to be moved in the coming days. Jaish al-Islam, a rebel faction in Eastern Ghouta, said it was releasing 29 prisoners as part of the agreement. The government has allowed the critically ill patients to leave in exchange, Reuters reports.The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is operating with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to move patients to Damascus, called the evacuations “a positive step.” SAMS President Dr. Ahmad Tarakji said there need to be more evacuations, although he is “very skeptical” that anyone beyond the 29 approved patients will be allowed to leave. “We feel that this was a very limited step,” he told HuffPost, adding that increased international pressure was likely the main reason behind the deal.“Ghouta has been suffering from prolonged besiegement for years,” he said. “You can tell how emotional this is for the patients.”The people released represent just a small fraction of the current 641 critical cases in need of urgent medical attention in Eastern Ghouta, according to SAMS. Among those on the waiting list is 9-year-old cancer patient Moayad Hamed, whose brain tumor is growing due to a lack of treatment. Nineteen other patients have already perished.Karim Abdel Rahman, another Syrian baby held under siege, lost his left eye during an artillery attack in Eastern Ghouta two months ago. Photos of his injury have stoked international outrage.“Of course I was very sad,” Anas Altaan, a volunteer with the Syria Civil Defence team, told HuffPost on Wednesday. Altaan was part of the rescue mission that rushed Rahman to a hospital.“This child lost his eye because of someone who wants to remain in the presidency,” he said, referring to Syrian President Bashar Assad.Jan Egeland, the United Nations humanitarian adviser for Syria, said last week that hundreds of people were on the priority list for medical evacuations.“That number is going down, not because we are evacuating people but because they are dying,” he said. “We have tried now every single week for many months to get medical evacuations out, and food and other supplies in.”For those left behind in Eastern Ghouta, the ratio is now less than one doctor for every four thousand people. More than 424,000 men, women and children have been under complete siege since 2013, shortly after a sarin gas attack by regime forces claimed an estimated 1,429 lives there.Cut off from food imports and medical aid, the residents have been eating garbage to survive. Hundreds of civilians ― more than half of them children ― have died from food and medication shortages since the start of the siege.As Syria’s government and its allies continue their blockade of Eastern Ghouta and other areas, they have pursued a “surrender or die” strategy, which “amounts to a campaign of widespread collective punishment,” according to a new report from Siege Watch published this month. The ongoing atrocities constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, the report charges.Despite numerous ceasefire agreements and U.N. resolutions demanding unobstructed humanitarian access, armed forces loyal to Assad have continued to target civilian residential areas, including hospitals and schools, with airstrikes. The international community’s inadequate response has only emboldened the Assad regime, Siege Watch asserts.Tarakji said he is “optimistic that we will continue to put pressure on the Syrian regime on all sides.” But, he added, “people are concerned about the longevity of this process [of evacuations]. They are concerned that this will not be continued or repeated in the future.”"

Russia denies allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and President Donald Trump denies any collusion.The Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees recently questioned behind closed doors Irakly Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen born in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the sources said. He is a U.S.-based representative of Azerbaijani oligarch Aras Agalarov’s real estate firm, the Crocus Group.The panels knew Kaveladze was at the June 9, 2016 meeting but became more interested in him after learning he also attended a private dinner in Las Vegas in 2013 with Trump and Agalarov as they celebrated an agreement to hold that year’s Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, the sources said.Committee members now want to know more about the extent of Kaveladze’s contacts with the Trump family and whether he had a bigger role than previously believed in setting up the Trump Tower meeting when Trump was a Republican candidate for president.The White House declined to comment. Mueller’s office also declined to comment.Scott Balber, a New York lawyer who represents Kaveladze, confirmed that his client attended both the dinner in Las Vegas and the Trump Tower meeting but said he did not set up the second meeting. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, other Trump campaign aides, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya were also at that meeting.Lawyer Balber also said the committees were only seeking Kaveladze’s input as a witness and were not targeting him for investigation.“No-one has ever told me that they have any interest in him other than as a witness,” Balber said.Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not respond to requests for comment about their contacts with Kaveladze. A lawyer for President Trump declined to comment.One photograph from the 2013 dinner, when Trump still owned the Miss Universe pageant, shows Agalarov and his pop singer son Emin along with Trump, two Trump aides and several other people at the dining table.

He said he ultimately never received the information, although it was later posted on the Internet.In a statement issued after meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 7, Trump, Jr. said Goldstone and Veselnitskaya were in a conference room with him as well as Kaveladze and a translator.Balber said Kaveladze attended expecting to serve as a translator, although he did not do so in the end because Veselnitskaya brought her own.

The 40-year-old Colombian superstar made the announcement about her El Dorado World Tour via a letter posted on her social media accounts Wednesday morning.“Though I very much hoped my vocal cords would recover in time to pick the tour back up in January, and after exploring many options to that effect, I have accepted that this is an injury that simply needs more time and care to heal,” Shakira wrote in the message. “I feel for all of you who planned ahead to come to these shows and who have been so patient as I took the time needed to figure out the best course of action with my doctors,” she added, saying tour dates for Europe, the U.S. and Latin America would be announced soon.The tour ― Shakira’s first in more than six years ― was scheduled to begin on Nov. 8 in Cologne, Germany. A day before the first show, the singer posted a message on social media saying she was on doctor-ordered vocal rest after straining her vocal cords during rehearsals.In the days that followed, Shakira posted new messages canceling several more shows. By mid-November, the star was forced to postpone all of the European tour dates. She also provided more details on her condition. “These past few days, just before my first concerts, have been some of the hardest in my career,” she wrote on Nov. 14. “At the end of July I went for a routine checkup, before starting to design this tour and my doctor confirmed that my vocal cords were in perfect condition.”“Towards the end of October though, in the home stretch of my rehearsals, I felt a strange hoarseness that impeded my singing,” she said. “The doctors, upon examination, detected that I had suffered a hemorrhage on my right vocal cord.” "

The two had not met before, she said.“It was completely demeaning and shocking,” she told the outlet, adding, “It felt like it was all a big joke to him.” The party, held to celebrate the president’s first year in office, took place at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, just a few blocks from the White House. Villa said she had posed for a photo with an unenthusiastic Lewandowski when he smacked her once.She said she warned him against the behavior. “I said, ’Watch it,‴ she told Politico. “Half-joking, I said, ‘I can report you for sexual harassment.’”She said he replied: “Go ahead, I work in the private sector,” before hitting her again. Villa, 31, is considering a run for Congress in Florida, a potential bid that has already attracted a tweet of support from Trump.The singer told the AP she was initially reluctant to go public with her accusation against Lewandowski, 44, for fear of backlash. But she plans to meet with Washington Metropolitan Police Department detectives next week about her complaint, she said.“I did nothing wrong,” Villa told the AP. “I realized if he’s not going to respond or apologize to me, I think it’s the right thing to do.” This isn’t the first police complaint against Lewandowski, reportedly known to some former colleagues for verbal abuse and for having a “misogynistic streak.” While serving as Trump’s campaign manager in March 2016, he was charged with misdemeanor battery following an incident in which he allegedly grabbed former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields. The charge was later dropped. Although Trump fired him in June 2016, Lewandowski remains close to him. A book about the campaign, Let Trump Be Trump, co-written by Lewandoswki and top aide David Bossie, was released earlier this month and gained attention for its tidbits on Trump’s eccentricities during his run for the Oval Office."

But in one teaser for the reboot that jarring detail is not only ignored, it’s a punch line.The clever clip features Becky and (zombie?) Dan watching basketball as Dan complains about the current Chicago Bull’s lineup and how the team was better in the 1990s.To this, Roseanne says:“You can’t live in the past, Dan. When things are gone, they’re gone forever.”This is not the first time the show has made fun of itself. Goranson, who originally played Becky, left the show in its fifth season to attend college. She was replaced by actress Sarah Chalke, but then returned for the show’s eighth season. Goranson eventually left the show again, and Chalke reprised the role. But the switching of the actresses became a long-running inside joke on the series — which you can see in these clips:Check out the other new teasers below!"

When the evacuation was lifted, travelers had to go through security checkpoints a second time, according to Jacob Long, a Boston-based news anchor who was at the airport.Long said there were “hundreds” of travelers walking on the tarmac beneath jet bridges as they were evacuated. In a series of tweets, Long said that many people and airport officials were confused about what was going on.“We’re all outside in the freezing cold walking under the jet bridges,” Long tweeted. “No idea where we are going or why. Hundreds of passengers.”Long was amused when he learned why the airport was evacuated."

On Dec. 20, they were charged with felonious assault in juvenile court.“This is a case where the state has very strong evidence ― there were statements made by all of the juveniles involved in this case,” Lucas County Deputy Prosecutor Lori Olender told the Toledo Blade.Byrd died on Friday, prompting the prosecutor’s office to amend the criminal complaint. The teens now face charges of murder, felony vehicular vandalism and misdemeanor vehicular vandalism.HuffPost is not identifying the defendants because they have been charged in juvenile court. They are being held without bail at a Toledo juvenile detention center.According to The Plain Dealer, other drivers said their vehicles were struck by objects thrown from the overpass on Dec. 19, but no other injuries were reported.Byrd, the father of a 1-year-old boy, was reportedly engaged to be married.“My auntie has to bury her son,” Shaveontae King, Byrd’s cousin, told the Blade. “He’s gone [and] he’s never coming back.”King said she’d like to see the teens charged as adults ― something the district attorney’s office has reportedly indicated it does not plan to do.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said other drivers reported their vehicles were struck by thrown objects on Dec. 20.

16,WOMEN,Topless Femen Activists Stage #MeToo Protest Against The Patriarchy At The Vatican,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/topless-femen-activists-metoo-protest-vatican_us_5a42ac42e4b06d1621b5bc25,One woman tried to steal the baby Jesus from the Vatican's Nativity scene.,2017-12-27,Vatican gendarmes attempt to block a topless activist in St. Peter's Square on Monday before the pope's Christmas address.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a42babc2100002c005f5dee.jpeg?cache=dfxQsXKBJI&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Three Femen activists disrupted Christmas worship services at the Vatican to protest what they believe is the oppression of women perpetuated by the Roman Catholic Church.Inna Shevchenko, a Ukrainian activist who leads Femen, an anti-patriarchy organization known for staging topless protests to attract media attention, told HuffPost that this action was a way to stand in solidarity with the viral #MeToo social media movement against the sexual assault and harassment of women. “As feminists, FEMEN considers organized religions with their institutions and leadership to be one of the historical oppressors of women,” she wrote in an email. “The action [at the] Vatican is, if you want, an act of revenge: a historical victim (a woman) rises up against her historical oppressor.”Vatican police detained one topless activist Monday as she tried to steal a statue of the baby Jesus from the Nativity scene in St. Peter’s Square, Reuters reported. The activist was identified on Femen’s website as the Ukrainian “sextremist” Alisa Vinogradova. The activist had the words “God is woman” painted on her body in English. The incident occurred two hours before Pope Francis delivered his Christmas message.Two other Femen activists broke into the Vatican’s Nativity scene on Christmas Eve, according to HuffPost France. They had the phrases ”#MeToo” and “Assaulted by church” written on their bodies. Shevchenko compared the Femen activists to a “modern and free Virgin Mary.” Although Mary is the major female figure in Catholicism, Shevchenko believes she is portrayed as silent and passive. It’s that same sort of passiveness, she said, that is expected of women who experience sexual assault.“Despite her significant role, Mary represents chastity, maternity and passiveness-all that is expected from women in patriarchal society. Moreover she is the woman with nor voice, neither sexuality,” Shevchenko told HuffPost. “The passiveness and silence of Mary is still often expected from women across the world as they get assaulted and attacked. As the #metoo campaign has shown, many women kept silence about their horrible experiences for years often under pressure, out of fear and insecurity. Nevertheless they have spoken, they broke the silence and shook the established system of dominance.”“Similarly, our Mary, who is expected to be passive and quiet, now breaks the silence and points out ... the assaults of women by the Church.”Among the grievances Femen has against the Catholic church are its “hostile” position against the LGBTQ community, its treatment of priests accused of pedophilia and its historic opposition to abortion.Shevchenko also noted that Femen wants to criticize the patriarchal nature of organized religions.“We decry the notion of the Father God as well as male leadership in religious institutions (as women are still officially banned from preaching),” she wrote. “We oppose religious scripture which often [portrays] women as inferior and weak creatures, their bodies as dirty and shameful, their souls as guilty.”In contrast, the “Marys” who participated in the activism at the Vatican this year are in full control of their bodies and are, in fact, using them as political tools, she said. Femen, founded in Ukraine in 2008, is an atheist organization that believes in the separation of church and state.

The activist was identified on Femen’s website as the Ukrainian “sextremist” Alisa Vinogradova. The activist had the words “God is woman” painted on her body in English. The incident occurred two hours before Pope Francis delivered his Christmas message.Two other Femen activists broke into the Vatican’s Nativity scene on Christmas Eve, according to HuffPost France. They had the phrases ”#MeToo” and “Assaulted by church” written on their bodies. Shevchenko compared the Femen activists to a “modern and free Virgin Mary.” Although Mary is the major female figure in Catholicism, Shevchenko believes she is portrayed as silent and passive. It’s that same sort of passiveness, she said, that is expected of women who experience sexual assault.“Despite her significant role, Mary represents chastity, maternity and passiveness-all that is expected from women in patriarchal society. Moreover she is the woman with nor voice, neither sexuality,” Shevchenko told HuffPost. “The passiveness and silence of Mary is still often expected from women across the world as they get assaulted and attacked. As the #metoo campaign has shown, many women kept silence about their horrible experiences for years often under pressure, out of fear and insecurity. Nevertheless they have spoken, they broke the silence and shook the established system of dominance.”“Similarly, our Mary, who is expected to be passive and quiet, now breaks the silence and points out ... the assaults of women by the Church.”Among the grievances Femen has against the Catholic church are its “hostile” position against the LGBTQ community, its treatment of priests accused of pedophilia and its historic opposition to abortion.Shevchenko also noted that Femen wants to criticize the patriarchal nature of organized religions.“We decry the notion of the Father God as well as male leadership in religious institutions (as women are still officially banned from preaching),” she wrote. “We oppose religious scripture which often [portrays] women as inferior and weak creatures, their bodies as dirty and shameful, their souls as guilty.”In contrast, the “Marys” who participated in the activism at the Vatican this year are in full control of their bodies and are, in fact, using them as political tools, she said. Femen, founded in Ukraine in 2008, is an atheist organization that believes in the separation of church and state. One of its stated goals is to work against religious institutions’ influence in the “civic, sex and reproductive lives of modern women.”Femen’s tactics and firmly anti-religious stance have earned criticism from some fellow feminists, including Muslim women who accuse the group of promoting Islamophobic rhetoric. The Vatican has often been a target of Femen’s activism, including a similar protest at the Vatican’s Nativity scene on Christmas in 2014, Reuters reported.  "

21,POLITICS,Orrin Hatch Trolls Utah Newspaper That Wants Him To Retire,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orrin-hatch-trolls-utah-newspaper_us_5a427bd0e4b06d1621b59d0e,The Salt Lake Tribune denounced Hatch’s “utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power.”,2017-12-26,Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has served in the Senate since 1977. The Salt Lake Tribune editorial board thinks Hatch has stayed in the chamber too long.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a427ecf1d00003a004d35d9.jpeg?cache=27CqXUtFTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) on Monday tweeted out an editorial in The Salt Lake Tribune naming him “Utahn of the Year,” declaring that he was “grateful for this great Christmas honor.”The tweet prompted some head-scratching for an obvious reason. Although the editorial afforded Hatch the “Utahn of the Year” distinction due to his far-reaching influence on the national stage, it expressed its deep disapproval of the way Hatch has used that influence and called on him to retire.“It would be good for Utah if Hatch, having finally caught the Great White Whale of tax reform, were to call it a career,” the Tribune stated. “If he doesn’t, the voters should end it for him.”But Matt Whitlock, Hatch’s communications director, made clear in a Tuesday tweet that Hatch’s seemingly approving tweet was “tongue-in-cheek.”“This is at least the 4th editorial the Tribune has written in the last two years urging Hatch to retire. Might as well have a chuckle about it,” Whitlock said.In a subsequent tweet, Whitlock issued a formal response to the Tribune editorial, urging the newspaper’s editorial board to “find joy this holiday season in something beyond baselessly attacking the service and integrity of someone who [has] given 40 years to the people of Utah.” But if a Democrat or Republican primary opponent were looking for ammunition against Hatch, the Tribune editorial would not be a bad place to look. The Tribune attacked Hatch for supporting President Donald Trump’s drastic reduction in the size of federally protected land in Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments, which the Tribune argued had “no constitutional, legal or environmental logic.”“To all appearances — appearances promoted by Hatch — this anti-environmental, anti-Native American and, yes, anti-business decommissioning of national monuments was basically a political favor the White House did for Hatch,” the Tribune wrote. “A favor done in return for Hatch’s support of the president generally and of his tax reform plan in particular.”In addition, the Tribune attributed Hatch’s failure to depart Congress in a timely fashion to his “utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power.”Hatch, a critic of politicians who overstayed their welcome from the time he unseated a three-term senator in 1976, is now the longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, the Tribune noted. His plans to run for re-election in 2018 also violate a 2012 promise not to do so, the editorial recalled.“Clearly, it was a lie,” the newspaper stated.However, as the Tribune noted, Hatch has, for better or worse, indeed had a momentous year. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Hatch presided over a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Even that milestone has not been without its hiccups. The famously mild-mannered senator lost his temper during a November hearing on the tax bill when Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) derided the legislation as a lopsided handout for the wealthiest Americans.“Listen, I come from the lower-middle class,” Hatch said. “We didn’t have anything. Don’t spew that stuff on me. I get real tired of that crap.”"

It was the first time the royals have included someone not yet part of the family in their holiday traditions, according to the BBC.The couple walked with other family members to the service before returning to Sandringham House for the traditional turkey lunch. They then watched the queen deliver her televised Christmas message.The queen said in her address that she was looking forward to “welcome new members” into the family next year — likely referring to Markle’s marriage to Harry in May and a new baby Prince William and Kate Middleton are expecting in April. An engagement photo of Markle and Harry was spotted with other family pictures near the queen as she spoke. The queen honored the victims of the 2017 terror attacks in Britain, and others affected by them, in her speech.Earlier, Markle, 36, joined the queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, William, Kate, and other members of the royal family at St. Mary Magdalene Chapel. Hundreds of people gathered outside, some lining up well before dawn, to catch a glimpse of the royals. They applauded Markle and Harry, who announced their engagement last month. Markle executed her first public curtsy — along with her future sister-in-law — as the 91-year-old queen left the service.Markle appeared at ease with the royals, chatting to William and Charles, and walked arm-in-arm with Harry, 33. After the service ended the couple greeted members of the crowd.Markle wore a camel-colored wrap coat by Sentaler of Canada, Stuart Weitzman over-the-knee boots and carried a suede Chloe bag. The biggest hit was Markle’s chestnut brown hat. One Twitter user noted that Markle is bound to fit in with the royals because she clearly has an eye for the “futuristic church lady hat the Brits are so into.”The queen wore bright orange."

But the Queer Resistance rose up.",2017-12-26,Hundreds of thousands participated in the Women's March on Washington.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4257ff2100002c005f5d5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Year in Review piece is always interesting, but in 2017 it serves a much more important purpose: To document atrocities, and to remind us never to forget.The first full year of Donald Trump’s presidency was marked by virulent, relentless attacks on LGBTQ equality. With the attacks came the same horror and grief that had taken hold in 2016 after the election. But 2017 stands out for something else: Queer Resistance. There is no question that there have been darker times in U.S. history for queer people. But in 2017, LGBTQ people saw hard-fought rights that were won over a period of many years ― like marriage equality ― seriously assaulted. Transgender people literally saw an attempt to make them invisible through the Trump administration banning the use of the word “transgender” at the Centers for Disease Control.And yet, because of the movement for equality and full civil rights that activists built over decades, LGBTQ people stood up to the attacks and joined with other groups, becoming an integral and important part of the Resistance that took hold and is successfully fighting back.In the past, queer people were in the background, or in the shadows, when fighting within the larger struggles for civil rights. Today we’re out and proud, helping lead the way. With that, here are some of the key moments, actions and realities that defined 2017.The Women’s March on Washington invigorated many and inspired LGBTQ people and others to fight the onslaught of brutality in the Trump era.Kicking off the year in January, this massive event gave many Americans, perhaps for the first time since the election, a sense of hope and empowerment, as millions marched in Washington and at hundreds of sister gatherings in the U.S. and around the world.From the outset, march organizers described the demonstrations as a protest fighting for the rights of women, but also for the rights of many other groups that joined forces, including people of color, immigrants and LGBTQ people. Prominent among the leaders and speakers were lesbians and trans women, such as J. Bob Alotta, executive director of Astraea Lesbian Foundation for Justice, and trans author and activist Janet Mock. LGBTQ groups had a vital presence.And among the millions marching were many queer people who found their voice with so many others. They began 2017 with an exhilarating moment that would inspire them to keep up the fight throughout the year. The Trump cabinet, more white and male than any since Ronald Reagan’s, not surprisingly turned out to be a who’s who of homophobia. From Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson to (now former) Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and CIA director Mike Pompeo, Trump’s inner circle was and still is filled with vocal, ardent and extreme anti-LGBTQ advocates.Never before have we seen people with such open displays of hostility to LGBTQ rights ― such as Carson, who compared same-sex marriage to bestiality, and DeVos, who publicly supports federal dollars going to private Christian schools that demonize homosexuality ― among the top advisors to a president. The hatred coming from Trump and his administration would filter down to all the departments, playing out in big ways, from making LGBT people invisible in the U.S. Census to ending collection of data on LGBTQ senior citizens. Mere acknowledgement of LGBTQ people ended as well. Trump, for example, issued no Pride proclamation in June, LGBTQ Pride Month.Vice President Mike Pence, the long-time foe of LGBTQ rights who led Trump’s transition team, populated the administration with religious zealots hellbent on having Trump sign a broad “religious freedom” order that would discriminate against LGBTQ Americans and pander to the Republican evangelical base.Though the administration seemed to retreat after public outcry over a leaked draft of the order in February, Pence and his allies have been successful throughout the year in quietly getting it put in place piecemeal, below the media’s radar. Neil Gorsuch, a “religious liberty” extremist, was put on the Supreme Court by Trump.Gorusch immediately began making his mark by challenging LGBTQ equality. Gorsuch, whom legal scholars described prior to his Senate confirmation as being to the right of even the late Justice Antonin Scalia, dodged questions during his confirmation hearings in March. But his agenda seemed clear to anyone who was watching when he tried to have it both ways on marriage equality.The campaign by GOP operatives to help install Trump’s pick on the court spotlighted some of Gorsuch’s gay friends who spoke to the media about how accepting he’s been of them ― an attempt to make him appear LGBTQ-friendly, despite enough evidence to the contrary. Gorsuch was confirmed in April, with Republicans using the “nuclear option,” taking away the 60-vote threshold with which Democrats could have blocked him. The Senate’s 54-45 vote confirming him was the smallest approval margin for a Supreme Court nominee in years.By June, Gorsuch revealed a dangerous disregard for the Obergefell marriage equality decision as he wrote the dissent in a 6-3 ruling that overturned an Arkansas law that prevented both parents in a same-sex marriage from being named on birth certificates ― as is the case for heterosexual wedded couples in the state (no matter the biological father). Gorsuch took pride in writing the dissent, joined by far-right Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, clearly supporting flat out discrimination and ignoring precedent. And he showed he is the anti-LGBTQ nightmare his gay friends hoped he wasn’t.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise’s life was saved by a black queer woman.That shouldn’t even be considered a political moment, but the realities of Capitol Police Special Agent Crystal Griner’s sexual orientation and race were something religious conservatives and anti-LGBTQ bigots were loath to observe.Scott Schoettes, a gay man who is counsel and HIV project director at the pioneering LGBTQ legal group Lambda Legal, resigned in June from the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA), along with five other council members, in protest of Trump’s polices ― or lack of polices ― to combat the HIV epidemic.In February the Justice Department rescinded a directive to schools nationwide put in place the by Obama administration that allowed trans students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity.In his opening statements during his Senate confirmation hearings in January, Sessions said, ”I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by our LGBT community.” He vowed to “ensure ... protecting their rights and their safety,” which he said would be “fully enforced.”Even more empowering than Moore’s defeat, Democrat Doug Jones ― who has a gay son and supports marriage equality ― won the the December special election. LGBTQ Alabamians played a critical role in a nail-biter of an election.In December the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission."

Jeff Hoover, left, is sworn in as House speaker. Hoover resigned his post as speaker this month after he was accused of sexual harassment.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a427c0921000018005f5d89.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jen FifieldThe movement that has empowered women across the country to levy sexual assault and harassment allegations against powerful men continues to snowball, causing an uprising in many industries, including state politics.In the past few months, since Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual assault, at least 18 male state lawmakers facing allegations in a dozen states have resigned, announced they will resign, been ousted from a leadership position, or otherwise punished, a Stateline review has found. The accusations, coming amid the larger #metoo movement, have sent legislative leaders in multiple states scrambling to strengthen their policies and procedures to prevent harassment. More than half of the states have created new policies, instituted more regular anti-harassment training, made changes to how allegations are reported and investigated, or are reviewing their procedures.But while their proposals are receiving praise, there’s a growing worry that they won’t lead to lasting change. Many women working in state capitols have seized this moment to reveal not only that they’ve been assaulted or harassed, but that they generally haven’t felt comfortable at work for years. Many worry that the movement will fizzle out, chasing vulnerable women — including young staffers, new lawmakers and lobbyists — back into the shadows.That’s something that Sarah Walker, a lobbyist in Minnesota, had on her mind from the moment she told her story to local reporters. Walker says Republican state Rep. Tony Cornish propositioned her for sex dozens of times and once forced her up against a wall to try to kiss her. Cornish at first denied the allegations but then announced he would resign, along with another state senator facing similar allegations.Walker was going to stay anonymous, but she said she wanted to come forward to create a safer environment for women in statehouses to do the same — and to help do that, she had to give her name.“I did want to give a message that you can come forward and you can still be a successful lobbyist and a strong woman,” Walker said.Cornish is one of at least eight male lawmakers — in Alaska, California, Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Ohio — who have resigned or announced they will resign from the legislature since early October. At least nine other male state lawmakers — in Arizona, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Washington — have resigned or been removed from a committee role or other leadership position. One other lawmaker, New York Assemblyman Steven McLaughlin, a Republican, received other punishment, including being told he could not hire interns and had to complete anti-harassment training.And in Kentucky, state Rep. Dan Johnson, a Republican, took his own life just days after he was accused of molesting a 17-year-old girl in 2012. Johnson denied the allegations.The far-reaching conversation about improper behavior in the workplace might change the environment in statehouses across the country come January — at least temporarily.“It may give sitting legislatures some pause, in terms of their own behavior,” said Jean Sinzdak, associate director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.Whether the movement permanently changes the culture in statehouses, though, is not clear, Sinzdak said.In response to allegations, many legislatures have beefed up anti-harassment training, which has been lackluster in many statehouses. Legislative leaders in at least 14 states have held anti-harassment training, announced that training will take place at the start of the next session, or said they will institute more regular training.More important than training, though, Sinzdak said, will be ensuring that women have a clear and safe way to report allegations, and creating a fair and thorough investigative process. At least 19 legislatures are updating or reviewing their code of conduct, policies or procedures.In many states, allegations are reported to legislative leaders. That leaves victims vulnerable both to political decisions about how to investigate, and to political retribution, according to many lawmakers who have started to reconsider their policies. Some states, such as Illinois and Vermont, are looking for ways to give the investigating authority to someone outside the legislature.In Colorado, top lawmakers in each chamber voted this month to hire a human resources officer to take complaints. In Maryland, lawmakers instituted a new process to track harassment claims. And in Iowa, Senate Majority Leader Bill Dix, a Republican, said he would hire a consultant to review whether to hire a new human resources manager.If politicians stay involved in the process, women will be afraid to come forward, Walker said. She thinks policies should protect lobbyists as well as lawmakers. She felt she had to go to the media to be heard, she said, and that was rough. “It was the most stressful two weeks I’ve ever experienced.”More changes may come when legislative sessions begin. Some legislators already have filed bills, including one in Arizona that would ban the use of confidentiality agreements in sexual harassment cases in which an elected official is accused, one in Pennsylvania that would amend the ethical conduct rules of the state House of Representatives, and two in Illinois that would change the legislative ethics commission and establish a hotline.In California, Assemblywoman Laura Friedman, a Democrat who is leading a new subcommittee that will make recommended changes to the chamber’s sexual harassment policies, said she thinks the Legislature needs a process in which punishment is decided by an independent party, such as an ethics officer or ombudsman. Right now, members of the rules committee and other legislative leaders determine what actions to take, Friedman said. Those decisions shouldn’t be left to lawmakers, she said.“We are all so connected to each other, and rely on one another for votes and political support and everything,” Friedman said.The California Legislature has contracted with an outside company to provide a hotline that victims can call to get counseling services and information about how to report allegations. Friedman wants the subcommittee to make the investigation process more transparent so the public has a better idea of what goes on at the Capitol.Friedman said she isn’t sure this is the path the subcommittee will take. But she hopes the changes will create a robust system that will stand the test of time, even as politicians transition in and out of their roles and leadership changes.“We know this (movement) has been a stain on the Legislature and politicians in general,” she said, “and we want people to know that people who do wrong don’t represent all of us.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

He has accused the U.S. government of pressuring the social media giants to disable his accounts. Washington imposed travel and financial sanctions against Kadyrov last week over alleged human rights violations by his government, including repression, torture and murder. He responded with a mocking Instagram post, in which he said he “can be proud that I’m out of favor with the special services of the USA.” Russia called the Magnitsky Act sanctions, which have also been aimed at a number of its own officials, “illegal” and “unfriendly.”Kadyrov, a former rebel leader who is now loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has a history of human rights abuses. Under his leadership, Chechnya has reportedly detained and killed scores of gay men ― although he denies this.The authoritarian leader often posted bizarre photos and videos on Instagram for his millions of followers. One purportedly showed him attacking a crocodile. Another was a plea to help him find his missing cat.Kadyrov made international headlines in early 2016 when he uploaded a video that appeared to show Mikhail Kasyanov, a Russian opposition leader, Putin critic and former Russian prime minister, being targeted by a sniper. The video, which Kasyanov described as “incitement to murder,” was eventually taken down by Instagram, angering the Chechen leader.Kadyrov’s Twitter account remains active as of Tuesday. He tweeted to complain about his blocked Facebook and Instagram accounts on Saturday.Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment."
27,GREEN,Trump's Offshore Oil Rush A Disaster For Oceans And Climate,"Richard Steiner, ContributorProfessor, conservation biologist (www.oasis-earth.com)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-offshore-oil-rush-a-disaster-for-oceans-and_us_5a41752fe4b0df0de8b066a1,Nowhere is President Trump’s historic assault on our natural environment more worrisome than his reckless push for increased,2017-12-26,"<p>Deepwater Horizon surface oil burning, June 2010</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4184ad1d00003b004d3508.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nowhere is President Trump’s historic assault on our natural environment more worrisome than his reckless push for increased offshore oil and gas drilling.At a time when science says that to stabilize global climate two-thirds of all fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground, Trump is instead pushing a huge increase in fossil fuel production, onshore and offshore. Expanded drilling, weakened agency oversight, relaxed safety regulations, and oil companies now with more available cash from tax cuts is a “perfect storm” for increased risk of climate disasters and oil spills.If this dangerous offshore plan moves ahead, we can expect decades of more catastrophic oil spills, hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires.In addition to the oil and gas already in production offshore, the U.S. offshore seabed may hold another 90 billion barrels of oil and 400 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, or more. Burning this amount of fossil fuel would add over 50 billion tons of CO2 to the global atmosphere, a “carbon bomb” comparable to the Alberta tar sands. And much of this CO2 would be reabsorbed into seawater, increasing ocean acidification.The administration’s offshore drilling plan would commit us to another several decades of carbon-intensive energy production, delay our transition to sustainable low-carbon energy, and guarantee future climate chaos. But Trump and friends see billions of dollars lying in the seabed, and ignore the inconvenient climate truth. This could be “game over” for efforts to control climate change.To appreciate the threat from Trump’s proposed offshore oil rush, just connect the dots between his policy decisions to-date.Launching his dystopian vision of “deconstructing the administrative state,” Trump issued as one of his first Executive Orders: “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,” ordering agencies to review (read: weaken or eliminate) hundreds of federal rules and regulations, and requiring that for every new regulation adopted two must be eliminated. Then, his March Executive Order: “Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth” ordered agencies to review (weaken or eliminate) existing energy regulations and policies “that potentially burden the production or use of domestically produced energy resources, with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy resources.”In response, the Interior department is currently reviewing offshore drilling safety regulations put in place by the Obama administration after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, including blowout preventer and well control requirements (well design, control, casing, cementing, monitoring, and subsea containment), safety and environmental management systems, and emergency blowout response plans. The administration is expected to give industry exactly what it wants – a relaxation of many of these drilling safeguards. The next Deepwater Horizon disaster now seems inevitable.Then, the April Executive Order: “Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy,” proposes an historic expansion of offshore drilling, including in the Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Alaska, and potentially even in National Marine Sanctuaries. Trump canceled previous Obama offshore lease withdrawals (protections) in the Arctic and Atlantic, making these areas available for drilling, and eased permit requirements for seismic exploration.The Interior department is now developing a new five-year offshore leasing plan (for 2019-2024) to be released soon, one that goes well beyond the current Obama five-year plan with its 11 new offshore lease sales, which in itself was bad enough. Even under the existing plan, the Trump administration has announced it will offer for lease in March “all available unleased areas on the Gulf’s Outer Continental Shelf,” some 77 million acres across the entire Gulf, including waters off the Florida coast that had previously been protected. This alone will constitute the largest offshore lease sale in U.S. history. With the new expanded five-year plan, Trump says he wants not just energy independence, but “American energy dominance,” and to “export American energy all over the world.”As another gift to industry, the administration has proposed cutting $54 billion in federal spending, largely from environment agencies including EPA, NOAA, NASA and Interior. While congress has yet to pass a new budget, now with a huge tax cut to pay for, it has a convenient excuse to approve many of these proposed cuts.And the administration is quietly allowing the 9-cent-per-barrel federal tax that funds the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to lapse on Dec. 31 (a $500 million a year gift to oil companies), suspended a study by the National Academy of Sciences on improving offshore drilling inspections, and ignored calls to establish Regional Citizens Advisory Councils for the Arctic and Gulf of Mexico that would provide citizen oversight of offshore drilling.Taken together ― expanded offshore leasing, weakened regulations, reduced agency oversight, marginalized citizens, ignored science, and huge tax cuts for oil companies ― present unprecedented and unacceptable risk to our oceans and climate.If we genuinely care about the ocean, we should not expose it to the risks from offshore drilling ― period. Spills will occur, they cannot be cleaned up, they can cause long-term environmental damage, and ecological restoration is impossible. Further, global climate cannot afford the additional carbon that would be produced offshore, and much of this carbon would wind up right back in the seas as absorbed CO2, increasing ocean acidification. Offshore drilling is a lose-lose proposition.Instead, we need to accelerate efforts to kick our carbon habit, and get on with the hard, yet inevitable work of building a sustainable, low-carbon energy economy.Sheik Zaki Yamani, former Saudi Arabian oil minister, once said: “The stone age did not end for lack of stones, and the oil age will end long before the world runs out of oil.” Our ancestors invented a smarter way to live. Now it’s our turn."
28,POLITICS,The Epic Fail Of Congress,"Center for Community Change Action, ContributorSocial justice organization",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-epic-fail-of-congress_us_5a424ac8e4b0df0de8b066ed,"By Kica Matos For the last decade or so, Carlos and his parents have spent Thanksgiving dinner with my family. Questions",2017-12-26,<p><strong>Dreamers hold up signs showing how many days they have left in the U.S. before their DACA expires.</strong></p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a424ae01c0000140068d43b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kica MatosFor the last decade or so, Carlos and his parents have spent Thanksgiving dinner with my family. Questions about his future and his dreams have always featured in our conversations. When I first met Carlos, he was a teenager – an undocumented youth working hard to make it through high school with a dream of attending college.Carlos’ life changed drastically in 2012 with the enactment of DACA – a program offering immigrant youth protection from deportation and permission to work. Of those who qualified, 800,000 applied for and were granted DACA. Since Carlos qualified for DACA, he was able to get a job, save for college and move to New York to pursue his studies. He also began to travel and was able to go to his home country, where he visited his father for the first time in over a decade. Last May, Carlos graduated with a degree in Computer Engineering. At the time, his future seemed limitless. But all of that changed abruptly last September, when Trump announced the cancellation of DACA. When Carlos visited our house for Thanksgiving this year, there were no conversations about his plans, or what the future holds for him. The sadness in the room was palpable.Yet rather than accept his fate, Carlos joined the thousands of other immigrant youth fighting to legalize their status through passage of Dream Act legislation. This was, after all, what Trump suggested as the correct solution for the DACAmented. Based on the administration’s support for a legislative solution and the assurances from a bipartisan group of lawmakers that they would move forward expeditiously, efforts began in earnest to push for passage of a law before the end of the year.In the ensuing months, immigrant youth, family members, advocates and supporters worked tirelessly to push Congress to pass legislation by December. No legislator was left untouched, as hundreds of thousands of phone calls flooded Congressional offices and countless in- person visits were held. Rallies, vigils, events calling attention to the need for Congress to act numbered in the thousands. And this week, as the deadline drew near, thousands of desperate young people descended to DC – some putting their bodies on the line, participating in civil disobedience in order to pressure legislators to do right by them.Yet none of this seemed to matter to either party. As the weeks passed, Republican leaders increased their outrageous demands  – mostly centered on agreeing to DACA in exchange for the ramping up the enforcement machinery by the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico, the hiring of thousands of additional immigration enforcement agents, the further militarization of the border and the of punishing sanctuary cities.Democratic leaders led with cowardice, dishonesty and broken promises. Every week, the goal posts seem to change, with the excuses flowing hard and fast as more and more obstacles were put in the way of legislation advancing. Despite repeated assurances that Dream Act would attach to “must pass” legislation before the end of the year, none of this came to pass. The callousness and indifference with which this issue was dealt with by both sides called into question the very humanity of many legislators in Congress.And so the hearts, the lives and the futures of nearly a million young immigrants were shattered into pieces just a few days before the holiday season when a feckless and cruel Congress failed to act. They cast their last vote, but the Dream Act was not attached. By failing to act, these political leaders – many of whom have children of their own ― voted for the deportation of immigrant youth. And over the course of their leisurely vacation – which stretches into January 8, an additional 2,074 young people will lose their status, adding to the 13,000 youth who have already lost their protections.Carlos returned home from DC last night, filled with bitter disappointment, anxiety and tremendous fear. But also with a tenacity and determination to continue to fight until Dream Act legislation passes.“I feel so disappointed and frustrated. By not acting, Congress chose to gamble with thousands of lives. Personally, I just don’t know what’s next - I just graduated from college and my future is uncertain,” Carlos said.And he is not the only one. Come January, immigrant youth, advocates and supporters will return to Congress with an added ferocity and determination to fight until Dream Act legislation passes, and to hold accountable those who stand in our way.Kica Matos is the Director of Immigrant Rights and Racial Justice at the Center for Community Change Action."

But the tree has decayed to a point where it can no longer be safely preserved, CNN reports.Stephanie Grisham, Trump’s spokeswoman, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the first lady discussed options with White House staff and reviewed an analysis by the United States National Arboretum before deeming that the tree was a safety risk. “[Melania Trump] trusted that every effort had been made to preserve the historic tree, and was concerned about the safety of visitors and members of the press who are often standing right in front of the tree during Marine One lifts,” Grisham told the AP.Grisham said that a “large portion” of the tree will be removed later this week. Wood and seedlings from the tree will reportedly be preserved for the future.The Jackson Magnolia, also known as a magnolia grandiflora tree, was Andrew Jackson’s tribute to wife Rachel Jackson. The pair fell in love and attempted to get married while Rachel was still legally married to her former husband, a situation that caused a scandal during the presidential campaign of 1828. Rachel’s health began to decline as Jackson’s political career progressed, and her existing medical issues were compounded by personal attacks during the campaign on her marriage and virtue. Rachel died on December 22, 1828, days after her husband was elected as president. Jackson, who blamed his political enemies for his wife’s death, moved into the White House as a widower. He reportedly asked for a sprout from Rachel’s favorite magnolia tree at the couple’s farm in Tennessee to be planted on the White House grounds. It was placed at the west side of the South Portico in 1835, according to the White House Historical Association. A second magnolia tree was later planted on the east side of the Portico, for symmetry.Since its arrival, the tree has been in the backdrop of many events at the White House ― from Easter Egg Rolls to routine Marine One departures. Seedlings from the tree have also been used as gifts. President Obama gifted a seedling from the tree to the Israeli people during a trip to former Israeli president Shimon Peres’ presidential residence in 2013. The Jackson Magnolia started to experience problems in the 1970s, when new trunks, or “leaders,” began to emerge from its base. Cement was later used to help shore up a cavity in the tree, which ended up causing more harm. The tree is now standing up with the help of a pole and cable system.According to a report obtained by CNN, experts at the Arboretum told Trump that this system can no longer prevent the tree from collapsing ― and that the tree may actually be a safety hazard.“If this was any ordinary tree, it would have been removed long ago,” the report from the Arboretum reads. “We understand this is a historic tree, and all measures have been used to save it to this point in time. While we cannot comment on the need to preserve the tree as long as it stands, we believe eventually, the tree will fail.”The White House said on Tuesday that seedlings from the original tree will be available in the future, if another tree needs to be planted on the lawn.CORRECTION: In a previous version of this story, a wire photo caption misidentified a Japanese magnolia tree as a Southern magnolia."

35,POLITICS,"In Less Than A Year, Trump Has Stripped Back Workers’ Ability To Unionize",Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-workers-union-rights-2017_us_5a42b5b1e4b025f99e187ea5,His revamped labor board issued a slew of new policies at the end of 2017 that will make collective bargaining harder.,2017-12-26,Donald Trump claimed during the campaign that he would be good for union workers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a42b8ca1c00003b0068d4d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Candidate Donald Trump pitched himself as the right choice for union workers. He bragged that he’d had good relations with labor unions during his real estate career. He argued that he deserved the AFL-CIO labor federation’s electoral endorsement, which ultimately went to his opponent, Hillary Clinton.But in less than a year as president, Trump has wiped away several of the modest policy gains that organized labor made during the Obama years. The nominees he’s chosen to fill crucial regulatory roles are already making it more difficult for some workers to join unions and bargain collectively.These policy reversals have drawn enthusiastic cheers from business lobbies and made a joke of one of Trump’s campaign boasts: “I have great relationships with unions.” Meanwhile, union ranks are hovering near historic lows.In the last weeks of 2017, the National Labor Relations Board issued a slew of decisions that rolled back worker- and union-friendly reforms from the preceding eight years. The NLRB is the independent federal agency responsible for interpreting collective bargaining law and refereeing disputes between employers, unions and workers.The new rulings were made possible by Trump’s two nominees to the five-member NLRB ― William Emanuel and Marvin Kaplan ― which flipped the board’s majority from liberal to conservative. The board managed to get several contentious decisions out the door before Dec. 16, when the term of the third Republican member, Philip Miscimarra, expired, deadlocking the board at 2-2.In one of the most consequential changes, the NLRB reversed a 2011 ruling that helped workers form smaller unions within a single larger workplace. The precedent set during the Obama years allowed, say, nursing home assistants to hold a union election without including all the facility’s dietary aides, maintenance workers and other employees who don’t share similar job duties, wages and gripes with management.Employers hated that standard, complaining that it led to “micro unions.” By overturning it, the Trump-shaped board made organizing workers at a large facility a far more daunting task. Consider the case they ruled on: After 100 welders unionized at a manufacturing plant, the NLRB found the smaller organizing unit to be illegitimate and said any union election would have to include all 2,500 different types of workers at the company, spanning 120 job classifications.The board ruled 3-2 along partisan lines in the case. The two dissenting Democratic members said it was “unconscionable” for the Republican majority to make such a sweeping change without at least soliciting briefs from unions and employers. “It is a dereliction of the duty we owe to the parties and the labor-management community,” they wrote.The Republican majority took an ax to another major precedent set during the Obama years known as the “joint employer” standard.Back in 2015, the NLRB ruled that companies can’t dodge their responsibilities to their workers just by outsourcing management duties to subcontractors or franchisees. The ruling made it easier for workers to file labor complaints against big companies like McDonald’s, which claim they aren’t the employers of the masses of people who labor at their franchise restaurants. The ruling also opened the door for fast food workers to potentially unionize in large groups, rather than store by store.But the new board flipped that decision, reverting the joint employer test to a standard more favorable to fast-food chains and other big companies that contract out work. McDonald’s is likely to benefit almost immediately in a current case over its responsibilities as a potential joint employer.Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate committee overseeing the NLRB, said in a statement that the change in the joint employer standard would make it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages. “And it goes against everything President Trump promised working people during the campaign,” she added.In addition to the two board members, Trump has also chosen a new NLRB general counsel, who functions as a kind of prosecutor and brings cases before the board. While President Barack Obama’s nominees aggressively pursued employers for unfair labor practices, Trump’s pick, Peter Robb, has already signaled that he intends to unwind much of what his predecessors did.In a December memo first reported by HuffPost, Robb told the agency’s regional directors that any expansion of workers’ rights under Obama was effectively on hold for now. He also rescinded several guidance memos that were issued under the previous more-liberal board and that employers argued were too favorable to unions and workers. Robb had represented employers and business groups in labor and employment disputes as a private attorney before Trump plucked him for the general counsel’s position.For now, the deadlocked NLRB won’t be able to rule on contentious cases, making it unlikely that other Obama-era policies will be undone in the near future. But Trump will have the chance to nominate a fifth member to the board in 2018. The GOP Congress will need only a simple majority to confirm the nominee and give the board a 3-2 Republican majority once again. "

Democratic House candidates received 153,422 contributions of $100 or less in the 2017 elections, compared to 7,332 such gifts for Republicans, the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project found by analyzing official data.Danica Roem, delegate-elect in Virginia’s 13th House district and the state’s first openly transgender lawmaker, picked up nearly 18,000 small donations ― more than the entire Republican total of such contributions. The record-breaking small-donor haul dramatically widened a gap between Democrats and Republicans that had been growing in the past few elections. For example, Democratic House candidates received 14,351 small donations in 2009, compared with 12,918 for Republicans, according to VPAP.Of course, both major parties remain heavily dependent on larger contributions. Donations of $100 or less made up 12.2 percent of Democratic House candidates’ fundraising total, and 2.5 percent of the total for Republican candidates.VPAP’s findings, which were published Dec. 15, provide new insight into the way that grassroots liberal excitement and anger at the policies of President Donald Trump propelled Democrats to surprisingly large wins in Virginia’s elections.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton defeated Trump in Virginia by 5 percentage points, giving Democrat Ralph Northam favorable odds in the state’s gubernatorial race. Northam indeed won by a comfortable margin. But Democrats’ success in the House of Delegates, where the GOP previously held a 66-34 majority, exceeded all expectations.The Democratic Party flipped at least 15 GOP-controlled Virginia House seats. A recount in a 16th race resulted in a tie that could soon be resolved by the drawing of straws. The House will be split 50-50 if Democrats win that seat, prompting a power-sharing agreement. In addition to Roem, new Democrats in the Virginia House include Chris Hurst, a former TV anchor whose girlfriend was killed on air in August 2015; the state’s first Latina delegates Elizabeth Guzman and Hala Ayala; the state’s first Asian-American female delegate Kathy Tran; and Lee Carter, a former Marine and self-described democratic socialist."
39,POLITICS,Saudi Arabia Pressured Lebanese Prime Minister To Resign: Report,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saudi-arabia-pressured-lebanese-prime-minister-to-resign-report_us_5a41184ce4b06d1621b537cf,The high-stakes gambit backfired amid international uproar.,2017-12-25,"Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned under apparent pressure during a November visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. After returning to Lebanon, he rescinded his resignation.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4118e02100002c005f5c9b.jpeg?cache=8ocXxb5Wsg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his short-lived resignation in early November under heavy duress from the Saudi Arabian government, according to a New York Times report based on the accounts of Lebanese, Western and regional officials, as well as other figures close to Hariri.Veteran Middle East watchers immediately suspected that Saudi Arabian pressure was at play when Hariri suddenly resigned on Nov. 4 during a visit to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The Times’ report confirms those suspicions and adds new details about what occurred.The officials and associates of Hariri who spoke to the Times portray a cringe-inducing saga in which Saudi Arabia, under the direction of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, subjected Hariri to demeaning pressure, handed him a pre-written resignation speech that blamed Iran for his departure and effectively held him captive to ensure that he would commit to the resignation.The plan was intended to diminish Iranian influence in the region, including the power of Iranian-backed militia Hezbollah in Lebanon, potentially by sparking a regional crisis, according to the Times.But after facing backlash in Lebanon and from Western governments, Saudi Arabia consented to let Hariri return to Lebanon. He withdrew his resignation earlier this month. The incident unraveled into a fiasco that cost Saudi Arabia dearly in terms of diplomatic fallout. At best, it generated modest policy wins.Several Middle East policy experts reacted with shock at the revelations in the Times’ report.Ilan Goldenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security who held top Middle East posts in former President Barack Obama’s State Department, tweeted that the Saudi Arabian scheme was an “incredible diplomatic clusterfuck.”Shibley Telhami, a Middle East politics professor at the University of Maryland, wrote on Twitter that the article “seems to confirm many of the worst rumors not only about Saudi treatment of Hariri, but also of others.”“If the details are accurate, expect more trouble ahead,” he added.Hariri ― like his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed in 2005 ― has strong ties to Saudi Arabia. He holds dual Saudi Arabian citizenship, was born in Saudi Arabia and owes his immense wealth to business holdings there.Saudi Arabia therefore views him as a crucial ally in Lebanon, where the oil-rich Sunni regional power competes with Iran for influence. But Hariri governs in a coalition that includes Hezbollah and allied figures, including President Michel Aoun.Saudi Arabia reportedly grew frustrated with Hariri’s ability or willingness to curb Iranian influence. The event that appeared to prompt Saudi Arabia to summon Hariri to Riyadh was an amicable meeting on Nov. 3 with a top Iranian official.Hours after the encounter, the Saudi king invited Hariri to Riyadh, supposedly to spend a day in the desert with the crown prince, according to the Times.Hariri didn’t hear from Mohammed bin Salman upon his arrival, but was summoned early the next morning for a meeting with the prince. Instead, Saudi officials “manhandled” Hariri, confiscated his cell phone and deprived him of all but one of his bodyguards, people familiar with the matter told the Times. Lebanese officials described what happened next as a “black box.”Hariri delivered his pre-written resignation speech on Saudi television in the afternoon.Shortly thereafter, Mohammed bin Salman summoned Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for a meeting in which he reportedly tried to shape Palestinian politics. Lebanese officials worried that Mohammed bin Salman was scheming to cultivate violent resistance to Hezbollah from within Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.Read the full New York Times report here. A coordinated diplomatic blitz from France, the United States, Egypt and other nations secured Hariri’s release and return to Lebanon. Mohammed bin Salman wanted Hariri to get Hezbollah to withdraw from Yemen, apparently unaware that Hezbollah is not a significant player in the Yemeni war, according to the Times. He may instead only succeed in persuading Hezbollah to tone down their anti-Saudi rhetoric.In response to inquiries by the Times about Hariri’s ordeal, a Saudi official said only that Hariri was “treated with the utmost respect.” Hariri did not respond to requests for comment. And both the Saudi official and a spokesman for Abbas denied any plans to cultivate violent resistance to Hezbollah from within Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.But the Times report is consistent with the aggressive and seemingly brash Saudi foreign policy spearheaded by Mohammed bin Salman, the 32-year-old heir to the Saudi kingdom. Even before the crown prince formally supplanted a much older cousin as royal heir in June, he had escalated Saudi Arabia’s role in the brutal war in Yemen, where a Saudi-led bombing campaign and shipping blockade aimed at dislodging the Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.Mohammed bin Salman also masterminded a regional blockade against neighboring Qatar over its support for the Muslim Brotherhood and relative amicability toward Iran. Many analysts say they believe the attempted crackdown has only nudged Qatar closer to Iran.In addition, the crown prince conducted mass arrests of wealthy Saudi businessmen and other prominent officials in November with the supposed goal of rooting out corruption. But outside observers maintain that Mohammed bin Salman’s real aim was to consolidate power and silence critics, noting that the arrestees included political rivals within the Saudi royal family.The latest revelations about Mohammed bin Salman’s conduct are likely to raise questions about President Donald Trump’s warm treatment of the Saudi government in general, and the crown prince in particular. Trump tweeted his approval of Mohammed bin Salman’s supposed anticorruption purge in November, expressing “great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.”Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has reportedly developed an especially close relationship with Mohammed bin Salman. Kushner visited the crown prince in October and they stayed up until 4 a.m. plotting strategy, according to a Washington Post columnist.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said Rafik Hariri was killed while serving as prime minister. In fact, he was killed after he left the office. "

That’s Mexico’s highest annual murder tally since modern records began in 1997.2011 had previously held the ignominious title, with 22,409 murders. (This year’s murder rate — at 18.7 per 100,000 inhabitants — remains lower than it was in 2011, when it soared to 19.4 per 100,000.)The record-breaking murder tally has been described as a major blow to President Enrique Pena Nieto and his Institutional Revolutionary Party as Mexico prepares to elect a new president in July 2018. When Pena Nieto took office in 2012, he had promised to bring peace to a country weary from years of violence. As Reuters notes, the number of murders did dip during the first two years of his tenure, but has since been on the rise.On Thursday, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said in a report that Mexico ― outside of active war zones ― was the deadliest country for journalists in 2017. At least six journalists were murdered in the country this year “in reprisal for their work,” and three other slayings are under investigation, according to the CPJ.The deaths include that of Javier Valdez Cardenas, an investigative reporter who had covered Sinaloa’s drug war. Valdez was forced out of his car in broad daylight in May and shot dead by two gunmen.“Impunity continues to fester in Mexico,” Jan-Albert Hootsen, CPJ’s Mexico representative, told VICE News last week. “Journalist murders hardly ever get investigated, they hardy ever get prosecuted. As that situation continues, the violence continues to be exacerbated.”Violence against women in Mexico is also on the rise. According a joint report published earlier this month by UN Women, the country’s Interior Ministry and National Women’s Institute, Mexico’s rate of femicide ballooned in the past decade. "

Firefighters recovered one body from the still-smouldering NCCC Mall on Sunday, reported CNN Philippines. Distraught relatives were told there was “zero” chance of survival for those still trapped inside, said Sara Duterte, the city’s mayor and daughter of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. She added that firefighters would not rest until all bodies are recovered and that an investigation would be launched into the cause of the blaze.The fire is believed to have started Saturday morning on the third floor of the four-story building. SunStar Davao reported that most of the shopping areas of the mall were still closed to the public at the time. Officials said many of those missing worked at a call center inside the building, reported The New York Times.On Sunday, the city of Davao released a list of names of those reported missing:President Duterte, who was Davao’s mayor until 2016 when his daughter was elected to the post, visited with relatives of those missing on Saturday night.

Scott Fricker, 48, and his wife Buckley Kuhn-Fricker, 43, were shot and killed in their home in Reston, Virginia, on Friday according to Fairfax County police. The teenager, who is not named due to his minor status, shot the Frickers after getting into their home. Police indicate that the teen also suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and is currently in critical condition. The teen was dating the Frickers’ teenage daughter, but the parents pushed the young couple to break up. Kuhn-Fricker’s mother, Janet Kuhn, told ABC 7 that her daughter tried to separate the teens because they considered the boy to be dangerous and a white supremacist.“They kept a tight eye on her and they disapproved of all the time she was spending with him, hours on the phone,” Kuhn told ABC.Kuhn-Fricker alerted the principal of the teen’s high school to concerning social media posts from the boy and called him an “outspoken Neo-Nazi” in messages to friends, the Washington Post reports. She flagged social media posts where the boy lauded Hitler, supported Nazi book burnings and called for a “white revolution,” according the Post. “I would feel a little bad reporting him if his online access was to basically be a normal teen, but he is a monster, and I have no pity for people like that,” Kuhn-Fricker wrote in an email obtained by the Post. “He made these choices. He is spreading hate.”After staging an intervention, the family believed their daughter had come to the realization that a breakup was in her best interest. But around 5 a.m. on Friday morning, Kuhn-Fricker and Fricker heard a noise and discovered the teenage boy in their daughter’s bedroom. The teen shot and killed the parents before inflicting a wound on himself, but none of the other four family members in the house were injured. The unnamed teen is under police guard and will be served his warrants depending on his medical condition, police say. "

One of those involved the company’s president, Andrew Creighton. He paid $135,000 in 2016 to a former employee who alleged she was fired after refusing “an intimate relationship” with him.Two other men accused in harassment settlements, former Vice News head Jason Mojica and Vice producer Rhys James, were both fired in November.According to the Times report, Vice settled for an undisclosed amount to an employee earlier this year who said that as her supervisor, Mojica retaliated against her at the end of a sexual relationship. The company settled for $24,000 in January to an employee of mixed race who said James made racist and sexist comments, including asking her about the color of her nipples.The fourth settlement involved a writer who said the company defamed her by falsely publishing that she agreed to have sex with a rapper she interviewed.Additionally, more than 24 women told the Times they had seen or personally experienced sexual misconduct at Vice like unwanted kisses, propositions for sex and inappropriate comments.Vice co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi appeared to agree with the sentiments of Vice employees. In a statement sent to the Times, they apologized that those running the company had failed to foster a “safe and inclusive workplace”:Listening to our employees over the past year, the truth is inescapable: from the top down, we have failed as a company to create a safe and inclusive workplace where everyone, especially women, can feel respected and thrive. Cultural elements from our past, dysfunction, and mismanagement were allowed to flourish unchecked. That includes a detrimental ‘boy’s club’ culture that fostered inappropriate behavior that permeated throughout the company.In a longer version of the statement sent to employees, Vice also outlined the steps the company has taken to improve the situation. Some of those steps were creation of a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Board with Gloria Steinem as a member, a strengthened process for reporting harassment and the removal of a bizarre “non-traditional workplace agreement” that essentially required new hires to agree to not be offended by whatever went on at the office.The Times report echoes earlier accounts that Vice employees, particularly women, have shared in recent weeks. Last month, The Daily Beast interviewed more than a dozen former and current staffers who described routine harassment and indifference on the part of the company. Employees also described having to sign the “non-traditional workplace agreement” mentioned in Vice’s statement. Those agreements mandated, among other stipulations, that they agree to not find “the workplace environment at VICE” to be “offensive, indecent, violent or disturbing.”Shortly after The Daily Beast story broke, HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg spoke with multiple Vice staffers who were furious about the company’s failure to address sexual harassment allegations and frustrated with a general lack of transparency. They also spoke of anxiety over the impending Times story, which they knew was in the works.“That story is a shadow over all of us,” one employee told HuffPost. “Every day you think, is this the day that it’s going to break?”"

They thought it was a weak storm but it dumped more rains.”Hundreds of kilometers to the east, army and emergency workers were checking reports an entire village was buried by mudslide in Tubod town in Lanao del Norte.Ryan Cabus, a local official, said power and communication lines to the area had been cut, complicating rescue efforts.The weather bureau said the storm had gathered strength over the Sulu Sea and was packing winds of up 80 kph (50 mph) and moving west at 20 kph.It was heading out over the sea by midday on Saturday and would have moved clear of the Philippines by Monday, it said.Emergency workers, soldiers, police and volunteers were being mobilized to search for survivors, clear debris, and restore power and communications.More than 100 deaths were reported in various places including 60 in Tubod, El Salvador and Munai towns in Lanao del Norte province. In Zamboanga del Norte province, police said 42 people had been killed in the towns of Sibuco and Salug.Three people were killed in Bukidnon province, while politicians in Lanao del Sur province said 18 people had drowned in flash floods there. Sixty-four people were reported missing in floods and landslides, according to a tally of reports form officials and police.The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons every year, bringing death and destruction, usually to the poorest communities. Last week, 46 people were killed in the central Philippines when a typhoon hit.In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan killed nearly 8,000 people and left 200,000 families homeless.(Reporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Robert Birsel and Stephen Powell)"

Deputies also killed the woman. The boy, Kameron Prescott, was hit in the abdomen by a stray bullet that went through the wall of his mobile home in the city of Schertz. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, The San Antonio Express-News reports. Four Bexar County Sheriff’s deputies were pursuing a female suspect, who was identified by her family as 30-year-old Amanda Lenee Jones. Police said the woman they were chasing was suspected of stealing a car. There is no known connection between Jones, Prescott or his family.Sheriff Javier Salazar said at a Friday news conference (below) that deputies opened fire on the woman after she forced her way into the home where Prescott lived and threatened people inside. He said she went back outside and threatened deputies with an object that they believed to be a “weapon.”Investigators have not recovered any firearms from the scene, but they did find a “tubular object” that they now believe was the item deputies mistook for a gun. At the conference, Salazar called what happened a “tragic accident.”In a statement released by Kameron’s school district, his first-grade teacher described him as a boy who loved to make everyone laugh.“Kameron was the kindest-hearted little boy that I have ever had the pleasure of teaching,” said Shanda Ince.School counselor Maria Morales remembered him as an energetic, intelligent “kind soul” who could “strike up a conversation with anyone.”Kameron’s uncle, Christopher Gonzales, has said that he wants to see the deputies “held accountable” for what happened.“Y’all just killed a little boy, if it was y’all,” he told KENS5. “There’s no weapon, so it wasn’t that lady.”Local news outlets have reported that a GoFundMe page has been set up for Kameron’s family to assist with funeral costs."

As in the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol, the villain of this story is money. It features its own Ebenezer Scrooge and ghosts of moral compunction. But the ending of our tale has been adjusted: Money prevails and Scrooge dies miserable and rich, but not before buying off his ghosts and fashioning them into a museum exhibit. That’s where I’m standing, in the annual Yuletide display of John Pierpont Morgan’s collection of Dickensia at the Morgan Library, the Madison Avenue monument to the excesses and undeniable good taste of the man who invented American banking as we know it. Specifically, I am standing in front of the original handwritten manuscript of A Christmas Carol, purchased by Morgan sometime in the 1890s, as his economic and political power approached its zenith. It is the crown jewel of the production, bound in handsome red Morocco leather, presented alongside personal correspondence, illustrations and other minor treasures from Dickens’ improbable life. In prior years, the irony would have been outrageous, but in this moment, the Dickens exhibit is merely appropriate. As Congress approves a tax bill of blatant financial despotism ― showering fresh riches on billionaires, senators and the president himself ― one of the most beloved expressions of Christian egalitarianism rests under soft illumination, the hunting trophy of a dead financier. When Dickens sat down to write A Christmas Carol in October 1843, he was frightened and broke. This would have surprised most Victorians, who knew him as the most popular English writer since Shakespeare and one of the few living men recognizable on multiple continents. But the weak sales of his most recent novels had put severe strain on his resources and amplified some of his deepest anxieties.When he was 12, Dickens’ respectable middle-class family had been overwhelmed by debt. His father was sentenced to debtors’ prison, and young Charles was dispatched to work at a shoe polish factory to help the family buy back their freedom. The “rotten floors and staircase” he described to his first biographer, John Forster, “and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars” stayed with him. They eventually made an appearance in his hit second novel, Oliver Twist, and stamped on its author a profound sense of social fragility. For Dickens, financial success and the public esteem that accompanied it were not anchored to character or ability. They were insecure blessings, easily erased. Oliver Twist was now four years in the past. In the meantime, like his father before him, Dickens had been siring more children than he could afford. He and his wife, Catherine, moved into a bigger house to accommodate their growing family even as sales of his novels, serialized in popular magazines, had collapsed to one-fifth of their 1841 peak. A Christmas Carol was a wild attempt to reverse these sagging fortunes. Instead of turning the work over to the magazines, Dickens would publish it himself as a hardbound book released a week before Christmas to capitalize on the holiday market. Though a sensible sales gimmick today, this was an act of lunatic delusion in 1843, when the market for bound books was small, and the market for Christmas did not exist.Christmas, in Dickens’ time, was going through an identity crisis. Considered a minor theological event for most of Christian history, Dec. 25 had always been entangled with various non-Christian celebrations of the winter solstice ― holly, mistletoe and ivy are all holdovers from different European tribal festivities, along with Yule logs and Christmas trees. This was particularly troubling to the severe theologies popular among the British. In the 17th century, Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan government put an end to all dangerous compromises with paganism by banning the holiday outright. Caroling became a crime.The Puritans eventually lost their war on Christmas, but upstanding English families were still negotiating the appropriate limits of joviality under Queen Victoria. She was understood to be Christmas-curious ― her German husband, Albert, was adamant about his tannenbaum ― but most households settled for the rough equivalent of a bank holiday in December, with an evening of ghost stories around the fire thrown in for family entertainment. Still, Dickens had to do something about his depleted bank account. After blitzing through the manuscript in just six weeks, he was overdrawn, and he wrote to his lawyer Thomas Mitton to beg for a £200 loan ― enough to get him through until the book sales paid out. All of this spiritual and financial turmoil found an outlet in A Christmas Carol. Combining pagan supernaturalia with Christian themes as subtle as a sledgehammer, Dickens presented a parable of what would soon be known as the social gospel ― a celebration of the working family, of the triumph of love over greed and the promise that everyone, even the most miserable miser, can be redeemed by helping the poor. People loved it. A Christmas Carol quickly sold out of its initial run of 6,000 copies. A pirated edition appeared ― a sure sign of a hit ― as additional printings were ordered up. It was soon adapted for the stage, and has continued to serve as source material for television, film, ballet and opera ever since. But its cultural influence proved more than literary. Dickens did not, as the latest film adaptation of his slim book (based on an amiable biography by Les Standiford) claims, invent Christmas. He was, however, instrumental in establishing the holiday as a festive season, according to another Dickens biographer, Peter Ackroyd. So long as everyone maintained a Christian spirit ― love of family, care for the poor and a healthy skepticism of financial capital ― pagan frivolities were fair game. All of the childhood wonder that has emerged since ― Frosty, Rudolph, the Grinch, even Santa’s red and white suit ― owe a small debt to Dickens.The great criminal of A Christmas Carol is not Ebenezer Scrooge, who opens the story as an abusive boss, denouncing the moral fiber of the poor as he shuns his own family. Scrooge eventually corrects his moral errors. The real poison is money itself, which corrupts his innocent soul and tricks him into purging joy from his life in a hopeless quest to insulate himself from sorrow. Dickens offered a retelling of the legend of King Midas, the tragic mythological figure whose life was ruined when everything he touched began turning to gold.It would eventually fall into the hands of a Gilded Age colossus.Nobody who knew Pierpont Morgan doubted his religious zeal. He collected medieval holy books, made an emotional pilgrimage to Jerusalem and claimed to have seen the exact spot along the Nile River where the infant Moses had been rescued from the reeds. So as his fortune swelled during the second half of the 19th century, the greatest of American financiers devoted some of his wealth to a higher purpose. He bought a church.At Saint George’s in Manhattan, Morgan paid for social services, financed the construction of new buildings and even picked the rector, Rev. William Rainsford. But ownership and management soon came into conflict when Rainsford sought to “democratize” the vestry ― the governing body of the burgeoning institution ― which the new preacher believed to be an unacceptably narrow, wealthy slice of the parish. Morgan was appalled: “I do not want the vestry democratized. I want it to remain a body of gentlemen whom I can ask to meet me in my study.” It was not that Morgan despised the working and middle classes ― though he did loathe the nouveau riche who had dared to migrate from among them into his own lofty station. “He was never a champion of social justice or equality,” as biographer Ron Chernow wrote in his titanic history The House of Morgan. But the money magnate still paid for his rector’s various endeavors to feed and educate the poor. Morgan instead enjoyed a sense of superiority over the masses. He had an unshakeable belief that he and his fellow princes of capital knew what was best not only for the ordering of corporations, but for the way his fellow citizens should live their lives. He provided financial support to Anthony Comstock’s censorship campaigns, which burned books and championed the covering of nude statues. When the Metropolitan Opera’s performance of the Richard Strauss libretto ”Salome” offended his puritanical sensibilities, Morgan personally intervened to cancel the production. He was an active member of the Young Men’s Christian Association, which sought to temper political radicalism among industrial workers by instilling in them Victorian virtues, discouraging gambling, in particular.Not that Morgan allowed his own conduct to be hindered by such inconveniences. Unhappy with his marriage, he carried on affair after affair with actresses “aboard his yachts, in private railroad cars, and at European spas,” as Chernow details. Once, at a Cairo hotel, he threw a small fortune in gold jewelry onto a table and instructed a throng of young women, “Help yourselves!” before other entertainments ensued.But for the most part, he lived a life of great power and little pleasure. With his children, Morgan was, in Chernow’s words, “terrifying” and “distant.” A dour, ferocious businessman, he could be as brutal with his colleagues as he was ruthless with his competitors, which he steadily eliminated, forming great monopolies in the steel, coal, telegraph, shipping and railroad industries. When a financial crisis shook the foundations of the American banking system in 1907, Morgan worked out the rescue plan in his study and all but ordered President Theodore Roosevelt to accept the terms, which happened to give Morgan control over the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. The Rough Rider assented without complaint.In short, over the course of his 75 years, Morgan was a living embodiment of everything Charles Dickens assailed in his fiction. When his son, Jack, came across the Dickens novel Dombey and Son at the age of 13, he was moved to tears by the story, which opens with an overbearing shipping magnate attempting to groom his sensitive son for the family business through various acts of bullying and intimidation. The child dies.Jack proved sturdier. He succeeded his father at the helm of the family empire and opened the Morgan home as a museum in 1924. Though most of the building has since been transformed into an airy, modern public space, curators have preserved the original patriarch’s library and study. It is both opulent and ominous, filled with dark mahogany shelves, walls covered in crimson silk, Italian Renaissance paintings and one massive portrait each of a glowering Pierpont and a more contemplative Jack. The library has its own rotunda adorned with brilliant mosaics supported by intricately carved marble columns. An adjacent showroom houses illuminated manuscripts, Egyptian statuary and an Assyrian cuneiform tablet. Pierpont’s greatest passion was not for actresses, but for plunder.Yet money was never far from his mind. Hanging over a massive stone fireplace in the library is an epic 16th-century tapestry depicting the deadly sin of avarice, characterized by King Midas himself. It is a difficult item to interpret. A symbol of Morgan’s internal torment? A demonstration of his power over the moral trifles of lesser men? A simple lack of self-awareness?Though the Dickens exhibit is more cheerful, it is impossible to put aside similar questions. Why would a fabulously rich banker purchase the letter Dickens wrote over Christmas of 1843 pleading for a loan?The wealth of material provides a charming narrative of Dickens’ career. Though A Christmas Carol revived his confidence, the project was a financial bust. He insisted on a jubilant presentation for the book, paying for full-color illustrations, leather covers and gilt-edged pages. These elevated production costs left him with a total profit of just £137 from the first printing. Even this was soon wiped out. Dickens successfully sued the rogue publishers who had released a pirated edition, but when they declared bankruptcy, he was left with £700 in legal fees to cover out of his own pocket.Undeterred, Dickens followed up with four other Christmas books in the 1840s, all of which racked up impressive sales numbers. This year’s Morgan Library exhibit features for the first time the original manuscripts of these later works ― The Chimes, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Battle of Life and The Haunted Man ― though they all made their way into the museum long after Pierpont’s death. None have the same power of A Christmas Carol, but they tackle the same themes, celebrating the working class as they excoriate the elite ― bankers, politicians and churchmen ― as either moralizing hypocrites or sterile, joyless sadists. The Chimes is even more radical than its better-known predecessor, the story of a poor family steadily beaten down into death and despair by a politician who styles himself an enlightened “friend and father to the poor.” Instead of education or financial aid, the vulnerable protagonists receive stern lectures about their character failings, as additional hardships are piled on to test their fitness for relief. Dickens explained his motive for writing the piece in a letter to the actor William Macready: “I have endeavored to plant an indignant right-hander on the eye of certain Wicked Cant that makes my blood boil, which I hope will not only cloud that eye with black and blue, but many a gentler one with chrystal of the purest sort.” Morgan’s eye was not blackened. He purchased the letter sometime before 1913. And Dickens himself would struggle to live up to some of these values in later life. His international celebrity put a terrible strain on his marriage to Catherine. In 1858, he humiliated her with a very public separation, leaving the mother of his children for the teenage Ellen Ternan. He worked at a furious pace all his life, taking on a second career as a public speaker, reading his books before audiences of thousands. He never abandoned his crusade for the poor ― his speaking tours for A Christmas Carol raised money for charity ― but family joys and responsibilities became an encumbrance to a man consumed by his own greatness. None of these failings have diminished the cultural power of his prose, which will resonate so long as economic inequality remains a dominant social problem. For Dickens, Christmas was synonymous with a natural, divine abundance. Scarcity was a human invention. There is never any question in his holiday fables whether there are enough geese in England to satisfy every table at Christmas ― only the question of why some tables are denied their dinner.Men like Morgan knew the answer. It was stashed away in their bank vaults and hoarded among their cuneiform ruins. And for all the talk of innovation, efficiency and progress we have heard from Wall Street and Silicon Valley in the century or so since Morgan’s death, that is where it remains. The American economy generates over $19 trillion in wealth every year, yet 40 million Americans live in poverty, 41 million live in ""food insecure"" households and roughly half do not have the funds to meet an unexpected $500 expense. Congress, meanwhile, has decided to raise taxes on the poor and middle class to shower trillions of dollars on some of the richest families the world has ever known, including their own. We are experiencing the spiritual arc of A Christmas Carol in reverse, watching our public commitments and ideas curdle into moral rot. "
55,POLITICS,Democrats Are Attacking The GOP For Its Hypocrisy On Deficits. That Might Be A Mistake.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-attack-gop-budget-deficit-hypocrisy_us_5a3d752fe4b0b0e5a7a21282,"The argument could backfire, some progressive economists fear.",2017-12-23,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hold a press conference against the GOP tax legislation, Nov. 2, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3d79972100002c005f598a.jpeg?cache=8q5JIYCM6F&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans ran against the rising national debt in the 2010 midterm elections, and it worked. The party won big and regained control of the House of Representatives.And regardless of what actually motivated the voters who propelled the Republican takeover that year, the tea party-fueled GOP claimed a mandate to curb President Barack Obama’s public spending habits.Throughout that period, progressive economists, activists and a growing number of Democratic lawmakers steadily advanced the idea that budget deficits, especially in a sluggish economy, are actually a good thing. Many of these thinkers even criticized Obama for seemingly buying into deficit hawks’ policy arguments and seeking a so-called fiscal “grand bargain” with congressional Republicans that would have cut Social Security and Medicare.Now, with the historically unpopular President Donald Trump in the White House, it’s Democrats’ turn to try and ride the midterm election wave. And since congressional Republicans’ massive tax cut bill is projected to add $1.4 trillion to the debt over the next decade, Democrats have stumbled on a seemingly delicious talking point to aid them in their quest: calling out the hypocrisy of Republicans and their supposed concern for budget deficits. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared at a Wednesday press conference that the bill would “explode the national debt.”“The poor deficit hawk,” Pelosi said. “It’s become, if not an endangered species, extinct, because the Republicans only seem to care about the deficit when it comes time to invest in people. Not when it comes time to give giveaways to corporate America and the wealthiest.”But some of the same economists who admonished Obama for embracing deficit concerns now worry that Democrats’ focus on the budgetary impact of the tax cuts could undermine the party’s political viability in the 2018 midterm elections ― as well as its policy agenda, should it regain power.“It’s wrong from just about every angle,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a progressive think tank. “First off, people don’t really care about the deficit.”Democrats “can complain about inconsistency,” Baker added, “but that also doesn’t go anywhere.”What Americans do care about, according to Baker, is the money in their pockets. And while the tax cuts’ benefits are skewed to the super-rich, the bill is expected to add 0.8 percent growth to the economy over the next 10 years. Plus, lower tax rates are expected, on average, to modestly fatten the paychecks of millions of middle-class Americans.So while the tax bill is deeply unpopular now, there is no guarantee its unpopularity will hold once the law’s benefits kick in.“Democrats are underestimating the extent to which the tax cuts are going to deliver in some respects,” said Stephanie Kelton, an economist at Stonybrook University and fellow at the Sanders Institute, the think tank of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). “I don’t think Democrats can bank on this thing being a disaster ― in the next year and a half, anyway.”What’s more, in the event that Democrats are able to take back one or both chambers of Congress in 2018, running as more responsible stewards of the federal budget could paint them into a corner.Rather than reorient the government’s spending priorities toward infrastructure, health care and education, Democrats might feel obligated to waste valuable political capital trying to clean up the GOP’s “fiscal mess” at a time when low inflation would make deficit reduction unnecessary, Kelton said. And since Republicans would at least retain control of the White House until 2020, the GOP would be able to thwart any efforts to raise taxes, she noted.In that scenario, Kelton warned, Democrats are “not gonna get anything done. The agenda will languish.”HuffPost asked Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and 10 House Democrats whether they harbored any concern that attacking the GOP tax cuts for raising the national debt could backfire on them by reinforcing the conservative idea that America is somehow “broke.”Perez responded that when it comes to deficit concerns, Republican “hypocrisy is rank.”The tax bill, in his view, has proven once again that Democrats are the more fiscally responsible party.“The Democrats have been the job creators over the last 36 years,” Perez said. “The Republicans have been the deficit creators.”Several of the Democratic members of Congress approached by HuffPost were puzzled by the question, and likewise returned to the idea that they had finally exposed Republican hypocrisy on budget deficits.“Listen, there is not a member who has not heard from the other side of the aisle their concerns of deficits. It’s becoming very hypocritical at this stage,” said Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.). Rep. Michael Capuano (D-Mass.) appeared to interpret the question as an unlikely challenge to the party’s fiscal bona fides, chuckling at the idea in the context of the GOP’s budget-busting tax cuts.“The last time I knew, when Dems ran the world, the deficit was not an issue,” he said. “We were paying down our debt and paying our bills, and funding the government.”Capuano later conceded that under pressure from budget hawks, Obama “may” have pivoted to deficit reduction too early, but said he was not worried “at this time” that Democrats’ rhetoric would revive deficit alarmism.Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) similarly touted Democrats’ fiscal stewardship. “We have a pretty good record through the Clinton years,” he said.As a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) helped lead progressive opposition to Obama’s efforts to broker a deal that would have cut Social Security and Medicare. On Thursday, Grijalva admitted that focusing on the deficit effects of the tax bill is less than ideal.“It’s about the revenue our country needs to take care of its people. I would prefer if we framed it that way,” Grijalva said. He nonetheless argued that it is “also important to point out the hypocrisy. These are the deficit hawks, these are the deficit people.” A number of Democrats maintained that they are less concerned about the effects of budget deficits per se than about the prospect that congressional Republicans might turn around and use the deficits created by the tax cuts they enacted to make the case for major cuts in social insurance programs. Indeed, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) declared earlier this month that congressional Republicans would be pivoting to so-called “entitlement reform” ― a euphemism for cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. (For his part, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that overhauling the programs is unlikely due to Democratic opposition.)“We use the conversation about deficits as shorthand for saying... ‘we know how you are, we know what you do, we know what your M.O. is, and now instead of paying for these things in what we think is a respectable and honest way, you’re gonna try to cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security,’” said Rep. Donald McEachin (D-Va.).Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) framed it in similar terms, predicting that “in a few weeks they’re gonna run around and say, ‘Oh, look at this big deficit we have. Now we have to cut Medicare and Social Security.’”Several Democratic lawmakers also acknowledged that generating budget deficits can have a positive effect on the economy. They argued that a tax bill targeted at high earners and corporations is a waste of budget deficits that would have a much greater impact if used to finance infrastructure and education investment.“There are reasons to deficit-spend if you were gonna invest in infrastructure right now, which we need, and we’re gonna have to invest in at some point,” said Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas). Referring to low interest rates, O’Rourke added, “Money’s really fucking cheap. And people are gonna need work in places that I care about in Texas. I’m happy to add to the debt for that.”Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who represents Flint, a city still reeling from the lead-poisoning of its water supply, likened the tax bill to credit card debt, when proverbial “mortgage debt” ― that is, debt-financed investment in a long-term asset ― is what the country needs.“I would have been much more comfortable if this looked more like mortgage debt ― by financing a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of infrastructure,” Kildee said. “But to borrow a trillion and half dollars from China to give it away to people with no commitment that they’re gonna use it for anything other than their own wealth, it’s a totally different question.”With the amount of money the tax cuts would add to the debt, said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), “you could pay off every student loan in the country. You could probably rebuild every bridge and repair every roadway that needs work.”When it comes to campaigning against the GOP tax bill’s benefits for middle-class people, the congressional Democrats interviewed by HuffPost were confident that pointing out the disproportionate benefits of the bill for wealthy people would be a winning message.They repeatedly cited the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center’s estimate that 82 percent of the bill’s benefits would go to the top 1 percent of earners over the next decade. The lopsided gains of the bill reflect the fact that while the bill’s corporate tax cuts are permanent, the lower individual tax rates would expire in 2025.“I suspect our response will be that you didn’t keep your promise ― ‘You put corporations over regular people. If you wanted to, you could have made the tax changes permanent just like you did for corporations, but you deliberately chose not to do that,’” McEachin said.And the elimination of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate is due to drive up health insurance premiums for many households, offsetting the tax cuts’ effect on incomes, Kildee noted.“If you get a slight increase in your take-home pay but you have to pay all of that and more to make up for increased health care premiums, it’s not a good deal,” he said. Democrats were less united about whether they would prioritize reducing budget deficits, including a politically difficult reversal of the tax cuts, should they gain control of one or both chambers of Congress in 2018.Democrats would need to be “responsible” in terms of financing any infrastructure investment, McEachin said. “We may need to redo the tax code, to the extent we make sure that folks are paying their fair share and that it’s not being balanced on the backs of the poor or the middle class.”When asked whether closing budget gaps would be on Democrats’ shortlist if the party won big in 2018, Lieu responded: “I don’t know. I think we would actually ask the American people.”However, Yarmuth, who stands to become chairman of the House Budget Committee if Democrats take back the House, flatly stated that Democrats would prioritize their spending goals ― including infrastructure, student loan relief and expanding community college access ― over deficit reduction.“All things being equal, if 2019 is the same as it is today, with interest rates at the same level and employment at the same level, I would say that we would be very aggressive in our program and in our agenda,” he said."

Actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio made headlines in the fall when his investment in Beyond Meat was announced. There are also ethical concerns. Major changes in livestock production, including the spread of so-called mega-farms where large numbers of animals are reared in close confinement, has led to criticisms over what some see as unacceptable levels of animal welfare.Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown told HuffPost he believes health concerns are the main motivation for reducing meat consumption. The World Health Organization has said eating processed red meat like burgers and sausages is linked to cancer, with 50 grams (about 1.7 ounces) of processed meat a day ― less than two slices of bacon ― increasing the chance of developing colorectal cancer by 18 percent.The environmental impact of meat production is also huge. Meat and dairy production is said to account for 14.5 percent of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions ― slightly more than the emissions produced by every car, train, aircraft and ship on the planet. Without cutting the overconsumption of meat, it will be almost impossible to prevent global warming from passing the danger level of 2 degrees Celsius, according to international affairs think tank Chatham House.Likewise, meat production is resource intense. Producing 1 kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of fresh beef may need about 29 pounds of grain and 66 pounds of hay, research suggests, which in turn requires more than 26,000 gallons of water to produce.Then there’s the fact that feeding crops to animals to produce food is just not very efficient. Globally, one-third of the calories produced by the world’s crops are used for animal feed, but only 12 percent of those feed calories contribute to the human diet, in the form of meat and other animal products.It is these types of planetary costs, as well as potential human health risks such as antibiotic use in livestock operations, that have prompted calls for meat products to be taxed and the ”true costs” of meat production to be accounted for.“Nearly all other carcinogens are regulated, so why not meat?” asks Marco Springmann, a researcher into sustainability and public health at the University of Oxford. “I think the evidence of the environmental and health consequences of meat shows there is a good, clear case for taxation.”The idea of a tax on meat has already been floated in Germany this year, with officials in the country saying it could generate the equivalent of $6.1 billion per year in revenue, to be used to cut the tax on other food products.An investor report produced earlier this month stated a tax on meat was now “increasingly probable.” It said meat was already headed down the path followed previously by tobacco, carbon and sugar, with health and environmental effects and financial costs swaying a number of countries to impose taxes.“If policymakers are to cover the true cost of livestock epidemics like avian flu and human epidemics like obesity, diabetes and cancer, while also tackling the twin challenges of climate change and antibiotic resistance, then a shift from subsidization to taxation of the meat industry looks inevitable,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative that produced the report.For much of the last century, it seemed the world was heading full steam toward ever-increasing amounts of meat consumption. Recent shifts in consumption patterns, the rise of alternatives and the likelihood of tougher regulation of the meat sector have now given real impetus to turn the 21st century into a plant-based century.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

Globally, one-third of the calories produced by the world’s crops are used for animal feed, but only 12 percent of those feed calories contribute to the human diet, in the form of meat and other animal products.It is these types of planetary costs, as well as potential human health risks such as antibiotic use in livestock operations, that have prompted calls for meat products to be taxed and the ”true costs” of meat production to be accounted for.“Nearly all other carcinogens are regulated, so why not meat?” asks Marco Springmann, a researcher into sustainability and public health at the University of Oxford. “I think the evidence of the environmental and health consequences of meat shows there is a good, clear case for taxation.”The idea of a tax on meat has already been floated in Germany this year, with officials in the country saying it could generate the equivalent of $6.1 billion per year in revenue, to be used to cut the tax on other food products.An investor report produced earlier this month stated a tax on meat was now “increasingly probable.” It said meat was already headed down the path followed previously by tobacco, carbon and sugar, with health and environmental effects and financial costs swaying a number of countries to impose taxes.“If policymakers are to cover the true cost of livestock epidemics like avian flu and human epidemics like obesity, diabetes and cancer, while also tackling the twin challenges of climate change and antibiotic resistance, then a shift from subsidization to taxation of the meat industry looks inevitable,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative that produced the report.For much of the last century, it seemed the world was heading full steam toward ever-increasing amounts of meat consumption. Recent shifts in consumption patterns, the rise of alternatives and the likelihood of tougher regulation of the meat sector have now given real impetus to turn the 21st century into a plant-based century.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.

The group also severed ties with David Koller, who co-founded The Young Turks with Uygur and served as Justice Democrats’ treasurer. A 2004 blogpost in which Koller used degrading language about women he and Uygur met on a road-trip surfaced this week as well.“The words and conduct in Mr. Uygur and Mr. Koller’s posts degrade what it means to be a Justice Democrat,” Justice Democrats executive director Saikat Chakrabarti said in a Friday evening statement announcing the board’s decision to demand Uygur and Koller’s resignations. “We do not feel that Mr. Uygur is fit to lead or participate in an organization that truly believes women’s issues and the issues of black and brown people are all of our issues.”The Justice Democrats board reached its decision to call for their departures after hearing Uygur’s “side of the story” and consulting with the political candidates the group has endorsed, Chakrabarti said. The Young Turks did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the past writings.This week, The Wrap unearthed archived blogposts from Uygur’s early days as a pundit and writer in which he repeatedly used objectifying language to describe women.“Obviously, the genes of women are flawed,” Uygur wrote in a 1999 post lamenting the inadequate amount of sex he was having while living in Miami, Florida. “They are poorly designed creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along peaceably and fruitfully.”In a 2002 entry in which Uygur described the “rules of dating,” he specified that “there must be orgasm by the fifth date.” And in a 2003 column, he described drunken revelry at Mardi Gras in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he “kissed over 23 different women, saw and felt countless breasts.”In addition, a 2004 post by Koller described teenage girls that he and Uygur met near a gas station in Pennsylvania as “whores in training, literally looking for boys to pick them up.”Uygur apologized profusely for his past writing, telling The Wrap in an interview that his comments were “really insensitive and ignorant.”“If you read that today, what I wrote 18 years ago, and you’re offended by it, you’re 100 percent right,” the progressive pundit said. “And anyone who is subjected to that material, I apologize to. And I deeply regret having written that stuff when I was a different guy.”Uygur also noted that at the time, he “was still a conservative who thought that stuff was politically incorrect and edgy.“When you read it now, it looks really, honestly, ugly. And it’s very uncomfortable to read,” he added.Koller declined to comment when reached by The Wrap, but Uygur insisted that what Koller wrote had been “over-the-top satire” and that they “did not proposition underage women.”Uygur’s explicit comments about the physique of women in Miami continued through at least 2013, however, when he marveled on Twitter about the city’s “improbable breasts” and “improbable butts.” He also declared Miami women “outrageously, almost unacceptably, hot,” but clarified in a subsequent tweet that the women were “unacceptably hot,” because he was married and they were therefore off-limits to him.Although Uygur and Koller were ousted for their words, rather than their actions, their swift departure from Justice Democrats occurs amid a wave of reckoning with sexual misconduct in the media and politics worlds that has not spared prominent figures on the progressive left.The Young Turks fired reporter Jordan Chariton in November after Chariton was accused of sexual assault by a former employee of his group Truth Against The Machine. Chariton maintains that the sexual encounter was consensual and is suing HuffPost, where an unpaid contributor first lodged the accusation, for $23.5 million. (HuffPost had removed the post after Chariton’s public complaints.)Uygur explained the decision to fire Chariton during a November broadcast on The Young Turks, where he is a co-host of the channel’s live evening show.“Here’s why we did it: to protect the people that work here and to make sure we have professional employment in place,” he said."

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 only prohibits the intentional hunting, capturing or killing of bird species, according to a legal opinion the Interior Department’s solicitor’s office published Friday. Accidental deaths, including those caused by oil rigs, wind turbines and power lines, will no longer violate federal law. “Interpreting the MBTA to apply to incidental or accidental actions hangs the sword of Damocles over a host of otherwise lawful and productive actions, threatening up to six months in jail and a $15,000 penalty for each and every bird injured or killed,” Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch brothers adviser who in May was appointed to the position of principal deputy solicitor, wrote in the 41-page opinion. The opinion replaces one from Jan. 10 in which Hilary Tompkins, the interior solicitor under President Barack Obama, concluded that the 1918 law applied to incidental wounding, killing or trapping of birds. “The prohibitions of the MBTA ... are not limited to hunting, poaching, or any particular factual context; rather, they extend generally to unauthorized take or killing of migratory birds, including take that is incidental to industrial or commercial activities,” she wrote. Heads of industry celebrated the decision announced Friday, while conservation groups condemned it. The decision is “an example of astute governance,” Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, wrote in a statement. He added that it “makes clear that the Migratory Bird Treaty Act should not be used for overzealous enforcement of criminal penalties on those engaging in otherwise lawful activities.” Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, said the change “returns the rule of law and will help prevent the disparate treatment of industries and the politically motivated use the MBTA as a weapon.”But wildlife groups said the decision is just another gift to corporations and will result in increased negligence and bird deaths.David O’Neill, chief conservation officer at the Audubon Society, called the Migratory Bird Treaty Act “one of the most important conservation laws” on the books. “Christmas came early for bird killers,” he said in a statement. “By acting to end industries’ responsibility to avoid millions of gruesome bird deaths per year, the White House is parting ways with more than 100 years of conservation legacy.”The century-old law has protected more than 1,000 species of migratory birds, including eagles, terns, sandpipers and geese. It prohibited anyone from pursuing, hunting, capturing, killing or possessing birds or their parts without proper permits. Misdemeanor violations of the law can result in as many as six months in prison and fines of up to $15,000."

But late Thursday night, the controversial former Texas regulator returned to square one. The Senate sent her nomination back to the White House as part of a deal to close out the legislative session before the holidays. Earlier this week, Democrats mounted a last-minute effort to exclude Hartnett-White from any agreement to table nominations and pick up where they left off in the confirmation process when the Senate reconvenes in January. Trump is now required to re-nominate her, forcing Hartnett-White to start the process over, including a new vote before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. The panel narrowly voted along party lines on Nov. 29 to advance her to the full Senate despite a bruising hearing at which she struggled to answer basic science questions and repeatedly contradicted herself. Videos of her stammered responses went viral. The decision to send her nomination back makes Hartnett-White the second major environmental pick to crater this month. Less than two weeks ago, Michael Dourson, Trump’s pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical safety division, withdrew his name from consideration after two Republican senators signaled they planned to vote against his confirmation. Democrats and environmentalists adamantly opposed Dourson, a researcher whose work often bolstered the safety claims of the tobacco companies and chemical manufacturers that paid him.“While we have been able to make progress in recent weeks on several qualified and reasonable environmental nominees, others, like Kathleen Hartnett White and Michael Dourson, have proven far too extreme to hold such important positions or be confirmed by the Senate,” Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who led the charge against Hartnett-White, said in a statement late Thursday.“I am pleased that Ms. White’s nomination has been returned to the White House,” he added, “and I am hopeful that President Trump will seize on the opportunity to start the new year and the new session of Congress off on the right foot by nominating a new and better qualified candidate to lead this consequential office.”The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Friday morning.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), one of the Senate’s foremost climate hawks, called Hartnett-White’s nomination “a failed experiment,” noting that Democrats found evidence that she plagiarized her written responses to questions ahead of the confirmation hearing. “Ms. White didn’t know basic science,” Whitehouse told HuffPost in an email on Friday. “She gave some of the most embarrassing hearing testimony I’ve ever seen.” Hartnett-White defended carbon dioxide, one of the chief causes of man-made global warming, as a “harmless trace gas” and “plant food,” compared Pope Francis’ public calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the Catholic Church’s arrest of Galileo for heresy in 1633, and derided the shift to renewable energy as “green folly” and “a false hope.” Her one-term tenure as Texas Commission on Environmental Quality chair was marked by her decision to greenlight a new coal-fired plant over the objections of 24 Dallas-area cities and counties. Last month, more than 300 scientists signed a letter demanding the Senate reject her on the grounds that “one thing more dangerous than climate change is lying.”“Kathleen Hartnett-White was laughably unqualified, even for Trump,” Alyssa Roberts, a spokeswoman for the League of Conservation Voters, told HuffPost by phone on Friday. “She clearly didn’t have enough support in the Senate and Trump should reconsider his approach and nominate someone who will prioritize protecting clear air and water instead of a fringe anti-science zealot.”  No Republicans publicly opposed Hartnett-White. But her history of taking extreme stances to defend polluters could give lawmakers some pause if she is re-nominated.She railed against Republicans for failing to campaign on the idea that the nation has “almost no real environmental problems.” “What you never hear and regrettably not even from our side is there is no environmental crisis,” she said in 2011 at an Americans for Prosperity conference titled, “The EPA’s Job Crushing Regulatory Assault.”Despite World Health Organization estimates that peg the number of worldwide deaths per year from particles in the air at 3 million, she said “people do not die from particulate matter levels.”An ardent coal advocate who credited the fuel with abolishing slavery, Hartnett-White attacked the EPA’s rules to limit mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants.For Republicans like Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who have fought to clean up mercury contamination, that could raise concerns. Neither lawmaker returned HuffPost’s requests for comment on Tuesday.This story was updated to include comment from Whitehouse. "

The motive for the shootings is unknown, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.A woman was struck by a bullet when she was driving on Dec. 1 in rural Fresno County near the town of Kerman, less than 200 miles (322 km) southeast of San Francisco.Her injuries were not life-threatening.In the other nine shootings, which occurred between Nov. 27 and Dec. 17, cars were struck by gunfire but no one was wounded, authorities said. Most of the shootings were in Fresno County, just outside Kerman with its population of 15,000 people.The drivers of those cars said they heard a bang, as another vehicle passed by, according to the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office.Investigators are not sure if a single suspect is behind the attacks, or if others may be involved, said Fresno County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Tony Botti.But Mims, speaking in general terms, addressed a single suspect during her remarks at the news conference.“To the suspect, this is a cowardly act and we are working very hard to find you,” Mims said. “We will hold you responsible.”Authorities believe the victims were randomly chosen.A number of communities in the United States have dealt with random shootings on roadways over the years.In 2015, 11 vehicles were struck by gunfire and a teenager was lightly wounded, in a series of shootings in the Phoenix area. A landscaper was arrested and charged later that year in connection with the attacks, but defense attorneys called into question ballistics evidence used to charge him.A judge in 2016 tossed out charges against the landscaper after prosecutors asked for them to be withdrawn."

Paxton issued a call in November for more parishioners to carry guns into churches, in the wake of a deadly mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Paxton followed up on Thursday by releasing a legal opinion that clarified how current Texas law stands on the issue. Paxton said that unless churches explicitly declare their buildings to be gun-free zones, licensed handgun owners can assume they’ll be able to bring weapons inside. “Unless a church provides effective oral or written notice prohibiting the carrying of handguns on its property, a license holder may carry a handgun onto the premises of church property as the law allows,” Paxton wrote in his opinion.This means churches are held to the same standard as most other private entities in Texas, in that church leaders have the ability to decide gun policies for their congregations.If a church conducts services in a rental property that is not its own, Paxton said, it should consult with the property’s owners to determine gun policies.The legal opinion also asserts that churches don’t have to pay an annual license fee typically required by private institutions that want to maintain a volunteer security team. Texas law already allows churches to form these teams without having members go through state background checks and training. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who serves as president of Texas’ Senate, requested an expedited opinion on Dec. 1. Opinions from attorneys general that interpret existing law carry significant legal weight in Texas.Ed Scruggs, vice chairman of the advocacy group Texas Gun Sense, told HuffPost that guns have been allowed in Texas churches for some time. Some congregations have allowed or even encouraged parishioners to carry firearms. Others have handled the issue more quietly to avoid offending some members.For churches that want to keep guns out, Paxton’s opinion puts the burden on them to put up signage declaring their policies. Texas law has very specific regulations about how the signs should be formatted.“The sign regulations are rather onerous - requiring a Spanish translation and a legal description of the statute,” Scruggs told HuffPost in an email. “A sign meeting these standards can be almost three foot tall and is often printed professionally. The signs must be clearly visible at each entrance, which can be a burden to some older churches with historic architecture or multiple entrances.”Scruggs was also concerned about the law that exempts churches from having to follow state standards in training and selecting their security guards.“On a certain level, it is unfortunate these concerns have become a concern for church goers, but it’s another example of how the state has more often than not taken the view that public safety is more of a personal choice than a public responsibility or preventive measure,” he said. Paxton’s opinion is part of Texas’ response to the Nov. 5 mass shooting at Sutherland Springs’ First Baptist Church that claimed 26 lives. During the attack, gunman Devin Patrick Kelley used a Ruger AR-556 rifle to methodically shoot victims in the head as they were attending a Sunday morning church service. When Kelley exited the church, he was shot twice by Stephen Willeford, a neighbor who had heard gunshots coming from inside the parish building.Kelley later shot himself after crashing into a ditch.Willeford, a shooting instructor certified by the National Rifle Association, has been hailed as a hero by conservative supporters of gun rights. He’s been cited as an example of a “good guy with a gun” who helped stop a shooter with bad intentions.On Thursday, Willeford’s actions again came into the spotlight. In a statement thanking Paxton for the legal opinion, Patrick, the lieutenant governor, wrote that “everyone in the state was very thankful for the brave Texan who stopped the attack through the exercise of his Second Amendment rights.”Although gun advocates argue that widespread gun ownership leads to less crime, several studies have shown that in home settings, at least, greater numbers of guns lead to a greater risk of homicide and suicide.In addition, it’s common for perpetrators of mass shootings to have a history of abusing women. (Kelley had a domestic violence conviction that should have prevented him from being able to purchase a firearm.)Firearms are responsible for the majority of domestic violence deaths. And research shows that having a handgun at home doesn’t protect women from becoming victims of domestic violence. Texas has one of the highest female homicide rates in the country. Scruggs said he’s not surprised about Paxton’s legal opinion on guns in churches. “Our state officials rarely pass on an opportunity to support a perceived expansion of gun rights,” he wrote. “We urge Texans - both armed and unarmed - to become more educated on their responsibilities and rights under the law.”"

In his remarks, the onetime lawmaker from Michigan referred to refugees as “invaders,” said Muslim migrants are “the next wave of jihadists in Europe,” and denounced the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a leading Muslim civil rights organization, as a “front organization for Hamas.”Hoekstra warned of a “stealth jihad” taking place in the United States and Europe, and claimed that the Netherlands, his native country, was in a state of “chaos” due to the migration of Muslims.“There are cars being burned. There are politicians that are being burned ... and yes, there are no-go zones in the Netherlands,” Hoekstra said.Footage of the 2015 address is available on Vimeo.Zwart was questioning the new ambassador about those comments, specifically his claim that there are “no-go zones” in the Netherlands. Hoekstra categorically denied that he ever made those remarks.“I didn’t say that. That is actually an incorrect statement. We would call it fake news,” he said. “I never said that.”The video of the interview then cut to a clip of Hoekstra making the exact comments he had just denied. When Zwart again pressed the ambassador, saying, “You call it fake news,” Hoekstra jumped in to deny that he had even said that.“I didn’t call that fake news,” Hoekstra claimed. “I didn’t use the words today. I didn’t think I did.”At that point, Zwart looked back at the camera, registering his own confusion. Hoekstra was born in Groningen in the Netherlands in 1953 and immigrated to the United States with his family at age 3. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1993 to 2011. When President Donald Trump announced Hoekstra’s appointment as ambassador to his country of origin, The Washington Post reported, a Dutch newspaper said the president was putting “a Dutchman in the Netherlands — but it is a Dutchman from the Netherlands of the ’50s.”"

72,EDUCATION,Newly Reelected New York City Mayor Decides His School Renewal Plan Failed But Still Claims Success,"Alan Singer, ContributorSocial studies educator, Hofstra University, my opinions, of c...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newly-reelected-new-york-city-mayor-decides-his-school_us_5a3c7557e4b0d86c803c7095,"The DOE, Farina and de Blasio also fail to explain a number of things about the new program.",2017-12-22,<p> Carmen Fariña (l) and Bill de Blasio thinking deep thoughts.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3c75631d00002a004d2f5e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2013, Bill de Blasio was elected mayor of New York City on a program that included a promise to abandon his predecessor’s policy of closing “struggling” schools. Instead of closure, a “Renewal” approach would improve school performance through heavy investment of money and support. Last month de Blasio was reelected Mayor with the same promise. This month his school chancellor, Carmen Fariña, announced the Department of Education would close 14 schools and mysteriously reorganize six others.The schools will be closed or transformed because of a combination of low standardized test scores, enrollment, graduation rates, and attendance, chronic absenteeism, and poor classroom instruction and school leadership. DOE officials insist the school closings are actually part of the initial Renewal School program.Because of his initial promises, de Blasio combined the school-closing announcement with a declaration of “success” – 21 RISE schools will graduate out of the Renewal program. Yet despite genuine statistical improvement at these schools, their students continue to perform significantly below city averages on standardized test scores. Fariña apparently had enough school “success” and two days later announced she was retiring.The DOE promises it will work with each student impacted by the changes to ensure they can attend a higher-performing school next school year, but why would anyone believe their educational promises? The DOE, Farina and de Blasio also fail to explain a number of things about the new program.(1) How will closing schools make things better?Thirty-six percent of the students at the Coalition School for Social Change in East Harlem are students with disabilities; almost all are Black of Hispanic; and 100 percent are from poor families. The dropout rate is at least 25 percent. The school, which opened in 1993, was one of the first experimental small schools created in an earlier wave of school reform. How will transferring these students to nearby struggling, but slightly higher performing schools, significantly improve their lives and education?Brooklyn Collegiate: A College Board School is another 100 percent minority, 100 percent poor family, school, this time on the border of the Crown Heights and Brownsville sections of Brooklyn. About one-fourth of its students have special needs. In November, the New York Times reported that its four-year graduation rate had fallen while it was in the renewal program. Graduation rates also fell at New Explorers High School, High School for Health Careers and Sciences, and Holcombe L. Rucker School of Community, other schools that are being axed. All of these schools were created during earlier school reorganization plans under previous mayoral administrations. How is this “reform” any different?(2) What will be done to help students and their families, other than transferring them to a new building?About one-third of the 1.1 children and teens that attend New York City schools live in poverty. Over one hundred thousand were homeless at some point during the 2016-2017 school year. Ten percent of its registered students live on the street, in cars, in shelters, in abandoned buildings, in public housing double-ups, and in over-crowded deteriorating tenements with people they do not know. They often don’t have basic food, clothing, and health care, or heat in the freezing winter and air-conditioning in the sweltering summer. Over 60 percent are chronically absent from school. Closing schools does nothing to change the conditions of their lives.(3) What will happen to the slightly “higher-performing schools” when these under-performing students enter? Past school closings have led to a cascading of school failure. The best example is “A Train” corridor schools in Queens. Far Rockaway High School was at the southeast terminal of the A train. A two-hour subway ride from Manhattan, drawing students from a community of high-rise public housing and crumbling former beach bungalows, with a large recent immigrant population, students who did not speak English and whose education was interrupted in the former country, Far Rockaway was zoned for failure. It stopped accepting students in 2008 and closed in 2011.When Far Rockaway closed, students from the area were sent a short subway ride away to nearby Beach Channel High School. When Beach Channel failed, students now traveled along the “A train” corridor to John Adams and Richmond Hill. Soon those schools were in trouble as well.There is no question that the schools slated for closing fail children. But at some point New York City, state, and national education officials must be forced to recognize that reshuffling the deck is not school reform or a program to improve the lives of students and their families.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "

While nearly all the employees surveyed said they’re proud to work at the Times, there were a couple of trouble spots. A glaring one: career development. Many staffers said they weren’t sure what they needed to do to continue to move upward at the Times.The paper’s editors copped to the problem at two all-hands meetings held the day before the Thrush announcement.For women at the paper, the two developments bundled together sent a demoralizing message. “They announce this big failure in career development,” said a female reporter who declined to be named because she didn’t want to jeopardize her job, “and then the first thing they do is protect Glenn Thrush.”The decision to retain the 50-year-old White House reporter came after a lengthy internal investigation into the allegations of sexual misconduct, first detailed last month by Vox.com’s editorial director. Times executive editor Dean Baquet announced in a statement Wednesday that Thrush would not be fired, though it allowed that he had “behaved in ways that we do not condone.” Instead, he’ll be reassigned to a new beat once his suspension ends next month.The announcement set off a wave of indignation among Times observers, who thought it sent a message that the paper condones sexual misconduct and isn’t concerned about the safety of its female employees. But among the female Times employees who spoke to HuffPost, the takeaway was less about the dangers of sexual misbehavior and more about who actually matters at the paper.“We’re not really sure what the message is here,” one woman told HuffPost. “I feel really conflicted.” Another lamented that while the Times took careful steps to nurture and protect its star male reporter, there were loads of women struggling to get help with flat-lining careers inside the newsroom. For her, the Thrush decision was another painful reminder of how the Times is failing its female reporters.“Every woman who works at the Times has to go to work tomorrow knowing that that’s the decision they made,” Kate Harding, who hosts the Feminasty podcast, tweeted Wednesday. “That’s whose career matters. That’s who they’ll go the extra mile for.”A female reporter at the Times said she saw that tweet and a lightbulb went off.“Women here feel like they’re being overlooked,” she said. And she’s not alone in feeling that way ― a fact the Times itself acknowledged in one of the slides in the survey presentation, which read: “On career development, staff don’t have a clear sense of their goals or available resources.” (The Times did not sort results by gender.)The Times also noted that 34 percent of those surveyed marked “unfavorable” when asked if they had discussed career objectives with a manager over the last 12 months. Only 42 percent of respondents said they understood what to do to advance their career at the paper. Sixty-three percent of employees responded to the survey.The survey also showed that staffers think the Times is failing to adequately communicate with employees and make swift decisions.The Times says the findings demonstrate that the paper is doing great. “The survey shows that an overwhelming majority of our employees feel highly engaged and deeply connected to the mission of the Times,” Carolyn Ryan, assistant managing editor, told HuffPost in an emailed statement. “Those numbers would be the envy of any company in any industry.”“They also show that employees want to build their careers here, and they want better guidance and training to do so,” she said, adding they want to create “pathways” for growth. And because of the Times’ expansion into multimedia like podcasts and video, there are more ways to advance than ever before.Baquet said in his statement that he believed Thrush’s punishment ― which is how the paper views its decision ― was appropriate, and concluded by affirming the paper’s belief in a respectful work environment. “The Times is committed not only to our leading coverage of this issue,” he wrote. “But also to ensuring that we provide a working environment where all of our colleagues feel respected, safe and supported.”While there are certainly superstar women at the Times — among them Donald Trump whisperer Maggie Haberman, who frequently collaborated with Thrush, as well as Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who wrote the investigation into Harvey Weinstein — there are others who feel they are being left behind.(In a devastating loss, Janet Elder, a three-decade veteran at the Times, died Wednesday night. She was one of the highest-ranking women on the masthead and by all accounts one of the biggest champions for women in the newsroom.)“Dean Baquet has no idea what I’m capable of,” the second female reporter said, adding that there are lot of women in similar positions. “They’re wasting talent and resources,” she said.The reporter clarified that she didn’t think Thrush deserved to be fired, and other staffers echoed that opinion. “Seems absolutely fair to me,” a third female staffer told HuffPost about keeping Thrush on. “The investigation was very thorough and conducted by a female lawyer.” (Charlotte Behrendt, a lawyer in the newsroom, led the investigation, according to the Times.)Taking Thrush off the White House beat makes sense, too, she said. “Anyone who covers Trump has to be extra-squeaky clean.” As to whether or not women at the Times are now in danger of being harassed by Thrush, she said: “If women at the Times had been harassed by him I’ve no doubt they would’ve spoken up.” She added, “The Times is a pretty sexless place. There’s no flirting.”The third staffer said the problem with senior leadership ignoring staffers’ career development is less about gender and more about a general obsession with stardom, which leads others to languish at the paper. “I am definitely in a situation where I feel totally neglected and deprived in a way that affects me more than the sexual stuff,” she said. She pointed to Thrush. The Times brought him in from Politico, where he was already an established name. “There were probably 10 reporters internally who wanted the job of White House correspondent and would’ve done a great job,” she said, “but they had to have the name.”The Times is well aware of its problems with newsroom diversity. Sixty-one percent of bylines in the front section of the paper are still male, according to the Women’s Media Center. Last December, Liz Spayd, then public editor at the Times, wrote that interviews with staffers across the newsroom left her with the impression that there was “a level of frustration bordering on anger [regarding the newsroom’s lack of diversity] that would be institutionally reckless not to address.”Over the past year, at least seven women of color have left the paper, including LaSharah Bunting, who went to the Knight Foundation; Rachel Swarns, who went to New York University; book critic Michiko Kakutani, who retired; and Catherine Saint Louis. Last year, masthead editor Lydia Polgreen left the paper to become the editor-in-chief of HuffPost. At a recent all-hands meeting, Baquet addressed the issue frankly, one source at the Times said. So did New York Times Company CEO Mark Thompson, publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. and Ellen C. Shultz, executive vice president of talent and inclusion, in a letter sent out last week. “Employees throughout the organization told us that we have to do more as a company to build a workplace that feels fair, diverse and inclusive to all,” they wrote. “This is an area the leadership is actively focusing on and we will share a specific action plan in the first few months of 2018.”While 95 percent of survey respondents said they were proud to work for the Times, 13 percent said it was likely they would leave the paper for another job in the next 12 months, up 8 percentage points from 2015, according to one of the company’s slides. Among some women, that feeling appears to have intensified this week. “Are women welcome here?” asked a female staffer. “Is anything going to change? Should I be looking somewhere else? I don’t know. Those are definitely questions that I’m asking myself.”Here’s the letter that was sent out internally to Times staffers:Dear Colleagues,"
75,POLITICS,Scott Pruitt Lands A Second Fawning Conservative Magazine Profile,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-pruitt-national-review-profile_us_5a3d3cb8e4b06d1621b42a1c,"Hell yeah, he’s owning the libs!",2017-12-22,"Scott Pruitt testified on Dec. 7 at the House Energy and Commerce Committee, his first public appearance before Congress since taking office. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a3d40dc1d000027004d3109.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scott Pruitt has scored his second glowing profile in a conservative magazine this month.On Thursday evening, National Review released its latest cover, a stately portrait of the Environmental Protection Agency administrator that declares Pruitt a “man on a mission” who “terrifies the Left.” Pruitt’s primary objectives this year included repealing rules to reduce pollution from power plants, rolling back protections for 117 million Americans’ drinking water, and clearing the way for industry-funded researchers to seize control of the EPA’s science advisory boards. Yet National Review’s story, written by Kevin D. Williamson, paints a rosy picture of Pruitt as a misunderstood environmentalist restoring the concept of “stewardship” to an EPA that has “long been dominated” by “the Left.” “Feed the world and fuel the world,” Pruitt is fond of saying, according to Williamson, who opens the article with an anecdote about Pruitt’s obsessive coffee consumption. (An inadvertent metaphor for fossil fuels?) Pruitt’s approach centers on “making responsible use of our national blessings, including our natural resources,” Williamson writes, in direct contrast with the hard-line conservationists who preach “a lot of Thou shalt and a whole heck of a lot more Thou shalt not.”The article comes one week after The Weekly Standard, another ostensibly highbrow journal of neoconservative thought, published its own profile of Pruitt under the headline “The Man They Love to Hate.”In it, Fred Barnes ― a once-respected Baltimore Sun reporter who has spent the last decade denying climate change and defending the Republican Party’s embrace of white identity politics ― writes admiringly about Pruitt’s agency ignoring requests for basic information from reporters at The New York Times and Politico.  “He’s different from previous EPA bosses, notably in his attitude toward the political class in Washington, including the media. Pruitt is not afraid of them,” Barnes wrote. “His fearlessness shows up in doing things most of Washington frowns on ― or that are politically dangerous. Refusing to pamper the Times and the national press is the least of his offenses.”National Review and The Weekly Standard served as launchpads of the so-called “principled conservative” #NeverTrump movement. Yet the magazines’ enthusiasm for Pruitt seems largely rooted in his tendency to agitate his political foes, the same habit that so endears Trump to his base, according to conservative talk radio host and Never-Trumper Charles Sykes.  “Conservatives will care less about governing and more about scoring ‘wins’ — and inflicting losses on the left — no matter how hollow the victories or flawed the policies,” Sykes wrote in May in a New York Times op-ed titled “If Liberals Hate Him, Then Trump Must Be Doing Something Right.” “Ultimately, though, this will end badly because it is a moral and intellectual dead end, and very likely a political one as well.”EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox declined to comment. The shared tone of the National Review and Weekly Standard profiles marks a victory of sorts for the EPA’s press office. During his first few months in office, Pruitt largely avoided the press, save for interviews with right-wing outlets like Breitbart and an infamous CNBC appearance where he disputed carbon dioxide’s role in warming the planet. In October, Pruitt began making the rounds to promote an alternative vision of his nascent legacy, not as an industry-friendly despoiler of public health safeguards, but as a principled policeman of polluters. “I don’t spend any time with polluters,” he told Time Magazine in his first mainstream media interview in months. “I prosecute polluters.”Never mind that Pruitt spent vastly more time with oil and coal executives than with environmental advocates during his first few months in office. Nor that the Trump administration’s Justice Department, which prosecutes at the EPA’s recommendation, collected 60 percent less in civil penalties from polluters than the past three administrations combined over the same period, according to an analysis released in August by the Environmental Integrity Project.For Pruitt, management of the EPA’s core duties may come second to the political optics his decisions project. Pruitt has long been rumored to be eyeing a run for Senate when his octogenarian ideological mentor Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) retires. In August, the EPA’s general inspector opened an investigation into Pruitt’s use of agency funds to travel back to Oklahoma, his home state ― trips that many speculate could be laying the groundwork for a campaign, according to Politico. His ambitions could include the Oklahoma governor’s mansion, or, as E&E News wrote in September, the White House.“Very few people think he’s going to serve out the four years there [at EPA], let’s put it that way,” one energy industry lobbyist told the environmental newswire. “You have to always factor in, ‘How long is Scott Pruitt going to stay there?’ No one knows that answer.” "

She also apologized for the announcement’s timing, saying she had hoped to save the news for the new year.“I am sorry only to have to share this news with you as we celebrate the holidays. I had hoped to make this announcement after the first of the year,” Vargas wrote in the memo, shared with HuffPost.The 55-year-old first joined ABC News in 1996 as a newsreader on “Good Morning America.” In a memo to staff on Friday, ABC News President James Goldston said Vargas was leaving “to pursue new ventures.”In his letter, Goldston noted that Vargas is the second woman to have served as an anchor on “20/20.”“She moved into that role ― a daunting assignment to follow in the footsteps of our legendary Barbara Walters ― with true determination to tell the stories from around the globe that explore important issues in depth and tap into significant moments in our culture,” Goldston wrote.The ABC News president went on to highlight Vargas’s many news accomplishments, noting the journalist’s “courage” in sharing her own story regarding a years-long battle with alcohol addiction.“We were most proud of her courage and grace in telling her own story about her struggle with anxiety and alcoholism,” Goldston wrote.Vargas has spoken openly about her addiction to alcohol and her experience with anxiety and panic attacks. Her 2016 memoir, “Between Breaths: A Memoir of Panic and Addiction,” detailed that struggle, which led her to seek out rehabilitation treatment on several occasions and which she said was among the factors that led to her divorce from singer-songwriter Marc Cohn.“Her best-selling memoir has helped so many people by raising awareness about the importance of finding treatment for millions who are still struggling,” Goldston wrote. “She continues to be an inspiration for us all.”Vargas will exit ABC News after finishing out the 40th season of “20/20” in May."

I suddenly just sort of walked in and said somebody’s done something ... and where are all my things? And then just fully sprinted out of the room in blind panic,” he added.Radcliffe hasn’t had much time to catch his breath lately. In addition to rushing to our call, the actor seems to be constantly taking on new projects, like starring in the upcoming TBS series “Miracle Workers” along with Steve Buscemi, which he called a career highlight. He’s also producing “Circus Kid,” a documentary now streaming on AMC Network’s video service, Sundance Now, which tells the real-life, unique and heartbreaking story of a kid who grew up in a circus.That circus kid was actually actor Lorenzo Pisoni. Radcliffe told us he and Pisoni struck up a friendship while the pair were in “Equus” together on Broadway.“I can probably tell this story now because at the time my parents didn’t know that I smoked, but they do now,” he said. “At the time when I was in theater, I would sneak up to Lorenzo’s room and ask if I could jump out on his fire escape to smoke. Again, maybe I shouldn’t be saying this.”Pisoni wasn’t smoking, Radcliffe clarified. “He was literally like, ‘Yeah, fine, you can use my fire escape.’ I had had my first cigarette before that, but I won’t say when. I will spare my parents’ retroactive disapproval.”After Radcliffe learned Pisoni grew up in the circus, the former “Harry Potter” actor couldn’t stop pestering his co-star about it. Radcliffe eventually attended an early version of Pisoni’s show, “Humor Abuse,” in which he told the story of his childhood. That sparked the idea behind ― and eventually led to the creation of ― “Circus Kid.”“He’s had this incredible life, but he’s incredibly grounded and has a level of self-awareness that is not always common in people that kind of know they’ve had extraordinary lives,” Radcliffe said.And as far as growing up in a circus goes, he can relate.Radcliffe recalled a moment he and Pisoni were onstage for “Equus” during a preshow check and both of them were above a grate where a smoke machine was being tested. “Now, I would assume that to most people the smell of onstage smoke would not be pleasant, but this puff of smoke came up and both me and Lorenzo went, like literally in sync, looked at each other, and went that is the smell of my childhood,” he said.To Radcliffe and Pisoni, the smoke was “weirdly nostalgic,” though for different reasons.“Lorenzo was backing trucks up and parking like massive 18-wheelers when he was 12, 13 years old. I wasn’t doing that, but I was doing other weird shit,” said Radcliffe. “I think there is a lot of common ground there, and I think we both recognize that, yeah, our childhoods are weird, but we also wouldn’t have had them any other way. We loved them and they made us the people that we are.”Indeed, “Circus Kid” depicts some difficult and heartbreaking moments from Pisoni’s life. And Radcliffe has likely had his own share. As “Harry Potter” casting director Janet Hirshenson told me, he got the title role because other contenders were “not going to have the balls” for it. “I don’t know what that means,” Radcliffe admitted, reflecting on Hirshenson’s words. “I’m really grateful for [them],” he added. “I like to think I sort of kept that attitude for my career even if I didn’t know I had it when I was 10.”The actor has his own explanation for why he was right for “Harry Potter.”“The thing that I will always say about myself is I was not the most gifted child actor. When I look at other young actors, like when I look at the kids on ‘Stranger Things’ or shows like that, I’m just like, ‘Holy! My god! How are you doing that?’ It’s amazing,” he said. “The thing I think I really was good at, and the thing I had, which was a huge advantage for me, was I just loved it.”“I loved being on set. I was good at being on set,” he continued. “I loved learning how to be helpful. The greatest thing about being on set is you get to be part of a team. That’s the most special thing about it, and you get to feel like with everyone else you are making this thing together, and I loved that feeling straight away. I think that was definitely what made me a great fit for those films.”“Circus Kid” is streaming on AMC Network’s Sundance Now."
