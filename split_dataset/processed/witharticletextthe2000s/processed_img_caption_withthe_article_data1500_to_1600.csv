Jeff Davis, addressing a Pentagon news conference, said he believed dozens of al Qaeda fighters were killed in the Thursday strike by manned and unmanned U.S. aircraft on an al Qaeda meeting place in the village of al-Jina, Aleppo.Davis said the U.S. military had not yet seen any credible allegations of civilian casualties, including on social media.“The strike targeted a building in al-Jinah, Syria, a town approximately 28 km southwest of the city of Aleppo, and within the province of Aleppo,” Maj. Josh Jacques, a spokesman for CENTCOM, told The Huffington Post. “This is relatively close to the border between Idlib province and Aleppo province.”Jacques added that the building targeted was across the street from the mosque in question.The Pentagon said it would soon release to the public the image it showed to reporters: a black-and-white aerial image showing the mosque still standing across the street from a building that had been reduced to rubble by the strike.On Friday, Tara Copp, Pentagon correspondent for Stars and Stripes, tweeted an image she said the Department of Defense had provided of its targets.Next to the charred plot where the al Qaeda militants had met was another building, which was also still intact.“We struck a meeting of senior al Qaeda terrorists. Some of these were likely high value individuals. We’re currently assessing that,” Davis said.Davis was unable to say what the purpose was of the building that was destroyed, beyond serving as a meeting place for al Qaeda.It is unclear how long after the strike the image was taken, and Reuters was unable to independently verify whether the mosque may have suffered any structural damage from the blast that could be difficult to see from an aerial image.Ahrar al-Sham, a powerful Syrian rebel group, on Friday said the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State was behind a deadly mosque attack near Syria’s Aleppo that a war monitor said killed dozens of people.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said jets hit around a mosque in al-Jina village near Atarib in the western part of Aleppo province, a few miles (km) from Idlib province on Thursday, killing at least 46 people, mostly civilians.The United States has been leading a coalition in an air campaign against Islamic State while also carrying out air strikes against al Qaeda in Syria, which it says sought to take advantage of the chaos from Syria’s civil war to reconstitute itself in ungoverned towns.Syrian military and Russian jets have also carried out numerous air strikes against targets in Idlib and western parts of Aleppo province, which are held by rebels seeking to oust President Basharal-Assad.The Huffington Post contributed reporting to this article."

3,POLITICS,Trump Had Stopped Focusing On Claim Obama Wiretapped Him -- Till A German Reporter Asked About It,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-merkel-news-conference_us_58cc1ec7e4b00705db4f3f91,The president revived the claim in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.,2017-03-17,"President Donald Trump holds a joint press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the East Room of the White House on Friday in Washington. The two leaders discussed strengthening NATO, fighting the Islamic State group, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and held a roundtable discussion with German business leaders during their first face-to-face meeting.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cc4866140000880607023e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s prepared remarks at Friday’s joint appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel focused on how trade deals had to be fairer and how countries like hers had to spend more on their NATO obligations.It took a single question from a German reporter to undo that message and bring it right back to the issue the White House has been working to escape for two weeks: Trump’s unfounded tweet alleging former President Barack Obama had wiretapped him at his New York skyscraper.What, the German reporter wanted to know, did Trump think now that his claim had been proven false, and did Trump ever regret sending a tweet?“Very seldom. Very seldom,” Trump said. “We have a tremendous group of people that listen and I can get around the media when the media doesn’t tell the truth, so I like that.”“As far as wiretapping, I guess by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps,” Trump said, turning to Merkel beside him.Merkel responded with a shocked expression but said nothing.If anything, Trump managed to exacerbate the situation, reviving the diplomatic headache created when it was revealed in 2013 that U.S. intelligence had eavesdropped on Merkel’s cell phone, as well as the unfounded assertion that Obama had outsourced the Trump Tower surveillance to British intelligence. The British government denied the claim Friday.Trump said he was citing “a very talented lawyer on Fox” ― presumably Fox contributor Andrew Napolitano: “So you shouldn’t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. OK?”During the campaign, Merkel was among the foreign leaders Trump loved to bash most. He accused her of “ruining” Germany, primarily, in his view, with her willingness to accept Syrian refugees. The criticism intensified after she beat him out for Time’s “person of the year” in 2015. (Trump won the honor in 2016, after winning the presidency.) This January, Trump even blamed an attack in a Berlin Christmas market by a Tunisian on Merkel’s acceptance of “all these illegals.”For her part, Merkel has not been shy in standing up to Trump. In a phone call with him shortly after he signed the first version of his ban on travelers from a handful of majority-Muslim nations in late January, her spokesman said she had explained to him the responsibility of accepting war refugees under international treaties.And on Friday, Merkel said Germany had increased its defense spending by 8 percent in the past year, and planned to increase it again. What’s more, she said, national security went beyond defense spending, and rightfully included money spent to help people in poor and war-torn countries build better lives. “It’s also promoting development assistance, but it’s also helping missions in Africa, for example, in trying to stand up for their own safety and security,” Merkel said through a translator.The two have divergent views on other issues, as well. Merkel supports work to reverse human-caused climate change. Trump has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese and has eliminated programs to stop it from his proposed budget. She is an advocate of free trade, while Trump has promised to tear up trade deals.Merkel will play host to Trump this summer, at the G-20 summit of the world’s major economies in Hamburg."
4,POLITICS,This Conservative Senator Is Trying To Woo Progressives With Bills He Says Restrict Trump,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oklahoma-senator-james-lankford-limit-trump_us_58caf214e4b0be71dcf2dee2,James Lankford said Democrats should back his bills because they'll keep the president's agency heads in check.,2017-03-17,Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) looks for bipartisan support for his package of bills on the regulatory process.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cb0f721d0000f42c7cede8.jpeg?ops=crop_0_0_4518_3686%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A Republican senator is trying to pitch progressive Democrats on a package of bills that he says will limit President Donald Trump’s powers.No, it’s not a joke.Conservative Sen. James Lankford, who was elected two years ago, wants progressives to give his bills a chance, arguing they aren’t on the “far-right edge” but are admittedly not far left either. Instead, he figures, they’re the kind of bills Washington should be working on at a time when Republicans and Democrats couldn’t be further apart. The Oklahoma Republican introduced his four-bill package on reforming the regulatory process last week. The goal, he said in an interview, is not to take anything away from the regulatory process but to find some common ground and improve it. One of the bills, co-sponsored by moderate Democrat Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), would require an agency to post an “advanced notice of proposed rulemaking” for any major regulation at least 90 days before it publishes a notice that it intends to change, repeal or craft a rule (essentially adding a new layer to the process). Another bill ― the one Lankford is really trying to sell liberals on ― requires science-based decision-making at agencies. The other two would require an agency to provide a simply worded 100-word summary when giving notice of a proposed rule, and would clamp down on guidance documents, which are meant to interpret regulations. “Regardless of who is president, we should have a good, reasonable process ― regardless of who is running what agency,” Lankford said. “My guess is I may have some colleagues that are more left-leaning that will now look at the way that regulation is done and say, ‘I want to make sure President Trump follows the rules.’” Even if taken at face value, the package, to many progressives, would appear to be a deregulatory one, but Lankford hopes that after multiple conversations with his colleagues they will come around.The sell? When Democrats say they are concerned one of Trump’s agency heads is going to undo Obama-era regulations, or completely reshape or dismantle an agency, Lankford points to his bills as an answer, by adding transparency and more opportunities for people (especially opponents) to weigh in on the process.Concerns surrounding new Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt have already come up among Democrats. Last week Pruitt said he didn’t believe the science was sound on whether carbon dioxide contributes to global warming. (The overwhelming majority of scientists agree that it does.)Lankford knows Democrats aren’t happy with Pruitt, and so he wants them to look at his “Better Evaluation of Science and Technology Act,” which would tell agencies to use the best available science and peer-reviewed science as a way to keep Pruitt in check. “If you’re concerned about science, let’s talk about the BEST bill that I have that deals with science and how do you define it, making sure every agency has to follow it,” Lankford said, recalling one exchange he had with a Democratic senator recently. “If there’s concern, to say, EPA is going to ignore science now, then we should be able to work together to figure how we’re going to do good science regardless of who is there.”But Lankford doesn’t share his Democratic colleagues’ concerns about Pruitt, a fellow Oklahoman and friend. That’s something that isn’t lost on the very progressives he’s trying to woo. Amit Narang of the Public Citizen watchdog group, said, “It’s not very plausible to me that the intent of this bill is to hold the EPA head accountable, and I worry some of the details will allow for the same type of strategic questioning of consensus science that was very effective for the tobacco industry for a long time. We’d be very happy for Sen. Lankford to make clear to EPA head Pruitt that his most recent statements of CO₂ not playing a role in climate change are overwhelmingly disputed by scientists.”Narang, who has testified before Lankford in the Senate, admitted that, though he isn’t a fan of Lankford’s science bill, the one adding a layer to the regulatory process by requiring advanced notice might be something Public Citizen and progressives in general could get behind. “To his credit, he does have some legislation in here that could make rule repeals go a little bit slower,” Narang said. “There is a possibility in the short-term a couple of these could make it slightly harder for agencies to get rid of rules under Obama. I will concede that.”But Narang added that when the next administration comes in, it would also make it more difficult to accomplish an agenda a new president’s team would support.Yogin Kothari, Washington representative of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Lankford’s bills “in theory sound nice” but in reality are “misleading.”“The goal seems to be to really shut down how science-based decisions are made at agencies,” Kothari said. “The way I read the language is there’s a lot of attachment points where I could see well-funded litigants arguing something is amiss.”Kothari added that he doesn’t think any progressives would back the package. “Just because it might slow down something for the next two to four years doesn’t mean it’s good policy,” Kothari said. “We’re not looking at just the next two to four years. Good policy doesn’t go by a political calendar.”Still, Lankford didn’t seem deterred from testing the waters with liberals. “Some of my Republican colleagues want to go a lot farther with regulatory reform. I get that,” he said. “Some of my Democratic colleagues will say I don’t want to limit any agency from doing any action it already takes too long to do.”But he thinks Congress has taken too much of a backseat, telling agencies to “make the decision and Congress is off the hook.” “Where there are things that need to be done, we’ve got to have Congress re-engaged,” he said.Lankford also attempted to make the case that Democrats should be relieved Republicans are undoing certain regulations, such as an Education Department requirement that federally funded teacher preparation programs be evaluated on how well students performed.“For your readers... if you’re going to have Betsy DeVos make all the decisions about education, about how teachers are evaluated, about how students are evaluated and how schools are evaluated, then leave that regulation in place,” Lankford argued, referring to Trump’s controversial education secretary.A lot of Lankford’s motivation also comes from the widening divide between Republicans and Democrats. “If you bring polarizing ideas out, it enforces more polarization. If you bring ideas out and say this is a common-ground issue and that regardless of who’s in the White House this is an issue that needs to be dealt with, i think it starts kind of pushing us back together.”Whether that’s possible under Trump ― whose actions and policies make Narang and Kothari skeptical ― remains to be seen.

5,POLITICS,White House Shares Parody Article As Real News In Daily Email Briefing,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-1600-daily-parody-article-budget_us_58cc18efe4b0be71dcf480c1,"""Trump’s budget makes perfect sense and will fix America, and I will tell you why,"" the headline reads.",2017-03-17,"A screengrab of Friday's ""1600 Daily"" shows the link, highlighted in red.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cc2d5f1d00001d107cf06b.jpeg?ops=crop_175_512_1005_329%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday, as part of its regular “1600 Daily” email briefing, The White House included a roundup of links of news friendly to President Donald Trump’s administration, as it regularly does.First on the list was a Washington Post article titled, “Trump’s budget makes perfect sense and will fix America, and I will tell you why.”If that headline sounds suspiciously servile to you, there’s a good reason why: It’s satire.The column, written by Washington Post humorist Alexandra Petri, employs a clearly satirical tone in an attempt to justify President Trump’s proposed budget cuts to various departments.“We don’t need to fund historic sites,” one section reads. “Those parks have sassed the administration enough and they must get what is coming to them.”So either the Trump administration didn’t bother reading the actual article itself, or, even more troubling, read it but failed to distinguish it as parody.Which wouldn’t be that surprising, really. In the Trump White House, negative news is automatically dismissed as fake, even if it’s from established organizations. Which means, as a corollary, that positive news must be real, even if it’s fake ― right?Right.Petri regularly dishes out similar satire columns, including “Chris Christie’s meatloaf humiliations” and “Sergey Kislyak, the least memorable man in the world.”Petri, who goes by @petridishes on Twitter, greeted the “news” of her latest work’s inclusion with humor, remarking, “nothing ruins a good story like clicking on it.”After The White House removed the link late Friday afternoon, she added, “aw, really? But i was looking forward to becoming an APPROVED SOURCE of TRUE CORRECT NEWS.”Hey cheer up Trump staffers, you’re in good company: North Korea, Bangladesh, and Iran have all been fooled by satire, too."

And the fact that it was only known through the accounts of anonymous “Seoul officials” via a foreign outlet is noteworthy in and of itself. That’s because Tillerson has taken this trip without the usual accompaniment of the U.S. press corps. It’s a break with tradition, and it introduced a host of complications and potential pitfalls. For example, Americans have no independent confirmation as to whether “fatigue” did in fact play a role in Tillerson’s actions. Indeed, as rumors spread Friday about Tillerson’s condition, The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, who served as the paper’s chief State Department reporter for nearly a decade, wrote that a foreign ministry, South Korea, was able to get out its own “spin” because the State Department “failed to bring US reporters on [its] plane.” Previous administrations would typically make room for at least a “pool” reporter to provide timely and newsworthy dispatches ― everything from the secretary’s remarks to local color ― for the larger press corps to use when space was at a premium. Tillerson didn’t do that.Instead, he and the State Department invited one reporter, who won’t provide “pool” coverage but will instead enjoy exclusive access to the secretary for her own outlet. In an unprecedented and controversial move, the State Department decided only to take reporter Erin McPike from the Independent Journal Review, a four-year-old conservative news site. It’s a media outlet, as press secretary Mark Toner acknowledged Wednesday, that does not typically cover the State Department and “isn’t steeped in foreign policy.”McPike is a legitimate journalist who has worked at news outlets such as CNN, National Journal and RealClearPolitics. However, she only joined IJR last month, and her main contribution on the State Department beat thus far appears to be a positive story about Tillerson having President Donald Trump’s ear despite a perception that he’d been sidelined. A social media-savvy upstart, IJR is investing in more original reporting and recently landed a big scoop on Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. The site, however, sparked controversy Thursday by publishing a conspiracy theory involving former President Barack Obama, in a now-removed article that prompted one of its Congressional reporters to quit. The State Department justified giving exclusive access to IJR as part of an effort “to include a broader representation of U.S. media” and to bring in a “new fresh perspective.” But IJR’s “fresh perspective” has so far been missing from coverage of Tillerson’s trip. McPike, who got on a plane Tuesday, had not published any stories or even tweeted as of midday Friday ― a silence noticed by other journalists. McPike told The Huffington Post that IJR editors made the decision for her not to tweet or file incremental stories, and to focus on a long-form piece instead. IJR founder Alex Skatell confirmed on Twitter that he made the decision. In fairness, IJR wasn’t given the only press seat to provide pool duty for other outlets. The publication is within its rights to publish as it sees fit with the access provided. But not only has its editorial decision brought renewed scrutiny of the State Department’s unusual arrangement with the site, it has also been derided as overly self-interested. With IJR unwilling to report on Tillerson’s movements in real time, and the press not having traditional access to do so, the public loses out. CNN’s Jake Tapper recently said that the State Department’s decision not to bring reporters on the Asia trip is “insulting to any American who is looking for anything but a state-run version of events.”Journalists’ complaints about press access might come across as simple whining. But the inability to comprehensively cover a president’s movements, or those of top officials like Tillerson, results in the public potentially losing independent coverage of historical moments. In 2001, pool reporters flew aboard Air Force One with President George W. Bush as he returned to Washington, D.C., following the Sept. 11 attacks. Without such access, Americans are left with only the government’s account of what happened, along with whatever appears in the foreign press.This has become something of a pattern in the Trump administration. Last month, Mexico’s press was the first to report that Tillerson planned to visit the country. And on Friday, British media revealed that White House press secretary Sean Spicer had apologized for repeating the unsubstantiated claim that the British intelligence agency GCHQ helped Obama spy on Trump. Tillerson has appeared reticent on the world stage ― The Washington Post’s editorial board recently dubbed him “Secretary Silent.” Though Tillerson may speak at length to McPike for her article, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp. has given no other interviews since taking the country’s top diplomatic post. And the State Department only recently resumed daily press briefings after a drought of over a month.On Friday, Tillerson again rankled the press corps when he barred a CNN producer providing pool coverage of his visit to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, allowing in only a team from Fox News.State Department spokesman R.C. Hammond disputed the CNN journalist’s pool report, which described being “blocked,” apparently at the secretary’s request. “Pool reporters were not barred,” he told The Huffington Post. The secretary answered a question from Fox News during a photo session at the DMZ, he said.The confusion Friday over Tillerson’s physical condition could put increased pressure on the State Department to return to traditional press coverage abroad. “This is a good example of why, on the press side of things, the U.S. side is always pressing for access,” NBC News Pentagon correspondent Hans Nichols said on MSNBC during a discussion of the South Korean press report. “If a story gets out that may not be accurate, or may be more spun to the host country or wherever the dignitary is visiting, there isn’t the own U.S. press corps to either correct the record or, frankly, get the other side out,” Nichols said. “So maybe this will cause them to rethink — the secretary and his high command — rethink their policy of not bringing a full complement of reporters.”"

The pain from watching national news events unfold ― like the police slayings of black lives, the devastating water crisis in Flint and the fight to protect sacred tribal sites in North Dakota ― has overwhelmed Aaron, a writer and poet from Chicago, in ways that have also motivated him to speak out about the agony.While Aaron, who identifies as a creative artist, is deeply committed to creating social change, he says engagement and momentum can sometimes be hard to sustain in many movements. “We see the names so much we forget the people, and their lives become fossils, dried up moments of humanity buried under time,” Aaron told The Huffington Post. “The information we acquire has to be stretched, pulled apart and wrung into action.” This is why he decided to create his own modernized method to fuse storytelling and social justice, and help mobilize people across the country to get involved ― and stay involved. Behold The People’s Campaign.On Wednesday, Aaron launched a GoFundMe page to crowdfund the project, which he hopes will be able to take a small team of creatives to 15 cities across America that have been affected by injustice, including in Ohio, where Tamir Rice was killed; Maryland, where Freddie Gray died; and South Carolina, where Walter Scott was fatally shot.They will then team up with local activists to co-organize an event that will tackle a local social justice issue and identify solutions that will leave community residents feeling more empowered. Aaron plans to lead the team, which will use digital platforms like YouTube, Instagram and SnapChat to profile local community members, as well as produce livestreamed and edited content for the general public. “The People’s Campaign is a journey of streamed content that marries action in the digital space with action in the real world,” Aaron told HuffPost. “We will democratize social change, simply by tapping into the power already in our hands. So that people like myself, everyday people, have the information, the ideas and the access to action.” Aaron, who aims to raise enough money to donate $10,000 to an immediate area of need in each city, said he hopes The People’s Campaign will help residents realize the power of their voices. He believes people are very interested in getting involved, tired of feeling powerless and are ready to move simply because, he says, we can’t afford to wait any longer.“I want people to take this journey and be empowered every step of the way,” he said. “I want people to know they can contribute, and even though social issues are large they are not impossible. We just need enough eyes and ears locked in at the same time.”For Aaron, tackling injustice has evolved into a lifelong commitment. Following Sandra Bland’s death in July 2015, Aaron was so overcome with grief that he quit his job in hospitality, essentially locked himself in his room for a month and fully focused on writing. In that time, he wrote a powerful book of poetry called “Someday” that is primarily centered on the complexities of race, and wrote and directed a 12-part play of the same title that followed many of the book’s themes. He will be using the hashtag #SomedayMustCome to merge his past project with his current one and help drive momentum to The People’s Campaign by asking people to post a picture with the hashtag.“I want the nation to show up at the front door of communities in need,” he added. “I want people to use their smartphones, or their laptop like a key and have a seat in a home that doesn’t stand like their own. I want people to understand difference and not criminalize it. I want us to challenge ourselves, and if nothing else, then out of curiosity, see how much good we can achieve together.”The People’s Campaign aims to fundraise $150,000 and, as of Friday, has raised more than $1,600. Aaron says he is confident it will reach its goal, but if that doesn’t happen, he still plans on using the available funds to create events in whatever cities possible. The campaign plans to kick off its first social event in New York ― but first, it’s asking members of communities everywhere to support its mission and embrace their own power. “We have to awaken collective power now, build a bridge of access between interest groups now, or the cycle of injustice will continue at the expense of the people sharing the margin,” Aaron said. “We’ve been waiting patiently and politely long enough,” he added. “It’s all hands on deck!” "

Bush, was discussing the executive order case, but did not comment on any substantive issues about the travel ban.The White House had no immediate comment on his speech.Trump has frequently attacked judges who rule against him. Last month, he called a Seattle federal judge who ruled against the first travel ban a “so-called judge.” During last year’s presidential campaign, he said a San Diego federal judge overseeing a fraud lawsuit against Trump University was biased because of his Mexican heritage.In an order issued late Wednesday related to Trump’s first travel ban challenge, a colleague of Clifton, U.S. Circuit Judge Jay Bybee, had words of his own for the invectives against members of the judiciary in these cases.“The personal attacks on the distinguished district judge and our colleagues were out of all bounds of civic and persuasive discourse — particularly when they came from the parties,” Bybee wrote, declining to mention the president by name.The judge, who was also appointed by Bush, added: “It does no credit to the arguments of the parties to impugn the motives or the competence of the members of this court.”(Reporting by Dan Levine in Honolulu; Additional reporting by Emily Stephenson in Washington; Writing by David Ingram; Editing by Peter Cooney)"
10,POLITICS,Trump’s Infrastructure Promise Is Leaving Out Water,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-infrastructure-water_us_58cc09c3e4b00705db4f16c9,"The nation's water systems are falling apart, but the president's infrastructure plan mostly ignores them.",2017-03-17,A major water main ruptured and flooded Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in 2014. Crises like these are becoming increasingly common and little funding is available to address the issue.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cc0bae14000088060700fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump proposed $1 trillion in infrastructure spending during the campaign, a pledge he repeated last month. He also promised to ensure “crystal-clear, crystal-clean” water. Those commitments now appear to be in doubt.The budget blueprint Trump released Thursday appears to give infrastructure a back seat to military spending. In addition, key areas of federal spending that support the nation’s crumbling water infrastructure are slated to take a big hit.Proposed cuts include various Environmental Protection Agency cleanup initiatives like the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay programs. Along with the Trump administration’s challenges to the Clean Water Rule, and reductions for enforcement and compliance efforts, the budget may lead to higher costs for utilities to remove contaminants from water sources, eating up resources that could be going to maintaining their distribution systems.Rural water utilities, already dealing with challenges to efforts to deliver clean water to customers, also would take a big hit from the elimination of the Department of Agriculture’s rural water and wastewater loan and grant programs. Erik Olson, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s health and environment program, spoke to these concerns at a House Environment and Public Works Committee hearing Thursday on water infrastructure.“We need a greater focus on source water protection,” Olson said in his written testimony. “Uncontrolled and poorly controlled source water pollution from polluters remains a serious problem.”Trump’s administration signaled that water projects may be low priorities in an infrastructure push with a report saying the president would prioritize projects that involve private money. Private investors tend to prefer projects with robust revenue streams — such as toll roads and bridges — over less-lucrative water infrastructure projects, which generate most of their revenue through monthly water bill payments. “Our most urgent infrastructure needs are things like water systems in Flint, Michigan,” Ron Klain, an Obama-era White House aide who was heavily involved with the last big federal infrastructure push, told NBC News this week. “They’re public goods — we call them that because the private sector doesn’t want to do them.”A leaked list of 50 top priority infrastructure projects of the National Governors Association requested by the Trump transition team included few water-related projects. Another report suggests that Trump’s infrastructure package, which has gotten pushback from political leaders of both parties, could be delayed altogether until next year. The proposed budget would slightly increase spending on EPA state revolving funds, and would maintain funding of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, both of which are important sources of federal support for water system repairs and improvements.The need for investment in water infrastructure remains urgent. According to the latest “infrastructure report card” released this month by the American Society of Civil Engineers, water systems are among the worst categories of U.S. infrastructure.The report card rated drinking water systems a D, while wastewater systems earned a D-plus. Many of the pipes that make up these systems were laid in the mid-20th century and are reaching the end of their useful life, the report said. It estimated the cost of repairs at $1 trillion ― an amount that would consume Trump’s entire pledge to rebuild the country’s infrastructure. Public money, alone, can’t pay for water infrastructure repairs, investor-owned utilities say.Kathy Pape, president of Pennsylvania Water and senior vice president of the Mid-Atlantic division of American Water, a water utility company, emphasized that public-private partnerships — and outright private ownership, in some cases — will be needed to fill the funding gap.“The funding that’s been available from the public sector has been a drop in the bucket in terms of what’s needed,” Pape told HuffPost. “The federal government can’t, and shouldn’t, have to fund that $1 trillion on its own.” Pape argued that water systems ought to embrace regionalization to reduce duplicative services and keep costs for customers reasonable, while allowing for investments. Of course, privatizing water can be a controversial move. While privatizing can help struggling utilities with short-term resources, critics argue that water privatization can dramatically increase customer rates. At a time when water affordability is a growing issue, this is no small concern. But privatization alone can’t solve the funding problem, Radhika Fox, CEO of the U.S. Water Alliance, an advocacy group, argued. “Leveraging and unlocking private capital alone isn’t going to be sufficient,” Fox said. “At at time where we’re making really big choices in Washington, we need to remember the fundamental importance of these water systems.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

Suburban and white, this collection of affluent commuter towns 45 minutes north of Atlanta is a maze of spiraling subdivisions, upscale retail stores and well-funded schools ― a veritable paradise of automatic sprinkler systems, Mercedes-Benz GLS-classes and C-suite types with names like Chet, Bobby and Judd. It’s not surprising, then, that seemingly every Republican in the area has declared for the race to fill this typically Republican seat vacated by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price ― though the actual number is closer to a dozen. This is, after all, the district that former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and, later, Sen. Johnny Isakson once represented. One reason the 6th has served as an incubator for some of the state’s most well-connected Republicans is its concentration of wealthy donors and proximity to Atlanta. There’s no shortage of ambitious Republicans with potentially deep war chests. But why are Democrats also pouring millions of dollars into the race? The answer lies in an opinionated former reality TV show star with a heightened sensitivity about the size of his hands. Hostility to President Donald Trump and his populist message runs deep here. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney won this district by over 20 points in 2012, yet Trump defeated his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton by a scant point in November, and it was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) who carried it in the Republican primary. Needless to say, the commander in chief’s message of upending the economic order, to say nothing of his personal indiscretions, does not necessarily resonate in a place with a thriving Talbots. Put another way, the president who so closely identifies himself with the country clubs he owns and operates is actually anathema to many traditionally center-right country club Republicans.Democrats smell blood in the water, and hope dearly to deprive congressional Republicans and Trump of some of their early mojo with a win or unexpectedly close loss.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former Democratic congressional staffer running in the district’s open primary, stressed that grassroots enthusiasm and turnout by nontraditional Democratic constituencies will be key when voters head to the polls on April 18.“There’s been a huge intensity of grassroots support here,” Ossoff said. “I don’t think it has much to do with me, but with the times.”“The north metro [Atlanta] area has become younger and more diverse,” he added, “but more importantly, it’s a very well-informed electorate here, with discerning voters who look at candidates rather than parties.”Dissatisfaction with the president was on full display at one of Ossoff’s field offices last week. While hostility to the opposition party is to be expected at a campaign office, what was surprising was how many first-time and Republican volunteers were present. When a campaign staffer asked a group of roughly 25 volunteers how many had never participated in a political campaign, nearly three-quarters raised a hand. “We’re appalled,” said Patricia Gagne, a retiree from Johns Creek. “Before this election, we never did anything like this.” “Where we live, people are very Republican as a whole,” she added, “but we see a crack, that people with any sense are starting to see that this is not what they thought it was.” “I don’t call him President Trump, I just call him Donald Trump,” added Patricia’s husband, Walter Urbanavitch, a retired aeronautical engineer and Air Force veteran who served a year-long tour in Vietnam. “I think he’s a disgrace. He’s not presidential, he just tells lies.” Though Ossoff is one of five declared Democrats in the race, he has quickly emerged as the party’s favorite, earning endorsements from the area’s two Democratic congressmen (and Ossoff’s former bosses on Capitol Hill) ― Reps. John Lewis and Hank Johnson. Outside money is pouring into his coffers, too; progressive groups including Daily Kos and MoveOn.org have funneled millions of members’ dollars to his campaign. Republicans are sufficiently alarmed that the National Republican Congressional Committee ― the GOP’s House campaign arm ― is pouring resources into the race, and one GOP super PAC spent $1 million in the district to air an ad hitting Ossoff for his youth, featuring a clip of him in college dressed as Han Solo. Unease with the chief executive pervades the Republican field as well. One candidate, Judson Hill, a former state senator and assistant U.S. attorney during the Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, has gone to great lengths to burnish his Republican bona fides ― touting endorsements from Republican heavy hitters like Rubio and Gingrich, the district’s former representative. However, he’s keeping a healthy distance from the president. Hill has the look and bearing of a polished Georgia politician, with a Southern drawl, neatly-coiffed hair and a broad smile. He invited HuffPost to tag along last week as he went door-knocking in one of the district’s wealthier areas.After setting out from ― what else? ― a country club parking lot, Hill provided background on both his campaign strategy and the neighborhood, discussing his attempts to drive up the vote in his former district and pointing out local landmarks, such as where his parents previously lived and the imposing residence of a Chick-fil-A board member. “I usually do this by myself,” Hill said as he trudged up a hilly road flanked on both sides by several immaculately maintained, multi-thousand-square-foot homes. “It’s good to get my steps in.”Hill is somewhat less open to talking about the president. Between chatting with constituents about whose son was in which military branch and whose daughter was enrolled in which middle school, Hill dodged HuffPost’s more probing questions about the numerous scandals and setbacks already plaguing the new administration, focusing instead on his own record and conservative agenda. “I’m thrilled we have a Republican in the White House,” Hill replied, before quickly shifting to his experience in the Reagan administration. Indeed, “Republican” seems to be the nicest adjective that many Republicans in Georgia’s 6th ― and across the country, for that matter ― can lay at this decidedly unorthodox president’s feet. The current front-runner, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel ― already a conservative star from her stint at the Susan G. Komen Foundation, when she engineered the breast cancer organization’s temporary decision to cut off funds to Planned Parenthood in 2012 ― has also distanced herself from Trump. Her website features no mention of him, outside of links to favorable articles that also happen to say the president’s name.

13,WOMEN,Famous Women's Bodies Don't Belong To You,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/famous-womens-bodies-dont-belong-to-you_us_58cad099e4b0ec9d29d9d412,Emma Watson and Amanda Seyfried were the targets of the latest celeb nude leaks.,2017-03-17,Just a few of the famous women who've been violated by internet trolls in recent years. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58caf2882c00002000feecd6.jpeg?cache=vPY4i0z3T9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2008, Emma Watson woke up the morning after 18th birthday to find paparazzi photos from her birthday party plastered all over tabloid covers and gossip websites. But they weren’t just any pap photos, candid shots of the young actress partying with her friends. “Photographers laid down on the pavement and took photographs up my skirt,” Watson recalled during a HeForShe conference last year. “If they had published the photographs 24 hours earlier, they would have been illegal. I think that’s just one example of how my transition to womanhood was dealt with very differently by the tabloid press than it was for my male colleagues.”Welcome to being a young woman in Hollywood. Welcome to being a young woman, full stop. What happened to Watson back in 2008 was just the first of many violations she would face. Over the last nine years, she’s had to deal with everything from photoshopped images of her face onto the bodies of nude adult film stars, to online countdown clocks to her becoming legal, to slut-shaming over her recent Vanity Fair cover.And on Wednesday, personal photos of Hollywood actresses including Watson and Amanda Seyfried reportedly began circulating on the “dark web,” Reddit and 4chan. The leaks include photos of Seyfried in the nude, performing sexual acts with then-boyfriend Justin Long, and Watson trying on several bikinis for a swimsuit fitting. The hackers claim more stolen photos are on the way. “There may be a few more names added to that list but these are the big two,” the person who originated the thread on Reddit wrote, according to the Telegraph. “Don’t want to break any Reddit rules so no links right now but there should be some really good drama over the next few days.”And yet, in the days since these leaks, there hasn’t really been any drama. Some outlets have referred to these leaks as “The Fappening 2.0,” a reference to the iCloud hacking of nude celeb photos in 2014 that included Jennifer Lawrence, Rihanna, Kate Upton, Vanessa Hudgens, Gabrielle Union, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Back then, gossip sites like Perez Hilton and Ohnotheydidnt covered the leaks with a kind of morbid glee. Even the name, “Fappening,” (a crude reference to masturbation) seemed to belittle the fact that these leaks were ultimately a violation ― and act that intentionally targeted women and their bodies. While mainstream bloggers like Hilton actually shared the photos to their sites or linked to where to find them, social media users weighed in on the leaks with classic victim-blaming.Things like:This time around, the photos aren’t being spread quite so cavalierly on mainstream sites, and the discourse around the leaks isn’t revolving around how these actresses should have “prevented” this from happening by simply not taking the photos to begin with. Instead, the focus is predominantly around how the sharing of nude photos without the subject’s consent is a criminal violation. Is this a sign of progress, incremental though it is? Perhaps, perhaps not. Perhaps we’ve learned a lesson, but perhaps also trolls and hackers have gotten smarter ― better to share these photos on the dark web, carefully making sure not to break Reddit rules by posting links, than to create an online trail that could lead to trouble with the law and possible jail time. (Both Watson and Seyfried have already lawyered up.)The fact that these pictures are being shared without these actresses’ permission at all is a sign, though, that the rape culture and misogyny that was called out back in 2014 hasn’t, of course, disappeared. What is perhaps more telling than the lack of horrific public reaction to the leaks is the female celebrities who were targeted. Seyfried has long been vocal about women’s rights including equal pay, and Watson, ambassador for the HeForShe campaign, was outspoken in 2014 about the iCloud hacks:For speaking out, Watson received threats from internet trolls who claimed they would leak nude photos of her. “That feminist b***h Emma is going to show the world she is as much of a whore as any woman,” a commenter on 4Chan said after Watson’s famous UN speech on feminism. Here lies the crux of the matter; why the apparent lack of “drama” surrounding these new leaks shouldn’t lull us into a false sense of complacency. The thing that compelled paparazzi to shoot photos of an 18-year-old Watson’s crotch is the same thing that compels trolls to steal the intimate photos of celebrity women. It’s not just about sex ― you can find porn made with consenting adults anywhere on the internet. It’s about control. It’s about ownership. And it’s about silencing those women who dare to speak out.Let’s not forget that while we all hear about it when famous women's bodies are exposed without their permission, this doesn’t just happen to celebrities. Every day, women who are not in the public eye have their privacy violated by strangers and by men they know ― ex-boyfriends, friends, coworkers. The impulse is, of course, the same. By humiliating these women, their tormentors are exerting control over their bodies and ultimately their lives. What’s happening to Watson and Seyfried is the every day sexism women face played out on a much larger stage. It's emblematic of how wearyingly predictable and harmful male entitlement can be. There’s always been tension in the notion of women getting to exist and thrive in public spaces. We must shrink ourselves on the street, on trains, at clubs ― all in the name of survival. If we don’t, and we are violated, somehow it’s our fault. This tension is amplified for celebrities, who also exist in public consciousness. But just because a woman exists in a public space does not mean that we, the public, own her body. "

Not being able to cry. Not being able to breathe. Just not being ‘able.’”For six months, Sursok credited her feelings to hormones, sleep deprivation and the life changes she made after becoming a mom. She felt as though she couldn’t ask for help because she feared her words would be “misconstrued” and turned into clickbait. She also didn’t want to be seen as weak. “Asking for help, especially in regards to motherhood, is often seen as self-trivialization and weakness, so on goes the perpetual cycle of fear, loneliness and guilt,” she wrote.After Sursok told her mom how she was feeling, she visited a doctor and was diagnosed with postpartum anxiety, or as she put it, “was officially branded by two words.”Sursok wrote that when she arrived home she had a panic attack. “My breathing labored and I almost passed out,” she wrote. “I hysterically threw the medication in the bin (which I’m now sure would have helped me greatly) and never did end up taking them. Ironically, I wondered, if I didn’t help myself, was I more of a failure?”The actress and girls’ clothing designer feels more like herself after three years of healing. Her daughter is 3-and-a-half now, and Sursok’s “great days far outweigh the panic.” “Through meditation, yoga, therapy, mindfulness, prayer, nutrition and reading and connecting with others who had been through the same experience, I somehow slowly, inch by inch, rebuilt myself,” she wrote of what helped her.In an Instagram post announcing that her essay had been published, Sursok wrote that postpartum anxiety hit her “like a ton of bricks.” To help other moms who might be experiencing similar feelings, Sursok encouraged mothers to talk more about their emotions and “break the stigma.”Though this is the first time Sursok has elaborated on her experience with postpartum anxiety, she has been open about her family and the ups and downs on her motherhood journey. In an Instagram post from January, she showed just how much she loves her daughter. “She makes me present and enjoy every wild, wacky and magical moment,” she wrote.

Entertainment sites regularly round up what’s coming and going from the Netflix options each month. There has to be a better way.”But Netflix is keen to get more people rating content so it can understand what viewers really want to watch.The Verge’s Lauren Goode also reported that with the rating change, comes more attempts from Netflix to use algorithms to match viewers with content they would like by showing a percentage beneath the title.Here’s hoping all this somehow leads to more “Gilmore Girls” episodes."

Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) has been an advocate for including maternity care and other women's health services in insurance policies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cc380a14000020000701fa.jpeg?ops=crop_0_34_3000_1834%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― One of the most heralded aspects of the Affordable Care Act was the fact that it no longer made being a woman a pre-existing condition.Before 2010, women often had to pay more than men for the same coverage. Only 12 percent of individual market plans covered maternity care. And it was completely legal for insurance companies to refuse coverage to women who were pregnant or might become pregnant in the future.Obamacare changed that. The law created a list of 10 essential health benefits that all plans on the marketplace must cover. Pregnancy, maternity and newborn care are on that list. President Donald Trump wants to get rid of that mandatory benefit. On Tuesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer pointed to maternity care as a reason that insurance costs were so high and said it was unfairly burdening men and older people who don’t need such services. He argued that costs would go down if people had more choices for a la carte services.“A 54-year-old doesn’t need certain things. They don’t need maternity care,” Spicer told reporters in his press briefing. “They don’t need certain medical services that are being provided to them by this government product that is being forced on them right now.”“You’ve got young people being told to buy packages that have end-of-life care that they don’t necessarily need, you have people in their older phases of life having to buy stuff for maternity that may not be a service that they need at their stage of life,” he added. The GOP’s current bill to replace Obamacare would not change the requirement for insurers to offer maternity care. But the Trump administration has made clear that the American Health Care Act is only the first step in what it sees as an approach with “three prongs” that would include the types of changes to coverage that Spicer outlined.“Sean Spicer’s comments illustrate how dangerous it is to allow people to propose health policy for this country when they don’t understand how insurance works and apparently don’t believe in ending discrimination against women,” said Gretchen Borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women’s Law Center.The way insurance works is that everyone pays into a system so that those who need the money get it in their time of need. You may never have cancer, but your insurance payments are helping to fund others who will. Women don’t have prostates, but their insurance premiums go to men’s prostate cancer screenings and treatments. “We shouldn’t allow insurance companies to say men’s health care is basic health care, but women’s health care is not,” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said. Removing the maternity care requirement would return the health care system to a time when women faced a high price simply because of their gender. Insurance companies would have more power on what to cover and whom they could deny.With only a fraction of plans on the marketplace offering maternity care, women often had to bear the extra cost burden since insurance companies didn’t have to. They might have had to pay thousands of dollars for a maternity coverage rider and typically had higher deductibles. Andy Slavitt, who was President Barack Obama’s acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told ABC News that if maternity care and other services were made optional, they’d likely become scarce. “Once something is not required, it becomes difficult for one company to offer it,” he said. “It can be a tough business decision. The fear is that you may attract only sicker folks. It can be a race to the bottom, in terms of what’s offered.”And even though nearly half of the pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, women would have to purchase this maternity coverage months in advance of being pregnant ― otherwise it could be considered a pre-existing condition for which insurance companies could deny coverage. “Picking and choosing among health services undermines the fundamental principles of insurance, and it leaves individuals without the care they need when they need it,” Borchelt added. “We saw this before the Affordable Care Act, when only 12 percent of individual plans covered maternity care, yet charged women more than men for coverage that didn’t even meet their needs. This left women without the care they needed, and left women and families saddled with huge bills. The health care law ended this discriminatory practice, making sure plans cover maternity alongside other essential health benefits.”Many experts also say that maternity care has not been a significant factor in higher costs. A 2016 study by Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, for example, said new enrollees in the previous two years tended to be sicker and require more expensive medical care. “Relative to other market changes, there is no indication that required coverage for women’s health benefits was a primary driver of premium increases,” Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health told The Associated Press. But even as the Affordable Care Act was being debated, many Republicans were baffled as to why women shouldn’t have sole responsibility for paying for plans that cover maternity care. One of the most memorable moments from the congressional debate was during a hearing in 2009, when Stabenow reminded a male GOP senator why services such as maternal care benefit everyone.“I don’t need maternity care, and so requiring that to be in my insurance policy is something that I don’t need and will make the policy more expensive,” then-Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) argued during a hearing in September 2009.“I think your mom probably did,” Stabenow shot back. “The point of it was, we are all connected,” Stabenow explained to The Huffington Post this week. “There are essential basic services in health care that should be available for men and women, as well as children. ... When a mom can go and get prenatal care and a baby is born healthy, we all benefit by that.”“Providing maternity care as part of basic health care actually saves tremendously in health care costs ― rather than a complicated pregnancy [and] health problems for babies,” she added. “It not only makes sense from a quality of life standpoint and the standpoint of women being able to be treated fairly in the health insurance market ... but it also saves dollars overall in the health care system.”Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Most of President Trump’s opponents don’t understand why anyone approves of him. And the new GOP health care bill is off to a rocky start in gaining public support. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 17, 2017.AMERICANS BREAK WITH TRUMP ON IMMIGRATION - Tal Kopan and Jennifer Agiesta: “Americans disagree with President Donald Trump’s immigration priorities, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, with nearly two-thirds of Americans saying they’d like to see a path to legal status for undocumented immigrants rather than deportations. Trump has made tough border security and strict enforcement of US immigration laws a focal point of his campaign and presidency ― using some of his first executive orders to pave the way for far more deportations and detentions as well as ordering the construction of a Southern border wall. But a CNN/ORC poll released Friday finds that the public is actually moving in the opposite direction since Trump has won election. All told, 60% say the government’s top priority in dealing with illegal immigration should be developing a plan to allow those in the US illegally who have jobs to become legal residents….The number who prioritize legal status for those working in the US illegally is up from 51% who said so last fall. That shift comes across party lines, with Democrats and independents each 10 points more likely and Republicans 8 points more likely to choose a plan for legal status now compared with last fall.” [CNN]MANY AMERICANS CAN’T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR POLITICAL OPPONENTS ARE THINKING  - HuffPollster: “Nearly half of Americans have already gotten into a political argument this year, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds….While 48 percent of Americans who personally approve of [President] Trump’s job performance say they understand why someone would disapprove of him, 43 percent say they can’t understand that, the poll finds. Trump’s opponents are even more vehement, with two-thirds of those who disapprove saying they can’t understand why anyone would approve of him, and just 23 percent that they can understand his supporters….People generally say their closest circle mostly shares their views of the president: 60 percent of those who approve of Trump’s job performance say most or all of their family and close friends also approve, while 76 percent of those who disapprove of the president say that opinion is shared by most or all of their friends and family.” [HuffPost] MOST POLLS SHOW LITTLE SUPPORT FOR GOP HEALTH CARE PLAN - HuffPollster: “Republican plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act have been met with a largely frosty reception by the public, according to the latest polling released this week. A Fox News poll published Wednesday night finds that just 34 percent of registered voters support the GOP’s health care plan, with 54 percent in opposition ― 36 percent oppose because it makes too many changes to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and 11 percent because it makes too few. A SurveyMonkey poll shows similar reactions, with most Americans opposed to the Republican bill, 55 percent to 42 percent. The poll finds more intense opposition than support, with just 18 percent saying they strongly support the bill, while 38 percent say that they’re strongly opposed to it. The Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, meanwhile, puts opposition at 49 percent, with just 24 percent approving. A fourth poll from Morning Consult and Politico, released Wednesday, finds considerably more positive views of the bill, with 46 percent of voters approving and 35 percent disapproving. (Perhaps relevantly, theirs was also the only survey not to explicitly identify the bill as being a Republican proposal.)...Most of the surveys find significant splits across party lines.” [HuffPost, more from Fox, SurveyMonkey, PPP (D) and Morning Consult/Politico] Many expect the plan to make things worse - Ashley Kirzinger, Liz Hamel, Elise Sugarman, Bryan Wu and Mollyann Brodie: “About half (48 percent) the public thinks the Republican replacement plan will decrease the number of people who have health insurance, while one in five (18 percent) say the number of insured people will increase and three in ten say it will stay about the same….When it comes to costs, about half (48 percent) expect the new plan to increase costs for people who buy insurance on their own, while about a quarter each say costs for these people will decrease (23 percent) or stay about the same (25 percent)....However, the public does not see a distinction in how the replacement plan would impact costs for these different groups of individuals, except when it comes to income. About four in ten Americans expect costs to increase for younger, older, urban-dwelling, and rural-dwelling people buying insurance on the individual market, while between about two in ten and one quarter expect them to decrease.” [Kaiser Family Foundation]TRUMP’S TWEETS ARE RATED MUCH WORSE THAN TWEETS FROM HIS AIDES - HuffPollster: “Tweets from President Donald Trump’s account that are registered as being sent from from an Android ― generally a sign that the president wrote them himself ― get significantly worse scores from the public than the more innocuous tweets sent from an iPhone (presumably written by his staff)....The YouGov TweetIndex catalogues Trump’s tweets and has a representative public sample rate for each of them….The Huffington Post collected the data and separated it by whether the tweet came from Trump’s Android or an iPhone. When the tweet came from an iPhone, it scored an average of 8 points in YouGov’s TweetIndex….However, tweets that came from Trump’s Android received an average score of -21 points, 29 points worse than those presumably sent by his staff.” [HuffPost, TweetIndex]VIEWS ON PAYING COLLEGE ATHLETES DIVIDE ALONG RACIAL LINES - Travis Waldron: “As the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments kick off this week, a majority of Americans who have any opinion on the subject are still opposed to paying college athletes, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll. The survey found that 37 percent of Americans strongly or somewhat oppose paying college athletes ― beyond their scholarships, that is ― while 30 percent strongly or somewhat support the idea. The remaining third aren’t sure. But dig a little deeper, and an interesting picture emerges: White and black Americans are sharply divided on the issue. A majority ― 52 percent ― of black respondents are strongly or somewhat in favor of paying college athletes, while only 15 percent strongly or somewhat oppose the idea. Among whites, however, the numbers flip: Just 27 percent support paying those athletes, while 43 percent oppose it.” [HuffPost]MOST AGREE THAT TRUMP’S TIES TO RUSSIA SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED - Dana Blanton: “Majorities of voters think Congress should investigate if Russia interfered with the election and allegations of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. That’s according to the latest Fox News Poll, taken amidst a new volley of allegations of ties between Trump and Russia, and wiretapping of Trump Tower. Sixty-six percent want a Congressional investigation into Russia’s attempts to influence the election, and 63 percent want lawmakers to look into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Voters are split 46-49 percent over whether lawmakers should investigate the wiretapping allegation. Views are clear on whether the president should produce evidence of his claim about the wiretaps: 76 percent think he should. That isn’t just Democrats, although most agree (88 percent).

Thomson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/breaking-bread-nyc_us_58ca981ee4b0be71dcf1e511,"""How you spend your lunch money can be a political statement.""",2017-03-17,"A plate served at the Yemeni cafe in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cacba21d00001d107ceccc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like so many of us, Scott Wiener ― who runs Scott’s Pizza Tours in New York City ― wanted to do something after Donald Trump’s proposed Muslim ban last month. Once the shock settled, something hit him: the city needed a new kind of food tour, one that celebrates the cuisine of the nations targeted by the ban.Together with Jeff Orlick, a fellow food tour guide, and product designer Steph Mantis, they were able to get Breaking Bread NYC off the ground in a little under a week after the ban was announced. “You put activism into your life through the channel you’ve already got,” Mantis told The Huffington Post. For Wiener and Orlick, that meant organizing the tour, and for Mantis it meant creating the logo (among other things). Breaking Bread NYC is a food tour company that provides maps, guided tours and dinner parties with the purpose of highlighting restaurants and bakeries run by people from the seven targeted countries ―Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.The tours and dinners have visited Syrian bakeries, Yemeni restaurants, Iraqi restaurants and even found one Somalian spot that let them take over the entire restaurant. The response ― from customers and the restaurateurs, alike ― has been amazing. Every tour has been sold out. There have been eight so far, and many more are in the works. Breaking Bread hosted a dinner party at an Iraqi restaurant on a whim in Dallas, TX when Orlick was traveling there, and 100 people showed up to it sell out in two nights. And the restaurateurs themselves have been so touched by the support. One place didn’t even want to accept money for the meal.Proceeds for the first tour went to supporting the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which was one motivating factor for people taking the tour. But that’s not at the heart of what drives these tours. Mantis explains, “You can talk about food and you’re not talking about your differences, but finding your common ground over this common bread. Eating is not just a necessity it’s an intimate experience of culture. There is a profound human connection within the act of eating, and that’s why it [the tours] works, because everyone is looking for ways to maintain that human connection.”These tours give people a way to show support without making a big show of it. It teaches us that anything can be a political act. Even “how you spend your lunch money can be a political statement,” says Mantis.Breaking Bread has become a platform for other folks who are hoping to do the same thing in their own city. Wiener said he will talk to anyone who is looking for advice ― the goal is just to spread acceptance. The tours are about more than just the travel ban, so they plan continue do these events as a way to bring people together and create a better environment for understanding across cultures through food.Wiener says this experience has been amazing for him personally. “It speaks to why I’m involved with food,” he elaborates. “It’s a way to connect, a way cultures define themselves, a way into somebody else’s life. When you meet someone and go to their parents’ house for dinner, you’re not just getting a plate of food, you get to see the way they eat their green bean casserole ― it’s a window into their culture.” "

All it took for those members was a little face time with the president and some cosmetic tweaks to the legislation, which Trump backed. Those changes would give states the option of imposing work requirements on Medicaid recipients, as well as of receiving a Medicaid block grant rather than the per-person sum they get now. But conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus ― a smaller, but more dedicated conservative group in the House ― do not appear wowed by the changes.“Wait, we are still opposing?” Freedom Caucus member Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) facetiously asked The Huffington Post on Friday. “I thought we had caved as soon as they met zero of our demands.”Labrador’s tough talk appears directed at leadership, who seemed to present RSC members caving as a major development in the whip effort. But Freedom Caucus members have been saying all along that they didn’t expect those members to stand strong.“The scene at the White House was political theater,” Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) told HuffPost. “Vote counts haven’t changed.”Trump had promised repeal, Amash added. “This bill not only breaks that commitment but also avoids meaningful reforms to improve health care for all Americans,” he said.The Freedom Caucus Twitter account suggested Friday that at least 80 percent of members ― meaning at least 30 Republicans ― were still opposed to the legislation. It’s clear party leaders don’t have enough support yet: They can only lose about 21 Republicans on the vote, and some moderates also have vowed to vote against the bill.“Everybody wants to get a deal, but no one knows how to make it,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost. He thought about that statement, then slightly revised it. “No one on Capitol Hill knows how to make it,” he said.Meadows has seemingly all but given up on negotiating with GOP congressional leaders, going directly to the Trump administration to work out a number of outstanding issues. The Freedom Caucus had previously focused on a slate of demands that included changes to the Medicaid expansion, but now they’re faced with the reality that a faster phasing-out of the expansion would scare away moderate votes. So conservatives have shifted to asking for major concessions on elements of coverage in the legislation, which they say would result in lower premiums.Those changes appear to be nonstarters with moderates and leadership. “Leadership has said they can’t make changes because of [the Congressional Budget Office],” Meadows said. “It seems clear they never were negotiating in good faith and anything that they change is meaningless. They’ve convinced the administration it’s this bill all the way.”Except Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has signaled that he’s open to making some changes ― for moderates, anyway. Ryan told members Friday that he was open to adjusting the structure of some of the tax credits in the GOP bill to address the massive premium increases expected for low-income seniors. (According to the CBO, a 64-year-old making $26,500 a year ― 175 percent of the poverty level ― would eventually see their annual premiums go from $1,700 a year to $14,600 a year, a 758 percent increase.)Moderates want some additional assistance for those sorts of individuals ― a demand they seem likely to win ― and to prevent an accelerated phase-out of the Medicaid expansion that conservatives want. Still, Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, has signaled he would like the House to slow down and work through other issues in the bill. “If I hear one more senator tell me this is dead on arrival, I think my head is going to explode,” Dent said Friday.The Tuesday Group is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House early next week to discuss its issues.But with Ryan unwilling to open up the bill for significant changes, Freedom Caucus members may have to decide if they will actually sink the bill. Leaders announced they would move forward with a vote next Thursday, seven years to the day that President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Leadership could be bluffing, perhaps delaying a vote as they wait for the CBO to score their latest changes. Or they could push ahead, try to pass the bill as best they can, and then relentlessly shame members who voted against it if it goes down.Either way, there appear to be a number of committed Freedom Caucus members who won’t budge under pressure from leadership or Trump.Asked if the Freedom Caucus may have to vote down the legislation once to let leadership know it’s serious about its demands, Labrador said that was exactly where this vote was headed.“I think unfortunately that’s the way negotiations always work with our leadership,” he said."

If perchance you are not in the immediate vicinity of a hall of books, worry not; Thomas R. Schiff will bring the library to you. The photographer’s series “The Library Exhibition” features a selection of 360-degree, panoramic photographs that mimic the feeling of entering an expansive library space. And the best part is, there’s no library card necessary. Schiff, who has previously photographed modernist homes and cathedral ceilings with the same panoramic style, captured the image of 38 libraries around the country, from Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello library to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale. Because Schiff captures the spaces before the libraries open to the public, few people are seen roaming the book-laden halls, allowing the eye to focus on the myriad architectural details and structural differences. The photographs come together to show the history of the library in America, a space traditionally designated for community and learning. There have been, however, significant changes to the library model over time. For example, prior to the late 18th century, libraries were spaces reserved for the elites; not until Benjamin Franklin opened the first American lending library in 1790 were the spaces open to the public. Are such ideological shifts evident in the buildings’ stained-glass windows, winding staircases, and looming chandeliers?

24,POLITICS,Indian-Americans Are Called ‘Model Minorities.’ But That Label Doesn’t Protect Against Racism,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indian-americans-are-called-model-minorities-but-that-label-doesnt-protect-against-racism_us_58caeddce4b0ec9d29da218b,The Kansas shooting has been a “wake up call” for the community.,2017-03-17,"A picture of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an immigrant from India who was recently shot and killed in Kansas, is surrounded by roses during a vigil in honor of him at Crossroads Park in Bellevue, Washington, U.S. March 5, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58caee8a1d00001d107ced51.jpeg?cache=PTmXGcu9Wk&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Srinivas Kuchibhotla was a model new American. He was well-educated, hard-working, charming, and doggedly optimistic. But he was also brown. And in America, that’s still reason enough to be targeted and killed. For years, Indian Americans have been labeled a “model minority” for achieving high levels of wealth and education. But Kuchibhotla’s shooting death, allegedly by a white man who mistook him for an Iranian, is a reminder that no amount of success can protect Indians and other brown folk from radical white terrorism.Dr. Vasudha Narayanan, a professor of religion at the University of Florida, said that the shooting was a “watershed” moment.“I think many Indians thought they were a model, protected minority. Even now, unfortunately, many may be in denial,” Narayanan told The Huffington Post. From her observations, some Indians are “still reeling under the realization that they are now being targeted.”Suhag Shukla, the Indian-American co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, said that the Kansas shooting has been a “wake up call” for the community. Hindus and other Americans of Indian origin are thinking about how to keep their temples and schools safe. She’s heard suggestions like “Don’t speak Indian languages in public,” and “Don’t wear Indian attire in public.”“When a life is lost due to hate and ignorance, and you recognize that Srinivas ... could have very easily been your brother, father, an uncle, or a friend, it hits home,” Shukla told The Huffington Post. The advocacy group South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT) claimed to have tracked over 200 incidents of hate violence and xenophobic political rhetoric aimed at South Asian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Arab, and Middle Eastern Americans during the 2016 elections. The group believes that hateful attacks can be linked to an uptick in xenophobic rhetoric used by leaders like President Donald Trump.Trump may be the focus of some Indian-Americans’ anger at the moment. But there is nothing new about America’s discrimination against brown skin. Indians have been living in America for more than 100 years, but discriminatory laws have often made life difficult. In 1923, all South Asians were stripped of their citizenship. It wasn’t until 1946 that Indians residing in America were finally allowed to seek citizenship.The biggest change came in 1965, with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which eliminated national quotas and resulted in a dramatic increase in Indians arriving in America. Those who were allowed in were not representative of all potential Indian immigrants ― they were a selected group of highly skilled professionals and students.Vijay Prashad, a professor of International Studies at Trinity College, told The Huffington Post that this wave of Indian immigrants was “twice blessed.” They were born into an independent India. And they arrived in the United States after 1965, missing out on the great marches and demonstrations that led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. “This generation misses the two great struggles of India and America and is the beneficiary of both of those struggles, but don’t acknowledge this because they’ve been gifted it,” Prashad said. “The first generation arrives as in a daze, thinking that ‘We are here because we are smart, we did well in school, we are professionals, and our children should follow us.’” When in fact, Prashad said, “They lived in a bubble.”Selective immigration helped foster the image of Indians as a model minority. Indian Americans’ average median annual household income was $88,000 in a 2010, compared to $49,800 for the overall U.S. population. Seventy percent of Indian Americans aged 25 and older had bachelor’s degrees that year, compared to 28 percent of all U.S. adults.But these statistics don’t take into fact the struggles faced by some members of the community ― such as the growing number of undocumented Indian immigrants living in America. The numbers don’t account for the quiet despair of Indian women who came to the U.S. as wives of workers on the popular H1-B visa. Banned from employment, these women are completely beholden to their husbands for their needs.There are other hurdles to overcome. Some Indian-Americans have embraced their privileged position in American society without reaching out to help other minority groups. Anti-Muslim sentiment is a problem. And in the past and present, Indians have complied with and even perpetuated white America’s anti-black racism.“People would prefer to be accepted by the power structure than to fight for their place in it,” Prashad said. “But it doesn’t work like that.”The bubble began to crack in the late 1980s and especially after the September 11 attacks, as reports surfaced of organized hate groups launching attacks against Indians. The children of those first immigrants began to organize, forming groups like the Sikh Coalition and SAALT.What Kuchibhotla’s death has shown is that the diversity within the Indian American community doesn’t matter to racists. Narayanan believes recent attacks against Indian Americans are driven by hatred of skin color and perceived ethnicity, what she calls “xenophobia in a chromophobic incarnation.”“Really, are individuals who are trigger-happy going to come and check your nationality, religion, etc. before they shoot?” she asked. “And even if it is aimed at other nationalities or religions, does that make it right?”For Prashad, the answer “isn’t more information, but more solidarity.” He said he’s seen a renewed drive among Indian Americans to get organized and active.In an article on CNN, Sayu Bhojwani, President of The New American Leaders Project, wrote that it’s time to stop relying on the “myth of Indian-American exceptionalism” and standing by quietly as “transgender women are killed, Latinos deported and Muslims banned.”“We are not alone in experiencing hate and violence,” Bhojwani wrote. “Instead of calling on [Trump] to be something he has repeatedly shown he cannot be, let’s figure out how all of us ― brown and black, gay and straight ― can stand together.”"

Dubbed “impressively specific” by The New York Times, Entertainment Weekly called the series “a portrait of difficult, incremental change and fragile wins that come at scarring prices.”“This response, this reaction, is more than I ever could have dreamed of,” Black said of the project’s strong public support during a 30-plus minute interview with Podomatic’s No. 1 ranked LGBT podcast. “I’ve never experienced anything like it.“I spent years of my life with almost no pay –- and I’m not alone there.

He calls the outpouring of positive feedback for the finished project “humbling.”“I’m hoping [that] by bringing our history to a broader American audience, and in doing so trying to represent the variety that is us, that our community is actually embracing it,” shared Black. “It’s brought me to tears a few times when I’ve read responses from our own community and what it means to them to have this testament to us,” he continued. “And in no way does [When We Rise] claim to be the testament of us. It is a testament, a slice. It’s scratching the surface.”The queer community is a sweeping tapestry of races, sexualities, gender identities, our allies and more, Black acknowledged.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, daughter Ivanka Trump and granddaughter Arabella Kushner, visits Saint Andrew Catholic School and Principal Latrina Peters-Gipson in Orlando, Florida, on March 3, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ca9ea6140000200006fd22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump wants to cut the Department of Education’s budget by 13 percent, or $9 billion overall, eliminating a program that provides after-school and summer programming for kids and a professional development program for teachers. Yet the proposed budget adds money to school choice options, including $250 million for a “new private school choice program.” This would likely be a voucher program ― providing public money for kids to attend private schools ― although the exact plan is still nebulous. The budget also adds $168 million for charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated. Trump did not attend public schools as a child. His secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, also did not attend public schools or send her kids to public schools.“The 2018 Budget places power in the hands of parents and families to choose schools that are best for their children by investing an additional $1.4 billion in school choice programs,” the budget proposal reads. The education budget also includes a $1 billion increase for Title I, a grant program that specifically targets schools serving disadvantaged students. The funding increase is intended to encourage “portability,” which means states and districts would allow Title I funding to follow a student if the student switches schools. The idea was heavily debated during the creation of the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, and was defeated at that time. Democrats argued that portability would ultimately strip schools serving high concentrations of poor students of necessary funding and could pave the way for private school vouchers. On the higher education front, the budget continues to fund Pell Grants, which help poor students go to college, at the current level, but proposes a “cancellation of $3.9 billion from unobligated carryover funding,” which would do away with surplus funding from before. The budget also slashes other, separate programs designed to help low-income students afford college. While the proposal does not touch programs supporting special education students, public education advocates are already decrying the impact this budget could have on schools.“Cuts to financial aid programs, including draconian cuts to the Pell Grant program, abandoning teacher support and development programs, and an ill-advised (and previously rejected) scheme to divert resources from our highest need schools would move our country backward,” said John King, CEO of The Education Trust and President Barack Obama’s former secretary of education, in a statement. “If this proposal were enacted, all students, particularly students of color and low-income students, throughout the entire continuum of our education system would suffer, as would the nation’s businesses who desperately need a skilled workforce to be successful,” King added.The president of the nation’s largest teacher’s union ― the National Education Association’s Lily Eskelsen García ― called the proposal “reckless and wrong.” “Sadly, the Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos scheme to take taxpayer dollars from public schools to fund private school vouchers is misguided and would harm our students,” Eskelsen García said in a statement. “Vouchers do not work, they undermine accountability to parents and taxpayers, and they have failed to provide opportunity to all of our students.”On the flip side, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools applauded the president’s dedication to school choice.“This funding will allow more high-quality charter schools to open, expand, and replicate ― and will help finance facilities for charter schools ― so that more students have access to the great education they deserve,” said Nina Rees, the president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, in a statement. Other charter school groups had more reservations about the new budget, however. The National Association of Charter School Authorizers said in a statement that while it appreciates the support for charter schools, it is also concerned about other cuts. “Charter schools are part of—not a substitute for—a strong public education system,” the association’s statement read."

They say the arrangement offers deniability to Moscow and freedom from legal troubles for the hackers.A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said employing criminal hackers helps “complement Kremlin intentions and provide plausible deniability for the Russian state.”The FSB in Moscow did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.The United States sometimes engages with criminal hackers as well, buying tools from them or recruiting them to help find other criminal hackers, cybersecurity professionals and government officials say.Milan Patel, a former FBI cyber agent and now managing director for cyber defense at K2 Intelligence, said the intermingling of espionage and cyber crime in Russia had led the United States and its allies to be far more wary about alerting Moscow to criminal hackers.“Magically those guys would disappear off the battlefield and most likely end up working for the Russian government,” Patel said of the names shared by Washington.The Russian government had no official comment on the charges in the Yahoo case.Russian news accounts stressed that one of the FSB agents, Dmitry Dokuchaev, was arrested by Russian authorities in December and charged with treason.The indictment charges Dokuchaev with having acted as a handler for a hacker named Karim Baratov, directing him to use the Yahoo data to crack emails on other systems and paying him a bounty when he succeeded.Baratov is in custody in Canada, according to the Toronto police, while Dokuchaev remains in Russia.The charges coincide with mounting tensions between U.S. intelligence agencies and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government, which they accused of hacking the 2016 U.S. presidential election to influence the vote in favor of then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.In addition, congressional committees are investigating possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Trump.Senator John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement the indictments showed “the close and mutually beneficial ties between the cyber underworld and Russia’s government and security services.”He said the case “underscores the complexity and the urgency” of the committee’s investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election.James Lewis, a former State Department official and now a cyber expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there were three rules for cooperation between the Russian government and criminal hackers.Private hackers know to avoid attacking Russian-language sites and to share their profits with authorities, he said. “Rule Number Three (is), if we ask you to do us a favor, do it.”"

There was panic and the students took refuge in the (neighboring) supermarket,” said the source.Interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told France Inter radio that three people had been injured, and advised families to remain patient as police took control to stabilize the situation. He had earlier told BFM TV eight were injured.He said checks were underway on the possibility of a second assailant.The incident comes with France in a state of emergency after several militants attacks over the last year. It is less than six weeks away from a presidential election in which security and fears of terrorism are among key issues.An eye-witness student in the school interviewed by France Inter radio said the students had heard a bang and taken cover under the tables.“I went to close the windows and saw a guy who looked at me in the eyes. He seemed to be a student and not very big. He shot in the air and ran away,” the student said without giving his name.Local emergency services advised residents on Twitter to stay at home. The government launched its mobile telephone application warning of a “terrorist” attack.(Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry, Sophie Louet, and John Irish; Editing by Adrian Croft and Sudip Kar-Gupta)"
31,THE WORLDPOST,Dutch Election Results Put A Crack In The Far-Right's Populist Narrative,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dutch-election-europe-populism_us_58c9640de4b022994fa3ef6c,"But Geert Wilders' anti-Islam party still gained seats, and there are big contests ahead in France and Germany.",2017-03-16,"Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders of the PVV, left, and Jesse Klaver of the Green-Left Party, right.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cabf5c2c00002000feec3a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A few years ago, a far-right anti-Islam party winning the second most seats in the Netherlands’ election would be a cause for panic in the European Union. In 2017, it’s being hailed as a great victory for liberalism.The Dutch elections on Wednesday saw center-right Prime Minister Mark Rutte fend off a challenge from far-right populist Geert Wilders and gain the largest share of the vote. The result sets up lengthy coalition talks between Rutte and some of the dozen-plus parties that managed to gain seats in Parliament, which will create a ruling government certain to exclude Wilders. Wilders’ Party for Freedom, or PVV, came in a distant second behind Rutte’s VVD, and finished just one seat ahead of two ascendant progressive parties. It gained five seats more than it did last election, but fell far short of poll predictions just a few weeks ago that showed the party on track to become the largest in the country.Pro-EU politicians have immediately seized on Wilders’ somewhat disappointing finish as a rebuttal to the far-right’s narrative that an inevitable populist uprising is taking place in Europe. After the U.S. election and Brexit referendum last year, France and Germany met the lack of a populist surge in the Netherlands with a sigh of relief, despite still-substantial popular support for Wilders. Both states are dealing with rising far-right parties ahead of their own elections later this year.“The Netherlands is showing us that a breakthrough for the extreme right is not a foregone conclusion and that progressives are gaining momentum,” said French independent leader Emmanuel Macron. He is expected to face off against far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the final round of France’s presidential elections in early May.“Large majority of Dutch voters have rejected anti European populists. That’s good news,” Germany’s Foreign Office posted on its Twitter account. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the former president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, both congratulated Rutte on the result. But while many pro-EU politicians celebrated the Dutch election as a defeat for Europe’s right-wing populist movement, it was about far more than just Wilders. Instead, the vote reflected a number of huge shifts in Dutch domestic politics that could threaten the long-term stability of its political system. There were 28 parties running in the Dutch elections, necessitating roadmap-sized ballots ― and highlighting the fragmentation of the country’s politics.A crowded multi-party system is nothing new in the Netherlands, but the divisions are growing more intense, and major parties are attracting smaller percentages of the vote. In part because of the plethora of options, around 50 percent of voters were still undecided at the start of election week.The decentralization will force a number of parties that hold opposing views to work together in a new coalition, which could lead to difficulties in governance. Wilders’ PVV is not the only party to gain from this fracturing. The progressive Green-Left, led by 31-year-old Jesse Klaver, won the greatest number of seats since the last election, and the newly formed pro-immigrant party, Denk, entered Parliament for the first time after winning up to three seats. The biggest loser of the election was undoubtedly the PvdA, a labor-oriented party that lost 29 seats in a crippling defeat. The PvdA came into the election as the second-largest party in the Netherlands, but fell to seventh after Wednesday’s vote. A number of small- and medium- sized parties, including the liberal, pro-EU D66, took over the PvdA’s lost seats.This decentralization of politics and turn away from historically powerful parties has been a trend in a number of countries across Europe. In Germany, the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party is looking to secure its first-ever seats. The party has practically no chance of actually governing, but its emergence is notable in a country that has lacked mainstream far-right political parties since World War II.As France also gears up for its first round of elections next month, the two candidates leading the polls are the independent Macron and far-right Le Pen. If either wins the vote, it would be the first time that a non-establishment party candidate has become president. With the Dutch election behind it, the EU has so far avoided the threat of a Brexit-style populist insurgence, but the real test for the bloc will be in these two-round French elections. A win for National Front leader Le Pen in that vote would present a greater danger to the EU than any result in the Netherlands could have posed, and it’s far more likely that she could govern. Even if Wilders had won, other Dutch parties had long sworn never to work with him due to his discriminatory platform.Wilders now finds himself in a familiar and comfortable position. Far-right populist parties thrive in the opposition, where they are freed from having to find ways to actually implement or deal with the consequences of their policies. Representing the second-largest party yet excluded from government, Wilders will be able to criticize any ineffectiveness or infighting among the ruling coalition as proof that he is the only real alternative to politics as usual.Wilders has already managed to influence Dutch politics from this outsider position, adding to the splintering of the political landscape and dragging the VVD to the right on issues like immigration. His failure to come out on top in the election puts a crack in the far-right narrative, but pro-EU politicians’ relief over the mixed results also shows how far the goal posts concerning populism have moved.On Twitter, Wilders celebrated the election’s outcome:“We were the 3rd largest party of the Netherlands. Now we are the 2nd largest party. Next time we will be nr. 1!”"

33,PARENTS,Data-Minded Dad Tracks Baby's Growing Vocabulary With Cool Charts,Caroline Bologna,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/data-minded-dad-tracks-babys-growing-vocabulary-with-cool-charts_us_58bcd7dfe4b05cf0f4015cd6,Jon Jivan plotted his son's first words and shared the data on Reddit.,2017-03-16,"""He’s saying 'kitty' in this picture,"" Jon told HuffPost. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58bcd99b1a00003400f41c12.jpeg?cache=JijDsMvPPt&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Jon Jivan’s son Elliot started talking, the dad decided to track his progress in a creative way. He created a series of charts to document his baby’s first words, from “dada” to “kitty” to “cookie.”Now that Elliot is 19 month old, his vocabulary has surpassed 100 words. Jon posted his first word charts on Reddit in the dataisbeautiful subreddit, where they quickly reached the front page.”All words recorded were said in context (not simply a parroting of sounds) and had to be witnessed by both myself and my wife for confirmation,” Jon explained in a follow-up comment on Reddit. The dad tracked Elliot’s words in Google Sheets and generated the charts with a program called Tableau Public. “I did not go by perfect pronunciation, but it had to be about 75 percent there,” he wrote on Reddit, noting that the system was a bit subjective. “There were many words I knew he was saying, but another person would likely not understand, even in context. For example, last night he was saying something that sounded like ‘mayma’ but he meant ‘banana.’ I would not count a word like this. But ‘eh-bo’ for ‘elbow’ was close enough, so it counted.Jon plans to track Elliot’s vocabulary until his second birthday.“I hope people realize how incredible it is that children can learn as quickly as they do,” Jon told The Huffington Post. “I think the workings of the human brain is incredibly cool. We start with nothing as infants and during early childhood our brains soak up an unbelievable amount of information at a snow-balling pace.”Some commenters on Reddit referred the dad to studies that suggest children typically know 20 words by 18 months and 50 words by the age of 2. Jon found that Elliot’s chart lined up nicely with the median of a comprehensive study from Stanford University. “I appears the study counts both words the ‘child produces or understands,’” Jon explained. “If I’m interpreting the data correctly, I suppose that means he is above average, since he understands the meanings of considerably more words than he can say out loud.”Jon said he and his wife, Lindsay, typically read three to four short children’s books to Elliot at bedtime. One Reddit user correctly guessed that they’d been reading “Goodnight Moon” to him, as he’d picked up the words “mush,” “moon,” “house” and “mouse.”The dad keeps his son’s progress in perspective, however. “Despite 100 words seeming like a large toddler vocabulary to some, most of what he says is still complete gibberish,” Jon joked.Other commenters noticed that Elliot said “dad” before “momma.” The dad told HuffPost that this fact warms his heart. “I try not to rub it in my wife’s face,” he said. “This is totally her fault though. She bought him Jimmy Fallon’s book Your Baby’s First Word Will Be Dada early last year, and it was overwhelmingly successful. Thanks, Jimmy.”Lindsay explained that she wasn’t hung up on the “dada” before “mama” phenomenon. “I thought that was typical,” she said. “I certainly was not offended!”Ultimately, the Jivans are simply grateful to have Elliot in their life. “Elliot is a happy, energetic boy who loves trains (’toot toots’) and cats (’kitties’),” the dad said. “Like most other children, he is constantly amazed by what more experienced humans might see as mundane. It’s funny how exciting a wall, or a clock is when you are a 1-year-old.”He added, “This morning, his mind was blown when he discovered snow had accumulated on the ground last night. One of his favorite games is taking all the Mac and Cheese boxes out of the pantry, setting them up in the kitchen and kicking them over. Kids are weird.”They certainly are."

Where was the email supposed to go? Why, to Uber ― or, more specifically, to Uber’s newly acquired startup Otto.Included in the email were schematics for a circuit board, one that looked remarkably similar to a board designed at considerable expense by Waymo. Without that circuit board and the “LiDAR” (laser-based surveying) technology it made possible, neither Otto nor Waymo would be going on a self-driving jaunt any time soon.“The email, which a Waymo employee was copied on, was titled OTTO FILES and its recipients included an email alias indicating that the thread was a discussion among members of the vendor’s ‘Uber’ team,” lawyers representing Waymo wrote in a complaint filed in court late last month.“Attached to the email was a machine drawing of what purported to be an Otto circuit board... that bore a striking resemblance to ― and shared several unique characteristics with ― Waymo’s highly confidential current-generation LiDAR circuit board, the design of which had been downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before his resignation.”“Mr. Levandowski” is Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo engineer now at the center of a brewing showdown between Google and Uber. Levandowski abruptly resigned from Waymo in January 2016, then founded Otto and sold it to Uber for $680 million that summer. (You can read a complete, surprisingly riveting timeline of the saga here, via the New Zealand tech blogger Daniel Compton.)The vendor’s misaddressed email has spurred an investigation by Waymo into Levandowski’s activities. Waymo declined to speak about the email or the ensuing investigation, instead directing The Huffington Post to a company blog post on the matter:We found that six weeks before his resignation this former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo’s LiDAR and circuit board. To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialized software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints.Adding to the intrigue, a former Waymo colleague of Levandowski’s testified last Friday that Levandowski had discussed “replicating” the LiDAR technology at a new company, and that an Uber executive had approached him about “buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at Google.”Levandowski was more than a mid-level engineer at Waymo. In many respects, he’s responsible for Google’s entire self-driving project.In 2008, Levandowski cobbled together a self-driving Toyota Prius in his spare time. He went on to wow Google with a demonstration in which the Prius autonomously delivered a pizza, successfully navigating the streets of downtown San Francisco using an early version of LiDAR.“The technology for being able to improve your convenience and safety while on the freeway is just around the corner,” he told CNET at the time. “I want to be the one to provide that.”All of which is to say: Levandowski brought considerable knowledge to Uber, Waymo files or no.Uber didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article, but in a late February interview with Forbes, Levandowski adamantly denied stealing any of Google’s technology.“We did not steal any Google [intellectual property],” he said. “Just want to make sure, super clear on that. We built everything from scratch and we have all of the logs to make that ― just to be super clear.”(It’s unclear what logs Levandowski is referring to. Last Friday, Google submitted testimony from a forensics security engineer analyzing the company’s own logs of Levandowski’s behavior, including the downloading of 9.7 gigabytes of data described above.)Uber has also dismissed the accusations as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Indeed, Reuters notes that in May 2016, Uber acquired a little-known company by the name of Tyto Lidar LLC, which holds a LiDAR patent that could help the company rebut Waymo’s accusations.Last week, Google filed an injunction in California, asking the court to halt Uber’s self-driving program. A ruling in Waymo’s favor could deliver a devastating blow to Uber, setting it back several years in its development of autonomous technology, and hindering its ability to raise more money from a pool of undoubtedly increasingly uneasy investors.Should this turn into a protracted legal battle, it’s hard to think of a worse adversary for Uber than one of the world’s richest and most powerful companies. The case is scheduled for a hearing April 27."

Without that circuit board and the “LiDAR” (laser-based surveying) technology it made possible, neither Otto nor Waymo would be going on a self-driving jaunt any time soon.“The email, which a Waymo employee was copied on, was titled OTTO FILES and its recipients included an email alias indicating that the thread was a discussion among members of the vendor’s ‘Uber’ team,” lawyers representing Waymo wrote in a complaint filed in court late last month.“Attached to the email was a machine drawing of what purported to be an Otto circuit board... that bore a striking resemblance to ― and shared several unique characteristics with ― Waymo’s highly confidential current-generation LiDAR circuit board, the design of which had been downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before his resignation.”“Mr. Levandowski” is Anthony Levandowski, a former Waymo engineer now at the center of a brewing showdown between Google and Uber. Levandowski abruptly resigned from Waymo in January 2016, then founded Otto and sold it to Uber for $680 million that summer. (You can read a complete, surprisingly riveting timeline of the saga here, via the New Zealand tech blogger Daniel Compton.)The vendor’s misaddressed email has spurred an investigation by Waymo into Levandowski’s activities. Waymo declined to speak about the email or the ensuing investigation, instead directing The Huffington Post to a company blog post on the matter:We found that six weeks before his resignation this former employee, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo’s LiDAR and circuit board. To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialized software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints.Adding to the intrigue, a former Waymo colleague of Levandowski’s testified last Friday that Levandowski had discussed “replicating” the LiDAR technology at a new company, and that an Uber executive had approached him about “buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at Google.”Levandowski was more than a mid-level engineer at Waymo. In many respects, he’s responsible for Google’s entire self-driving project.In 2008, Levandowski cobbled together a self-driving Toyota Prius in his spare time. He went on to wow Google with a demonstration in which the Prius autonomously delivered a pizza, successfully navigating the streets of downtown San Francisco using an early version of LiDAR.“The technology for being able to improve your convenience and safety while on the freeway is just around the corner,” he told CNET at the time. “I want to be the one to provide that.”All of which is to say: Levandowski brought considerable knowledge to Uber, Waymo files or no.Uber didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article, but in a late February interview with Forbes, Levandowski adamantly denied stealing any of Google’s technology.“We did not steal any Google [intellectual property],” he said. “Just want to make sure, super clear on that. We built everything from scratch and we have all of the logs to make that ― just to be super clear.”(It’s unclear what logs Levandowski is referring to. Last Friday, Google submitted testimony from a forensics security engineer analyzing the company’s own logs of Levandowski’s behavior, including the downloading of 9.7 gigabytes of data described above.)Uber has also dismissed the accusations as “a baseless attempt to slow down a competitor.” Indeed, Reuters notes that in May 2016, Uber acquired a little-known company by the name of Tyto Lidar LLC, which holds a LiDAR patent that could help the company rebut Waymo’s accusations.Last week, Google filed an injunction in California, asking the court to halt Uber’s self-driving program. A ruling in Waymo’s favor could deliver a devastating blow to Uber, setting it back several years in its development of autonomous technology, and hindering its ability to raise more money from a pool of undoubtedly increasingly uneasy investors.Should this turn into a protracted legal battle, it’s hard to think of a worse adversary for Uber than one of the world’s richest and most powerful companies. The case is scheduled for a hearing April 27."

It’s fake. It’s a lie. It’s bullshit. It’s not real,” Williams said.“And it’s been created to ... preserve the status quo and to stop black, brown and poor people from having access,” he continued. “All of these things are a part of a thread, when you talk about police accountability, anything, part of a thread of people having to spend their entire life fighting for the rights they already supposedly have ― exhausting themselves just to have the thing that you said that we had when we were born.”President Donald Trump has alleged that between 3 million and 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 election. With no evidence to back his claim, he vowed to launch an investigation into widespread voter fraud. But evidence of voter suppression is aplenty. November’s election was the first presidential election in 50 years without the full protection of the Voting Rights Act. This meant more barriers that eligible voters had to get around in states with new restrictions, like North Carolina, Wisconsin and Florida. Voter ID laws, a reduced number of polling sites and permanent disenfranchisement are just a few factors that blocked millions of Americans’ right to vote.Watch Williams’ full interview with Noah here.

It’s not that he doesn’t appreciate the accolades. He just finds them a bit odd. “I thought that’s what we’re supposed to be,” Biden said during a speech Wednesday at Research!America’s 21st annual Advocacy Awards.“The idea that Notre Dame would say, ‘Joe Biden and John Boehner, they actually get along so we should give them an award?’” Biden continued, referring to the Republican former House speaker. “There’s something really wrong with what we’ve allowed to have happen here.” The Republican and Democratic parties are now more polarized than they’ve been in decades, a 2016 report found. But amid all the animosity and chaos, Biden sees one area where the two can — and should — continue to get things done. “Folks, there’s one bipartisan thing left in America: Cancer,” he whispered during his speech, as if unveiling top secret information. “Not a joke. Not a joke. And we have some really, really responsible, informed and persuasive leaders in the Republican Party.” Biden was among the honorees at Wednesday’s dinner, where the nonprofit health advocacy group presented him with its Gordon and Llura Gund Leadership Award for his “commitment to accelerating cancer research as the driving force behind the White House Cancer Moonshot.” His 46-year-old son, Beau Biden, died of brain cancer in 2015. Since then, the former vice president has become a champion in the fight against the disease. He’s presided over the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act, a bill that commits billions to medical research and the “cancer moonshot” initiative. He has since announced plans for the Biden Cancer Initiative, which will aim to increase collaboration and access to data, break down barriers and speed up cancer research. Biden said he’s in this fight for the long haul and optimistic about the future.“I think it’s because the American people believe what I’ve come to know as well — that we are on the cusp of a major breakthrough and progress,” he said. “This is not the time to let up, this is a time to redouble our efforts.”Biden also echoed a comment he made over the weekend about his only regret of not running for president in 2016: That he wouldn’t get to preside over ending cancer as we know it. “This is within our power,” he said of tackling the disease. “It’s within our grasp.”"

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/legal-services-corporation-trump-budget_us_58cabca5e4b00705db4cef22,"If the Trump administration gets its way, the Legal Services Corporation is getting the axe.",2017-03-16,The Legal Services Corporation requested $502 million for fiscal year 2017. The Trump budget released Thursday suggests Congress cut the group's funding altogether.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cad1591d00001d107cece5.jpeg?cache=AFEXBzuX0N&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― About two weeks ago, as the White House Office of Management and Budget was reaching out to federal agencies about their budget proposals, the head of the Legal Services Corporation began to worry. The LSC, an independent nonprofit established by Congress in 1974, provides legal assistance to impoverished Americans, funding 134 civil legal aid programs across the county. As other federal agencies were in communication with the Trump administration about their budgets, LSC had been in the dark.“We didn’t hear anything, we got no response at all to our request,” said LSC president Jim Sandman. “It seemed to be a signal, and it turned out it was.”The Trump administration unveiled its budget proposal on Thursday, suggesting Congress fully eliminate funding for LSC. Legal Services Corporation had requested $502 million for fiscal year 2017, and had been given $385 million in the 2016 fiscal year. That works out to just over $1.20 per American per year.The American Bar Association said the organization’s leaders were “outraged” that the funding was eliminated in Trump’s proposed budget. “LSC provides civil legal aid to people who desperately need help to navigate the legal process. Without this assistance, court house doors will slam in the faces of millions of Americans, denying them equal access to justice,” the ABA said in a press release. Christine Hines, the legislative director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, said it would be “cruel” to eliminate LSC’s funding. “LSC programs across the country help Americans with serious troubles ranging from domestic violence, housing and foreclosure, and harm caused by predatory financial services practices, such as abusive debt collection and debt traps,” she said. Sandman said the LSC ensures “fairness” in the justice system.“We fund the provision of legal assistance to people who can’t afford to pay for a lawyer and are facing significant legal issues: things like needing a protection order against an abuser, people facing wrongful eviction or foreclosure, survivors of disaster who need legal assistance in restoring their legal documents and getting access to federal benefits; representing veterans who have been denied the benefits they earned through their service in the military,” Sandman said.“We have a legal system that requires legal assistance to be able to access it in a meaningful way,” he added. “It was a system created by lawyers, for lawyers, that assumes you have a lawyer, and if you don’t, the system doesn’t work for you.”Legal aid is all about getting legal assistance to people “who don’t have the means to be able to afford a lawyer,” Sandman said. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she was troubled by Trump’s proposed elimination of the LSC. “Every person in our country should be treated equally under the law — so it is deeply disappointing that President Trump’s proposed budget would make it even harder for our most vulnerable populations to navigate the justice system. This is yet another step away from justice by an Administration that has taken far too many,” Murray said.Sandman told The Huffington Post that the percentage of funding LSC provides to civil legal aid programs varies across the country, meaning certain areas would feel the impact of the LSC’s elimination much more severely ― including in parts of the country that went for President Donald Trump. “On average, they get about 38 percent of their funding from us, but that percentage varies tremendously across the country. In 12 states, our grantees get more than half their funding from us. In a place like Alabama, our grantee gets more than 80 percent of its funding from us. So yes, our impact is felt disproportionately in rural areas,” Sandman said.Artur Davis, a former member of Congress who now serves as the executive director of Legal Services Alabama, recently wrote that his group serves roughly 11,000 people per year.“They include veterans who have drifted into homelessness: a few weeks ago, five of our lawyers in Birmingham devoted a day to a clinic for these ex-servicemen who are facing very hard times,” Davis wrote. “The single largest share of our attorney hours are spent on victims of domestic violence, and the largest section of this group is mothers who need court intervention to make their abusers stay away from them and their children.”Sandman said his office had been in constant contact with congressional offices this year, and will be making the case to protect their funding. “We have good relationships and we have been meeting with a number of members of Congress and their staffs this year, and the feedback that we’ve gotten is very positive,” Sandman said. Sandman said LSC will work to highlight the role it plays to the public and members of Congress as the budget process plays out.“People need to understand that what the Legal Services Corporation is about is fairness in the justice system, whether we mean it when we say we’re a nation with justice for all,” Sandman said. “We’re as American as the Fourth of July.”This story has been updated to include comment from Murray."
41,POLITICS,Court Ruling May Force Trump To Admit The Number Of Refugees Obama Wanted,Elise Foley and Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-refugee-ban-ruling_us_58cadf7ce4b00705db4d6ebd,A Hawaii federal court temporarily blocked the latest travel ban.,2017-03-16,Protesters rally in Philadelphia against President Donald Trump's initial executive order barring refugees and certain foreign travelers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58caef09140000200006fe7a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal judge’s ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s new travel and refugee ban could end up requiring the president to welcome a much larger number of refugees than he had envisioned. That’s the reading refugee resettlement organization officials have taken from the ruling, which came down late Wednesday night ― hours before the executive order was supposed to go into effect. They argue that the decision by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii should lead to the government reinstating its initial cap of admitting 110,000 refugees this fiscal year, set by President Barack Obama. In his executive order, Trump had cut that cap to 50,000 refugees ― a decision that could lead to tens of thousands of people remaining in refugee camps, often separated from family in the U.S. Watson’s ruling doesn’t address the refugee numbers specifically, but it blocks implementation of two full sections of the executive order, including the one that includes the new admissions cap. The ruling is based on a finding that the president’s statements on Muslims likely amounted to unconstitutional animus toward a religious group.If the correct reading of the ruling is that the refugee numbers must go back to pre-executive order levels, and if Trump’s administration continues to process refugees at a glacial pace, the government would be in violation of a court order. And if Trump tries to cut the admissions cap again, he could run into the same problem he did with the executive order ― namely, that his past statements on Muslims could demonstrate that admitting fewer refugees is based on religious animus.Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy at the refugee resettlement organization Church World Service, compared it to laws that dictate that an employer can fire employees but not based on their religion.“Sure, usually the administration sets the numbers, but if they’re setting the numbers as a means to discriminate against people based on their nationality or religion ― which is what they’ve forecast in numerous public statements, then that’s not OK,” she said. “That’s against the law.” Officials at the State Department, which handles much of refugee resettlement, have not said specifically what refugee cap they are operating under. But they said they will comply with the ruling. Mark Toner, acting spokesman for the department, said in a statement that the Department of Justice “advised that all enforcement of [the two sections of the order] must cease immediately.”“As a result, refugees will continue to arrive in the United States under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,” Toner said. “We are working closely with our legal teams as well as our interagency and overseas partners to comply with the order.”It could be difficult to set an exact definition for what non-compliance would look like, but refugee resettlement organizations said they’ll be watching closely to see whether the government starts ramping up admissions efforts. That might not mean an instant increase in the number of refugees admitted to the country, but they do expect to see more processing efforts overseas, aligned with reverting the cap to 110,000. “We’re cautiously optimistic but with emphasis on the caution,” said Kay Bellor, vice president of programs at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. “A lot has to happen before we see something that really tells us 50,000 is no longer the operating number.”Since Trump’s first immigration executive order, the government has admitted only up to 400 refugees per week. Should they continue at that rate, it would be impossible to get to 110,000 this year. There are about 26 weeks remaining in the fiscal year, meaning that, if the current rate holds, only about 10,400 refugees could be resettled between now and when the 110,000 quota expires. Meanwhile, more than 37,000 refugees have already been resettled, according to Refugee Processing Center statistics, leaving about 73,000 slots still available.“There are literally thousands who have been totally cleared [for travel] and have followed all the rules,” said Mark Hetfield, CEO of HIAS, one of the resettlement agencies. The 400 weekly figure is “a totally artificial number and that’s what has to stop.”He and other leaders said they’re urging the State Department to begin booking travel for refugees.If these processing efforts don’t resume, opponents of the order will bring it up in future court proceedings, said Melissa Keaney, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which is working with the American Civil Liberties Union on a lawsuit against the ban in Maryland.Their lawsuit asks that the entire order be blocked, and specifically argues that the administration cannot slash the refugee admission cap midway through the fiscal year because of immediate harm to their clients, including resettlement organizations. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, who as part of their lawsuit issued an order early Wednesday blocking the 90-day travel ban in Trump’s order, will hear arguments on the refugee admission cap element of their suit on March 28. They plan to ask for an injunction on the order. “If the federal government is not abiding by the [Hawaii court ruling] ... then I think that’s going to factor heavily into the judge’s decision about the need for his court to act as well,” Keaney said.A primary concern for refugee advocates is what will happen for refugees whose security checks expire while they wait for their travel to be booked. Because refugees are screened in stages, approval at each step is valid for a limited period ― for example, their interview is valid for 15 months and their medical clearance is valid for 90 days. If those expire, they have to start the process over again, further delaying their final approval. One thing is clear: The limbo that thousands of refugees have been thrown into as a result of Trump’s executive orders and their temporary blocks isn’t going away anytime soon. And the longer that people have to wait for resettlement, the more danger and insecurity they are subjected to.Abdul Ghani Abdul Jawad, a Syrian refugee, is facing such a situation. He was cleared to fly to Buffalo, New York, with his family in December, with both of his sons suffering from a rare genetic disorder called Omenn syndrome and requiring bone marrow transplants to survive. The youngest was deemed too sick to fly, so their trip was postponed to Feb. 1 ― only a few days after Trump’s first try at a travel ban, unveiled on Jan. 27. Their trip was canceled.Their older son, Yahya, 6, died in a Turkish intensive care unit last month. On top of that, Abdul Jawad’s family’s clearances may have lapsed. Given the urgency of his son’s medical situation, the United Nations Refugee Agency is now trying to move them to Germany.“I’ve been struggling for the past two years to go to America,” Abdul Jawad told Al-Jazeera in Wednesday’s episode of “Fault Lines,” the network’s documentary series. “Every time I talk to the NGOs, they tell me your case is strong and it is urgent, urgent, urgent. I was devastated.”"

He said his son has a history of abusing drugs and soliciting himself for sex on Craig’s List, an online classified advertisements service.According to the Senate’s website, Shortey attended a Baptist Bible College in Oklahoma City before providing mission work overseas. He also was an early supporter of Trump during the president’s primary campaign, having joined a list of 23 Oklahoma leaders in 2015, according to Trump’s website.A photo posted to Shortey’s Facebook page one day after his alleged motel meeting last week showed him posing with Trump’s son, Donald Jr., whom he said he was honored to have had lunch with, the New York Daily News reported.

He also was an early supporter of Trump during the president’s primary campaign, having joined a list of 23 Oklahoma leaders in 2015, according to Trump’s website.A photo posted to Shortey’s Facebook page one day after his alleged motel meeting last week showed him posing with Trump’s son, Donald Jr., whom he said he was honored to have had lunch with, the New York Daily News reported. On Wednesday, the state Senate voted to suspend Shortey from all committees and remove his name from legislation, KFOR reported.A message left with his office on Thursday morning was not immediately returned.This story has been updated to include information about Shortey’s endorsement of Trump.

That’s why the 30-year-old Muslim mother is teaming up with a community organization in Pittsburgh to launch Hello Hijab, a tiny headscarf that can be used on Barbies and other children’s toys.Bokhari told The Huffington Post that she hopes Hello Hijab will be used by both Muslims and non-Muslims, so that children get used to the sight of women wearing the headscarf. “The idea of kids and girls playing with the hijab and the hijab becoming something usual, I think it will make a difference in the future,” Bokhari said. “It won’t be a problem for my daughter, if she wants to wear hijab, it wouldn’t be considered something strange.” Bokhari and her friend, Gisele Fetterman, both have 5-year-old daughters who like playing with dolls. Fetterman came up with the idea to create a doll-sized headscarf that kids can use during playtime, with the proceeds from the sales going to charity. Bokhari said she was on board with the project.“I was very happy because, you know, you can’t be creative if you’re scared,” she told The Huffington Post. Bokhari and Fetterman found a Muslim seamstress in Pittsburgh who could create the scarves.

The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities are among 19 bodies slated to be defunded entirely under Trump’s proposal, along with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Institute of Museum and Library Services.When reports initially surfaced in January that the NEA and NEH might be targeted for elimination, arts advocates pushed back, noting that the two agencies combined only account for a fraction of 1 percent of the budget while providing irreplaceable support for local arts, culture and education programs around the country.In fiscal year 2015, NEA grants reached every county in the country, many through partnerships. State and local arts organizations partially depend on federal funding to sustain accessible arts programs throughout the country ― not just in major metropolitan areas. The NEA targets roughly half of its grants to programs that will reach underserved communities through arts and literacy education, local theater and performance, and radio and TV broadcasts of arts programming. Meanwhile, the NEH worked directly and with local agencies to support the preservation of American history and culture, funding projects such as the digitization of the Hellen Keller Archives and the preservation of aging wax cylinder recordings of Native American languages and song.Weeks prior to the release of Trump’s budget proposal, arts advocacy groups scrambled to defend the institutions’ value, not only culturally but economically, as the funding also stimulates the arts marketplace.The NEH supports “humanities work in small towns all around the country,” Stephen Kidd, the executive director of the National Humanities Alliance, told HuffPost in January. Whether the organization is providing crucial funding to local historical societies preserving pockets of American history, ensuring students have access to decades of newspaper articles for research, or helping veterans cope with war trauma through literature, Kidd said, “there really aren’t other funders out there that are supporting that kind of work on that kind of scale.”PEN America director Suzanne Nossel agreed, telling HuffPost that the agencies “fund things that can’t attract for-profit dollars,” ensuring that culturally significant arts organizations aren’t utterly dependent on attracting philanthropic contributions from wealthy donors.Both the NEA and NEH had remained publicly optimistic and refrained from what the agencies termed “speculation” on federal appropriations for 2018. However, upon the release of the president’s budget proposal, NEA chairman Jane Chu noted in a statement that “[a]s a federal government agency, the NEA cannot engage in advocacy, either directly or indirectly.” Nonetheless, she commented that the institution is “disappointed ... we see our funding actively making a difference with individuals of all ages in thousands of communities, large, small, urban and rural, and in every Congressional District in the nation.”In a separate statement, NEH chairman William D. Adams commented, “We are greatly saddened to learn of this proposal for elimination ... But as an agency of the executive branch, we answer to the President and the Office of Management and Budget.”Though the endowments themselves cannot advocate, advocacy groups are amping up their mobilization.“The elimination of the NEA and the NEH under the proposed federal budget would be a betrayal of the U.S. government’s long history of bipartisan support for innovation in the arts and for groundbreaking research, and could threaten the future of some of the most treasured national institutions,”  PEN America’s Nossel stated Thursday in a press release urging continued action.Approval of a federal budget ultimately falls to Congress, not the president. Though both houses are currently held by the president’s own party, many Republicans in the House and Senate have already voiced discomfort with elements of his proposed budget. And while the NEH and NEA have previously been targeted for elimination by right-wing politicians, they have always enjoyed enough bipartisan support to escape the axe.Advocates now hope that the same will hold true in congressional battles over the final fiscal year 2018 budget. It takes effect Oct. 1."

So Atwood visited each of his famous subjects in their respective homes for Kings & Queens in Their Castles, which hits retailers April 25. The finished collection, he said, took 12 years to complete and required him to travel to 30 states across the country. “The primary responsibility I felt was to portray subjects as they truly are, how they really live… to capture moments that reflect their everyday lives,” Atwood told The Huffington Post. “A lot of LGBTQ photography depicts scantily-clothed young subjects and seems to emphasize nudity and sexuality. I wanted to offer a different perspective.”Many of Atwood’s subjects, such as former U.S. congressman Barney Frank and Fun Home author and cartoonist Alison Bechdel, reside far from the urban confines of New York and Los Angeles. As time-consuming as the travel was, Atwood said he didn’t want geography to limit the scope of the subjects he included, and ultimately, he found each home as fascinating as its occupant. The photographer, who resides in New York, may have picked up some decor and style tips along the way, too. “Many gay men and women have a flair for design and have crafted some of the most intriguing living spaces in this country, which appealed to me aesthetically,” he told HuffPost. “For a community sometimes obsessed with image and beauty, our living spaces can also be the ultimate in self-expression... many of these subjects have crafted playful, often outlandish homes that tell stories about their inhabitants.” The book’s allusion to royalty, he said, was meant as a tongue-in-cheek metaphor. Still, he added, “Many of the subjects are ‘kings or queens’ of their professions — leading actors, writers, designers, politicians or journalists.” Atwood, who cited Simen Johan, Arnold Newman and David LaChapelle as artistic influences, said President Donald Trump’s rise to power makes the Kings & Queens in Their Castles “all the more necessary.” For those who support Trump, he hopes the book “reminds them that there are LGBTQ folks living in their communities who are just like them in many ways.”Check out some photos from Kings & Queens in Their Castles below.

Commandant General Robert Neller, vowed to hold Marines accountable for the recent nude photo-sharing scandal.But, his passionate pledge only came after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) ripped into the general for the Marine Corps’ failure to protect its female members. “There’s no mystery this has been going on for a very long time,” Sen. Gillibrand told Neller during the hearing. The Marines have been aware of the online exploitation of female Marines for the past four years, Sen. Gillibrand said, holding up a 2013 letter from a female Marine to a commander detailing the harassment she was receiving online. “It is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female marines who will give their life to this country in the way they have with no response from leadership,” Sen. Gillibrand said, visibly shaking in anger. “I can tell you, your answers today are unsatisfactory. They do not go far enough.” Watch the full exchange below. The scandal broke last week when it was revealed that hundreds of veteran and active-duty Marines were sharing nude photos of female Marines without their consent in a private Facebook group titled “Marines United.”According to a Business Insider report published last week, the scandal goes beyond just one Facebook group: Hundreds of nude photos of female Marines have been shared on a site called AnonIB dating back to May 2016. In another report from Navy Times published Tuesday, it was revealed that nude photos were also shared on sites like 4chan and Tumblr, along with male Marines’ personal Google Drives. Sen. Gillibrand took Neller to task for what she sees as the ongoing inability of the military to hold perpetrators who exploit other members of the military accountable for their actions.“Where’s the accountability for failure? Who is being held accountable for doing nothing since 2013? Who? Which commander?” she said. “I am very concerned that this is part of a culture that is resulting in the high levels of sexual assault.”In response, Neller admitted that this is most definitely a problem with the Marines’ culture. “I don’t have a good answer for you. I’m not going to sit here and duck around this thing, I’m not. I’m responsible,” he told Sen. Gillibrand. “We’re going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we treat each other. That’s a lame answer, but ma’am, that’s the best I can tell you right now. We’ve got to change and that’s on me.”"
52,POLITICS,Trump Wants To Neuter The State Department. Putin Would Love That.,Akbar Shahid Ahmed,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-budget-cut-state-department_us_58cabd6ee4b0ec9d29d9874f,Weakening the agency reduces U.S. influence on the direction of global affairs and Washington's ability to promote human rights.,2017-03-16,Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has attended international meetings with smaller staffs than usual. Experts say other powers could read into that.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cae7221d0000f42c7ced46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In his first months in office, President Donald Trump has cut the State Department out of major decisions, sharply reduced State officials’ access to the press and said many of the agency’s jobs serve no purpose. His budget, released Thursday, calls for a 28 percent cut to funding for the diplomatic agency that he and others have long caricatured as feckless.But Trump’s characterization of the State Department as weak and useless bears little connection to reality. Instead, in neutering State, Trump is weakening the agency that U.S.-friendly governments and activists abroad rely on most. It also happens to be the department that Russian President Vladimir Putin and other autocrats most hate.State helps define America’s positions on matters of war, peace and human rights. The agency provides guidance to top U.S. officials, offering advice that’s shaped by deep familiarity with the outside world ― not domestic politics. And State provides a daily press briefing that makes the U.S. voice a dominant feature of the global conversation and signals that the world’s most powerful nation is committed to transparency.When State draws on its foreign affairs expertise and makes its views known, it can be hugely influential ― and threatening to America’s rivals. Take Putin, for example. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton repeatedly challenged the Russian president’s crackdown on domestic dissent, abruptly ending a meeting with Putin’s foreign minister after he told her Moscow was ejecting U.S. officials supporting Russian civil society, and even going so far as to endorse independent assessments that Russian elections were rigged. Victoria Nuland, a diplomat who spent decades at State, was the loudest American critic of Putin’s intervention in Ukraine, becoming the first U.S. official to call it what it was: an invasion. Without employing the threat of military force, both women weakened Putin by exposing his fear of his own under-served people and his need to deploy misleading narratives.Putin retaliated. When Nuland took over Ukraine policy, a recording of her saying “Fuck the E.U.” surfaced — a move she and other experts called a transparent Russian attempt to discredit her. Clinton, meanwhile, became a frequent specter in Putin’s speeches, someone he regularly referred to as actively directing the work of his political opponents. According to the U.S. intelligence community, Putin launched a hacking campaign to undermine Clinton in last year’s presidential election. And when Nuland left her job after Trump’s win, the Kremlin-backed news outlet RT published a story celebrating her departure.Conversely, silencing and undercutting State leads to confusion abroad ― and emboldens U.S. foes. The world does not stop spinning for President Donald Trump: State went 45 days without a press briefing after Trump was sworn into office, and that meant crises in Syria, Ukraine, South Sudan and other hotspots continued to evolve without clear American direction. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s arrival at international meetings without a standard staff could be interpreted as a sign of his relative weakness, causing more chaos. “With the Chinese, protocol is policy,” a mid-level State officer told the Atlantic. “We’re sending signals that are potentially damaging the relationship in ways we can’t anticipate.”The State Department also saves lives. An American diplomat’s engagement can literally mean the difference between life and death for activists and political dissidents fighting for foreign societies to look more like the U.S. Inquiries about the murder of a journalist or a friendly government’s use of torture rarely make the cut at White House or Pentagon press briefings. But at State, reporters can get officials on the record on those developments. The briefings allow Washington to show that it cares about everyday citizens abroad, undercutting the efforts of strongmen like Putin to turn people against democracy and the U.S. and of extremist recruiters in the Muslim-majority world to portray unpopular ruling regimes as stooges of an unsympathetic American empire.The agency’s outreach to all kinds of citizens ― not just governments ― in foreign societies amplifies that effect. “For some people, for example activists, a relationship with the State Department can be the difference between being able to do one’s work and not being able to do it,” said David Kramer, the head of the department’s human rights, democracy and labor bureau under President George W. Bush. “The U.S. government is often the source of not only financial support, but moral and political support for activists overseas.”“Even just a mention in the press briefing, one line, even if it’s the same line of, ‘Yes, we’re following their case,’ it steels their resolve,” said Cole Bockenfeld, the deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy, describing his work with human rights workers in tightly controlled countries like Egypt and Bahrain.The department is able to push even America’s closest allies to respect human rights and the rule of law ― improving the lives of dissidents and political minorities without permanently damaging key relationships, and helping to ensure the health of societies that are important to U.S. global influence. As the only arm of the U.S. government to regularly call for reform from the repressive regime of U.S. ally Bahrain (and its patron, Saudi Arabia), for instance, State has pushed for more accountability in the kingdom. After Obama-era human rights official Tom Malinowski met with the leader of the country’s chief opposition party in 2014, Bahrain expelled Malinowski. But after then-Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call, the government granted Malinowski access for a new trip.In the summer and fall of 2014, as Israel launched its latest attack on Gaza and tensions in the region were running high, State demanded justice for American citizen Tariq Abu Kheidr, a 15-year-old who had been assaulted by an Israeli police officer. When an Israeli court cleared the officer of wrongdoing in 2015, State loudly condemned the decision.The department is also the public face of the U.S. government abroad ― handling visa requests, promoting American businesses and generally trying to make the country (and the president) look good. “The State Department, particularly through its embassies, is often the first exposure that people overseas have to the United States,” said Kramer, now the senior director for human rights and democracy at the McCain Institute think tank.Tillerson appears unenthusiastic about that public role. In breaks from tradition, the widely criticized new secretary did not attend the rollout of State’s annual human rights report and prevented reporters from accompanying him on a trip to Asia, after being caught on camera twice dodging questions from veteran foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell. Since his takeover, the department has announced that it will have fewer briefings and make many of them off-camera. It “makes it hard to receive a clear picture about [the] US position,” Tehran-based Iranian journalist Sadegh Ghorbani told HuffPost. Perhaps most importantly, State does what it’s always done: negotiate deals with other countries to end old conflicts and prevent new ones. The agency’s defenders note its clear wins. Western diplomatic achievements like the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the Paris climate agreement were only possible because of Kerry’s work at State, said Federiga Bindi, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Transatlantic Relations and former adviser to the Italian government. The agency also led the negotiations that allowed four Americans to come home from Iranian detention in 2016. “If you don’t fully fund the State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition,” Trump’s Defense Secretary, retired Gen. Jim Mattis, said in 2013. More than 120 generals and admirals repeated that message in a letter to lawmakers last month.In taking aim at the State Department early with budget threats and tight restrictions on hiring, Trump is signaling his vision: military force and quick fixes over the long-term gains of diplomacy, carte blanche for authoritarian leaders who serve his agenda, and a smaller U.S. role in tackling global problems. This approach aligns with the ideology of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who hopes for “the deconstruction of the administrative state” and wants to avoid the kind of State official he sees as “a globalist, an interventionist, a neoconservative.” If the argument that U.S. engagement abroad is an undesirable interference sounds familiar, there’s a reason: It’s the one authoritarian rulers like Putin (and their defenders on the far right and the far left in the U.S.) often cite when they respond to State complaints. “These kinds of regimes find it difficult to accept that their own people might demand positive change and liberalization and reform, and so they accuse the United States of spawning and fomenting these kinds of protests,” Kramer said. “It’s not a new criticism, but I think it has picked up in intensity. It’s convenient for these leaders to point the finger at Washington and blame the State Department.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

They also cooked your food and served you today.” This small message is a significant stance in the state of New Mexico, which is at the center of the immigration debate. General manager Belinda Marshall told Grubstreet that they wanted to give “credit where credit is due.” They were inspired by Chef Mark Simmons’ message printed at the bottom of his Brooklyn restaurant Kiwiana’s receipt. Marshall told Grubstreet she was nervous that her restaurant might get some backlash from the message, but so far the response has been nothing but positive.One thing we’ve learned in this current political landscape is that activism can take many forms. It can be as a big a statement as millions participating in the Women’s March. It can come in the form of how a bookstore sets up its window display. And it can be as small as a couple of sentences on a piece of paper. It all makes a difference. And size, even when it comes to Trump’s tiny hands, really doesn’t matter."
54,POLITICS,Texas Police Ask The State Not To Crack Down On Sanctuary Cities,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-ask-texas-not-to-crack-down-on-sanctuary-cities_us_58c9ef14e4b0ec9d29d8a234,"For the second time in six weeks, hundreds of people registered their opposition to a Republican-backed immigration crackdown.",2017-03-16,"The Texas State Capitol is seen through the trees on Feb. 22 in Austin, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9f03e140000200006fc01.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A parade of Texas law enforcement officials once again registered their opposition Wednesday to a Republican-backed effort to crack down on “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities. But conservative lawmakers seem poised to ignore them.SB 4, which would fine local officials that refuse to comply with “detainer” requests to hold undocumented immigrants on behalf of the federal government, has already passed the full state Senate. The House State Affairs hearing Wednesday marked the bill’s first step on its way through the legislature’s lower house. Most of the state’s Republican lawmakers view it as a commonsensical effort to enforce the immigration laws already on the books.But several police officials from the state’s largest cities have cautioned that the law would make their jobs more difficult by alienating immigrants and making law enforcement vulnerable to liability for increased racial profiling that they say will likely accompany the bill’s implementation ― criticisms widely shared by legal experts and immigrant families. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said pressing his officers to help enforce immigration law would distract them from their core responsibilities. “It’s going to pull my officers away from their more important duties of combating crime,” Manley said. Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said passing the bill would alienate immigrants, as the police would begin taking on a greater role in federal immigration enforcement.“It’s imperative that we maintain trust with the communities we serve,” Salazar told the committee. “We risk driving this segment of the population into the shadows. … I have seen examples where victims of domestic violence are told by their abuser, ‘Go ahead and call the cops. You know where you’re going.’”Ed Gonzalez, the sheriff of Harris County, which includes Houston, said he suspected the bill would make the state less safe by making unauthorized immigrants fearful of calling the police if they see a crime. “I think that inherently when someone witnesses something traumatic, there’s already going to be fear,” Gonzalez said, “let alone when they fear they themselves will be deported.” One woman described suffering precisely that experience. She told the committee that it took three years for her to find the courage to call the police to report an abusive partner ― even after he held a gun toward her, threatening to shoot her and then himself if she left him. “I was worried that if I called the police, I would be asked about my immigration status and then deported,” she said. “You will be empowering the abusers and giving them another tool to carry out their abuse [if you pass SB 4].” Legal experts also cautioned that letting police play a greater role in federal immigration enforcement would open the state up to lawsuits. “Let’s be clear,” Celina Moreno, an attorney with the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said. “Racial profiling is a foreseeable consequence of SB 4.” Kali Cohn, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, added that jurisdictions that honor all requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold undocumented immigrants can be sued for violating the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees protection from unlawful searches and detention. “An ICE detainer asks a local law enforcement agency to hold someone for 48 hours,” Cohn said. “But when those additional 48 hours begin, local law enforcement still need probable cause to make that detention. The problem is they can’t point to probable cause because ICE detainers are not supported by probable cause.” Several Texans who either have undocumented family members or were undocumented themselves said the bill would threaten their safety. “My dad isn’t an alien,” one young girl said through tears. “He’s a human being and he should be treated like one.” The vast majority of those who testified asked the legislature to abandon the bill. Of 638 who registered, only 11 urged lawmakers to pass the bill, according to Texas state Rep. Rafael Anchia (D-Dallas). The hearing continued well into the evening. Opposition from law enforcement notwithstanding, Texas lawmakers are likely to pass the measure against sanctuary cities. Republicans have tried to ban sanctuary cities for years, despite the fact that the vast majority of local officials honor virtually all federal requests to hold undocumented immigrants in local jails on behalf of ICE. But conservative efforts to pass such legislation have failed in the past because Democrats had enough votes to block floor debate in the state Senate. Last year, Republicans loosened the century-long tradition of requiring the votes of two-thirds of the state Senate to make it easier to pass a conservative agenda, in a state where they control all three branches of government. Despite conservative emphasis on ridding the state of cities with liberal immigration policies, currently the only jurisdiction to limit its cooperation with ICE is Travis County, where Austin is. In January, Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez adopted a policy of declining to hold immigrants for ICE if they qualify for release or bond, unless they are convicted or charged with one of a short list of crimes including murder, sexual assault and human trafficking. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) responded by stripping the county of $1.5 million in state grants and threatening to find a way to remove Hernandez from office. "

The budget proposed steep and sweeping cuts across the executive branch. But the Environmental Protection Agency suffered the biggest blow, losing 31 percent of its funding. The agency is seen as the spear tip of the “administrative state” President Donald Trump vowed to dismantle.The Trump administration’s preliminary skinny budget, released at 7 a.m. on Thursday, reduces the EPA funding from $8.2 billion to $5.7 billion and guts climate change programs across a slew of other federal agencies. “We’re not spending money on that anymore,” Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said of efforts to prevent climate change from worsening. “We consider that to be a waste of your money.”The new budget eliminates funding for regional cleanup efforts in the Great Lakes, the Long Island Sound and Chesapeake Bay, for example, and defunds the Clean Power Plan, the federal government’s only major effort to reduce carbon emissions from the utility sector. Trump is expected to sign an executive order further weakening the Clean Power Plan as early as this week. The order will reportedly instruct the EPA to begin rewriting the plan, which would have reduced the greenhouse gas emissions from the utility sector ― the biggest industry emitter in the U.S. ― by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.The move essentially kneecaps U.S. participation Paris Agreement on climate change that 195 countries signed. The budget dramatically shrinks the State Department. It eliminates spending on the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Global Climate Change Initiative and ceases payments to the United Nations’ climate change programs, such as the Green Climate Fund ― a critical tool for getting poorer countries to reduce their carbon footprint.At the EPA alone, the budget axes funding for Energy Star, the popular, voluntary program that boosts energy efficiency in appliances, electronics and buildings. It also ends grants for ozone pollution cleanup and infrastructure assistance to Alaska Native villages and people on the Mexican border, along with international climate programs, climate change research and partnership initiatives. It “reins in” spending on the toxic waste cleanup Superfund, lowballing the account by $330 million. In all, the proposed budget terminates more than 50 EPA programs. The cuts go further than the 25 percent reduction originally proposed in a draft of the budget earlier this month. Administrator Scott Pruitt ― an opponent of the agency’s core mission who previously sued the EPA 13 times to block environmental regulations ― failed to persuade Trump to leave the budget at $7 billion, according to The New York Times. Instead, the president axed more. The budget proposes adding $4 million to the State Revolving Funds programs that provide low-interest loans for investments in water and sanitation infrastructure, increasing it to $2.3 billion. It also leaves in place $20 million for rebuilding water infrastructure ― an issue that reached crisis pitch with the lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan, last year.Gina McCarthy, who served as EPA administrator until January, issued a scathing response to the budget plan.“Literally and figuratively, this is a scorched earth budget that represents an all out assault on clean air, water, and land,” she said in a statement. “You can’t put ‘America First’ when you put the health of [its] people and its country last.”The EPA’s budget last year was already well below its 2010 peak of nearly $10.3 billion, and critics of the cuts said the agency requires more funding, not less. “The problem at EPA is not that it has too much power, but that it doesn’t have enough resources to do an adequate job of protecting our air, water and irreplaceable natural resources,” Ken Cook, president of the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, said in a statement. “This is not a philosophical debate about regulations or ‘deconstructing government,’ but about our health, our safety and the world we’re going to leave to our children.”Trump pledged to boost the U.S. economy by shredding environmental rules he blames for holding back businesses. He stacked his Cabinet with fossil fuel allies and climate science deniers, including Pruitt, who ignited a firestorm when he said on national TV that he doesn’t believe carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming. Already, the Trump administration has lifted regulations to protect streams and waterways from toxic pollution and scrapped a rule requiring oil and gas drillers to report methane leaks. But the budget proposal marks the first time he has put vague, sometimes contradictory campaign promises into clear, black-and-white spending priorities.The Department of Energy’s climate and renewables research took crippling hits. Trump proposed eliminating the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, known as ARPA-E, a critical program responsible for major breakthroughs in energy research, and the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program. “[T]he private sector is better positioned to finance disruptive energy research and development and to commercialize innovative technologies,” the budget reads.The department’s Office of Sciences, a key funder of research, loses $900 million and must abide by new directives to limit research into energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear energy, electrical grid technology and fossil fuels to “early-stage applied energy research and development activities where the Federal role is stronger.”The budget does, however, provide $6.5 billion to clean up radioactive waste from energy research and nuclear weapons production ― money that’s also earmarked for modernizing aging nuclear facilities.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a division of the Department of Commerce, suffered major blows. The budget leaves environmental satellite programs in place only to help with weather forecasting and cuts back the use of satellites to monitor polar icecap melt. It appears to maintain funding to the National Weather Service, which Trump tweeted support for during a blizzard this week. However, it zeroes out over $250 million in targeted grants for coastal and marine management, research and education though the Sea Grant, which funds conservation efforts in the Great Lakes and on the coasts.“The Trump administration’s proposed budget would cripple the science and technology enterprise through short-sighted cuts to discovery science programs and critical mission agencies alike,” former New Jersey Congressman Rush Holt, now chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said in a statement. “The administration’s cuts threaten our nation’s ability to advance cures for disease, maintain our technological leadership, ensure a more prosperous energy future, and train the next generation of scientists and innovators to address the complex challenges we face today and in the future. The Department of the Interior ― which oversees 500 million acres of land or 20 percent of the U.S. landmass ― saw 12 percent of its budget evaporate, reducing it to $11.6 billion. That includes money to restore abandoned mining lands and some National Wildlife Refuge fund payments to local governments. The office that buys public lands would lose $120 million. Funding for National Historic Sites would be wiped out. It’s unclear whether that would affect National Historic Parks, such as the those located in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and at inventor Thomas Edison’s old home in New Jersey. At the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, funding for robotic satellites, education and Earth science programs shrank as the White House seeks a “focused, balanced” approach that “supports the priorities of the science and applications communities.”“The Trump budget deliberately eviscerates enforcement of our environmental laws — which would let many law-breakers operate with little fear of prosecution — and dismantles programs that support our most vulnerable communities from environmental hazards,” said Trip Van Noppen, president of the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, in a statement. “We call on members of Congress to stand up for the communities they represent and vigorously oppose this irresponsible plan.”This article has been updated with more details and reactions to the budget plan."

I was a tough and loving mother who taught them the value of a dollar, not to lie, cheat or steal, respect for others and other life lessons.”Ivana’s marriage to Donald Trump was reportedly not without friction; a 1993 book put forth an accusation that he had raped her, a charge she did not fully refute. The marriage ended after Donald Trump’s alleged affair with Marla Maples, who became his second wife and the mother of Tiffany Trump. In 2005, Trump married his third and current wife, Melania, with whom he has one son, Barron.Gallery Books, which will publish the book, is an imprint of recently embattled publishing giant Simon & Schuster dedicated to celebrity memoirs.

The program helps fund clean water and sewer systems in communities with less than 10,000 people.Other USDA areas targeted for cuts to reach the White House’s $17.9 billion discretionary spending budget include its statistical capabilities and staffing at its county-level service centers.The White House also said it would eliminate the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program, which provides donations of U.S. agricultural commodities to food-deficit countries. The program, which had $182 million earmarked in the fiscal-year 2017 USDA budget, “lacks evidence that it is being effectively implemented to reduce food insecurity,” the document said.The plans for spending at the USDA were released as part of Trump’s budget blueprint, a broad outline of spending proposals for the fiscal year ahead.The blueprint does not cover “mandatory” spending established by law, like farm subsidies, but only addresses “discretionary” programs where lawmakers can adjust spending from year to year.The Trump White House has said it plans to release a traditional full budget with a 10-year outlook for all government spending and revenues in mid-May.The budget plan calls for $6.2 billion in funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). That would be about $150 million less than the estimated $6.35 billion the USDA said was budgeted in fiscal 2016. Under former Democratic President Barack Obama, the program was reduced by $273 million between fiscal 2015 and 2016.The WIC program is designed to help meet the basic nutritional needs of low-income pregnant women, new mothers, infants and children up to age five.The USDA, founded in 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln, oversees the nation’s agriculture and rural communities, as well as nutritional programs, including funding for school lunches and low-income families. The agency also publishes U.S. and global farming production statistics, which are closely watched."
62,POLITICS,Ivanka Trump Said Her Dad Cared About Child Care.

His daughter Ivanka told an audience this summer at the Republican National Convention that, if elected, Trump would “focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all.” She’s been evangelizing for a policy to help parents balance work and kids ever since, part of her campaign to market herself as a champion of #WomenWhoWork. Yet on Thursday, the Trump administration sent Congress a proposed budget that cuts funding for public school programs that offer working parents, particularly low-income families, access to affordable child care. As part of a $9 billion cut to the Department of Education, Trump’s budget would eliminate funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers. Created in 1994 and costing about $1.1 billion annually, the centers provide before-school, after-school and summer programs for 1.6 million low-income children, primarily those of color, across the country. Kids who attend the centers ― most located at public schools ― learn math, science and environmental literacy, among other things. They also get fed. In short, the centers offer children in grade school and middle school a safe and secure place to go after school.After-school programs can be lifesavers for parents whose workdays don’t end when the school bell rings. They also give low-income kids, in particular, a safe and constructive place to go after school.“[Trump’s] proposal would devastate working families,” Jodi Grant, executive director of Afterschool Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in a statement Thursday. “It is painfully short-sighted and makes a mockery of the President’s promise to make our country safer and to support inner cities and rural communities alike.”Research from the nonpartisan Afterschool Alliance has shown that these programs in particular help kids raise their math and language test scores and improve school attendance rates.Trump’s budget reveals the emptiness of his previous statements on child care, Julie Kashen, policy director of Make It Work, a nonprofit advocacy campaign working toward economic security for families, told The Huffington Post.“We have seen that the plans that come out of the Trump administration are not in touch with the real needs of working parents,” she said.Ivanka Trump, who holds no official position in her father’s administration, has reportedly been working behind the scenes to advance a $500 billion child care tax credit. But a tax credit along the lines she’s proposed would likely be more beneficial for higher-income parents, who can afford to pay upfront for child care and wait a year to get a break on their taxes. Lower-income parents, many of whom pay little to nothing in federal taxes, would find a tax credit inadequate as they pay for care on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.Seventy percent of the tax benefit would go to families who make at least $100,000 a year, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center. And 25 percent would go to families earning at least $200,000. The mismatch between the school day and the workday is an ongoing challenge for working parents.“There’s nothing more killing for parents, or women in particular, than having a child that gets out of school at 2:30,” Harvard economist Claudia Goldin told The Huffington Post last year, explaining that the short school day keeps a lot of parents, particularly women, from rejoining the labor force full time.

That is important. How do we create the America that we want to envision? The America that fights for the rights of women, LGBTQ, workers, immigrants, all of us, those who are being discriminated against, how do we become all of that?”Glover also posed the question of how American citizens should reshape their views in light of climate-related issues, such as global warming, taking precedence in society.“What are we changing, when a society that King talked about and was concerned about becomes more about things than who we are as human beings,” he said. “How do we reshape this image of ourselves? Because one thing that’s gonna trump all that we talked about somewhere down the line is global warming and climate change.”He continued, “What are talking about in terms of war and conflict, materialism, racism — the center of it is racism.

64,POLITICS,Conservatives Demand Changes On Health Care Bill As GOP Leaders Sound Shaky,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservatives-health-care-bill-changes_us_58c9fbe7e4b0be71dcf16394,"The House Freedom Caucus comes out ""confident"" that the current legislation won't fly.",2017-03-16,"Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said after a meeting with the conservative Freedom Caucus, said his group wants to ""truly, fundamentally, change the direction of this bill, where it actually lowers premiums.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9fc2c1d00001d107ceaff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) acknowledged Wednesday there will have to be changes to the House Republicans’ health care bill, just as conservatives acknowledged that, short of a massive overhaul to the measure, they probably won’t support the legislation.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, emerged from the HFC meeting late Wednesday to suggest that Republicans may have to start over.“We’re confident tonight that there are not the votes to modify this current bill to make it acceptable to conservatives and moderates alike,” Meadows said.Pressed later on that point ― whether there were no changes leaders could make to win over conservatives ― Meadows walked his comment back and said that, if leaders were willing to negotiate “in good faith,” then maybe the Freedom Caucus could deal. But he stressed that the far-right’s biggest concern was the high cost of premiums and that the current bill “does not lower premiums in any meaningful way.”For leaders like Ryan who seem to believe they can win over conservatives by giving in on minor changes like work requirements for Medicaid, the new focus of premiums can’t be welcome comments.For the first time in the health care debate, Ryan acknowledged Wednesday what the White House has signaled for some time: that there will have to be changes. Ryan said now that Republicans have a Congressional Budget Office assessment on the legislation, they could “incorporate feedback” from members. Or, as Ryan put it earlier in the day, “We have consensus, and we’re fine-tuning that consensus.”If you weren’t sure of the degree to which Ryan is now uncertain about the future of the bill, he refused to confirm that the measure would get a floor vote next week, deferring scheduling questions to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and noting that the House had a snow day Tuesday.That shift in tone and willingness to adopt changes were welcome signs for conservatives. “Ten days ago it was a binary choice,” former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said. “And now it’s a, ‘It won’t pass without change.’” (Jordan agreed he was taking some “literary license” with Ryan’s words.)Consensus-tuning aside, conservatives recognize that it’s unlikely leadership will tear out the advance refundable tax credit portion of the bill, which far-right members hate but is the underpinning of the GOP’s replacement plan. The Freedom Caucus now seems focused on portions of the bill that would weaken coverage in favor of lowering premiums.Conservatives have set their targets on the continuous coverage provisions that prevent insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, as well as language that lays out essential benefits in coverage.The current bill would allow anyone with a pre-existing condition to get insurance, but someone who chose not to be insured and then got sick would be subject to a 30 percent surcharge. In the conservative plan written by Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), individuals have a two-year window to purchase insurance and then must maintain coverage. Switching to that system would lower premiums, but it also would leave many people who elect not to buy insurance devastated if they were to get sick.Meadows told reporters Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus would be producing an amendment later this week ― probably Friday ― that would address premiums. Although he wouldn’t go into specifics, sources indicated that the continuous-coverage element and eliminating plan requirements for essential health benefits, which mandate that insurers cover things like mental health and maternity care, would probably be the main focus of the amendment.Meadows acknowledged that the Medicaid changes conservatives want could be a hang-up for moderates. Conservatives had wanted to accelerate the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion from 2020 to 2018, but members understand that change is probably a non-starter in the Senate and could imperil votes in the House.Instead, Meadows said, the Freedom Caucus was now focused on an amendment that, he thought, could be supported by conservatives and moderates alike, “and truly, fundamentally, change the direction of this bill, where it actually lowers premiums.”There are some immediate problems with such an amendment. For one, Republicans could run into problems in the Senate and a legislative rule that prevents reconciliation language from making policy changes. Another issue is that HFC members continue to insist that they want a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act.“My understanding of where we’re at is we’re going to insist on a full repeal coupled with a repeal of the regulations,” Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) told The Huffington Post on Wednesday night.Part of the reason Republicans preserve some portions of Obamacare is that repealing all of it would violate the so-called Byrd rule, which would require 60 votes in the Senate. Asked whether he thought it was likely that leadership would agree to those changes, Brooks was undeterred.“It doesn’t make any difference whether they agree with it or not; that’s our position,” he said.“They can work with the big government folks, or they can work with the little government folks. It’s their choice,” Brooks said.Leadership doesn’t seem to be working all that much with conservatives. Meadows reported Wednesday night that, save an informal conversation he had with Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), he hasn’t communicated with leadership for two weeks. Meanwhile, he’s been in contact with the White House almost every day.But Meadows believes Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders recognize they have to come to the table if they want to pass the health care bill.“We are confident that, based on the whip count that we did today, that there are more than enough votes to assure that amendments need to be made,” Meadows said.Meadows dodged questions about a specific vote count, but he said currently there were “definitely” more than 21 hard Republican votes against the bill, which would be enough to sink the legislation. “Much more than 21 hard noes,” Meadows said.Asked if he meant overall or just in the Freedom Caucus, he said overall. And then he added that there were more than 21 in the Freedom Caucus too.Jonathan Cohn contributed to this report."
65,POLITICS,Progressives Slam Tom Perez's New DNC Transition Team,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressives-tom-perez-dnc-transition-committee_us_58cab459e4b0ec9d29d9695f,The Democratic Party's November wounds still haven't fully healed.,2017-03-16,"DNC chair Tom Perez, left, and Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) do an interview at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 28, 2017. Perez now faces criticism for his transition team appointments.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58cb04291d00001d107cedbe.jpeg?cache=RgWSXoAUKS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Several prominent progressive activists are blasting Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez for shunning leaders of the party’s populist wing for his transition advisory committee.The newly elected party leader named a large number of longtime party insiders to the committee, activists complained, and relatively few progressive leaders and supporters of Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, who was runner-up in the DNC chair race. The activists say the committee appointments show Perez’s DNC is not serious about addressing concerns of the party’s populist wing.“After looking at that list, it has become abundantly clear that the controlling forces of the Democratic Party want to make the other half of the party suffer,” said Nomiki Konst, a convention delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).“The DNC is not tone-deaf ― it is on a mission to crush the working side of our party,” added Konst, now an investigative reporter for the Young Turks who did not endorse a candidate in the DNC chair race. Kait Sweeney, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backed Ellison’s bid, said in a statement that “the initial names on the DNC Transition Advisory Committee include zero leaders of progressive grassroots groups that engage in electoral work and very few movement progressives.” She said the group would recommend names for the DNC to add to the committee.The DNC’s 29-person transition advisory committee, which Perez announced Wednesday, will be co-chaired by Leah Daughtry, a veteran Democratic operative who was CEO of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, and Chris Lu, a former deputy labor secretary who ran the 2008 Obama-Biden transition team.Other members include former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, former Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, racial justice advocate DeRay McKesson and National Domestic Workers Alliances director Ai-Jen Poo. The group also includes defeated DNC chair candidates: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Jehmu Greene, and Idaho Democratic Party Executive Director Sally Boynton Brown. (See the names of all 29 members here.)Just two people on the committee endorsed Ellison in the DNC chair race: Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Brian Weeks, the political director of AFSCME. Of the two, only Jayapal supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential primary.“The real absence of Bernie grassroots leadership is unsurprising to me,” Winnie Wong, a founder of the People for Bernie Sanders, said in an email. “What the DNC doesn’t know is that we are both resourceful and well resourced, so we’ll be doing the work: organizing, RECRUITING, knocking on doors, building up our giant email lists and generally running the internet in a way that the Ds could only dream about.”Perez spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa emphasized in a statement that “the transition advisory committee is just a start to the broader transition efforts.”“Over the weeks to come, Tom Perez and DNC leadership will continue meeting with key stakeholders in our big tent party, including progressive leaders, labor, and experts in various fields to discuss priorities for the DNC, grassroots organizing, reaching key voters who were left behind this last election, and raising the resources needed to succeed,” Hinojosa said.Perez selected committee members with input from other DNC officers, including Ellison, Hinojosa noted. The DNC is also seeking a meeting with the PCCC and other major progressive stakeholder groups, she added.Ellison praised the transition advisory committee in a statement.“I’m glad to see so many outstanding Democrats represented on the Transition Advisory Committee, including my friend and colleague Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, worker advocate Ai-Jen Poo, and labor leaders like Brian Weeks from the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees,” Ellison said. “In the weeks and months ahead, Tom and I will continue to work not just with this committee but with a broad coalition of Democrats, state parties, organizers and activists looking to increase the DNC’s engagement with rank-and-file members and progressive advocates across the country.” Zerlina Maxwell, an appointee to the transition committee and director of progressive programming at Sirius XM radio, rejected critics’ suggestion that the committee did not include enough figures from the progressive movement.“I don’t think that my progressive credentials could be questioned,” said Maxwell, who was also director of progressive media for Clinton’s presidential campaign. “But I also think it’s important to note the diversity of the people on the committee as well, because I think when we’re talking about the progressive movement, the inclusion of people of color is very, very important, if not the most important aspect of it.”Progressives’ public disagreement with Perez just weeks after the chair election suggests that the party divisions exposed by the contest remain at least partially unresolved.The normally sleepy contest to run the party’s main body became a brawl for control of the Democratic Party after the November election defeat left partisans scrambling for answers. Many progressive activists who blamed the Democratic establishment for falling out of touch with party’s populist, working-class roots rallied behind Ellison’s candidacy.Ellison had a virtual lock on prominent liberals and Sanders supporters, but he was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and leading labor unions that backed Hillary Clinton.Many DNC members who voted for Perez said they liked his experience running large organizations, rather than any policy or ideological considerations. Perez earned stellar marks from progressives for his work in the Obama administration as head of the Department of Justice civil rights division and the Department of Labor.But some Ellison supporters could not shake the feeling that elements of the establishment had conspired to stifle the grassroots once again, arguing that the party had been uniting around Ellison until then-President Barack Obama encouraged Perez to run. Senior Obama aides phoned DNC members on the day of the election to lobby them to vote for Perez.Perez grasped the importance of reconciling with Ellison supporters immediately after he was elected chair by a close margin in late February, using his victory speech to appoint Ellison as his deputy.The gesture was welcomed by many Ellison supporters. Later, Perez drew further accolades from Ellison supporters for speaking at a White House rally against Trump’s travel ban.But some progressives remain unconvinced. “You can’t just brand something unity and not have unity. It is unity in name only,” Konst said.Yasmine Taeb, a Virginia Democratic national committeewoman who invited Perez to the White House rally, took issue with only four elected DNC members on the transition team: Rion Ramirez of Washington; Bel Leong-Hong of Maryland; Luis Heredia of Arizona; and Jenny Wilson of Utah. “That goes to the crux of my frustration with the DNC ― that traditionally they have ignored the grassroots members, which is half the membership,” she said.Taeb also lamented that a committee so racially diverse did not include a Muslim or person of Middle Eastern heritage, when people from those groups “are under attack by this administration.”Konst singled out the transition committee co-chair Leah Daughtry as an example of the type of entrenched DNC official from whom the party needs to distance itself. As CEO of the Democratic National Convention, Daughtry oversaw the expulsion of restive Sanders supporters from the convention hall, according to Konst. Even Perez’s selection of DeRay McKesson, a former Baltimore school district worker known for his antiracism and police accountability work, has drawn criticism. Activists have derided McKesson’s ties to controversial causes and corporations, including his participation in a panel discussion sponsored by Wells Fargo.Some Ellison backers acknowledged Perez has discretion to name the committee picks and said there were more substantive fights for activists.“It’s solely a personal list for Tom’s advice so he obviously named people who he was close to,” said Larry Cohen, a DNC member from Washington, D.C., and chairman of Our Revolution, the successor organization to Sanders’ campaign.Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb, who serves on the Our Revolution board with Cohen, took a similar view. She added: “If I was in Perez’s shoes, I probably would have appointed a couple more obvious Bernie people just for the sake of keeping the peace.”Another major test of the party’s commitment to reform will be in the power it gives to the forthcoming Unity Reform Commission, according to Kleeb and Cohen. The 21-member panel ― the product of a last-minute compromise to mollify Sanders supporters prior to the Democratic National Convention ― is charged with studying ways to increase party accountability and reform the presidential nominating process through measures like abolishing the super-delegates. Kleeb and Konst are among the seven commissioners appointed by Sanders, who also named Cohen a co-chair. Clinton gets to name nine members of the panel, plus a co-chair. Perez will name the remaining three. Aside from Clinton’s appointment of the commission chair, Jen O’Malley Dillon, neither Clinton nor Perez has announced their nominees. “The unity reform commission is the statutory body of the party to look at structural reform. Having met with Tom about that, I’m confident that he fully supports his role,” Cohen said.This article has been updated with comment from Keith Ellison and Zerlina Maxwell."
66,ENTERTAINMENT,Debriefing On Awards Season With Isabelle Huppert,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isabelle-huppert-showgirls_us_58c98d6ae4b0cb7d28ce6679,"Turns out she loves ""Showgirls.""",2017-03-16,"Isabelle Huppert and ""Moonlight"" director Barry Jenkins on the red carpet at the Oscars on Feb. 26, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9a5592c00002000fee9ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are fond of excess, so of course Hollywood’s awards season lingers for four interminable months (six if you count the annual fall film festivals). Isabelle Huppert, a screen legend just nominated for her first Oscar at age 63, schlepped back and forth from her native France for a parade of ceremonies, screenings and media appearances. She has a bundle of hardware to show for it, including a Gotham Award, a Golden Globe, an Independent Spirit Award and a bevy of critics’ prizes.Having wrapped another movie upon returning to Paris after last month’s Oscars, a vacation is the next line item on Huppert’s agenda. When we hopped on the phone Tuesday in recognition of the DVD/Blu-ray release of “Elle,” the actress assured me she is “absolutely” taking a few weeks off. I told her she deserved it, to which Huppert responded, “I think so too.” How heavenly.What follows is the rest of our conversation, which contains an obvious highlight: She loves “Showgirls.” (And Barry Jenkins, of course.)Because of its unconventional portrayal of a rape victim, “Elle” is a polarizing movie. It’s sparked some fierce debates. Considering the many conversations you’ve had about this movie over the past several months, has your perception of it changed at all?Not really, actually. I have to say that since the very beginning, when the movie was first presented to an audience in Cannes last May, from that moment on, we’ve seen more positive reactions than anything else. I think from very early on we realized the film had the potential to be taken beyond the controversy. Of course, the film is disturbing. I did not want to present the film differently from what it is. But basically, globally, I would say, the film was received with a great understanding, a great comprehension. The film is a real film, and that’s the way people received it. When I say that, I mean its potential for imagination, for fantasy, not to be taken as a philosophical point of view upon the rape. No, it’s more to be taken as a fantasy and an imaginary situation from which you can try to understand a woman’s behavior, a woman’s psyche, a woman’s most unconfessable parts of herself. And it’s her own attempt to understand where violence comes from, how it’s been transmitted in the same family or from men to women. The movie is so rich and so complex and so complete that I think it leaves behind any kind of real controversies. You’ve been working for almost five decades, but this was your first Oscar nomination. Does it surprise you that this was the film voters responded to, given it’s a challenging story told in French?Well, first of all, of course, it’s a French film, and that’s always a surprise in a way, that a French-speaking film gets this kind of attention. Of course, it’s not an easy film. It’s a very provocative film, it’s a distributing film. But it’s also a Paul Verhoeven film — it didn’t come from someone completely unknown to the American audience or the American critics. Paul Verhoeven is obviously a big name for the American audience, so on one hand, yes, it was a surprise because it was a French-speaking film. Then, on the other, no, it was not such a big surprise because it was precisely a Paul Verhoeven film. But of course there was the combination of this film and the other film last year, “Things to Come,” and I got many awards for both films in this country. I have nothing much more to say. I was very, very happy that it got all this recognition because the movie was successful in America — I mean, as successful as a French film can be successful, you know? I’m not saying it’s a major blockbuster. It was all very, very nice. Was there a moment for you that became the highlight of the season?It all started with the Gotham, which I won. That was really wonderful because no French actress got that prize before. To be honest, it made the Gotham Awards very popular in France because no one had ever heard of the Gothams in France before I got it [laughs]. In that sense, it brought as much to me as I brought to the Gotham. No, I’m kidding. But you know what I mean, because no one was really familiar with the Gothams before I got it. But it all started with the Gotham, until the Spirit Awards, which I won for “Elle.” It’s such a recognition for the film and such a recognition for Verhoeven, who always had a French status, even in America, even though he did big blockbusters like “RoboCop” and “Showgirls.” Well, “Showgirls’ might not be a blockbuster, but let’s say “RoboCop” or “Starship Troopers.” But Verhoeven was always such a free spirit, always doing his own way and playing with codes and pretending to be a mainstream director. Meanwhile, he was never really a mainstream director because he was always fooling with the classic codes of making movies. I mean, he’s really a great director for that because he pretends to be what he is, and under the surface he is by no means what he pretends to be. I was really, really happy to get all that recognition for this movie.Speaking of which, what’s your opinion of “Showgirls”?Well, I love “Showgirls.” I always liked it since the first time I saw it. Even in France, some people thought it was not such a great film, and other people thought yes, it was a great film. But now most people can come to terms with it and admit that it is a great film. Recently, because I think the movie was re-released in France or released on DVD or whatever, there were a lot of new reviews about the film. They all came to the conclusion that, yes, of course it is a great film and by no means is it a bad film. I always thought that ever since I saw the film.Who were you happiest to meet along the way?Well, I’ve particularly enjoyed meeting people like Barry Jenkins, of course, and I was so happy that he won for best film. And Kenneth Lonergan. We kept meeting each other along the way, first in Toronto. We always met at the film-critics circles because we were always winning prizes together. Yes, I really appreciated meeting Barry and Kenneth, yes.What was it like to witness the Best Picture mishap in person?Well, it was very weird. It is certainly something I will remember all my life, as will most people who saw it, even on television. That film will be certainly imprinted with what happened. Because all of a sudden the mechanism was — oh, how can I say it? — usually on this kind of evening, everything goes in the right direction, and for a few seconds it obviously went in the wrong direction. We all thought for a few seconds that something extra dramatic was happening, like an attack or whatever. It was very weird, for a few seconds. Of course, after we realized. But it was human. Sometimes the machine doesn’t work the way you expect it to work.You’re making another movie with Michael Haneke, who directed you in “The Piano Teacher,” “Time of the Wolf” and “Amour.” What can you tell us about it?It’s called “Happy End.” We shot that film in the north of France, and it’s about a family.

67,ENTERTAINMENT,Debriefing On Awards Season With Isabelle Huppert,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/isabelle-huppert-showgirls_us_58c98d6ae4b0cb7d28ce6679,"Turns out she loves ""Showgirls.""",2017-03-16,"Isabelle Huppert and ""Elle"" director Paul Verhoeven backstage at the Golden Globes on Jan. 8, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9a5e62c00002000feea01.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are fond of excess, so of course Hollywood’s awards season lingers for four interminable months (six if you count the annual fall film festivals). Isabelle Huppert, a screen legend just nominated for her first Oscar at age 63, schlepped back and forth from her native France for a parade of ceremonies, screenings and media appearances. She has a bundle of hardware to show for it, including a Gotham Award, a Golden Globe, an Independent Spirit Award and a bevy of critics’ prizes.Having wrapped another movie upon returning to Paris after last month’s Oscars, a vacation is the next line item on Huppert’s agenda. When we hopped on the phone Tuesday in recognition of the DVD/Blu-ray release of “Elle,” the actress assured me she is “absolutely” taking a few weeks off. I told her she deserved it, to which Huppert responded, “I think so too.” How heavenly.What follows is the rest of our conversation, which contains an obvious highlight: She loves “Showgirls.” (And Barry Jenkins, of course.)Because of its unconventional portrayal of a rape victim, “Elle” is a polarizing movie. It’s sparked some fierce debates. Considering the many conversations you’ve had about this movie over the past several months, has your perception of it changed at all?Not really, actually. I have to say that since the very beginning, when the movie was first presented to an audience in Cannes last May, from that moment on, we’ve seen more positive reactions than anything else. I think from very early on we realized the film had the potential to be taken beyond the controversy. Of course, the film is disturbing. I did not want to present the film differently from what it is. But basically, globally, I would say, the film was received with a great understanding, a great comprehension. The film is a real film, and that’s the way people received it. When I say that, I mean its potential for imagination, for fantasy, not to be taken as a philosophical point of view upon the rape. No, it’s more to be taken as a fantasy and an imaginary situation from which you can try to understand a woman’s behavior, a woman’s psyche, a woman’s most unconfessable parts of herself. And it’s her own attempt to understand where violence comes from, how it’s been transmitted in the same family or from men to women. The movie is so rich and so complex and so complete that I think it leaves behind any kind of real controversies. You’ve been working for almost five decades, but this was your first Oscar nomination. Does it surprise you that this was the film voters responded to, given it’s a challenging story told in French?Well, first of all, of course, it’s a French film, and that’s always a surprise in a way, that a French-speaking film gets this kind of attention. Of course, it’s not an easy film. It’s a very provocative film, it’s a distributing film. But it’s also a Paul Verhoeven film — it didn’t come from someone completely unknown to the American audience or the American critics. Paul Verhoeven is obviously a big name for the American audience, so on one hand, yes, it was a surprise because it was a French-speaking film. Then, on the other, no, it was not such a big surprise because it was precisely a Paul Verhoeven film. But of course there was the combination of this film and the other film last year, “Things to Come,” and I got many awards for both films in this country. I have nothing much more to say. I was very, very happy that it got all this recognition because the movie was successful in America — I mean, as successful as a French film can be successful, you know? I’m not saying it’s a major blockbuster. It was all very, very nice. Was there a moment for you that became the highlight of the season?It all started with the Gotham, which I won. That was really wonderful because no French actress got that prize before. To be honest, it made the Gotham Awards very popular in France because no one had ever heard of the Gothams in France before I got it [laughs]. In that sense, it brought as much to me as I brought to the Gotham. No, I’m kidding. But you know what I mean, because no one was really familiar with the Gothams before I got it. But it all started with the Gotham, until the Spirit Awards, which I won for “Elle.” It’s such a recognition for the film and such a recognition for Verhoeven, who always had a French status, even in America, even though he did big blockbusters like “RoboCop” and “Showgirls.” Well, “Showgirls’ might not be a blockbuster, but let’s say “RoboCop” or “Starship Troopers.” But Verhoeven was always such a free spirit, always doing his own way and playing with codes and pretending to be a mainstream director. Meanwhile, he was never really a mainstream director because he was always fooling with the classic codes of making movies. I mean, he’s really a great director for that because he pretends to be what he is, and under the surface he is by no means what he pretends to be. I was really, really happy to get all that recognition for this movie.Speaking of which, what’s your opinion of “Showgirls”?Well, I love “Showgirls.” I always liked it since the first time I saw it. Even in France, some people thought it was not such a great film, and other people thought yes, it was a great film. But now most people can come to terms with it and admit that it is a great film. Recently, because I think the movie was re-released in France or released on DVD or whatever, there were a lot of new reviews about the film. They all came to the conclusion that, yes, of course it is a great film and by no means is it a bad film. I always thought that ever since I saw the film.Who were you happiest to meet along the way?Well, I’ve particularly enjoyed meeting people like Barry Jenkins, of course, and I was so happy that he won for best film. And Kenneth Lonergan. We kept meeting each other along the way, first in Toronto. We always met at the film-critics circles because we were always winning prizes together. Yes, I really appreciated meeting Barry and Kenneth, yes.What was it like to witness the Best Picture mishap in person?Well, it was very weird. It is certainly something I will remember all my life, as will most people who saw it, even on television. That film will be certainly imprinted with what happened. Because all of a sudden the mechanism was — oh, how can I say it? — usually on this kind of evening, everything goes in the right direction, and for a few seconds it obviously went in the wrong direction. We all thought for a few seconds that something extra dramatic was happening, like an attack or whatever. It was very weird, for a few seconds. Of course, after we realized. But it was human. Sometimes the machine doesn’t work the way you expect it to work.You’re making another movie with Michael Haneke, who directed you in “The Piano Teacher,” “Time of the Wolf” and “Amour.” What can you tell us about it?It’s called “Happy End.” We shot that film in the north of France, and it’s about a family. It’s very, very critical and very political, but it’s also very funny. It has all the qualities of the best films of Michael Haneke. I hope you enjoy your vacation. It’s much deserved.Yes! Well deserved in fact. Thank you very much.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length. "

Leslie Simmons, the library manager, said that staff members found three copies of the Quran damaged “by a yellowish liquid substance” after one of the couple’s visits. Staffers also said that the books smelled of urine, according to the police report.Surveillance footage shows the couple at the library using their computer and reading books, according to a police report obtained by local news station KOB 4. The video also shows the man picking up books, then bringing them back.Police said the low-quality video did not show which books the man picked up, but it does show the man going to the same locations where library workers found damaged copies of the Quran and Bill Clinton’s autobiography, “My Life.”Library staffers told police that the couple started visiting the library every few days since March 2 and that they were loud and disruptive, according to KOB 4. Library workers also claimed the couple placed copies of the Bible and books written by conservative commentator Ann Coulter around the library “as if they were placed on display for all to see,” according to a police report.Police said that DNA testing would be inconclusive, since the damaged library books were likely handled by a lot of people, according to the New Mexican. Police concluded the investigation after they were unable to locate the license plate number for the couple’s truck in law enforcement databases.The vandalism comes at a time when hate crimes targeting Muslims are becoming more frequent in the U.S. The number of anti-Muslim hate groups nearly tripled in 2016, according to a recent report published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Meanwhile, mosques have become targets for vandalism and destruction.On Tuesday, CAIR called on officials to investigate a similar incident in which an Arizona man broke into the Islamic Center of Tucson and tore apart several copies of the Quran.

Now he wants to make sure it saves other people too.,2017-03-15,"Mancheno in Ecuador, before he fled that country for America. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c8283a2c00002000fee54d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Luis Mancheno remembers the moment he knew he had to get out of Ecuador. He was 21, it was 2007, and he was living with his family in the capital city Quito. For 6 months, his evangelical Christian parents had sent him to conversion therapy in an attempt to make him not gay. This destructive form of therapy, of course, didn’t “work” ― because it can’t ― and one night Mancheno decided to go with a friend to a gay bar.At the bar, Mancheno says he and his friend were drugged. He woke up with his pants down, in his car, on the edge of a cliff. The car had crashed into a light post. His friend was unconscious in the backseat, also with his pants pulled down.“And then I realized that [whoever did this] had painted the car ― ‘Maricón’ ― which means faggot in Spanish,” Mancheno recalled. “And the only reason why I was still alive and my friend was still alive is because there was a light post. Because other than that, the car would have rolled down the cliff and we would have died.”Mancheno says he couldn’t tell his parents about the incident. “They believe that every, anything bad that will be happening to me will be because I was gay,” he said. And the police weren’t any help either.“I was telling the police officer that I was at this gay bar, he stopped taking notes,” Mancheno said. “He closed the notebook that he was using to take notes and he said, ‘Uh, I’m sorry. But we don’t have jurisdiction over that bar.’ And immediately, all of the officers who were overhearing what I was reporting started laughing. And the next thing that he said was, ‘You should know better next time to not go there.’”“And that did it,” Mancheno continued. “ I knew that I was not going to have the protection from the police ... and next time there might not be a light post to save my life.”He went to America. First on a student visa to Willamette University in Oregon, where he learned he could claim asylum in the U.S. as a refugee fleeing persecution. (He was granted asylum in 2009.) And then to Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island on a full scholarship, where he became involved in representing low-income clients in immigration court. Mancheno said that going through the asylum application process taught him what “a huge difference” immigration lawyers can make. (There’s no right to a lawyer in immigration court, and immigrants in deportation proceedings are at least twice as likely to be deported when they don’t have an attorney.) Mancheno said he wanted to “help the next Luis Mancheno that comes down the line, who needs a lawyer, who doesn’t have all the privileges that I had.”He eventually moved to New York and became part of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, an organization that provides free legal services for poor defendants, and later became a teaching fellow at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan. In June 2016, Mancheno became a U.S. citizen during a ceremony at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. His husband, whom he married in 2015, was there to celebrate. “Becoming a US citizen for me was a very powerful thing because I finally felt validated as having a voice here,” Mancheno said.On Jan. 28, Mancheno returned to that same courthouse under very different circumstances. A day earlier, President Donald Trump had issued an executive order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S., shut down the whole refugee program for 120 days, and barred all immigrants and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. The order, a partial fulfillment of Trump’s bigoted campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., was implemented haphazardly. Terrible stories quickly emerged of immigrants, visitors and refugees being detained or deported ― or, in some cases, both ― by border officials struggling to adjust to the new law.Mancheno said that although he’d been an American for less than a year, the Muslim ban made him already feel “disappointed and ashamed of being American.” And so he and his colleagues at the Cardozo immigration justice clinic sprung into action. Jacqueline Pearce went to JFK Airport, where she was approached by a woman who said her sister ― a sick and wheelchair-bound middle-aged Syrian woman with a valid U.S. permanent resident visa, or green card ― was being detained by immigration authorities, and was told she’d be deported to Syria. Mancheno immediately started drafting a motion for a temporary restraining order ― basically asking a judge to block the Syrian woman’s deportation until a court could decide whether her removal from the U.S. was legal. Mancheno said he was simultaneously putting on a suit while printing out hundreds of pages. His husband proofread the motion and stapled the pages together. Mancheno then rushed to the federal courthouse in Brooklyn to file the motion. Outside, hundreds and hundreds of people were protesting the Muslim ban. Initially, Mancheno thought the crowd would prevent him from getting inside the court in time to file the motion. But a protester screamed, “He is one of the lawyers!” Mancheno recalled, and “it was like the Red Sea.” The crowd parted, and people cheered and clapped and thanked him as he marched into the courthouse and filed the motion.A short time later at JFK, around 8:50 p.m., Pearce received bad news: The Syrian woman was scheduled for a flight back to Syria at 9:20 p.m. She frantically texted Mancheno and their other colleague, Peter Markowitz, who was in the courtroom where a judge was hearing another challenge to the Muslim ban filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. Out of desperation, Markowitz passed a note to the ACLU attorney. “I was just passed a note that the government is literally, as we speak putting someone back on a plane back to Syria,” the ACLU lawyer told the judge, according to court transcripts. “What do you think about that?” the judge asked the attorneys representing the U.S government. When those attorneys demurred, saying they didn’t have enough facts to respond, the judge issued a stay ― meaning the government could no longer deport people it had detained under Trump’s Muslim ban. The executive order, the judge stated, would cause “irreparable harm” to the woman if she was sent back to Syria, a war zone. When news of the judge’s ruling spread, thousands of protesters, outside the court and outside JFK Airport, erupted into cheers.But despite the victory, Mancheno said he and his colleagues still didn’t know what had happened to their client. “I am literally getting pictures of the written decision from the judge and texting them to Jackie so Jackie could show it to the [border patrol] officers there and say, ‘It’s official. I have the document here and it says that you are supposed to stop. The judge is ordering you to stop her deportation.’”Then, a grueling hour-and-a-half later, around 11 p.m., Pearce sent him a picture: the Syrian woman being pushed in her wheelchair past customs. She had been released. HuffPost showed Mancheno a video of the woman being reunited with her crying sister. Tears welled up in his eyes and he said, “I am happy because I feel like we did a good thing. We got the job done.”“But it’s so unfair and I’m angry every time that I see that people have to celebrate to see their family members who have an actual legal right to be in this country. Celebrate that they are not being detained just because of where they’re from, and just because the president thinks that they’re all Muslims [and] should be banned from this country.” “It gives me strength, strength to fight. Every time that I see people suffering, I become stronger and I know that I have to be better. And I know that I have to work harder to fight this injustice.” For now, Mancheno says he and his colleagues are fighting two other executive orders signed by Trump: One that significantly expands which undocumented immigrants are prioritized for deportation and another that expands border security. On Thursday, Trump’s second, scaled-back Muslim ban ― which still bars refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days ― goes into effect. At least six states have already filed lawsuits challenging its legality.Asked what the ban means to him as a refugee, Mancheno said: “Closing the door to the people that need help the most is one of the cruelest, anti-American things that this government could have done.” “If I wasn’t allowed to come here as a refugee,” he said, “I wouldn’t be alive today.”The video was produced by Omar Kasrawi. It was edited by Maria Tridas, Ethan Kirby and Chai Dingari. The Director of Photography was Chelsea Moynehan. The video was filmed by Mike Caravella and Dan Fox.

Mancheno then rushed to the federal courthouse in Brooklyn to file the motion. Outside, hundreds and hundreds of people were protesting the Muslim ban. Initially, Mancheno thought the crowd would prevent him from getting inside the court in time to file the motion. But a protester screamed, “He is one of the lawyers!” Mancheno recalled, and “it was like the Red Sea.” The crowd parted, and people cheered and clapped and thanked him as he marched into the courthouse and filed the motion.A short time later at JFK, around 8:50 p.m., Pearce received bad news: The Syrian woman was scheduled for a flight back to Syria at 9:20 p.m. She frantically texted Mancheno and their other colleague, Peter Markowitz, who was in the courtroom where a judge was hearing another challenge to the Muslim ban filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. Out of desperation, Markowitz passed a note to the ACLU attorney. “I was just passed a note that the government is literally, as we speak putting someone back on a plane back to Syria,” the ACLU lawyer told the judge, according to court transcripts. “What do you think about that?” the judge asked the attorneys representing the U.S government. When those attorneys demurred, saying they didn’t have enough facts to respond, the judge issued a stay ― meaning the government could no longer deport people it had detained under Trump’s Muslim ban. The executive order, the judge stated, would cause “irreparable harm” to the woman if she was sent back to Syria, a war zone. When news of the judge’s ruling spread, thousands of protesters, outside the court and outside JFK Airport, erupted into cheers.But despite the victory, Mancheno said he and his colleagues still didn’t know what had happened to their client. “I am literally getting pictures of the written decision from the judge and texting them to Jackie so Jackie could show it to the [border patrol] officers there and say, ‘It’s official. I have the document here and it says that you are supposed to stop. The judge is ordering you to stop her deportation.’”Then, a grueling hour-and-a-half later, around 11 p.m., Pearce sent him a picture: the Syrian woman being pushed in her wheelchair past customs. She had been released. HuffPost showed Mancheno a video of the woman being reunited with her crying sister. Tears welled up in his eyes and he said, “I am happy because I feel like we did a good thing. We got the job done.”“But it’s so unfair and I’m angry every time that I see that people have to celebrate to see their family members who have an actual legal right to be in this country. Celebrate that they are not being detained just because of where they’re from, and just because the president thinks that they’re all Muslims [and] should be banned from this country.” “It gives me strength, strength to fight. Every time that I see people suffering, I become stronger and I know that I have to be better. And I know that I have to work harder to fight this injustice.” For now, Mancheno says he and his colleagues are fighting two other executive orders signed by Trump: One that significantly expands which undocumented immigrants are prioritized for deportation and another that expands border security. On Thursday, Trump’s second, scaled-back Muslim ban ― which still bars refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days ― goes into effect. At least six states have already filed lawsuits challenging its legality.Asked what the ban means to him as a refugee, Mancheno said: “Closing the door to the people that need help the most is one of the cruelest, anti-American things that this government could have done.” “If I wasn’t allowed to come here as a refugee,” he said, “I wouldn’t be alive today.”The video was produced by Omar Kasrawi. It was edited by Maria Tridas, Ethan Kirby and Chai Dingari. The Director of Photography was Chelsea Moynehan. The video was filmed by Mike Caravella and Dan Fox.

78,THE WORLDPOST,Mesmerizing Blue Light Makes Tasmanian Waters Glow,Kate Abbey-Lambertz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tasmania-sea-sparkle-glow_us_58c9a712e4b0be71dcf128af,Bioluminescent plankton are responsible for the beautiful but troubling bloom.,2017-03-15,Green Noctiluca blooms in the Arabian Sea and other locations. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9b4ac140000880606fb77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A blue glow lighting up the waters off the shores of Tasmania has captivated photographers and onlookers ― but it’s also a troubling example of how rising ocean temperatures have disrupted marine ecosystems. A mass of Noctiluca scintillans, a type of plankton, produced the bioluminescent glow known as “sea sparkle” this week on the north coast of the island.Photographer Leanne Marshall captured the display at Rocky Cape in dramatic nighttime shots.“To say I was excited to finally see some #bioluminescence was an understatement,” she wrote on Instagram.  While the glowing water has a strange, otherworldly beauty, the single-celled organism’s bioluminescent displays have actually occurred periodically in the island’s waterways in recent years.Noctiluca only showed up in Tasmania beginning in 1994, according to New Scientist. The frequency of the blooms has since increased, said Anthony Richardson, a researcher with Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and climate change could be playing a role. This type of plankton, dinoflagellates, “tend to do better in warmer water and a stable water column ― both of which happen with climate change/global warming,” Richardson told The Huffington Post in an email. “I think that climate change can lead to more Noctiluca blooms.”Noctiluca has appeared in the Southern Ocean and begun to spread to the south coast of Australia, Richardson said, due to warmer waters. The blooms aren’t toxic for humans, but can affect other marine life. Noctiluca gobbles up plankton and “acts like a vacuum cleaner,” University of Tasmania professor Gustaaf Hallegraeff told HuffPost Australia in the fall when sea sparkle appeared in Tasmania’s Derwent Estuary.When large blooms die and decompose, they strip oxygen from the water, a problem for other species and aquaculture industries and fisheries, Richardson said. Noctiluca blooms form in warm waters around the globe, including a massive one that is currently spreading green ooze in the Arabian Sea, a twice-annual event. The outbreaks off the coast of Oman ― which can be three times the size of Texas ― weren’t seen until the 1990s and are now disrupting the food chain, according to Joaquim Goes, a marine biologist at Columbia University. The red variety of Noctiluca, the type seen in Tasmania, also appears off the coast of China, in the Gulf of Mexico and near Seattle, Goes said in an email. Goes added that the rash of blooms worldwide “are connected in a sense ― they are being caused by the warming trend and increased stratification of the upper oceans.”Sea surface temperatures have been rising since the early 1900s and are at a record high. Half of the heat increase in the global oceans since 1865 occurred during the past two decades, according to research from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

79,BLACK VOICES,Raphael Bostic Named First Black President Of A Fed Regional Bank,Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/raphael-bostic-first-black-president-fed-regional-bank_us_58c94bf2e4b022994fa3b167,"The USC professor called the appointment ""a tremendous privilege.”",2017-03-15,Raphael Bostic’s appointment comes after politicians and advocacy groups criticized the Fed’s 12 regional banks for a lack of diversity.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9578c1d00007b2b7ce8c1.jpeg?cache=tlnULCdTCe&ops=crop_9_46_1071_734%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"University of Southern California professor Raphael Bostic just made history by becoming the first African American to be named president of a Federal Reserve regional bank in the system’s nearly 104-year existence.The 50-year-old was named head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on Monday. Bostic, director of the Bedrosian Center on Governance at USC’s Sol Price School of Public Policy, said in a video statement that his appointment is “a very big deal,” according to the Los Angeles Times.“It’s not lost on me that I ... am the first African American to lead a Federal Reserve institution,” he said. “It’s kind of daunting. It’s an overwhelming thought. It’s a tremendous privilege.”Prior to Bostic’s appointment, politicians and advocacy groups had spoken out about the lack of diversity at the Fed’s 12 regional banks. In September, four black members of Congress, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.), Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), sent a letter to Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen urging her to appoint a black or Hispanic person to the Atlanta seat. Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, described Bostic as an “outstanding choice” and applauded the Fed’s steps toward diversifying their leadership, according to the Los Angeles Times. “Given the disparate economic experiences faced by key demographic groups, it is crucial that a broader cross-section of groups have a seat at the decision-making table,” Waters said.The Atlanta Fed’s board chairman, Thomas A. Fanning, also praised Bostic in a video statement. “What made Raphael our top choice for the Atlanta Fed president? His positive energy, his deep knowledge of income inequality, economic opportunity and consumer banking issues and his outstanding personal character and intellect,” he said.Bostic, who joined the Fed as a staff economist in 1995, will also become just the fourth African American to serve on its policy-making committee. He will lead hundreds of employees including economic researchers, bank regulators and others who work the financial system. Bostic will start on June 5, succeeding current president Dennis P. Lockhart, who reached mandatory retirement after serving 10 years. He said that he’s eager to take on the task and break a racial barrier.“This could have happened a long time ago,” Bostic said, “but we’re happy that it happened now, and I look forward to this being a steppingstone for many others to have this opportunity as well.”"
80,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Silence On The Fed Interest Rate Hike Speaks Volumes,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike_us_58c9b0b7e4b0be71dcf135ac,The president went after the central bank when it was politically expedient.,2017-03-15,"President Donald Trump speaks to auto workers in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on March 15, 2017. He did not mention the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike earlier in the day.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c9bed2140000880606fb8a.jpeg?cache=ba5v0wQCoc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump loved to rail against the Federal Reserve board’s chair, Janet Yellen, during the final months of his presidential campaign.He claimed that Yellen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, was refusing to raise the Fed’s benchmark interest rate to bolster Obama politically with an artificially inflated economy. By extension, Trump implied, the Fed was working on behalf of his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, who would presumably benefit as a member of the incumbent party.“We have a Fed that’s doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political ― by keeping the interest rates at this level,” Trump said during the first presidential debate in September.“And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you’re going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job,” he said.Lo and behold, the Fed raised its influential federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point in December, and did it again on Wednesday by the same amount.Only instead of calling out the Fed for putting the brakes on job growth just as he takes office, Trump has stayed silent. Trump did not mention the Fed during a speech on Wednesday promoting jobs in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The central bank did not even merit a measly tweet from Trump’s Twitter account.“As has been practice for the White House in the past, we’re not going to comment on the Fed’s decisions,” White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom said in response to an e-mail inquiry.Of course, if Trump’s silence is an apparent contradiction of his campaign-trail invective against Yellen, it is entirely consistent with his approach to disparaging independent government actors and institutions: He does it when it suits him politically. Prior to Trump’s inauguration, he routinely doubted the veracity of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ monthly jobs reports, claiming the employment situation was much worse than the official data suggested. But last Friday, after the first report on job growth that occurred solely under his presidency came out, Trump touted the numbers and clarified that he now accepts their accuracy.Conversely, prior to taking office, Trump loved to cite the findings of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Once CBO panned House Republicans’ Obamacare replacement bill, however, senior members of the Trump administration were quick to question the institution’s analysis.So too with the Federal Reserve.Trump never offered any evidence to support the allegations against Yellen. That’s because the evidence is virtually nonexistent. Even Yellen’s critics consider her a highly qualified, independent central banker. But that wasn’t the point. When Trump was running against Clinton, it made sense to disparage Yellen. It fed into the web of conspiracy theories he was promoting among his supporters, many of whom were eager to believe they were fighting a system stacked against them.Like Trump’s claims that the voting system itself was rigged, his bloviating against Yellen was also designed to undermine the legitimacy of the election results if he lost.Now that Trump has won, it’s not a fight worth picking.If anything, the fact that the post-election stock market boom continued uninterrupted after the rate hike means the Fed’s decision could be framed as a political boon to him.“Maybe if markets reacted more negatively he would have had something to say about the Fed’s rate hike,” suggested Stephanie Kelton, an economist at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. Trump’s views on the Federal Reserve, like many topics, underwent many iterations over the course of his campaign. In May, he told CNBC that he agreed with Yellen’s decision to keep rates low, observing that higher rates could increase the value of the dollar and hurt manufacturing exports.On other occasions, Trump voiced support for restoring the gold standard, which would likely dramatically curtail the Fed’s ability to respond to business cycles. In fact, he has surrounded himself with gold bugs and other proponents of hard-money policies, according to a lengthy new report in Politico Magazine.All of those factors raise questions about just how Trump will choose to shape the Federal Reserve, which is also charged with regulating major financial institutions. The resignation of Daniel Tarrullo, the Fed’s enforcement chief, means that Trump will have the opportunity to fill three board governor positions this year alone. “If he calls me up, I’ll tell him he should appoint people prepared to let the economy get to full employment and risk a little bit of inflation,” said Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research.Baker even argues that it would be perfectly appropriate for Trump to weigh in on the overall direction of the Fed without trying to dictate its every move. The challenge is getting Trump to adopt a coherent vision of monetary policy ― let alone one that is progressive, according to Baker.“At this point, I won’t place bets on that. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”"

At an event with auto executives in a Detroit suburb, Trump announced his administration’s decision to restart a review of the cost of new fuel efficiency rules that would require vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, nearly double today’s standard. The Obama administration moved to lock in the rules by issuing the EPA’s positive assessment of the costs and feasibility of the regulations more than a year early, in January.“We are going to cancel that executive action,” Trump said. “We are going to restore the originally scheduled midterm review.” A senior White House official had confirmed the long-expected announcement to reporters on Tuesday night.“The auto industry rightly cried foul because we were supposed to do [the assessment] in 2018,” the official said.In his speech, Trump said the “assault on the American auto industry, believe me, is over.” He did not mention the roughly $80 billion government bailout package the industry received after the financial crisis.Trump’s announcement does not affect the waiver granted to California under the Clean Air Act to set fuel efficiency above the federal standard. “When 2018 comes around, we have to work with California to figure it out,” the official said, adding that withdrawing the waiver was not under consideration “right now.”The chief executives of General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles attended the event, along with officials from several Japanese and German automakers. Trump has put intense pressure on automakers to keep manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Reassessing a rule that has long nettled the industry is part of that push. In 2012, automakers agreed to the first major overhaul of fuel efficiency standards since the 1970s ― on the condition that, by April 2018, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would perform a thorough review of rules and tweak them if they were too expensive or impossible to meet. In a move to block incoming EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, an oil industry ally who rejects the scientific consensus on manmade global warming, from undoing the rules, the EPA announced its findings ahead of schedule. Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy issued a final determination on Jan. 12 finding that “automakers are well positioned to meet the standards at lower costs than previously estimated.”NHTSA, which is under the Department of Transportation, traditionally oversees fuel efficiency standards. But the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA requires the EPA to set global warming pollution standards for vehicles under the Clean Air Act. The Trump administration plans to give NHTSA’s analysis more weight in next year’s assessment, essentially downgrading the priority given to environmental and climate concerns in the regulatory process. Unlike the EPA, the Department of Transportation ― overseen by Elaine Chao, a longtime coal industry backer and the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ― does not have an explicit mission to keep toxic pollution out of the air. The move appears to be in line with what Pruitt described as his philosophical approach to his new job: that “regulations exist to give certainty to those they regulate.” But environmentalists fear that an assessment in 2018 will result in scrapping the new standards.“This is no time to shift cleaner car standards into reverse,” Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. “These commonsense clean cars standards are already doing their job to protect consumers, protect our health and climate, and reduce our oil consumption.” Some critics feared that relaxing standards would destroy auto industry jobs in the long term as foreign rivals increase fuel efficiency. “We’ve seen this story before in the 1970s, when the American auto industry was building gas-guzzlers and Japanese carmakers ate them for lunch,” Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center, told The Huffington Post by phone on Wednesday. “President Trump’s policy is short-sighted. American automakers will succeed if their companies move forward with technological innovation and build the cars of the future to create the jobs of the future.”In January, Ford announced plans to spend $700 million to add 700 workers to a plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. The company said it wanted to focus its efforts in the U.S. as it invests in new technologies, including electric vehicles, sales of which could suffer under weaker efficiency rules. The governors of Washington and Oregon condemned the move on Wednesday in a joint statement signed by the mayors of Oakland, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. “The U.S. is a technology superpower. Our strong vehicle fuel economy standards are a reflection of that and position the U.S. to remain competitive in the global push toward clean cars,” they wrote. “Let’s not cede our leadership.”The White House would not necessarily give deference to auto manufacturers when the full review is conducted next year, the official said. But he pointed reporters to an assessment by an industry-funded group that challenged the feasibility of Obama’s more stringent standards.“Go read the Auto Alliance assessment,” he said. “It’s a pretty comprehensive assessment.”The conservative Heartland Institute said it expects the new review will ultimately reject the Obama administration’s findings. It hailed the announcement as a victory for automakers, oil producers and mineral miners. “[W]hen consumers are free to choose the vehicles of their choice, domestic oil demand will increase,” Bette Grande, an energy policy research fellow at the think tank, said in a statement. “So much winning, I think I’ll take my truck for a spin to celebrate.” This article was updated to include portions of Trump’s speech and comment from Howard Learner and Bette Grande."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c841411d00001d107ce673.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Warning: Spoilers for “This Is Us” Season 1 ahead. Tuesday night’s finale of “This Is Us,” titled “Moonshadow,” gave fans some of the answers we’ve been waiting for, but also left viewers with a whole new set of questions. Although we didn’t learn how Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) dies (sigh), we will still be mulling over every little detail until the show returns this fall.The episode started off with an intoxicated Jack arriving at Rebecca’s (Mandy Moore) show after driving to the venue to apologize. But after Rebecca’s bandmate, and ex, Ben (Sam Trammell) tries to kiss her backstage, she regrets going on tour and tries to reach Jack. Little does she know he’s right around the corner.Jack goes to find Rebecca, but ends up running into Ben, who tells him he’s sorry he “crossed the line.” That’s when Jack loses it and punches Ben before Rebecca walks in, shocked. She tells Ben the tour is over before driving Jack home.Once back at House Pearson, the couple faces off in a screaming match about their lives, relationship and missed opportunities. The next morning, Rebecca asks Jack to move out ― and move in with Miguel (Jon Huertas) ― so they can have some space. (Space, what? These two? NO!)The finale also gave us a look at Rebecca and Jack before they were Rebecca and Jack ― and let’s just say we didn’t know Jack. We are introduced to Jack’s unstable family life and his hostile relationship with his father. In order to move out of the house, Jack and his friend Darryl (Jeremy Luke) enter into a risky gambling situation so they can earn some fast cash. All doesn’t go as planned, of course, and the “bad guys” steal Jack’s money after a poker match. As they try to get Jack’s cash back ― by attempting to rob a restaurant’s cash register ― Jack hears Rebecca singing onstage, and the course of his life immediately changes. He trades in a life of crime for a life of love. (And we start crying again.)Back in separation limbo, Jack reminds Rebecca of this first meeting, telling her, “You’re not just my great love story, Rebecca, you were my big break. And our love story, although it may not feel like it right now, I promise you, it’s just getting started.”Although that speech was epic, Jack still leaves the house, but gives us hope that love will prevail. (Well, until we find out why and how he died). Other notable moments: Kate (Chrissy Metz) is going to pursue a singing career, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) wants to adopt a baby, and Kevin (Justin Hartley) seems to be making it work with Sophie (Alexandra Breckenridge). “[The finale] is going to answer some questions and make people ask some new ones, and change a lot of people’s perceptions about where they think the show is going,” showrunner Dan Fogelman told Entertainment Weekly ahead of the episode. “Without giving much away, it changes everything — and maybe in ways people might be talking about, maybe in other ways.”Now we just have to wait months and months to learn what is actually going on...

During the presidential election, Trump and his supporters often campaigned against Islam.“There’s no denial it’s about Trump ― his candidacy relied on Islamophobic concepts,” Shams said. “I guess what I want people to know, a guy who looks like me ― brown skin, black beard, the typical stereotype ― is not a terrorist. He could even be a U.S. Marine!” So far Shams has traveled to a handful of states, including Texas, Colorado, Washington and New York. His goal is to get to all 50 U.S. states.Around 62 percent of Americans don’t even know someone who is Muslim, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center survey. The same survey also found that while the U.S. public generally views Jews and Christians positively, Americans view Muslims negatively.In Shams’ journey so far, people have asked him everything from “How are you?” to “Are you American or Sharia law?”“It’s a lack of awareness, lack of knowledge,” Shams said. “I respond, ‘Sharia law, do you know what Sharia law means? It’s a moral code, it tells me to be nice to you, to be a good person, that’s what Sharia law is.’”Shams’ project is one of several efforts worldwide in recent years to counter anti-Muslim hate with peer-to-peer education: In Canada, members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community launched a #MeetAMuslimFamily campaign in 2015, to remove misconceptions around Islam. And earlier this year, in the U.K, the Muslim Council of Britain organized a national “Visit My Mosque” day, inviting the wider community to visit a local mosque.One-on-one conversations to counter bigotry have appeared to be beneficial in some cases: One man in Nebraska told news outlets that he once “hated Muslims” ― though he had never met any. But after getting to know his new Muslim refugee neighbors, they supposedly “took the hatred out” of him. Shams himself has experienced some successes in his own travels. In Houston, for instance, a man walking by his sign gave him a “really evil look,” according to Shams. Eventually they got to talking.“Listen, I want to apologize to you for my behavior,” the man reportedly told Shams. “I didn’t read the whole sign.”“So if you had just read the first part [that says ‘I’m a Muslim’ ― but not ‘and a U.S. Marine’], you would have walked away like that?” Shams countered.“I know I’m ignorant ― I feel like I’m being played like a pawn, and people are dividing us,” the man conceded, according to Shams. “I want to learn, thank you for standing here and extending friendship to me.” “That to me is priceless,” Shams said of the encounter.  Shams acknowledged that it is far too much to ask that any Muslim person ― or anyone who belongs to any marginalized group ― be required to educate people who would discriminate against them.“The Muslim world doesn’t have a responsibility to apologize. I don’t expect you to apologize for anything white people do, like white supremacy,” Shams said. “However, if I can help my country, as a citizen, as a Marine, then I think I do have that responsibility.”For Mansoor, his status as a U.S. citizen and a former Marine places him in a unique position of privilege when it comes to countering anti-Muslim hate ― one he says he can’t turn away from. “People are listening to me because I’m a Marine who served. I get that I earn a level of respect and trust where they can hear what I have to say,” Mansoor said. “I would love if the world we lived in was one where it wouldn’t matter whether I served.”In the coming months, Shams plans to travel to several more states with his sign, including Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia.With the ultimate goal of making it to all 50 states, Shams has started a GoFundMe page to raise funds to support future travels.“No matter what I get from the funding, I’m going to do this,” Mansoor said. “The need is greater than any dollar amount. I feel like I’m literally serving my country again ― a country that’s clearly quite divided these days ― by uniting us through conversation and getting out of my comfort zone.”For HuffPost’s #LoveTakesAction series, we’re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened.

Like this:And like that:And like this:And, uh ― then it went silent for a while.But exactly 40 minutes after the president posted his final tweet, the official POTUS Twitter account literally copied, pasted and published the same exact Snoop Dogg tweet. For those wondering, exactly 1 hour and 52 minutes passed between the time of the two Snoop Dogg tweets in question. That means that the president ― nay, the leader of the free world! ― likely spent almost two hours of his day thinking about the rapper, instead of, say, the millions of people who stand to lose their health care under a newly proposed Republican plan. What did Snoop Dogg do to warrant such antipathy? He released a music video in which he shoots a prop gun with a flag that says “BANG” at a clown who looks a whole lot like President Trump.Uh, yeah, believe it or not, that’s it. That’s the whole story, and that’s why the president believes Snoop Dogg might be headed to jail in an alternative world in which the president is still Barack Obama.This is not the rap beef we want.

And now new data shows the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased at a record pace for the second year in a row.“As we twiddle our thumbs, CO2 just keeps going up and up,” Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps Institute for Oceanography’s carbon dioxide monitoring program, told Scientific American Tuesday. Climate scientists have long agreed that the carbon dioxide that humans pump into the atmosphere is the primary driver of climate change, he added.Atmospheric CO2 levels measured at the Mauna Loa Baseline Atmospheric Observatory in Hawaii, the world’s marquee site for carbon dioxide monitoring, soared by a record-breaking 3 parts per million in both 2015 and 2016, according to data that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released on Friday.Carbon dioxide concentrations measured at the facility hit 405.1 parts per million last year, the agency said, adding that similar observations had been recorded at dozens of other sites all over the world.Pieter Tans, lead scientist at NOAA’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network, said that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased at least 2 parts per million for the five consecutive years ― an “unprecedented” growth rate.“The rate of CO growth over the last decade is 100 to 200 times faster than what the Earth experienced during the transition from the last ice age,” Tans said in a statement. “This is a real shock to the atmosphere.” In 2013, Mauna Loa Observatory scientists announced that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide had reached a daily average above 400 parts per million for the first time in history. CO2 concentrations “haven’t been this high in millions of years,” said scientist Erika Podest at the time. “This milestone is a wake-up call.” Two years later, the world reached another grim benchmark. NOAA said the monthly global average concentration of CO2 had surpassed 400 parts per million for the first time. A year after that, scientists said global CO2 levels would likely not fall below 400 parts per million — perhaps ever again. “I think we’re essentially over for good,” Keeling said in May 2016. In the 10,000 years or so before the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels had averaged about 280 parts per million. Since then, however, the concentration of CO2 has skyrocketed, ballooning from about 300 parts per million in 1960 to the current astronomical level. And the upward trend is showing no signs of slowing. Scientists say 410 parts per million could be reached later this month, a concentration never before witnessed in human history. “The momentum we’re seeing right now, going upwards, I think is going to easily carry us through 450 parts per million,” Keeling told the The Huffington Post in an earlier interview. “And then I would say even stabilizing before 500 parts per million is probably not going to be very easy.”Since carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds, even thousands of years, even a fairly stable rate of carbon emissions ― which is what we’ve seen over the past three years ― would still result in an ever-burgeoning concentration of it in the atmosphere. In fact, even if emissions somehow plummeted to zero tomorrow, it would still take many years for the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to start tapering. “At best [in that scenario], one might expect a balance in the near term and so CO2 levels probably wouldn’t change much — but would start to fall off in a decade or so,” Gavin Schmidt, NASA’s chief climate scientist, told Climate Central last year. And this is the best-case scenario. Though carbon emissions have been relatively flat in recent years, people are still spewing enormous amounts of it into the atmosphere every year. In 2014, an estimated 35.7 billion tons carbon dioxide was released by the burning of fossil fuels alone.Since the Industrial Revolution, carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere has caused an average global temperature increase of about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit ― a shift that’s led to record temperatures, melting ice sheets, extreme weather events and other significant impacts.At current rates of warming, scientists have predicted that global temperatures could rise by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (or 6 degrees Celsius) over the next century. By signing last year’s landmark Paris Agreement, however, more than 190 countries vowed to cut their carbon output so as to keep global warming “to well below” 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius). But President Donald Trump and his administration have shown reluctance ― and even hostility ― toward the global consensus. Trump has called climate change a “hoax” and “bullshit,” and said he wants to pull the U.S. out of the global climate agreement. He’s also expected to soon sign an executive order, seeking to repeal the historic Clean Power Plan regulation that former President Barack Obama’s administration issued, which restricts greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.Last week, Pruitt prompted a furore in the scientific community and among many in the American public when he claimed that carbon dioxide released by humans is not definitively the primary contributor to climate change. “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see,” the EPA chief told CNBC. “We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.” The phones in Pruitt’s office were reportedly “ringing off the hook” following these comments, as hundreds of people called in to express their outrage. Pruitt, whose close ties to the fossil fuel industry are well-documented, was also the target of a letter that a group of 30 climate scientists wrote this week that lambasted his comments. “Just as there is no escaping gravity when one steps off a cliff, there is no escaping the warming that follows when we add extra carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,” said the letter, signed by researchers from Harvard University, Stanford University, Princeton University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among others. “[If] we continue to increase the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, the Earth will continue to heat up, with serious consequences for economies and ecosystems across the globe,” the scientists added."

And now new data shows the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased at a record pace for the second year in a row.“As we twiddle our thumbs, CO2 just keeps going up and up,” Ralph Keeling, director of the Scripps Institute for Oceanography’s carbon dioxide monitoring program, told Scientific American Tuesday. Climate scientists have long agreed that the carbon dioxide that humans pump into the atmosphere is the primary driver of climate change, he added.Atmospheric CO2 levels measured at the Mauna Loa Baseline Atmospheric Observatory in Hawaii, the world’s marquee site for carbon dioxide monitoring, soared by a record-breaking 3 parts per million in both 2015 and 2016, according to data that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released on Friday.Carbon dioxide concentrations measured at the facility hit 405.1 parts per million last year, the agency said, adding that similar observations had been recorded at dozens of other sites all over the world.Pieter Tans, lead scientist at NOAA’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network, said that carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere have increased at least 2 parts per million for the five consecutive years ― an “unprecedented” growth rate.“The rate of CO growth over the last decade is 100 to 200 times faster than what the Earth experienced during the transition from the last ice age,” Tans said in a statement. “This is a real shock to the atmosphere.” In 2013, Mauna Loa Observatory scientists announced that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide had reached a daily average above 400 parts per million for the first time in history.
