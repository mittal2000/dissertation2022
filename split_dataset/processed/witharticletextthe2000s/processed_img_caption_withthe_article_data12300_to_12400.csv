0,POLITICS,FBI Employees Wear 'Comey Is My Homey' Shirts To Family Day,Dana Liebelson and Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-comey-my-homey-shirts-family-day_us_5956f33de4b05c37bb7e8532,The show of support appears to challenge Trump's claim of an unpopular former director.,2017-07-01,"Former FBI Director James Comey was called an ineffective and unpopular leader of the bureau by President Donald Trump, who fired him.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5956f6f918000035006725ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Some FBI employees and their guests wore “Comey is my homey” T-shirts to the bureau’s Family Day in Washington on Friday in what appeared to be an unofficial show of support for former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired in May by President Donald Trump. At least a dozen people wore matching #ComeyIsMyHomey shirts, according to social media postings. Family Day is an annual event for employees and their families to visit the FBI as well as showcase divisions within the agency, an FBI spokesperson told HuffPost. People in the photos could not be reached or declined to comment.When Comey was fired, he was overseeing the FBI’s investigation into whether Trump’s campaign associates colluded with Russian attempts to interfere in last year’s presidential election. The White House initially said Trump fired Comey at the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who drafted a memo outlining criticisms of Comey’s handling of the probe into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. But Trump later told NBC he planned to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein’s recommendation because he was fed up with the Russia investigation. Comey has since emerged as an unlikely star among opponents of the Trump administration. Once accused of tilting the election in Trump’s favor with his pronouncements on the Clinton email saga, Comey now appears well-poised to reveal damaging information about the president. Shortly after he was fired, Comey leaked memos he wrote while still head of the FBI describing Trump’s bizarre demand for loyalty and a request that the bureau drop its investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Comey later confirmed both of those incidents in a public congressional hearing. Nearly 20 million people watched that hearing, with some skipping work to tune in from bars. Trump at one point raised the possibility on Twitter that he had recordings of his conversations with Comey — a statement that turned out to be baseless and looks to have been intended to undermine Comey’s credibility. One Family Day attendee wore a button that riffed off Comey’s Senate testimony: “Lordy, I hope there are tapes.” Within the FBI, Comey’s ouster feels particularly personal. Despite the White House’s claim that he had lost confidence of “rank and file” FBI employees, Comey still enjoyed broad support within the bureau, Acting Director Andrew McCabe testified at a Senate hearing in May. And even some of Comey’s detractors saw Trump’s move to fire him as an inappropriate effort to shut down the investigation. The back of some shirts included a quote that was attributed to Comey, though we could not confirm he said the specific words: “We choose to do good for a living.” "
1,POLITICS,"Voter Fraud Panelist Asks Court To Drop Sanctions Against Him, Blames Sloppy Editing",Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-sanctions_us_5957b65be4b05c37bb7eaa19,Kris Kobach faces a fine and ACLU questioning over a brief he filed arguing why he shouldn't have to turn over documents from a Trump meeting.,2017-07-01,"The ACLU sought documents Kris Kobach, now head of Donald Trump's voter fraud panel, was photographed holding while meeting with Trump at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey on Nov. 20.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5957b98d1800003800672631.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach asked a federal court this week to reconsider sanctions imposed against him after the judge ruled he made “patently misleading representations” to the court about the contents of voting rights documents he was photographed holding while meeting with Donald Trump in November.In June, U.S. Magistrate Judge James O’Hara fined Kobach $1,000 and ruled that lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union could question him in an ongoing lawsuit over a Kansas voter registration law passed in 2011. The sanctions came as Kobach, a Republican, has been thrust into the national spotlight as the vice chairman of Trump’s presidential commission on election integrity. He is also running for governor of Kansas.Kobach was photographed Nov. 20 holding documents containing a potential amendment to the 1993 National Voter Registration Act when he met with Trump. The ACLU sought those documents as part of its lawsuit against Kobach over a 2011 Kansas law that requires proof of citizenship when residents register to vote. The ACLU argued that if Kobach was proposing an amendment to the NVRA, he was conceding that he didn’t have the authority under federal law to implement the citizenship requirement in Kansas. Kobach filed a motion to reconsider the “manifestly unjust” sanctions Thursday, saying he didn’t intentionally mislead the court. Instead, he said, he eliminated four pages of arguments from a brief his attorney was drafting in order to get it down to the page limit as a filing deadline approached. In the Thursday motion, Kobach says that last-minute cut eliminated crucial context in the 30-page brief for his argument for why the NVRA amendment documents were irrelevant to the lawsuit and that his attorney lacked time to review the edits because Kobach sent them to him at 10:30 p.m. on the day the brief was due. “It is Defendant’s hope that this Court would recognize that the lack of clarity was a mistake compounded by last minute editing, made in good faith, and would reconsider its ruling stating otherwise,” Kobach and Garrett Roe, his attorney, say in the filing. “Defendant apologizes to the Court for this misunderstanding and will do a better job of ensuring that future arguments are presented more clearly.”Kobach refused to produce the documents as part of discovery in the case, claiming they were irrelevant and protected by attorney-client and executive privilege. The ACLU filed a motion to compel him to produce the documents, which the court eventually granted.Kobach argued against producing them by saying they did not deal with “eligibility-assessment procedures” required by the NVRA, but O’Hara wrote that, after reviewing the photographed documents, they clearly did deal with those procedures. While the court forced Kobach to produce the documents, it has allowed him to shield them from being released to the public.In the Thursday filing, Kobach and Roe also asked the court to reconsider subjecting him to a deposition. Because Kobach is also serving as his own principal defense attorney, they said being deposed by the plaintiffs would present an ethical conflict of interest that could force him to recuse himself as an attorney later at trial. Blocking Kobach from being able to argue his own defense at trial, they argued, “would significantly impair the defense.”Responding to Kobach’s filing, lawyers for the ACLU dismissed Kobach’s argument, saying that he failed to show what the actual ethical conflict was and that the Kansas rule Kobach cited only applied to attorneys in jury trials.ACLU lawyers also urged the court not to reconsider the sanctions based on Kobach’s pleas about last-minute editing because he hadn’t made such a claim in other briefs responding to the motion to compel him to produce the documents from the Trump meeting. The lawyers said the claim was Kobach’s “latest excuse,” and “if a misunderstanding had simply arisen from editing errors, that fact would have been well known to Defendant and his co-counsel months ago.”Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s voting rights project and a lawyer in the case, summarized Kobach’s editing excuse in an email response to HuffPost.“Dog ate his homework.”Read Kobach’s filing urging reconsideration of sanctions below:"
2,POLITICS,You Can Now Buy Legal Marijuana In Nevada,Matt Ferner and Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/legal-marijuana-nevada_us_59554036e4b05c37bb7cedb3,"The state is the fifth in the nation to reject prohibition in favor of legalizing, regulating and taxing marijuana for adult use.",2017-07-01,Customers line up in Las Vegas Friday evening as they wait for recreational marijuana sales to begin.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59580dc32100003400fc5075.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Adults who are at least 21 years old can now legally purchase recreational marijuana from select retail shops in Nevada. Sales began just after midnight on Saturday. There are a total of 44 licensed dispensaries around the state open for business so far, according to the Nevada Department of Taxation, which oversees the industry. Thirty-three shops in Las Vegas and four shops in Reno are among those that have licenses.Customers can legally be in possession of up to an ounce of marijuana or one-eighth of an ounce of cannabis-infused edibles or extracts.Nevada joins Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska in rejecting marijuana prohibition and legalizing the sale of weed for recreational purposes. A total of eight states ― along with the District of Columbia, which does not allow sales ― have already enacted laws to legalize, regulate and tax recreational marijuana. Licensed dispensaries are expected to open for business next year in California, Maine and Massachusetts.More than 54 percent of voters supported Nevada’s legalization measure last year, which required the state to begin selling recreational marijuana by Jan. 1, 2018. But the state’s tax commission adopted temporary regulations to begin sales early, making Nevada the fastest state to move on implementing its recreational marijuana program, according to The Associated Press.“The marijuana prohibition era is finally coming to an end in Nevada,” said Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, the drug policy reform group that backed the state’s measure to legalize. “Adults will now be able to purchase marijuana similarly to how they purchase alcohol, from regulated businesses rather than criminals in the illegal market.” Although pot sales are legal, there are still restrictions on public use. People won’t be allowed to toke up on the street or in the state’s hotels and casinos, where smoking cigarettes is still commonplace. Violations can lead to a $600 ticket. But there’s also still some confusion over how strictly police will enforce these laws ― many people already openly drink alcohol on the Las Vegas Strip, despite restrictions on such consumption.In a statement issued Friday evening, just hours before retail sales began, Deonne Contine, executive director of the Department of Taxation detailed the specifics of the new law and also offered a reminder about moderation, especially when it comes to edibles.“If Nevada is anything like Colorado, we’re likely to see people who have only smoked marijuana in the past try different products, like edibles,” Contine said.The department warned that edibles can be much stronger than smoking and can take two hours or more before the effects fully set in.“Because of this, officials caution consumers to start with one serving that has no more than 10 milligrams of THC and wait at least two hours before having more. Check the labels on products before you buy so you know how much THC is in each product and serving size,” the statement read.(If you do find yourself feeling too high on marijuana edibles, here are some things to remember to help get you through.) Some parts of the state law are still being ironed out. Although existing medical marijuana retailers who have received state recreational licenses can begin selling their existing product on Saturday, restocking on weed may become an issue in the weeks ahead due to an ongoing legal battle over who will get state marijuana distribution licenses. As of last week, liquor distributors ― the only entity approved to distribute marijuana during first 18 months of sales under state law ― had not been issued transportation licenses yet.Nevada’s push on recreational marijuana puts it in some uncertain territory. Despite the continued efforts to decriminalize the use, cultivation and sale of marijuana at the state level, the plant remains illegal under federal law.Former President Barack Obama’s Justice Department allowed states to forge their own marijuana policies, issuing guidance that urged federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. But that guidance is not law and President Donald Trump’s administration has already raised alarm among those who favor reforming drug laws. As a candidate, Trump said he was in favor of respecting states’ rights on legalization. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an anti-marijuana hard-liner who has issued some ominous warnings about states that have legalized marijuana, has suggested that a federal crackdown could be on the way. Although Sessions has said Obama-era marijuana guidance is “not too far from good policy,” officials in legal weed states expect the attorney general to make some changes to it.Kevin Sabet, president of anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said in a press statement that Nevada was rushing to duplicate what his group called the “failed pot experiments” of other states that have abandoned prohibitionist marijuana policies.Nevada has the potential to become a massive legal marijuana market ―perhaps the largest in the nation ― once legal recreational sales begin there in January, largely thanks to the state’s thriving tourism industry. In Colorado, which has a population of about 5 million and sees more than 70 million tourists annually, marijuana business made $1 billion in sales in 2016. “Nevada is a major national and international tourist destination, which means it could become one of the largest adult-use marijuana markets in the nation,” Tvert told HuffPost. “It will really hinge on whether the state and localities adopt reasonable laws and regulations for allowing social consumption in certain venues. Tourists who can legally purchase marijuana need to have places where they can legally consume it.”Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance in the United States. National support for legalization has risen dramatically in recent years, reaching historic highs in multiple polls. Medical marijuana enjoys even more overwhelming support, with a recent Quinnipiac poll finding that 94 percent of Americans approve of allowing adults to use the drug for medical purposes if their doctor prescribes it.A strong majority of Americans also say individual states should be able to enact their own laws on marijuana, without interference from the federal government. A that Survey USA released last week found that 76 percent of American adults want Trump to respect state marijuana laws. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats, independents and respondents of every age group agreed that federal authorities should not interfere with states that have ended prohibition. "

Paramore’s Hayley Williams and New Found Glory guitarist Chad Gilbert are splitting up after nearly ten years together. After getting married last year, the two rockers have announced they’ve decided to go their separate ways in a heartbreakingly honest joint statement. “We want to publicly state – plainly, and only this time – that we are splitting up. We also feel it, important to state that we are going to be okay and in fact, we remain close friends who are good in each other’s eyes,” the statement read. “That’s something we are deeply thankful for. Even though situations like these can feel defeating. We will continue to encourage and support each other personally and professionally.”The former couple tied the knot in a laid-back ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee, in February 2016. Williams paired her fiery red hair with a short-sleeved lace wedding dress.“The two of us have been together for the better part of 10 years. We’ve grown up together and we’ve been beside each other through a lot of goodness and a lot of challenges,” they continued. “There is a challenge to trying to understand your own heart in the context of a relationship… and there is goodness in considering another heart, even in spite of your own. Marriage is not for the faint of heart. Love is an absolute risk. And it’s up to each of us to stay hopeful even when the outcome isn’t what we’d originally hoped for.” The couple went on to thank the fans of both bands, who’ve supported the duo for years, as well as their families for standing by them during this difficult time. The announcement comes amid a bit of resurgence for Williams’ career. Paramore reunited and released their first album in four years, titled “After Laughter,” following Williams’ break from the band.The song “Forgiveness” off the album is apparently inspired by some “rocky moments” in the couple’s marriage. Read the full statement below. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Paramore’s most recent album. It is “After Laughter.”"

Echoing the sentiment expressed by other European leaders following President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the historic Paris climate deal, Merkel emphasized on Thursday that she was “more determined than ever” to implement the climate agreement. “There is still a lot to be done” to overcome the “existential challenge,” the chancellor added.“Whoever believes the problems of this world can be solved by isolationism and protectionism is making a tremendous error,” Merkel added. The meeting of the Group of 20 in the German city of Hamburg next week is shaping up to be a contentious one.

European leaders are united in their desire to move forward with the implementation of the Paris agreement. In response to the Trump administration’s move to exit the deal, Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni came out firmly in support of the agreement. “We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,” the leaders said at the time.

They’re taking a very different approach to the “anti-Romeo” squads in neighboring Uttar Pradesh, which gained a reputation for harassing couples.JAIPUR, INDIA — Lada Kumari, 28, was riding around the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, on her motorbike when she saw a fight break out near the city’s Central Park. A girl in her late teens had gotten caught in the middle of a dispute between several young men after one of them tried to stop the others from harassing her. She looked frightened.“I stopped my bike and broke up the fight,” Kumari says. “The girl went home and the boys stopped fighting.”Kumari is one of 52 Jaipur policewomen who make up the city’s first all-female squad, launched in early May. The women are trained in martial arts and patrol the city of 3 million inhabitants in pairs. Their aim is to stop the harassment of women, known colloquially as “Eve-teasing.”“The group [promotes] women’s safety,” explains Rajendra Singh, the superintendent of Jaipur’s main police commissariat. “They will patrol the most sensitive areas, like schools, parks, and malls.”Jaipur isn’t the first place in India to form a dedicated police squad to stop the harassment of women. This year, the state of Uttar Pradesh launched patrol groups made up of both male and female officers known as the “anti-Romeo” squads. But the squads were heavily criticized for allowing conservative social values to influence their work and intimidating young, unmarried couples.In Jaipur, however, the authorities say their all-female squad will leave couples alone and focus on legitimate cases of harassment.“The point is that a lot of girls don’t want to talk to male police officers when they have a problem,” says Pinku Rathore, a policewoman at the commissariat. “But women understand the problem – we know what Eve-teasing is.”According to a recent survey by ActionAid UK, nearly four in five Indian women report having experienced harassment in public. Young women tell tales of being surrounded on their way to school or work by young men who grope or yell lewd comments at them. Some young men view this activity as innocent play. But increasingly, local officials are looking for ways to stop it.So far, Jaipur residents seem happy with the police’s efforts to protect women.“Men are often sitting in a circle or in a group on the street and teasing girls. We see this so many times. So if the police are making those men move, then that [signals] they are doing something wrong,” says Diya Naruka, a 17-year-old women’s rights advocate from Jaipur.Kanoria College, an all-women’s school located across the highway from the University of Rajasthan, is one of the places where the new squad has started patrolling.Antima Joshi, a 22-year-old art student, says she’s happy female officers are now protecting the area.“I think it’s a good idea for more women police to be deployed, because they understand the problem more than men do,” Joshi says.But Ranju Mehda, the college’s vice-principal, says patrolling isn’t enough to stop harassment.“If there is more patrolling, then men who harass women will be more scared because they know they can be caught. But that’s not a long-term solution, it’s just a first step,” Mehda says. “What we need to do is change the attitude of men.”Mehda says change will begin with the way young men are raised to treat women. And in the meantime, experts say both male and female police officers should be trained to be more sensitive to gender issues.“It doesn’t matter if you’re a man or a woman, it’s patriarchy that is there in the way you have been socialized,” says Nandita Bhatt, an expert on gender violence with India’s Participatory Research in Asia program. “So we need to have these conversations with male and female officers.”Jaipur has around 60 police stations, four of which are specifically dedicated to women’s issues. The women’s police stations are in charge of everything from disputes over dowries to sexual harassment. But while all police stations have a desk where women can bring their complaints, there aren’t always enough female officers to staff them, Singh admits.Kamal Shekhawat, head of the control and command center in Jaipur’s commissariat, says many Indian women lack the means to join the police force.“We have opened our gates and provided opportunities for women to work with us, but often they don’t have the resources [to study], and those welfare issues should be taken up by the government,” she says.Nevertheless, Shekhawat says Jaipur’s commissariat plans to create more female squads in the near future.“Soon, we would like to deploy 26 more teams of two officers each,” she says. “We have scooters to give them, and we’ll send them to the most sensitive areas in the city.” This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

But while all police stations have a desk where women can bring their complaints, there aren’t always enough female officers to staff them, Singh admits.Kamal Shekhawat, head of the control and command center in Jaipur’s commissariat, says many Indian women lack the means to join the police force.“We have opened our gates and provided opportunities for women to work with us, but often they don’t have the resources [to study], and those welfare issues should be taken up by the government,” she says.Nevertheless, Shekhawat says Jaipur’s commissariat plans to create more female squads in the near future.“Soon, we would like to deploy 26 more teams of two officers each,” she says. “We have scooters to give them, and we’ll send them to the most sensitive areas in the city.” This article originally appeared on Women & Girls Hub.

8,BLACK VOICES,New Report Reveals Shocking Details In Baton Rouge Officer Shootings,David Lohr,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baton-rouge-officer-shootings-report-gavin-long_us_5956b62ee4b05c37bb7e6234,"Gavin Long set out to inflict ""destruction ... upon bad cops as well as good cops,"" according to a note found in his car.",2017-06-30,A screenshot of Long in a video uploaded to YouTube. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5956cbcb1500006303bfbae7.png?cache=JvOsUeZQFv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Authorities in Louisiana released a mountain of evidence Friday in a final report which concludes officers were justified in the fatal shooting of a gunman who ambushed and killed three Baton Rouge police officers last year.“There was no doubt here regarding their justifications,” East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore said at a Friday press conference. “These courageous officers who responded to this tragedy were completely justified ... and certainly saved more lives than were taken.”The report, which includes 911 recordings, surveillance video and investigative reports, contains a copy of a lengthy handwritten letter that was found inside Gavin Eugene Long’s vehicle. In the note, Long, a former marine who lived in Kansas City, Missouri, wrote that he knew people would not believe that he would be capable of “such horrendous acts of violence.”The report details the events of July 17, 2016, when Long waged a one-man “ambush-style” attack on police on his 29th birthdayDuring his 13-minute shooting spree, Long killed Baton Rouge Police Officers Montrell Jackson, 32, and Matthew Gerald, 41, as well as East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff’s Deputy Brad Garafola, 45.Three other officers were wounded before Long was shot and killed by responding officers. An autopsy determined that Long, who had a total of 45 bullet wounds, had alcohol and methamphetamine in his system, Moore said.In his note, Long said he had to inflict “destruction ... upon bad cops as well as good cops in hopes that the good cops (which are the majority) will be able to stand together and enact justice and punishment against bad cops.”He called his actions, “A sacrifice for my people and a sacrifice for the people.”The killings came less than two weeks after Alton Sterling was shot to death by Baton Rouge police. That case sparked protests and nationwide outrage after video surfaced showing two officers pinning Sterling to the ground before shooting him at close range.The Hammond Aire Plaza, where Long waged his attack on police, is about a mile south of police headquarters and about five miles away from where Sterling was shot and killed.While authorities were able to determine Long had searched for information on the officers involved in Sterling’s shooting, it does not appear he planned to target them or that he participated in protests.“He thinks protests are worthless,” Moore said, referring to Long’s suicide note. “You’ll read that in his own words.”While the investigation into the attack has been able to answer the question as to how Long carried it out, the reason why he traveled to Louisiana’s capital city in the first place remains a mystery.“We don’t have a clear answer as to why,” Moore said.David Lohr covers crime and missing persons.

12,POLITICS,"EPA Plans New Climate Science ‘Critique,’ Swapping Peer Review For Red Vs. Blue Politics",Alexander C. Kaufman and Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-climate-red-blue_us_59568718e4b05c37bb7e126f,"Scientists, former agency officials and House Democrats fear the new program opens the door to more industry pseudoscience.",2017-06-30,"EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt defends budget cuts during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing on Capitol Hill this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59569ca31500006303bfba39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Environmental Protection Agency has already erased its website dedicated to climate change, purged dozens of scientific advisory board members, and pressured a top scientist to alter her congressional testimony to include more political “talking points.” Now EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt plans to launch a new initiative aimed at challenging the widely accepted conclusion that the climate is changing due to the influx of planet-warming gases caused by burning fossil fuels, industrial farming and large-scale deforestation. The program, reported by E&E News on Friday morning, will recruit experts to debate climate science in a “back-and-forth critique” between a “red team” and a “blue team,” a move scientists and former EPA officials fear will give industry-backed conspiracy theorists equal standing with actual researchers. There are few details available about what the program would look like and how it would be carried out and presented to the public.The EPA declined to comment to HuffPost. “Pruitt said the American people deserve a true, peer-reviewed discussion of climate science,” Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), a physicist who serves on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, told HuffPost on Friday. “What he apparently does not understand is that discussion has been going on in peer-reviewed literature for 30 years.”There is some speculation that Pruitt’s latest move is laying the groundwork for a rollback of the EPA’s 2009 conclusion that climate change threatens human health. Known as the “endangerment finding,” this ruling underlies the regulations on greenhouse gas emissions that the Obama administration established and that the Trump administration has been working to dismantle. Pruitt made his name fighting those regulations in his previous job as Oklahoma’s attorney general. But even if regulations are reversed, the “endangerment finding” could still compel the agency to issue rules on emissions. Overturning the finding itself would require the agency to essentially disprove the overwhelming scientific evidence of man-made climate change. “This might be a crossroads for science at EPA,” Thomas Burke, a former EPA science adviser who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University, told HuffPost. “If you’re going to make the case that climate change is not happening and that human activities are not influencing climate, you’ve got a really tough scientific row to hoe there.” “This could really be an embarrassment to the agency and to the nation,” he continued.There are, of course, uncertainties in climate science, including the rate of warming and the ways weather patterns and temperatures could shift as gases trap more heat in the atmosphere and melt polar ice. Debate over whether human activity causes global warming is fueled primarily by industries that stand to lose money and market if the causes of climate change are addressed, just as the tobacco industry once fueled a debate over whether smoking causes cancer. Pruitt cultivated close ties to the oil and gas companies during his six years as Oklahoma’s top cop, and used industry donations for trips to Hawaii and New Orleans. If Pruitt really wanted to iron out details on climate change, he would enlist groups like the National Academy of Sciences to work on what critics say is already a superfluous process, Burke said.But Pruitt has already spent more time meeting with fossil fuel executives than environmental and public health advocates, so it seems likely that this new program will be geared toward giving industry a stronger platform to dispute largely settled science. “It’s not a scientific approach, but he’s trying to masquerade it as one,” Liz Purchia, a former EPA spokeswoman, told HuffPost.That would be just the latest front in the GOP’s assault on climate science. In March, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) — chair of the House Science Committee and one of Congress’ most outspoken climate change deniers — held a committee hearing to “examine the scientific method and process as it relates to climate change.” Joining a trio of prominent, like-minded climate change skeptics chosen by the majority party was one climate scientist, Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University.The lopsided debate that played out — over whether the vast majority of climate scientists, roughly 97 percent, are correct in their consensus that climate change is real and that humans are the primary cause of it — could hint at what Pruitt’s program will look like.“The whole idea that you’re going to have equal representation of pro- and anti-climate advocates is a little bit strange,” Foster said, adding that questioning the basis of scientific evidence doesn’t qualify someone to go toe-to-toe with actual researchers. “If you’re going to have a review of gravitational physics, you probably don’t want equal numbers of people on both sides.” It doesn’t have to be that way. Offering a more optimistic view, Joseph Majkut, an energy expert at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said EPA could stack the so-called “red team” with conservatives who believe in climate science, shifting the partisan debate from the question “Is climate change real?” to “How should we deal with this?”“[B]oth climate scientists and advocates should see opportunity in a red team exercise,” Majkut wrote in a blog post Friday morning. “A properly-done red team exercise could both elevate the status of climate science in the Trump administration and among Republicans, and reset how we approach climate science as a nation.”Mann noted that the proposed EPA initiative calls for a rigorous review of climate science ― but that is “precisely what scientific peer-review is.” Mann compared Pruitt to Trofim Lysenko, the Soviet purveyor of pseudoscience under Joseph Stalin.  “History will judge Scott Pruitt and his fellow fossil fuel-funded henchmen most unkindly,” Mann told HuffPost by email. “The reality is that the only thing these folks don’t like is the conclusion that the scientific community (that is, the world’s scientists, literally) has arrived at — that climate change is real, human-caused, and a threat.” Funding a program like this spends money that could be used to combat pollution or environmental enforcement at a time when the White House has proposed cutting the EPA’s budget by about 30 percent. “There’s no reason to open this back up in a way to waste tax dollars,” Gretchen Goldman, a research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told HuffPost. “What Pruitt should be doing is using these resources to look at impacts, figure out how to mitigate emissions and focusing on communities that have been traditionally underserved by the EPA.” "

Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and other interfaith activists gave speeches and participated in prayer and worship throughout the night. Together, they decried what they believe are inherently immoral cuts to Medicaid included in Republicans’ Better Care Reconciliation Act. “This attempt to roll back health care is immoral and this bill is an attempt to mainstream inhumanity,” Rev. J. William Barber II, a prominent progressive Christian activist, said during the protest. “To make it cool to be inhumane.”“When our democracy is sick, we must be the healers,” the preacher instructed his listeners. “Our nation is sick but we can’t give up on it ... This is cruel. It’s wrong. It’s immoral.”Listen to Rev. Barber’s speech below.  The vigil began at 4 p.m. on Wednesday and lasted until about 3 p.m. on Thursday. It was organized by the Interfaith Healthcare Coalition, an informal coalition of national faith-based organizations ― including groups like Bread for the World, Sisters of Mercy, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and several mainline Protestant churches.About 150 people of faith attended the protest, according to Think Progress, along with politicians like Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Senator Tim Kaine spoke during a Catholic sunrise mass early Thursday morning.During the interfaith protest, Rabbi David Saperstein, director emeritus of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, said that the Jewish tradition asks followers to pay special attention to those with particular needs who would otherwise be excluded from the community. “The model of the prophets’ willingness to speak to the nation as a whole and to those in power on behalf of the poor, the elderly, the vulnerable compels us lift-up these voices as we gather today on Capitol Hill to call resolutely on the Senate to reject the so-called Better Care Act and instead listen to the stories of the those who are crying out against this dangerous legislation,” Saperstein said. Dr. Sarah Kureshi, a representative of American Muslim Health Professionals, said she felt it is the responsibility of people of faith to “protect the vulnerable and fight against this bill.”  “There’s a saying of Prophet Muhammad about how the community is like a body; when one part feels pain, the whole body responds to that pain,” Kureshi said, according to a representative from Bread for the World. “Similarly, when the most marginal and underprivileged in our community are hurting, forgotten, downtrodden, or neglected it is our responsibility to respond with love, kindness and empathy, because their pain is our pain.”According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the Senate bill would leave about 22 million more people uninsured over the next 10 years. That wealth would effectively be transferred to wealthy people and to health care companies in the form of tax relief. The bill would restructure Medicaid, which currently provides health insurance to 74 million disabled, elderly or poor Americans. Under the bill’s provisions, federal funding for the program would be drastically reduced. Premiums and out-of-pocket expense would increase for some low-income people and for those nearing retirement.The bill also makes it easier for states to get exemptions from certain federal standards for insurance coverage, meaning it could impact, for example, coverage for pregnant women, people who need mental health support, and those who need very expensive drugs.The bill would allow insurers to charge older people five times as much as younger people ― the current limit is three times.Faced with the reality that many Republican senators had serious reservations about the GOP’s proposed health care bill, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell delayed a vote on the legislation on Tuesday. The debate will resume after the Fourth of July recess. During his speech at the interfaith protest, Barber repeatedly questioned the morality of Republicans’ cuts to Medicaid. “Health is a human right and it should not be determined by your money or the size of your house,” he said. “The last time I read Jesus said, ‘When I was sick, you cared for me.’ He didn’t say, ‘When I was sick, you cared for some of me.’”“Jesus promoted universal health care.”"

Mike Pence wrestled with moral questions for months before approving a needle-exchange program.,2017-06-30,"Tammy Breeding, of Austin, Indiana, discusses Scott County's HIV epidemic in 2015. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5956a87d2100003400fc4eb7.jpeg?cache=pSa6o60Fuq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dr. Jerome Adams, the Indiana health commissioner nominated as surgeon general by President Donald Trump, became a reluctant supporter of needle exchanges for drug users only after the worst HIV outbreak in his state’s history.If confirmed, Adams, an anesthesiologist, would succeed Vivek Murthy, who was ousted as surgeon general by the the Trump administration in April. Adams is known for opioid epidemic advocacy and his vocal support of naloxone, the overdose-reversal drug. But he’s also tied to a dark moment in Indiana history: the 2015 HIV outbreak that spread while he and then-Gov. Mike Pence struggled with moral concerns about a needle-exchange program.In 2011, several years before Adams became health commissioner, Pence laid the groundwork for an HIV outbreak in his state as congressman, when the House passed legislation he authored to defund Planned Parenthood. Two years later, Scott County’s only Planned Parenthood ― the county’s lone HIV testing center ― closed.Suddenly, there was no place for county residents to get tested for HIV. Nearly 20 percent of the county’s 24,000 residents were living below the poverty line, and injection drug use was prevalent.By November 2014, just one month after Adams was appointed health commissioner, new HIV cases were being identified in Scott County. By January 2015, Pence and Adams had an outbreak on their hands. But it took until April for Pence to authorize a temporary needle exchange to stem the rising HIV cases. Pence was morally opposed to needle exchanges, believing they encouraged drug use. Adams at first had his own reservations. “There are people who have real moral and ethical concerns about passing out needles to people with substance abuse problems,” Adams told The New York Times in 2016. “To be honest, I shared that sentiment.”Addiction experts say the premise is flawed. “People think that if you give someone a syringe, it means they’re going to go out and inject drugs, and if you don’t give them syringes, they won’t inject drugs,” Robert Childs, executive director of the North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition, told HuffPost in 2015. “But the thing is that if you don’t give them syringes, they share them, and then people will start getting HIV and viral hepatitis C.”That’s exactly what happened in Indiana. As infections continued to pile up, however, Adams changed his opinion. By March, he was encouraging Pence to authorize a needle exchange. “The CDC felt strongly, and I agreed, that providing syringes was the appropriate response, that this is an extraordinary situation that requires extraordinary measures,” Adams said. Pence reportedly prayed about the dilemma, and ultimately green-lighted the exchange, which was credited with ending the outbreak.Still, the delay proved costly. Swifter action likely would have ended the outbreak earlier, instead of securing its place as worst HIV outbreak in Indiana history. At its height, 20 new cases of HIV were being diagnosed each week. A total of 219 people were diagnosed before the outbreak was curbed. Of those individuals, 95 percent also contracted hepatitis C. “We don’t have all the answers, but we are learning as we go,” Adams wrote in a May 2015 press release. “We are building a model for prevention and response should this type of outbreak happen in other communities in the U.S. I would like nothing better than to tell you this unprecedented HIV epidemic will never happen again anywhere else. But I can’t do that.” The experience seems to have turned Adams into a believer in the value of needle exchanges. “Syringe exchanges aren’t pretty. They make people uncomfortable. But the opioid epidemic is far uglier,” he wrote this month in a state Health Department press release titled, “Indiana Syringe Programs Save Lives, Money.”According to Adams’ statement, eight Indiana counties now have needle exchanges, with a total of 2,800 participants. All of them have disease-testing access. Adams’ statement also highlighted important public health facts about needle exchanges. The exchanges don’t increase drug use, and participants are five times more likely to get substance-use disorder treatment than those who don’t, he pointed out. “No matter how uncomfortable syringe service programs make us, they are proven to save lives, both by preventing the spread of diseases like HIV and hepatitis C and by connecting people to treatment that can put them on a path to recovery,” he wrote.Adams also noted that addiction is a medical condition, not a choice. “We must also acknowledge that addiction is a chronic disease that changes the brain, not a moral failure.”Murthy, the previous surgeon general, authored a 400-page report, “Facing Addiction in America,” that hit on the same themes. “For far too long people have thought about addiction as a character flaw or a moral failing,” Murthy told HuffPost in November. “Addiction is a chronic disease of the brain and it’s one that we have to treat the way we would any other chronic illness: with skill, with compassion and with urgency.”Adams did not immediately respond to request for comment.

16,POLITICS,Experts Have A Plan To Beat Climate Change Even If Donald Trump Won't Help,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-plan-2020_us_5955ef9ce4b0da2c73227dbe,"""Impossible is not a fact, it's an attitude.""",2017-06-30,Vast swaths of Australia's Great Barrier Reef have died in recent years due to increased ocean temperatures linked to climate change.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5950e5d8290000cc0f3b119b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The world has just a few years to scale back global carbon emissions to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a panel of leading experts and scientists warned this week. That goal may seem farfetched, but they say it is attainable.The journal Nature published a statement Wednesday from a group of six climate experts urging the world to urgently reduce emissions in order to keep the planet from warming beyond safe limits that scientists established as part of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Dozens of prominent co-signers have also added their names to the statement.The group, led by Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has set a goal of 2020 to begin lowering emissions after a multiyear plateau. The experts said that despite growing antagonism from some parts of the world (like the U.S. under the Trump administration), the transition is still possible.“When it comes to climate, timing is everything,” the authors write. As several outlets note, the group points to basic math to rationalize the urgency of a target just three years away: The planet can probably only emit about 600 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere before temperatures rise beyond 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. Above that temperature, scientists say a slew of horrific effects would be seen around the planet, including heat waves, more intense weather events, rising seas and mass extinctions.The authors estimate we only have about 15 years, maximum, before that allocation is exhausted, and it’d be near impossible to emit carbon for the next decade and a half and then immediately stop. Scientists warn the world is perilously close to missing targets if reductions aren’t locked in soon, and some say the Paris commitments aren’t even close to being strong enough. “If the current rate of annual emissions stays at this level, we would have to drop them almost immediately to zero once we exhaust the budget,” the statement reads. “Such a ‘jump to distress’ is in no one’s interest. A more gradual descent would allow the global economy time to adapt smoothly. The good news is that it is still possible to meet the Paris temperature goals if emissions begin to fall by 2020.”Many of those negative climate impacts have already begun to take place ― even with the limited warming over the past century, the experts write:After roughly 1°C of global warming driven by human activity, ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are already losing mass at an increasing rate. Summer sea ice is disappearing in the Arctic and coral reefs are dying from heat stress — entire ecosystems are starting to collapse. The social impacts of climate change from intensified heatwaves, droughts and sea-level rise are inexorable and affect the poorest and weakest first.However, despite those fears, the group presents six goals they identify as “idealistic at best, unrealistic at worst” to achieve what they’re calling Mission 2020. The group has urged rapid investment in renewable energy to generate 30 percent of the world’s power by 2020, and said no new coal plants should be approved beyond that date. The experts called for 15 percent of all cars sold to be electric vehicles and for vast reforestation efforts to create a “carbon sink.” Other efforts would involve retooling investment in cities and business to favor environmental projects.While those goals may seem unattainable, the authors note that optimism must be encouraged and efforts by the likes of President Donald Trump to withdraw America from the Paris Agreement will not stop a clean energy transition. Trump’s anti-climate agenda is likely to come to a fore during next week’s Group of 20 meeting, as a coalition led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel seeks to refocus attention on the issue, the nonprofit environmental news site Grist notes.“Recent political events have thrown the future of our world into sharp focus. But as before Paris, we must remember that impossible is not a fact, it’s an attitude. It is crucial that success stories are shared. Demonstrating where countries and businesses have over-achieved on their targets will raise the bar for others. More-ambitious targets become easier to set,” the experts write in Journal. “There will always be those who hide their heads in the sand and ignore the global risks of climate change. But there are many more of us committed to overcoming this inertia. Let us stay optimistic and act boldly together.”"

Chance made the announcement after being presented with the Trail Blazer Award by the DuSable Museum during its “Night of 100 Stars” gala. “I’m so excited to not just work hand in hand with the African American History Museum, but we want to build it up,” he said during his acceptance speech. “We want to make it a staple of African American history.

21,ENTERTAINMENT,"Making Movies 'For The Fans, Not The Critics' Is An Affront To The Fans",Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/making-movies-for-the-fans-not-the-critics_us_59512bd4e4b05c37bb781616,Storytellers dismissing critics leads to a slippery slope.,2017-06-30,"Tom Cruise stars in the critically derided ""The Mummy.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595170eb1700001f00102dea.jpeg?cache=TmqMinrOw1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hell hath no self-pity like a filmmaker with poor reviews. See, for example: Alex Kurtzman, who responded to negative reception of “The Mummy” by saying, “We made a film for audiences, not critics.” Or David Ayer, the “Suicide Squad” maestro who expressed his disregard in a tweet: “Made it for the fans.” And while “Batman v Superman” director Zack Snyder reacted to pans with an even-keeled “it is what it is,” his cast went further. “None of us are making the movies for the critics,” Amy Adams said. “What is really going to matter, I believe, is what the audience says,” Henry Cavill retorted.Artists spurning those who critique their work is an age-old battle. But with public reactions a mere Google search or Twitter scroll away, this erroneous divide between “fans” and “critics” has become magnified within American movie culture. Making a movie ― or any type of commercial art ― can be thankless. You spend years with a project, breathing life into ideas that once existed only on pages and in Hollywood boardrooms. You find the right collaborators, spend laborious months shooting it and supervising its editing, and sometimes just as long enduring the grueling media cycle that accompanies its release. Then the reviews hit, adjudicating whether all that grind was worth it. It’s a vulnerable thing, making something for mainstream consumption. To see your name next to a pitiful Rotten Tomatoes score must be heartbreaking. There go years of your life, forever emblazoned with a “nice try” sticker. But bitter directors treating critics ― that is, those paid to comment on culture for credible outlets ― like enemies occupying holier-than-thou ivory towers undercuts their own work. The “this is for fans, not critics” reasoning is a fatuous reduction. Critics are fans. More precisely, we are disciples. We want nothing more than to see accomplished films, hear fantastic albums, read articulate books, binge interesting shows. Writing a bad review can be fun in practice, sure, but never do we say, “I take pleasure in this failure.” Especially when films boast hundreds of million of dollars’ worth of resources, we want you to succeed and create something worthwhile, just as much as you want the glory that comes with widespread praise. Still, we get it: Harsh reviews sting harshly, and what’s “bad” to one person is heaven to another. More than anything, it is perfectly fine to disagree with the critical consensus ― many bona fide classics (and cult favorites) weren’t appreciated upon debut. What these directors and actors don’t realize is that they’re not actually uplifting the fans. Really, they’re insulting them. They’re saying fans are endlessly forgiving, that they’re not capable of discerning quality, that storytellers can do whatever they want as long as the result is full of spectacle and good intent.These comments also risk implying that appreciation must be calculated in metrics. Discounting reviews as a marker of success leaves, first and foremost, box office receipts. But “people liked it ― look at how much money it made” would be a brainless conclusion. Hollywood’s current franchise market exists because devotees are expected to show up, no questions asked. That doesn’t guarantee they’ll appreciate what they see. Only skill and merit ― or, at least, an attempt at something inventive ― can invite admiration. And that makes Kurtzman’s sentiments about “The Mummy” especially foolish, given the movie’s piss-poor performance in North America. What do you do when critics are revolted and audiences are disinterested?Part of this conversation stems from the commercialization of movie reviews, perpetuated by letter grades, star ratings and “two thumbs up” pull-quotes. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel breathed a lot of life into film criticism with their weekly TV show, which debuted in 1975 and ran for more than three decades. But turning criticism into digestible tidbits exchanges thoughtful commentary for Consumer Reports. The see-this-but-skip-that mentality now exists primarily on Rotten Tomatoes, where movies are scored according to “fresh” or “rotten” aggregates. While entertaining and effective, this practice loses the nuance that comes with a finely sculpted review, meant to unpack a piece in terms of broader artistic, technical and sociopolitical contexts. Nowadays, Rotten Tomatoes is a marketing tool. “Get Out” and “Wonder Woman,” for example, ran ads touting their near-perfect scores. Filmmakers who can’t claim such a victory are left out of the party, and some place blame anywhere but themselves or the studios that intercepted their work. Here’s an especially embarrassing example: Responding to disdain about last month’s “Baywatch” reboot, which has suffered mediocre box office returns, Dwayne Johnson implied that critics aren’t people.This, in turn, implies that everyday moviegoers who disliked “Baywatch,” or who were’t interested in seeing “Baywatch” in the first place, aren’t people either. You’re only a person if you like the product Johnson created.A further irony underlies the entire phenomenon. One can assume that Kurtzman or Ayer or Cavill or Johnson will frolic through whatever future adulation they receive from professional critics. Who wouldn’t? But if you lash out at the bad, you don’t get to revel in the good. No one is guaranteed a lifetime of triumph, just as one misfire needn’t define an artist’s entire résumé.Of course, there’s a lot to be said about the state of arts criticism in general. (This column also assumes the aforementioned artists expected to make something of quality, which may not be the case. In Hollywood, sometimes you just need a paycheck.) It’s not the norm, but reviews can be unfair hit jobs, filtered through the lens of one individual. Most critics probably wish they could go back and tame or reframe some of their more biting world choices, like former Entertainment Weekly writer Owen Gleiberman, who later retracted some of the venom he unleashed upon “Pretty Woman” at the time of its release. And if public figures do a quick scroll through social media or comment boards, they’ll find more vitriol than any human should ever consume. Putting one’s guards up, even being ready to defend oneself, is necessary in our contemporary internet climate, especially for passionate artists whose work could be misinterpreted or undervalued. But dismissing negative reception by saying “well, I didn’t make this for you anyway” is misguided. Critics are on your team ― we want you to succeed; in many cases, we’re your biggest fans. It’s why we sought to do this for a living. But we’re also hyper-conscious of the corporatization of Hollywood and the many hands that go into making a movie. Just look at the reports surrounding Tom Cruise’s interference on “The Mummy” or Warner Bros.′ hefty control on “Suicide Squad.” Critics consider all of those factors, and more.Reviews implicate more than a director’s fragile ego. And if nothing else, filmmakers opted to work in a system that invites scrutiny and exegesis. Don’t court critics’ affection and then rebuff their appraisals. You insult your entire audience when you do. You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Read more here."
22,WORLD NEWS,Will Congress Confront Trump Administration's Syria War 'Adhocracy?',"Jon Rainwater, ContributorExecutive Director, Peace Action Education Fund",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/will-congress-confront-trump-administrations-syria_us_5955aca4e4b0c85b96c66091,"For a statement that was intended to read like a bright red line, this week’s White House statement on Syria created more",2017-06-30,"<p>Marines with the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit fire an M777 Howitzer during a fire mission in northern Syria as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, March 24, 2017.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5955b3fc1800001d0067234f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For a statement that was intended to read like a bright red line, this week’s White House statement on Syria created more confusion than clarity. The statement warned the Assad government that it will “pay a heavy price” if it carries out a chemical weapons attack — an attack the White House claimed Syria was making “potential preparations” for.Most coverage of the Syria statement focused on its awkward rollout. One U.S. Central Command source said they had “no idea” what prompted the statement. The New York Times reported that “several military officials were caught off guard by the statement,” and sources at the State Department and the Pentagon seemed to be equally in the dark. This opacity flies in the face of the normal interagency process that usually precedes big White House announcements of any kind let alone the drawing of red lines.Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, has dubbed Trump’s foreign policy “adhocracy” recently calling the administration “a decentralized, improvisational administration.” That’s putting it charitably. One day Trump is delegating military policy decisions to battlefield commanders, the next day he’s blindsiding Central Command. This type of improvisation is plain reckless when thousands of lives hang in the balance.The grim and glittering chaos that is the Trump White House is as hypnotizing as a car crash. That chaos sustains an ongoing and important narrative that the media understandably homes in on. So this week’s Syria coverage has focused on that aspect of U.S. policymaking. But as terrifying as Trump’s military adhocracy is, the larger story is the dangerous direction it’s driving U.S. Syria policy in.Lost in most coverage of the White House Syria threat is that the use of U.S. military force against Assad’s forces or their allies violates both U.S. and international law. President Obama argued that under U.S. law, operations against ISIS in Syria were justified because of the 2001 war authorization that allows for the targeting of al Qaeda and groups associated with it. That’s a very questionable claim given the longstanding rivalry between ISIS and al Qaeda. But not even the most aggressive interpretation can claim that the 2001 authorization covers the use of force against the Syrian government or its allies.There are also strategic questions worth unpacking. For example: what exactly do we expect to gain by exacting “a heavy price” against Assad’s forces should they launch a chemical weapons attack?The administration’s explanation for the first U.S. strike against Assad was that it was meant to deter further chemical weapons attacks. So assuming Assad’s forces were responsible for the chemical attack in April, an allegation the administration has yet to offer proof of, and assuming the administration assessment was correct and Assad was or is preparing another chemical weapons attack, the first U.S. strike was by the administration’s own rubric a complete failure. There’s little reason to think another strike would have more success.Congress and the U.S. public must also debate this key question: How does the administration plan to avoid a full-scale war with the Syrian government and the inevitable quagmire it would create? With each new escalation against Assad and his allies, the U.S. becomes more and more entangled. Following the U.S. strikes in April justified as a deterrent, U.S. forces conducted a series of attacks against pro-Assad forces and recently downed a Syrian jet, claiming self-defense of U.S. coalition partners battling ISIS. Now with the administration’s new threat, the rationale for continuing to strike Syrian forces has shifted yet again to include making them “pay a heavy price.”At what point are we committing to stay in Syria not only until we “crush and destroy ISIS” as Trump has promised to do, but also until we topple Assad, prop up a new government, and ensure this new government can maintain peace and stability on its own, like we did in Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan? Average Syrians and Americans will be the ones paying a heavy price if we allow recent history to repeat itself.Of course, as disastrous as a U.S.-Assad grudge match would be, it would pale in comparison to war with Russia. In response to the string of U.S. escalations since April, Russia suspended its participation in an agreement to avoid mid-air incidents between Russian and U.S. coalition aircraft, stopped using a hotline between U.S. and Russian forces set up to de-escalate tense situations, and said it will track U.S. coalition planes west of the Euphrates River as targets.These policy shifts, both U.S. and Russian, have created an incredibly volatile situation where accidental and intentional confrontations between U.S. and Russian forces are much more likely than they were a few months ago. The risks of a U.S.-Russia conflict can hardly be overstated as both countries maintain and work to expand their vast nuclear weapons arsenals.Despite all the risks, Congress, the branch of government tasked with deciding whether or not the U.S. goes to war, still hasn’t held a formal debate let alone a vote on whether or not to authorize the use of force against ISIS or the Assad government. Thanks to the stalwart leadership of Representative Barbara Lee (D-CA), that may be about to change.In the House Appropriations Committee today, an amendment to the defense appropriations bill offered by Rep. Lee that would sunset the 2001 war authorization passed in a voice vote with strong bipartisan support. While the repeal still has several hurdles to clear before becoming law, it tees up a debate on the House floor on whether or not maintaining a 16-year-old authorization for war with no geographic or time limits is really in our nation’s best interest. If reason prevails, Congress’ blank check for endless war may finally bounce."

Ripped from the pages of his-story, you would have to dig to find out that a woman—a Jewish lesbian—started the war on “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.”Although Ben-Shalom railed against the patriarchy, you’d be hard-pressed to find an article  on the repeal of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” that mentions her name. But don’t get it twisted—Miriam Ben-Shalom not only put her life on the line to fight for our country, she also kick-started a legal battle so that Americans could serve their country, regardless of sexual orientation.In 1976, when Ben-Shalom was discharged for admitting she was a lesbian, she picked herself up by the bootstraps and made a bold move—she would fight the decision in a court of law. Back then, women who refused to fall in line with a male-dominated way of thinking, were shut down immediately, put in their place, and told their voices simply didn’t matter. But as the saying goes: Well-behaved women rarely make history.In 1976, Ben-Shalom was kicked out of the Army for identifying as a lesbian. At the time, she was one of few female drill sergeants, and in 1988, became the first openly gay person to be re-enlisted in the Army by court order. —The Daily BeastWomen were expected to be quiet, while male lawmakers made decisions for them. In those days, it was much harder for a woman to come forward, and when they expressed concerns, they were chided and accused of having irrational fears. But in the 1970’s raping a woman was legal. And until 1978 a woman could get fired from her job for being pregnant. In a time when women were often bullied and even threatened into silence, Sergeant Ben-Shalom stood up and fought back. ‘I can tell you that when I decided to stand up and challenge the ban on gay people in the military, being a Jew profoundly influenced that,’ [Ben-Shalom] said. —ForwardIn 1980, Judge Evans ruled that Ben-Shalom’s discharge violated the U.S. Constitution, specifically, and most importantly, the right to free speech. This was a win in more ways than one. It not only gave a voice to an oppressed group of people, it gave a voice to a woman. And women, at the time, could barely get a word in edgewise.Historically, being born female can come with a dangerous set of consequences—The statistics of violence against women are staggering and young girls are ingrained with a horrible sense of vulnerability. Miriam Ben-Shalom gave women a much-needed role model. She spoke up and someone heard her. She was a trailblazer. A Jewish lesbian hero.But the 1980 ruling was short lived. The U.S. Army refused to comply with the courts decision. It wasn’t until 1988, that the army finally allowed Sergeant Ben-Shalom to reenlist. She became the first openly gay soldier to be reinstated into the Army and was promoted to SSG (Staff Sergeant).That victory was stripped away a year later when it was appealed in 1989. Ben-Shalom tried to remain hopeful.‘’ ‘I do not believe America will let me down,’ said Ms. Ben-Shalom. ‘I’m nothing but a good soldier.’ ″ —New York Times, 1989 In 1990, the Supreme Court refused to hear her case.Time and time again, women were taught that they didn’t have a place in the conversation—even when those conversations directly affected them. When they dared to chime in, they were quickly shut down—ignored and disgraced. This time, SSG Miriam Ben-Shalom was not even given a discharge. She was released from the army as an ‘erroneous enlistment.’ Effectively erased.She’s still fighting to have the ‘erroneous enlistment’ reversed.“[Ben-Shalom’s] commitment to community action has roots in her Judaism.” —ForwardFor Ben-Shalom, being a Jewish woman is deeply linked with an obligation to speak up. Jewish lesbians still face a harsh level of discrimination when their views don’t align—At this years Chicago Dyke March, Jewish lesbians and lesbians in general, with different beliefs than the March organizers, were told not to attend. Several Jewish women carrying a rainbow flag with a Jewish star were harassed, questioned, and thrown out of the event by the organizers. Celebrities like Rosanne Barr considered this a real wake up call.The culpable Dyke March organizers claim that they are inclusive and fighting for social justice, but only if the participants believe like them and support their politics, and all other things be damned. —The Advocate SSG Ben-Shalom fought to give us our rights, but in 2017, it often feels as though lesbians are facing eradication. Less than a handful of lesbian bars remain open in the U.S. Under rainbow rulership, lesbians still face a great deal of homophobia. And a woman’s opinion is still not taken into consideration when it comes to decision making.Growing up in the ’50s and ‘60s, the world must’ve looked very different through Miriam Ben-Shalom’s eyes. As a strong Jewish woman, she went to battle, so the rest of us wouldn’t have to carry a burden of shame. At a time when a woman’s opinion was considered problematic, she bravely came forward, so we could someday feel ‘Pride’. Back when a woman was still expected to play house, SSG Miriam Ben-Shalom stood on the front lines, and she fought.Julia Diana Robertson is the author of the recently published novel Beyond the Screen Door.

Since that statement was issued, I have been called a “RINO” (Republican Only In Name) and told I’ve “betrayed” the Republican Party and that I should’ve shut my “yap.”Why was I moved to oppose a president of my party?I am close to two people who come from some of the seven countries included in this policy. One is my roommate from last year, a graduate student from Iran, holding a green card and studying architecture. The other is a professor I’ve studied with for almost three years, a citizen of the United States who emigrated from Yemen.I don’t blindly support my party or any action undertaken by a member of my party. When I decided to register as a Republican, I didn’t sign a contract promising my fealty. I joined the party because I believed, more often than not, that they represented the values important to me. We made a fair exchange: I gave them my vote on the condition that they promised to represent me, our country, and our Constitution. If they violate the terms of the agreement, I’m free to take my vote somewhere else. Protecting true American values and the rights of individuals will always be more important to me than the temporary success of my party.These women are not a threat to our country. To reduce them to that is an immense disservice. They are kind, fiercely intelligent, dedicated and passionate. We aren’t merely allowing them to take up space in our country. We are lucky they chose to come here and to bring their talents and contributions to us. Thanks to the change in policy, much of my old Iranian roommate’s family can’t visit her in the United States, and she can’t return to Iran with any guarantee that she’ll be able to come back to her studies in the United States. My professor, who has had to hear about the destruction of her birth country only from the news, knows that refugees ― who could have been her under slightly different circumstances ― are not welcome in her new home country.I wish these were the worst repercussions of Trump’s order, but they’re not. Refugees and immigrants who’ve waited years to properly attain the documentation to come to the United States and to escape dangerous and war-torn countries are being turned away at the last moment. Even worse, people who took risks to serve as interpreters and translators to our nation ― and who are now in danger because of this very same sacrifice and bravery ― are being denied admission to the country they tried to help.What makes a Republican a Republican should be that we don’t judge policies based on their intentions, no matter how good they may be. First we look at constitutionality, then practicality and efficacy ― Trump’s executive order fails on both counts. Trump’s executive order discriminates based on country of origin, if not religion. In all of the confusion, we are mistakenly detaining people who weren’t even the intended targets of the order. We are providing fodder for ISIS recruitment propaganda ― not making America safer.This piece was originally published in Collegereaction.com"
25,POLITICS,"ExxonMobil Talks A Good Game, But It’s Still Funding Climate Science Deniers","Elliott Negin, ContributorSenior Writer, Union of Concerned Scientists",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxonmobil-talks-a-good-game-but-its-still-funding_us_5956673de4b0c85b96c66116,ExxonMobil executives repeatedly claim their company supports a federal carbon tax and the Paris climate agreement. The company’s,2017-06-30,"<p>Darren Woods succeeded Rex Tillerson as ExxonMobil’s CEO last January, and so far he’s staying the course on climate.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595670121800002000672449.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ExxonMobil executives repeatedly claim their company supports a federal carbon tax and the Paris climate agreement. The company’s checkbook ledger, however, tells a far different story.Yesterday, the company released its annual list of its “public information and policy research” grantees, which shows that it spent $1.65 million in 2016 on a dozen think tanks, advocacy groups and associations that contest climate science and oppose both the Paris accord and a carbon tax—the very policies the company professes to endorse. Last year’s outlay boosted the total of the company’s expenditures on climate disinformation over the last two decades to $34.6 million.Chamber of HorrorsMost of ExxonMobil’s spending on denier groups last year — 87 percent — went to four organizations: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, American Enterprise Institute, Manhattan Institute and American Legislative Exchange Council.ExxonMobil gave more than half of last year’s kitty — a cool $1 million — to the Chamber, which provided President Trump with a key, but fraudulent, rationale for pulling out of the Paris agreement. Parroting a recent report funded by the Chamber and the American Council for Capital Formation (ACCF) ― which received $1.78 million from ExxonMobil between 2000 and 2015 ― Trump claimed that over the next several decades the accord would cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion and, by 2040, eliminate 6.5 million industrial sector jobs.The Associated Press (AP), Politifact and The Washington Post factchecked the speech and arrived at similar conclusions: The Chamber and ACCF cooked the books.“The study makes worst-case assumptions that may inflate the cost of meeting U.S. targets under the Paris accord while largely ignoring the economic benefits to U.S. businesses from building and operating renewable energy projects,” AP reporters Michael Biescker and Paul Wiseman pointed out. “Academic studies have found that increased environmental regulation doesn’t actually have much impact on employment. Jobs lost at polluting companies tend to be offset by new jobs in green technology.”The Chamber, which has a long history of denying climate science, made similar dire warnings about job losses in a 2014 report analyzing the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. That report used flawed assumptions to magnify the carbon rule’s cost and exaggerate job losses and, like its recent report on the Paris agreement, didn’t factor in the carbon rule’s considerable benefits.The Market Will Take Care of ItThe next biggest ExxonMobil grant last year — $235,000 — went to the American Enterprise Institute, which had already received $4.1 million from the company between 1998 and 2015. AEI economist Benjamin Zycher addresses climate issues more than anyone else these days at the free-market think tank, and his views are diametrically opposed to ExxonMobil’s professed positions. He disputes the conclusions of mainstream climate science, insists that a carbon tax would be “ineffective,” and calls the Paris agreement an “absurdity.”Zycher’s colleague Mark Thiessen, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, is also no fan of the international accord. In a June 2 essay, he cited numbers from the Chamber’s discredited report and maintained that “our emissions will arguably decline faster because of Trump’s withdrawal — because our free market economy will be stronger and more innovative without it.”Wind Energy BlowsThe Manhattan Institute, which received $705,000 from ExxonMobil between 2006 and 2015, pulled in another $135,000 from the company last year. Staffers there aren’t too keen on the carbon tax or the Paris agreement, either. Senior Fellow Oren Cass, who previously worked at Mitt Romney’s old firm Bain & Company, calls the accord a “fraud” and argues that a carbon tax would be “bad for the country” and “bad for the economy.”Another senior fellow at the libertarian think tank, Robert Bryce, previously worked as a newspaper reporter and for the Institute for Energy Research, a former ExxonMobil grantee that is largely underwritten by the Koch brothers. A self-styled agnostic about climate change, Bryce regularly attacks renewable energy. He especially loves to bash wind, carping about the industry’s temporary federal tax breaks over the last 20 years and its threat to birds. Never mind that the oil and gas industry received an average of $4.86 billion a year (in 2010 dollars) in permanent federal subsidies between 1918 and 2009 (that continue to today) or that oil and gas industry fluid waste pits kill roughly three times more birds a year than wind turbines. Bryce never mentions either of those salient facts.Not-So-Smart ALECBetween 2006 and 2015, ExxonMobil gave $600,000 to the American Legislative Council, a secretive lobby group that drafts sample corporate-friendly legislation for state lawmakers. Last year, the oil company gave ALEC another $76,500.Does ALEC also oppose a carbon tax and the Paris accord? You bet.In 2013, ALEC drafted a sample resolution for state legislators to reject “all federal and state efforts to establish a carbon tax on fuels for electricity and transportation.” More recently, the director of ALEC’s Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force slammed the Paris agreement as a “bad deal” for America. “The Paris agreement is little more than an effort by the previous president to lend some international legitimacy to his destructive regulatory campaign against affordable domestic energy,” Kenneth Stein, a former legislative aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, wrote in May 25 essay on ALEC’s website. “As has been seen in any number of U.S. industries, regulation and rulemaking stifle progress and innovation — much more so when the regulations become part of an international treaty regime.”Why bother with a carbon tax or an international carbon-reduction agreement if, as ALEC erroneously maintains, scientists haven’t determined the role human activity plays in global warming? “Climate change is a historical phenomenon,” its website states, “and the debate will continue on the significance of natural and anthropogenic contributions.”More than 100 corporations have quit ALEC for a number of reasons, notably its scientifically indefensible position on climate change. Those companies include a number of energy sector heavyweights, including American Electric Power, BP, ConocoPhillips and Shell. But not ExxonMobil.Meet the New Boss...The fact that ExxonMobil’s grantees contradict the company’s avowed positions on climate science and policy should come as no surprise. Its funding pattern in Congress is analogous. Over the years, the company has consistently rewarded legislators who reject mainstream climate science and vote against carbon tax resolutions by funding their reelection campaigns. Half of the nearly $1.45 million it spent on candidates in the 2016 election cycle, for example, went to 81 climate science deniers in the House and 24 in the Senate. And 18 of the 22 senators who sent a letter to President Trump urging him to abandon the Paris agreement collectively received $371,000 in campaign contributions from ExxonMobil between 2011 and 2016.Rex Tillerson began playing this game soon after he became the company’s CEO in 2006. In January 2007, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report documenting that between 1998 and 2005, ExxonMobil had spent at least $16 million on a network of more than 40 anti-regulation groups to manufacture doubt about climate science. A week after its release, Tillerson acknowledged that his company had a PR problem. “We recognize that we need to soften our public image,” he said, according to a January 10 story in Greenwire, a trade publication. “It is something we are working on.”Ten years later, ExxonMobil’s PR offensive continues. Publicly, company officials repeatedly assure the news media and the general public they have seen the light. Climate change is indeed real and we need to address it. At the same time, however, ExxonMobil is still bankrolling climate disinformation groups and deniers in Congress to stymie government action.In January, Darren Woods, who has been working for ExxonMobil since 1992, replaced Tillerson as CEO. So far, he’s the same as the old boss. His inaugural blog post, which champions natural gas as “powerful tool” to reduce carbon emissions and stresses the challenge of “managing the risks of climate change” while meeting growing worldwide energy demand, could have easily been written by Tillerson. And, like his predecessor, Woods dutifully reiterated ExxonMobil’s nominal support for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and the Paris agreement. But until the company stops funding climate science denier groups and the members of Congress standing in the way, it will remain a major obstacle to saving the planet from the worst consequences of climate change.Elliott Negin is a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The other climate science disinformation groups on ExxonMobil’s payroll last year include the Center for American and International Law ($28,500), Federalist Society ($10,000), Hoover Institution ($25,000), Mercatus Center ($10,000), Mountain States Legal Foundation ($5,000), National Black Chamber of Commerce ($35,000), National Taxpayers Union Foundation ($50,000), and Washington Legal Foundation ($40,000)."

It’s gut-wrenching to know that in the era of FaceTime, Instagram and Twitter, humanity is still capable of sitting on the sidelines, as so many children are slaughtered, maimed and exiled from their homes. Dictatorial tyrants are destroying the landscape of the Middle East as many Arab nations refuse to intervene and welcome-in their neighboring brothers and sisters.I have no doubt that my fellow Americans, suffering mostly with first world dilemmas, are truly bothered when seeing horrific images of starving African children. We are concerned by the condition of woman in Saudi Arabia and we are horrified by self-immolating monks in Tibet, but today I ask the verboten question: What about the “refugee” down the block? What about your child’s classmate who’s too hungry to do their homework? What about the child in Bozeman, Montana who has never had a well visit with a pediatrician, a dentist check up and doesn’t know if their drunk “parent” is going to wake up in time to serve them breakfast?Merriam-Webster dictionary defines Refugee as “one that flees; especially a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution” but shouldn’t the definition be broadened to someone “seeking refuge”, period? According to US government statistics, on an average day in the United States, over 100,000 foster care children are yearning to be adopted, is this not a refugee crisis within our own borders?As an adoptive father of four, I am keenly aware, how challenging it may be to meet the needs of these children. In fact, I don’t expect every American to foster or adopt children, but shouldn’t the “Welcome refugees” sign be held high not only at our nation’s airports but in our local communities as well? Wouldn’t it be noble and merciful if we were to hold up signs saying, “Welcome Johnny from down the block” or “no one chooses to be a refugee, including Maya from Butte, America”?In August of last year, a lovely 12-year-old girl, Courtney, joined our Camp Gan Israel Jewish summer camp in Bozeman. Her mom died tragically when little Courtney was 5 years old and her dad, who loved her a lot, didn’t raise her with the stability that each precious child deserves. With the encouragement of her beloved grammie, she spent two weeks in our home and loved her time here. Upon returning home to Wyoming, she was unhappy and the question arose: Should we take her in as our own?Chavie and I had adopted three babies before Courtney, but a pre-teen? Unlike babies, they come with a long history of “baggage” that affects their every day, their every thought, their every emotion. Courtney was placed by G-d at our doorstep and we needed to answer G-d’s call. I know G-d would’ve understood, if we would’ve said “sorry, we just can’t. We aren’t cut out for this”, but, how could we?We said yes.On Thursday September 1, 2016, Courtney AKA Shoshana (which means Rose in Hebrew), joined our family and just last week her adoption was finalized. She’s an amazing, talented, smart and fun young woman and she will undoubtedly grow to boundless heights. Does that mean she’s always easy? Not in the slightest! Are any girls her age easy? Does she have a lot to repair internally? She’d be the first to say so! But does she have a glowing soul that is in love with Judaism and is she a remarkable older sister to Chaya, Zeesy and Menny? You bet!I know that, like our Shoshana, there are so many gem-like souls out there who need a loving, nurturing and non-abusive home. They don’t always scream for help, because so often they are certain that no one is listening. May G-d bless all the Courtney’s of the United States to find parents who view them as the Shoshana’s that they are!Don’t ever give up!"

Let's Break The Cycle Of Incarceration And Addiction","Ryan Hampton, ContributorAuthor, recovery advocate, person in recovery from a substance...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-recovery-lets-break_us_5956e1d0e4b0c85b96c66200,These people aren’t criminals. They’re people with substance use disorder.,2017-06-30,<p>The women of the Chesterfield County Jail’s Heroin Addiction Recovery Program (HARP).</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5956e2111800003c0067259f.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s the Fourth of July Weekend. While we’re out saluting our independence, millions of Americans will watch the fireworks from behind bars. These people aren’t criminals. They’re people with substance use disorder, and instead of treatment, they’ve been sentenced to prison or jail.How does this happen? Many people end up getting sober in jail. It’s not really a choice: it’s forced withdrawal, without medical assistance. The outcome of this non-medical detox can be fatal. At least four cases of inmates dying while incarcerated have made national news in the last few years. In 2015, David Stojcevski died an excruciating, slow death while serving a 30-day sentence for a careless driving charge. His cause of death was listed as “acute withdrawal from chronic benzodiazepine, methadone and opiate medications.”In these cases, jails often point the finger at hospitals, saying that the victim should have been in a hospital bed. Yet, hospitals regularly discharge substance use patients within hours of administering Naloxone, putting them back on the street instead of offering treatment that addresses the deeper issue.Jails blame hospitals. Hospitals blame jails. And in the meantime, people are dying because nobody wants to be the “somebody” who does something. Our jails and prisons are full of people whose only crime is being arrested while under the influence, or in possession of, a substance they are dependent on.Once released, they aren’t “cured” of their chronic health issue, either. It’s clear that we can’t just arrest our way out of the drug epidemic. Greg Williams, co-founder of Facing Addiction, said, “Substance use always has and will be a concern to public safety and public health. But when someone develops an addiction, we need to understand that a law enforcement-centric approach hasn’t and will not get us the ‘rehabilitation’ goal of the criminal justice system if we continue to ignore treatment and recovery support needs for people.”There is no substitute for medical aid and treatment, and incarceration isn’t the answer. As long as policy makers are hesitant to decriminalize addiction, we will continue in this destructive cycle that costs so many people their lives. That’s not an exaggeration, either: substance use disorder is a health condition which often requires medical treatment, but people who suffer from it are almost universally denied care. This is a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. People with substance use disorder are treated like second class citizens, jailed, and discriminated against. And, as a result, we die in record numbers.Karl Leonard, Sheriff of the Chesterfield County Jail in Chesterfield, Virginia, is breaking the cycle of addiction. Instead of releasing inmates without support, he’s helped create a network of people in recovery who can offer housing, meals, and fellowship, instead of drugs. The jail’s doors are open daily to anyone who needs help: he says they can come in off the street and take part in the jail’s drug education program. “People think Narcan is the answer,” said Sheriff Leonard. “They resuscitate someone and send them on their way, saying, ‘Well, I saved their life.’ But that’s not true. You are not saving someone’s life. You’re only postponing their death. We are taking action to make sure that these people actually get another chance.” And it’s working, at an 89% success rate. That’s higher than most detox and treatment centers. This weekend at the Chesterfield County jail, the women who are incarcerated there will meet for their recovery support groups to share the message of hope: We can and do recover, even in circumstances that seem impossible. We can’t do it alone: we need each other, and we need the love and support of the people around us. They shared a special message in a Facebook Live video on Friday on Facing Addiction’s page: The facility will be open, so the women’s families can visit and take part in the recovery workshops offered through the jail. Sheriff Leonard says that including friends, family, and community are key to reducing the rate of relapse and death. “People forget that addiction is a disease, not a crime,” he said. “Everyone is a human being first.”Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That’s the promise for all Americans, even those of us with chronic illnesses like substance use disorder. Let’s work together to break the cycle, like Sheriff Leonard. Let’s give everyone the chance to achieve independence from substances, and true freedom in recovery.Ryan Hampton is an outreach lead and recovery advocate at Facing Addiction, a leading nonprofit dedicated to ending the addiction crisis in the United States.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

When an act of terror is carried out by a Muslim abroad, the 27-year-old from Newark, New Jersey, said he’s often called upon to defend his faith.If there’s one thing he’s learned from all these interactions, it’s that many Americans seem to be reacting in fear.In an article for Slate, he writes, “I’ve come to believe that many Americans are motivated by fear. Fear that I’ll force women to cover themselves. Fear that they’ll be subject to Sharia law. Fear that I’d kill if given the chance.”On Thursday, Ismail and fellow Slate video producer Jeffrey Bloomer debuted a new video series exploring Islam in America. In “Who’s Afraid of Aymann Ismail?,” Ismail actually seeks out anti-Muslim activists who are convinced that Islam is a religion that should be feared.At the same time, Ismail turns a critical lens on American Muslims’ cultural practices ― such as how Muslim communities treat queer people. In the first episode of the series, Ismail visits the home of Jim Hoft, the founder of the conservative blog Gateway Pundit. Hoft, who is gay, kept his sexuality private until the mass shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub resulted in the deaths of 49 people. The attack was carried out by Omar Mateen, who came from an immigrant Muslim family. Hoft blamed Mateen’s religion for the attack. In the same episode, Ismail spoke with his cousin, Mo, and the filmmaker Parvez Sharma ― two gay Muslims who have faced threats from their communities because of their sexual orientation. Ismail dives into the homophobia that’s present within American Muslim communities ― convinced that it’s these kinds of conversations that will help stop perpetuating fears about Islam.Below, HuffPost chatted with Ismail about his new series and the discussions he’s hoping to spark. HuffPost: In the first episode, you said that American Muslim communities have often defended themselves against Islamophobia by defending their faith from ANY kind of criticism. Why does that happen and what are the pitfalls of that approach?Ismail: It’s kind of depressing, but being constantly on the defensive is ingrained in the Muslim American experience. Even since way before 9/11, people use violence committed by Muslims abroad to demonize the Muslim population here in the States. That means that every time a tragedy occurs that impacts everyone, I’ve got Twitter eggs in my mentions asking me what I’m doing to save London. So time after time, Muslims are forced to remind everyone around them that we are a massive and diverse demographic that spans hundreds of countries and languages, that we don’t even agree on when to celebrate Ramadan let alone the best way to be Muslim. It conditioned me to reject any suggestion that my religion is evil. This ended up hurting me because instead of addressing people’s fears, I reject them as xenophobia and race-baiting ending every conversation before it started, perpetuating those fears. It’s easy to reject Daesh’s enslavement of women or horrific executions of the LGBT. What’s harder is digging deeper and talking about those fears with people who believe that it represents me. By addressing the fears, we can form alliances to reject evil, no matter what direction the perpetrators pray.What have you learned so far after talking to far-right and anti-Muslim activists? What are their motivations?This sounds crazy, but I absolutely love talking with anti-Muslim activists. Not in a sadistic way I swear! I just really enjoy talking with people who have total opposite perspectives from me. From what I can tell, most people who hate Muslims are immensely misinformed and are vocal for the sport. Really, they get their info from sarcastic urls like religionofpeace.com. It’s like being far-right or liberal is being a sports fan and no matter what happens, your team is the best team and all other teams suck. But once we get past the whole “Islam is cancer” part of the back and forth, there’s a lot of earnest fear beneath the hate of societal collapse. That, many Muslims can empathize with given the current situation in the Middle East. What do you think is causing Americans to fear Muslims?The Huffington Post ran this really insightful article written by good friend Rowaida Abdelaziz about search engines weighting anti-Muslim websites that pipe anti-Muslim talking points. I’m serious, they get oddly specific, its weird. When I first talk with people, I usually need to spend 10 minutes letting them vent about what they hate about Muslims, but when they find out that I’m also very sternly against crimes against humanity like terrorism, FGM, and pedophilia, we can start to have an honest conversation about what really motivates their fears. I like to think we are all against the same things in America, [we] just really suck at communicating. Maybe we need national couples’ therapy or something.Who is your audience here? Who are you hoping this video series reaches?Everyone everywhere. Muslims, non-Muslims, anti-Muslim activists, Muslims who hate Muslims, people who just don’t know any Muslims, people who met a Muslim one time and thought they were a jerk, everyone. This entire series exists outside the bubble of partisanship. This isn’t about proving any one side right. The goal is to introduce as many different perspectives to a subject that’s been oversimplified into oblivion. Truth is, people’s personal relationships with their identities are complex, and if you’re interested in a nuanced look inside the complicated lives of regular ol’ American Muslims, watch this series.What kind of impact do you hope this series has?If you watch this series and are confused by it, that’s a win. There is no single answer to these giant questions floating over the heads of Muslims in America. Nobody has all the answers and I really strongly believe that everyone should stop pretending to have them. Every Muslim person’s experience is different, that’s just how life works. I’m already bracing for the ton of hate from both Muslims and anti-Muslims for presenting literally anything about Islam, but that’s kind of the point. Be mad, be sad, be happy, who cares. But the people in this series exist and their stories and reality are just as valid as yours. But that’s a big ask. Honestly, if you watch and think to yourself “huh?” you’ll make this Muslim more happy than Eid dinner.What other topics are you hoping to tackle in the future?I’ve got a doc full of ideas for future episodes. It’s like whatever the Muslim journalist equivalent is to Jay Z’s rhyme book. The next episode will be about hijab, but it’s really about my sister’s relationship with her mom. Even though she’s not so sure she wants to continue wearing it anymore, removing it would break my mother’s heart. I’ve got my heart set on getting that Master of None’s Religion episode vibe for that one. I’m also planning on doing episodes about radicalization, ex-Muslims and criticism of Islam, interfaith relationships, Sharia Law, Blasphemy, and really whatever else Slate will let me get away with."

When I first talk with people, I usually need to spend 10 minutes letting them vent about what they hate about Muslims, but when they find out that I’m also very sternly against crimes against humanity like terrorism, FGM, and pedophilia, we can start to have an honest conversation about what really motivates their fears. I like to think we are all against the same things in America, [we] just really suck at communicating. Maybe we need national couples’ therapy or something.Who is your audience here? Who are you hoping this video series reaches?Everyone everywhere. Muslims, non-Muslims, anti-Muslim activists, Muslims who hate Muslims, people who just don’t know any Muslims, people who met a Muslim one time and thought they were a jerk, everyone. This entire series exists outside the bubble of partisanship. This isn’t about proving any one side right. The goal is to introduce as many different perspectives to a subject that’s been oversimplified into oblivion. Truth is, people’s personal relationships with their identities are complex, and if you’re interested in a nuanced look inside the complicated lives of regular ol’ American Muslims, watch this series.What kind of impact do you hope this series has?If you watch this series and are confused by it, that’s a win. There is no single answer to these giant questions floating over the heads of Muslims in America. Nobody has all the answers and I really strongly believe that everyone should stop pretending to have them. Every Muslim person’s experience is different, that’s just how life works. I’m already bracing for the ton of hate from both Muslims and anti-Muslims for presenting literally anything about Islam, but that’s kind of the point. Be mad, be sad, be happy, who cares. But the people in this series exist and their stories and reality are just as valid as yours. But that’s a big ask. Honestly, if you watch and think to yourself “huh?” you’ll make this Muslim more happy than Eid dinner.What other topics are you hoping to tackle in the future?I’ve got a doc full of ideas for future episodes. It’s like whatever the Muslim journalist equivalent is to Jay Z’s rhyme book. The next episode will be about hijab, but it’s really about my sister’s relationship with her mom. Even though she’s not so sure she wants to continue wearing it anymore, removing it would break my mother’s heart. I’ve got my heart set on getting that Master of None’s Religion episode vibe for that one. I’m also planning on doing episodes about radicalization, ex-Muslims and criticism of Islam, interfaith relationships, Sharia Law, Blasphemy, and really whatever else Slate will let me get away with."

31,POLITICS,Trump Administration Threatened With Lawsuit For No Longer Protecting Yellowstone Grizzly,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawsuit-trump-yellowstone-grizzly_us_59566697e4b02734df31df15,"""We should not be taking a gamble with the grizzly’s future,” an attorney for Earthjustice said.",2017-06-30,"A grizzly bear mother and her cub walk near Pelican Creek in Yellowstone National Park on Oct. 8, 2012. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59567ac6180000380067247d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A group of conservation nonprofits and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe announced Friday that they plan to sue the Trump administration if it does not reverse course on removing federal protections for grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park.The Interior Department said last week that Yellowstone grizzlies, which have been listed as endangered for more than four decades, have recovered to the point that they no longer require protection under the Endangered Species Act.That decision ignores the best available science and violates the ESA, Earthjustice argues in a notice of intent to the Interior Department and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Earthjustice ― a nonprofit that represents the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, Center for Biological Diversity, National Parks Conservation Association and Sierra Club ― said it would pursue legal action if the Trump administration does not retract its decision within 60 days.“With grizzly deaths spiking, now is not the time to declare the great bear recovered and federal protections unnecessary,” Earthjustice attorney Timothy Preso said in a statement. “The grizzly is a major part of what makes the region in and around Yellowstone National Park so special and unique. We should not be taking a gamble with the grizzly’s future.” Federal authorities have said multiple factors indicate that the Yellowstone grizzly population “is healthy and will be sustained into the future.” The decision to remove protections, they said, was “informed by over four decades of intensive, independent scientific efforts.” The population is estimated at 700 bears, up from as few as 136 individuals in 1975, according to the Interior Department. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement that the delisting was “a long time coming and very good news for many communities and advocates in the Yellowstone region.”“This achievement stands as one of America’s great conservation successes; the culmination of decades of hard work and dedication on the part of the state, tribal, federal and private partners,” he said. But conservationists argue that the Yellowstone grizzly is not out of trouble just yet. They point to a record-high 61 bear deaths in 2015, followed by another 58 in 2016. Additionally, the high-elevation white bark pine, the seeds of which are an important food source for the bears, have been severely impacted by disease, insects and climate change, resulting in the animals consuming more meat.

32,POLITICS,Bully In Chief,"Common Sense Media, ContributorWe rate, educate, and advocate for kids, families, and schools.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bully-in-chief_us_59567799e4b0f078efd9893e,It’s clear that the toxic political rhetoric has poisoned our nation’s schools.,2017-06-30,<p>Someone needs to take away the Bully’s Pulpit.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5956859f1500006603bfb9ec.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jim Steyer, Founder & CEO, Common SenseMore than anything, we exist to make the world a better place for our children. That’s why we as educators, policymakers and community leaders devote so much energy to prevent bullying.So it’s especially disappointing to see our current president bullying anyone who he feels threatened by, from women and minorities to his own government employees and our country’s allies.In his latest attack on Mika Brzezinski, the co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, our bully of a president childishly stooped embarrassingly low once again by calling Ms. Brzezinski “low I.Q.” and “crazy.” He followed that up with yet another sexist and offensive comment implying that Ms. Brzezinski missed a dinner he invited her to because she was “bleeding badly from a face-lift.”Fortunately in this situation, Ms. Brzezinski and her co-host Joe Scarborough have a platform to stand up to our Bully in Chief. Their Washington Post column “Our President Is Not Well” and their response on television pulled no punches and, better yet, people all over the country responded in their own way on social media, from members of Congress and journalists to teachers and parents.The question is, where are the members of this Administration? It is especially troubling that our Secretary of Education, Betsy Devos, a woman and someone who claims to care about our children, hasn’t said a word. What kind of example is she setting for the kids she wants us to believe she cares about?Where is Vice President Pence, father of two daughters? His benign silence is as bad as defending the indefensible.Speaking of which, how does Sarah Huckabee Sanders look herself in the mirror after not just defending the bully’s comments, but blaming the media? What kind of example does that set for kids?And how can the FLOTUS say out one side of her mouth that she is combatting cyberbullying while on the other side of her mouth defend her husband’s cyberbullying behavior? She has said, when her husband gets attacked, he will “punch back 10 times harder.” Ms. Trump could have used a digital citizenship course to learn what cyberbullying is before she announced her anti-cyberbullying campaign.At Common Sense, we define bullying as actions that make another person feel angry, sad or scared, usually again and again. That last part is important, because we all make gaffes. Bullying, however, is a repeated behavior, and this Bully in Chief has a track record of bullying that few can contest.This matters a great deal to those of us who are working hard to turn the tide of bullying that plagues our children. In 2015, one out of five kids in America was bullied, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Our goal is to reduce bullying, not encourage it.The bully in Washington’s behavior and rhetoric has had the opposite effect on our children. Recently, Richard Cohen, the President of the Southern Poverty Law Center said, “We’ve seen Donald Trump behave like a 12-year-old, and now we’re seeing 12-year-olds behave like Donald Trump.”It’s clear that the toxic political rhetoric has poisoned our nation’s schools. For example, at a South Central Los Angeles school, girls were called “Miss Piggy,” repeating the slur Mr. Trump used against Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe contestant. In San Fernando, Calif., students flailed their arms to mock students in special education as they lined up for P.E., mimicking Mr. Trump’s ridicule of a reporter’s physical disability.In Washington state, teachers report a new type of bullying emerging on the playground, one targeting Muslim and Hispanic students. A Muslim student, for example, was called a terrorist, while a Hispanic student who was born in the U.S. was told to “go back to the border” and “it’s not right for you to be here.”Tragically, those incidents do not appear to be isolated. In a survey of 2,000 teachers across the country conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center, more than a third of educators surveyed reported an increase in bullying, harassment and intimidation of students whose races, religions or nationalities were targeted in caustic campaign rhetoric, with a number of teachers reporting that students were using the word “Trump” as a taunt or chant as they ganged up on others.President Trump, if I were you, I’d take it as a wake-up call that my last name was being used as an epithet and a rallying cry for schoolyard bullies. Children mirror what they see in the real world, and what they see is someone in power belittling and abusing anyone who he is threatened by. I know of no one who thinks this will make us a great nation.Mr. Trump, I urge you to have more respect for those who disagree with you. Using power to shut down opponents isn’t democracy—it’s totalitarianism. Our nation is built on dissent and our strength is in our capacity to grow from open, healthy debates. Words have power, and the podium of the U.S. Presidency gives those words vast amounts of power. To make America truly great, I urge you to use your words to build—not destroy. Unite the country—don’t divide it with a “put up or shut up” stance.To American families who, like mine, are bewildered by the prevalence of hate speech and offensive comments cultivated by this administration, I want you to know that you aren’t powerless. In fact, each and every one of us has influence. You can choose to give bullies more power by mimicking their actions. You can reinforce their bullying by doing nothing and tacitly condoning their behavior. Or you can step in and defend the people being bullied, which is what we saw in Ms. Brzezinski ’s case.At Common Sense, we teach children, families and educators how to stand up for victims of bullying. Why bother? Because it works. Bullying isn’t a problem between two individuals; it’s a group process. And research has demonstrated time and again that the intervention of bystanders is an effective way to stop bullying and mitigate the psychological damage it causes.For the sake of our kids, whether it is the Bully in Chief, a colleague at work or a child’s friend online, we have to consistently stand up to bullies and stop the damaging behavior in our country. Particularly, the one with the loudest voice of all.About James SteyerJames Steyer is the father of four children, Lily, Kirk, Carly and Jesse.

Victoria Police served his legal representatives with the charges and ordered him to appear before a magistrate next month. He has lived at the Vatican since 2014.“Today Victoria Police have charged Cardinal George Pell with historical sexual assault offenses,” Shane Patton, the deputy commissioner for Victoria Police, said at a media conference. “Cardinal Pell has been charged on summons and he is required to appear at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 18 July this year for a filing hearing.”He continued: “The charges were today served on Cardinal Pell’s legal representatives in Melbourne and they have been lodged also at the Melbourne Magistrates Court. Cardinal Pell is facing multiple charges in respect of historic sexual offenses. There are multiple complainants relating to those charges.”In a statement released Wednesday, Pell said he would return to Australia “as soon as possible.”On Thursday, Pell held a news conference at the Vatican and denied the allegations.“I look forward to finally, to having my day in court. I’m innocent of these charges. They are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,” he said.Earlier this year, Pell upheld his innocence after police said they were considering whether to file charges against the cardinal over his time as a priest in the rural Australian town of Ballarat. At the time, he told reporters he would be willing to “cooperate fully” if asked to return to Australia. “I’d just like to restate my innocence,” Pell told reporters in Rome in May, according to The Guardian. “I stand by everything I’ve said at the royal commission and in other places. We have to respect due process, wait until it’s concluded and obviously I’ll continue to cooperate fully.”At Thursday’s media briefing, police declined to take any questions, and said they would not be providing further updates to the investigation.“It is important to note that none of the allegations that have been made against Cardinal Pell have obviously been tested in any court yet,” Patton said. “Cardinal Pell, like any other defendant, has a right to due process and so therefore, it is important that the process is allowed to run its natural course.”“Preserving the integrity of that process is essential to us all and so for Victoria Police, it is important that it is allowed to go through unhindered and allowed to see natural justice is afforded to all the parties involved, including Cardinal Pell and the complainants in this matter. ”Pell has been slammed for his behavior while in leadership roles in the Catholic Church, while child sexual abuse was rampant. During a recent government inquiry into child abuse within the church, he was accused of overlooking instances of abuse committed by members of the clergy.He admitted during the inquest he was “very strongly inclined to accept the denial” of priests who disputed allegations of abuse made against them. He also said he did not remember if any children came to him personally with complaints.“I don’t remember any such thing happening and therefore I don’t believe it did but my memory is sometimes fallible,” he said in 2016.Pell controversially gave video evidence from Rome instead of appearing in person in Australia during the inquiry, arguing he was too ill to travel."

He was very happy,” Eli Zohar, another Olmert attorney, said of the parole decision. “He hopes very much the prosecution service will not ask to delay his release.”Olmert was found guilty in 2014 of accepting bribes from real estate developers when he was Jerusalem’s mayor, before his 2006-09 term as prime minister and head of a centrist political party.During his time as Israel’s leader, he claimed significant progress in talks with the Palestinians on securing a final peace deal, offering an Israeli withdrawal from much of the occupied West Bank. But no agreement was reached.A lawyer by profession, Olmert began his political career in the 1970s as a right-wing lawmaker who targeted organized crime in Israel. As prime minister, Olmert waged war against militants in Lebanon in 2006 and the Gaza Strip in 2008.His original six-year sentence - the judge in the case said his corruption offenses were tantamount to “treason” - was cut to 18 months on appeal, but another month was later tagged on over obstruction of justice charges.Olmert’s term was ultimately lengthened to 27 months after he was convicted in a separate case involving cash payments from a U.S. businessman.Over the past several weeks, Olmert was again in the Israeli headlines after police raided a publishing house over suspicions a memoir he is writing contained security secrets that had not been cleared by the country’s military censor.Olmert was taken to hospital last week, complaining of chest pains, Israeli media reports said. He was returned to prison on Tuesday after tests and treatment.Any attempt at a political comeback seems unlikely. A court found that his crimes entailed “moral turpitude”, which under Israeli law would preclude Olmert from running for public office for seven years after his release, when he will be 78."

Failure to do so could lead to fines of up to $2,000 and a prison term of up to a year, as well as “public censure,” which would be published in a “newspaper of general circulation.”An exception would be made for “individuals whose faith or religious beliefs prohibit them from singing the national anthem.” While these people would be exempt from singing, the bill states, they would still have to “show full respect when the anthem is being sung or played ... by standing at attention.”The bill, which needs Senate approval before it can be signed into law, is a revision of existing legislation. The current law codifies how “reverence and respect” should be shown to the national anthem, flag and other national symbols of the Philippines. The word “mandatory” is stipulated in the section on anthem singing as well as other stricter provisions. These include mandating the exact tempo of public performances of the anthem (it has to fall within 100 and 120 metronome) and instructing educational agencies to ensure that all students memorize the anthem in its entirety.The new legislation includes several stipulations from a 2010 bill that sought to criminalize “improper singing” of the nation anthem, the BBC notes. That bill had been passed by a 196-0 margin in the lower house, but it was ultimately not signed into law.As The New York Times reported this week, it’s unusual for countries to criminalize the failure to sing a national anthem; but several nations do have laws in place preventing the denigration of their nation’s song. In China, for instance, lawmakers are reviewing legislation that would make “derogatory” performances of their national anthem punishable by up to 15 days in detention, reported the South China Morning Post.In 1942, two students in Chicago were charged with disorderly conduct and slapped with a fine for failing to stand when “The Star-Spangled Banner” played at a movie theater, according to the Times."

The province, which is larger than Texas, relied only on wind, solar and hydroelectric power from June 17-23, reported Xinhua. These renewable energy sources reportedly provided Qinghai and its population of 5.8 million with 1.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity — equal to about 535,000 tons of coal.Qinghai’s fossil fuel-free week was part of a trial that the Chinese government initiated to see if an entire province could successfully achieve zero emissions for an extended period of time. Wang Liming, deputy governor of Qinghai, told China Daily this month that the experiment would set a new global clean energy record.“It will break the current record of four days held by Portugal,” he said, referring to the four days in May last year when the European nation of 10 million ran on just renewable energy. As Grist notes, Qinghai is a hub for clean energy in China. Located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, the province gets plenty of sun (more than 3,000 hours of daylight every year) and is home to the world’s largest solar farm. Also the location of the headwaters of Asia’s three largest rivers ― the Yellow, Yangtze and Mekong ― Qinghai’s hydropower potential is immense.“Qinghai is the country’s important warehouse of natural resources and it plays a vital role in the development of the nation’s green industry,” said Miao Wei, China’s minister of industry and information technology, this month, according to China Daily.China has been positioning itself as a global leader of green energy in recent years. In January, the Chinese government announced plans to spend $360 billion on renewable energy by 2020, an investment they could create 13 million jobs.With its commitment to clean energy development and reducing its coal consumption, China is set to overachieve the pledges it made in the Paris climate agreement, according to a recent Climate Action Tracker report. Together with India, China’s climate commitments have been so significant that they could offset the negative impacts that President Donald Trump’s climate policies could have on the globe, the report’s authors said. “Five years ago, the idea of either [China or India] stopping — or even slowing — coal use was considered an insurmountable hurdle, as coal-fired power plants were thought necessary to satisfy the energy demands of these nations. Yet, recent observations show they are now on the way towards overcoming this challenge,” the report said. “This stands in contrast to the decisions of the U.S. administration under President Trump, who appears intent on going in the opposite direction.” "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595494d2290000cc0f3b1a82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new study has linked the expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act to fewer cardiac arrests in Portland, Oregon, and the city’s surrounding county.Researchers said the incidence of the usually fatal heart condition fell significantly among middle-aged adults in Multnomah County after they acquired health insurance through the ACA. The study, published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association, compared cardiac arrest data before (2011-2012) and after (2014-2015) the implementation of the health care bill. For adults aged 45 to 64 ― a group that saw a substantial increase in insurance coverage, particularly through Medicaid ― rates of cardiac arrest fell 17 percent, the researchers found. For people over 65, whose coverage remained high and largely unchanged under the ACA, cardiac arrest incidence remained the same.This graph shows the percentage of uninsured adults in Multnomah County before and after the health care law’s implementation. Co-author Sumeet Chugh told ResearchGate in an interview this week that increased “access to preventive health care” thanks to the ACA could have made a “significant contribution” to the decline in cardiac arrests among middle-aged adults.“At least 50 percent of this age group — both men and women— experience warning signs in the weeks that precede the sudden cardiac arrest event,” he said. “While this would need to be specifically evaluated, it is possible that new access to health care encouraged some of these patients to see providers and receive treatments that prevented sudden cardiac arrest.” More than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital in the United States every year. Characterized by a sudden loss of heart function, the condition is fatal for nine out of 10 people afflicted. “These findings underscore the important role of prevention in the battle against sudden cardiac arrest, which affects almost a thousand Americans every day,” said Chugh, director of the Heart Rhythm Center at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, in a statement. “Less than 10 percent of these patients make it out of the hospital alive, so by the time we dial 9-1-1 it is much too late. For this reason, effective primary prevention is vital.”Chugh told ResearchGate that he’d expect to see “similar” post-ACA declines in cardiac arrest numbers elsewhere in the country. He noted, however, that the “same analysis would need to be performed in other states before we can say for sure.” The study authors said more research in general needs to be conducted to show conclusively that improved health insurance can reduce rates of cardiac arrest. While their study shows a link between the two, it does not prove cause and effect, they stressed. Senate Republicans are currently wrangling with a new health care bill to replace the ACA, also referred to as Obamacare. As it stands, the repeal bill would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance coverage, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.Commenting on the proposed bill, study lead author Eric Stecker told Reuters news agency this week that lawmakers should “carefully consider” the potentially fatal consequences of the new legislation. “My personal opinion is that lawmakers and voters should carefully consider the proposed healthcare legislation and understand that if it results in more people being uninsured, it may lead to more preventable deaths,” said Stecker, an associate professor of cardiology at Oregon Health & Science University’s Knight Cardiovascular Institute."

Characterized by a sudden loss of heart function, the condition is fatal for nine out of 10 people afflicted. “These findings underscore the important role of prevention in the battle against sudden cardiac arrest, which affects almost a thousand Americans every day,” said Chugh, director of the Heart Rhythm Center at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, in a statement. “Less than 10 percent of these patients make it out of the hospital alive, so by the time we dial 9-1-1 it is much too late. For this reason, effective primary prevention is vital.”Chugh told ResearchGate that he’d expect to see “similar” post-ACA declines in cardiac arrest numbers elsewhere in the country. He noted, however, that the “same analysis would need to be performed in other states before we can say for sure.” The study authors said more research in general needs to be conducted to show conclusively that improved health insurance can reduce rates of cardiac arrest. While their study shows a link between the two, it does not prove cause and effect, they stressed. Senate Republicans are currently wrangling with a new health care bill to replace the ACA, also referred to as Obamacare. As it stands, the repeal bill would cause 22 million Americans to lose insurance coverage, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.Commenting on the proposed bill, study lead author Eric Stecker told Reuters news agency this week that lawmakers should “carefully consider” the potentially fatal consequences of the new legislation. “My personal opinion is that lawmakers and voters should carefully consider the proposed healthcare legislation and understand that if it results in more people being uninsured, it may lead to more preventable deaths,” said Stecker, an associate professor of cardiology at Oregon Health & Science University’s Knight Cardiovascular Institute."
39,ARTS & CULTURE,Chicago Artist Carefully Placed 'Real Fake' Sculpture Outside Trump Tower,Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/real-fake-trump-tower-art_us_59553dade4b0da2c73220eb9,The golden sculpture not-so-subtly calls out Donald Trump as a bonafide phony.,2017-06-29,"Priscilla Frank - Arts and Culture Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bfef7703c000041040ebe03.jpg?ops=100_100,"Those who paid a visit to Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago this week likely noticed a newly installed statue just outside President Donald Trump’s namesake building. The sculpture, the work of Chicago-based artist Scott Reeder, simply reads “REAL FAKE” in metallic gold, uppercase letters. The artwork delivers a not-so-subtle dig at number 45, who has been frequently described as a “charlatan,” a “scam artist” and a “duplicitous demagogue.”Reeder’s piece was installed on Monday night by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), as reported by The Chicago Tribune, as part of the city’s Year of Public Art program.Just one day after the piece was installed, Trump was exposed for hanging fake Time Magazine covers with his face on the cover on the walls of his golf clubs around the world. It also references Trump’s ongoing assault on “fake news” media ― a designation he often slings at publications attempting to hold him accountable. The six-foot-tall artwork was first displayed at Art Basel in 2013, so, regardless of how fitting the Trump associations may be, the piece was made long before Trump was even a presidential candidate. And yet the dig is more than evident. As Chicago city spokeswoman “coyly” told The Chicago Tribune, “what’s wonderful about art is that it is completely open to interpretation.”Reeder’s piece is not the only work of protest art scheduled to invade Trump Tower this summer. Chicago-based architectural firm New World Design Ltd. has plans to erect golden flying pigs that would obscure Trump’s logo from view. Jeff Roberts, who is leading the firm, explained the motivation behind the work in a statement: “The references are many, from flying pigs and Miss Piggy comments to a taste for gold embellished interiors. Ultimately, this is a very rational design and is in direct contrast to the chaotic nature and bizarre antics of our current leadership.”"
40,POLITICS,Tensions Flare After Single-Payer Health Care Bill Shelved In California,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/single-payer-california_us_59553cb7e4b02734df30e2d3,Death threats target Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon after he pulled the bill over funding and other concerns.,2017-06-29,Protesters gather earlier this week outside California Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon's district office in Los Angeles County.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59553d3018000035006721f7.jpeg?ops=crop_33_233_5151_3655%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The debate over enacting a single-payer health care system in California turned vicious this week, as state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon received death threats after he removed the bill from consideration. The Healthy California Act gained traction in the state legislature as President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have tried to dismantle the Affordable Care Act at the national level. The proposal sought to create a universal health care system for Californians in which the government, rather than private insurance companies, would pay for care.The proposal was popular among voters, and drew support from the likes of the California Nurses Association and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who’s already declared his candidacy in the 2018 gubernatorial race. The legislation quickly advanced through the state Senate, which passed the bill in early June. But Rendon, much to the chagrin of the bill’s supporters, opted to pull it last week despite his support for a single-payer system, calling the plan “woefully incomplete.” He urged the state Senate to “fill the holes” and send the Assembly a “workable” bill next year.“Even senators who voted for SB 562 noted there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill,” he said in a statement on Friday. These include its failure to address “many serious issues, such as financing, delivery of care, cost controls, or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters” to make the bill “a genuine piece of legislation,” he said.Rendon’s decision prompted swift backlash among California progressives, and even drew condemnation from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who said he was “extremely disappointed” that the Assembly wouldn’t get to vote on the bill. Supporters organized protests at Rendon’s district office in Los Angeles County, as well as outside the state capitol in Sacramento. Some single-payer supporters held signs depicting the California state flag’s grizzly bear stabbed in the back with a knife that reads “Rendon.” The backlash took a decidedly ugly turn on social media.“I pray someone checks his schedule for baseball practice,” one person tweeted about Rendon, an apparent reference to the attempted assassination of members of Congress earlier this month at a Virginia baseball field just outside Washington.“This is a good way to get guillotined in a public square,” tweeted another.Rendon, 49, confirmed in a Thursday statement that he and his family had received death threats since he shelved the bill. “I’m a grown-up in politics, so those are things I can handle,” he said.What upset him more, he said, was the “false hope” the bill’s backers gave to families at risk of losing health care coverage should Congress succeed in its efforts to repeal Obamacare.“It is shameful how the proponents of SB 562 have provided false hope to people who are suffering,” he said. “The sponsors need to decide if they are serious about having a policy discussion about how to do this.”Bonnie Castillo, associate executive director of California Nurses Association, said the group would “never condone any sort of threats or harm to come to anyone.” The group’s concern is that Rendon acted “unilaterally,” and that sidetracking the bill “is actually a threat to our patients and Californians at large,” she told HuffPost. A legislative analysis released prior to the bill’s state Senate passage showed it would cost an estimated $400 billion annually — more than double the state’s $180 billion annual budget. According to the analysis, $200 billion would be offset through existing federal, state and local funds. The other half would come from tax revenues, which the analysis suggested could come from a 15 percent payroll levy.But another analysis of the bill, conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute and funded by the California Nurses Association, projected a single-payer plan would actually save the state $37 billion. It estimated that the current system costs the state $368.5 billion annually while a single-payer system would cost $331 billion. That analysis suggested paying for the system through new sales and business taxes, or a combination of payroll and sales taxes. The bill itself did not include a tax proposal or any specific funding mechanism. But proponents of the legislation argued that by pulling it, Rendon stopped lawmakers from being able to work out those details.“Why do we elect legislators if not to legislate?” Castillo asked.The nurses association plans to continue to pressure Rendon to return the bill to this year’s agenda, and will canvass in his district this weekend. Still, several roadblocks loom to implementing a single-payer system that are beyond the legislature’s control.One is Proposition 98, a voter-passed law that amended the state constitution to require a certain percentage of the state’s tax revenue be spent on K-12 education. Unless the provision was suspended, it would require nearly half of the tax revenue from the single-payer program to go toward education funding. There’s also the issue of California’s so-called Gann Limit, another voter-approved measure that limits growth in spending by state and local government. If estimates of a single-payer plan’s costs are accurate, it almost certainly would run up against that limit.Both of those issues would likely need to be addressed through ballot initiatives.It’s also unclear whether Gov. Jerry Brown (D) would sign the legislation into law. He’s appeared skeptical of single-payer plans in the past.“Where do you get the extra money? This is the whole question,” he said in March.Additionally, the federal government would need to approve a waiver to allow California to redirect federal funds for the Medicare and Medicaid programs to a single-payer system. It’s far from certain that the Trump administration, which has openly attacked the state, would do so. "

Mike Noel on Monday linked the huge Brian Head fire that scorched some 54,000 acres to a lack of logging in state forests, and said poor land management policies had only helped the wildfire spread.“When we turned the forest service over to the bird- and bunny-lovers and the treehuggers and the rock-lickers, we turned our history over,” Noel said at a press conference this week. “And the fire is going to do more damage because we’re going to lose our watershed, we’re going to lose our soils, we’re going to lose our wildlife and we’re going to lose our scenery.”He continued, “The very thing you people wanted to try to protect... It’s just plain stupidity.”The so-called “rock-lickers” slammed the pronouncement, accusing Noel of using the fire for political gain.“Noel and others are exploiting this fire to mislead the public,” Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The truth is that climate change, drought, historic fire suppression and wind all play roles in the severity of fires. There is no single cause and no easy solution. It’s shameful that Noel would seize on the dire straits folks find themselves in to fan the flames with his rhetoric.”The Brian Head area has a vast number of dead trees that succumbed to mountain pine beetle infestation years ago. But scientists have said the trees have been dead for so long, it’s unlikely logging them would have reduced the impact or intensity of a wildfire.“The fine needles and smaller fuel fibers [from those dead trees] have fallen on the ground or they are gone, so there isn’t that flashy fuel,” Cigi Burton, a spokesperson for the Dixie National Forest, told the Tribune. “That reduces the intensity. It’s like trying to light a giant log with nothing around it.”Mark Finny, a researcher at the U.S. Forest Service Fire Science Laboratory, expressed similar thoughts to The Associated Press.“If we’re looking for someone to blame, there isn’t anyone,” he said. “Forests burn.”"
42,POLITICS,"By 2090, The Paris Climate Pact Could Save Thousands Of U.S. Lives Each Year",Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/extreme-heat-deaths-american-cities_us_59540b89e4b02734df2fae25,"Does Trump's ""America First"" agenda include letting Americans die?",2017-06-29,"People enjoy a day in the pool during a heat wave in the Queens borough of New York City, July 24, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595514751500006303bfb644.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — As climate change drives up global temperatures, sweltering summer heat is becoming increasingly dangerous. And for thousands of city-dwelling Americans, world leaders’ willingness to meet the targets of the historic Paris climate pact could mean the difference between life and death.That’s according to a new analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council that describes some potential local effects of the world failing to drastically cut carbon emissions, as nearly 200 countries committed to doing when they signed the 2015 Paris accord. “If we continue to emit climate-changing pollution at our current rate, our largest urban areas like New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis will see many more summertime deaths,” says the report, released Thursday and authored by the environmental nonprofit’s special projects director Juanita Constible.In 45 of the nation’s largest urban centers alone, by the mid-2040s, the number of heat-related fatalities could total 13,860 every year — or roughly 150 people dying every day for an entire summer. By 2090, according to the findings, extreme heat-related deaths in those cities could soar to nearly 30,000 per year — more than 300 deaths per summer day.By the 2090s, summer heat waves could kill an average of 7,370 people each year in New York alone. Philadelphia, Chicago and Boston would also be hit hard under a business-as-usual emissions scenario, with 5,040, 2,440 and 1,340 annual deaths, respectively.In a call with reporters Thursday, Constible said the report “underscores some of the most dire consequences” of President Donald Trump’s climate agenda. “The Trump administration is doing everything it can right now to roll back climate and health protections,” she said. “Instead of accelerating our nation’s transition to a cleaner, safer future, President Trump and his Cabinet are driving in reverse with their eyes closed.” These future estimates dwarf historic figures. Between 2006 and 2010, about 620 people in the U.S. died annually from heat-related causes, according to a 2014 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Thursday’s report also estimates the number of lives that could be saved in America’s largest cities if countries around the world meet the goals of the Paris accord. By the 2090s, more than 3,100 lives could be saved per year in New York alone. And around 1,600 people could be spared in both Philadelphia and Chicago. By the 2090s, in the 45 metropolitan areas analyzed in the report, a total of 12,820 lives could be saved each year if the goals of the Paris pact are met, the NRDC says.In signing the Paris accord, countries, including heavy polluters like the U.S., China and India, committed to slashing carbon emissions in an effort to prevent global temperatures from increasing by 2 degrees Celsius ― the “magic number” that scientists say the world must stay below to ward off the very worst effects of climate change. This month, however, Trump announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the agreement.The announcement came as little surprise, as Trump has worked feverishly to roll back Obama-era climate policies ― in particular the Clean Power Plan, which limited greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. He has promised to save America’s dying coal industry and increase oil and gas production, and has proposed sweeping cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency that target climate programs.In its report, the NRDC writes that Trump is “leading the United States in entirely the wrong direction” — one that will likely prove deadly.“To minimize needless and preventable American deaths from heat-related causes, the Trump administration must cease these rollbacks of vital health and environmental protections and immediately recommit to the Paris Agreement,” the report states. Extreme heat can lead to a number of dangerous and even fatal health conditions, including heatstroke and cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. Children, the elderly and low-income populations are most at risk. U.S. cities including St. Louis, Philadelphia and Chicago have seen “large increases in death rates during heat waves,” according to the CDC.Last week, as brutal heat scorched the southwestern U.S., a University of Hawaii study found that without global action to reverse climate change, 3 in 4 people on the planet could be exposed to deadly heat waves by 2100. And even with aggressive emission reductions, up to 48 percent of the global population will likely be plagued by at least 20 days of lethal heat per year by the end of the century.This story has been updated with Constible’s remarks to reporters."

Members asked officials to provide “publicly available voter roll data,” including the “full first and last names of all registrants, middle names or initials if available, addresses, dates of birth, political party (if recorded in your state), last four digits of social security number if available, voter history (elections voted in) from 2006 onward, active/inactive status, cancelled status, information regarding any felony convictions, information regarding voter registration in another state, information regarding military status, and overseas citizen information.”The letter also asks election officials a series of questions, including what changes they would make to “enhance the integrity” of federal elections and how the panel can support local officials to improve election security. The letter, which makes no specific reference to Russian hacking in the 2016 election, also asks states to provide instances of voter fraud and convictions of election-related crimes since 2000. Voting advocates are closely watching the commission, which had its first conference call on Wednesday to work out logistics, because they say the group is laying the groundwork for more restrictive voting laws. Notably, the commission is also making recommendations for preventing voter intimidation and disenfranchisement ― something not specifically outlined in the executive order creating the commission.Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under President Barack Obama, said the letter made it clear the commission was pursuing voter suppression.Trump has claimed repeatedly, without evidence, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election. Kris Kobach, Kansas secretary of state and vice chairman of the committee, has a history of exaggerating voter fraud and pushing laws that make it more difficult to vote. Studies have shown that voter fraud is not a widespread problem.Jason Kander, the former Missouri Democratic secretary of state who now leads a voting advocacy group called Let America Vote, expressed concern about the panel seeking voters’ personal information.“It’s obviously very concerning when the federal government is attempting to get the name, address, birth date, political party and social security number of every voter in the country. I certainly don’t trust the Trump Administration with that information, and people across the country should be outraged,” he said in a statement.The panel is requesting states submit the data using a secure file exchange. Still, David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation, said there were ”significant privacy concerns.” The committee is requesting “very highly sensitive individual information that is not publicly available in pretty much every state,” he told HuffPost, noting that the letter says any documentation states submit to the panel will be made public. “Can you imagine basically making publicly available a list of all the members of our military who are registered to vote and giving people their address?” he asked. “It’s entirely warranted that states, especially before they hand over individual level data over to anybody, ask, ‘What do you need this data for? How are you going to use it? What’s going to happen to the data while you hold it? Where is it going to be stored? What are the protections in place and what are you going to do with it when you’re done?’”It’s unclear to what extent states will comply with the committee’s request for voter information.Connecticut Secretary of State Denise Merrill (D) said her office would share data with the commission in the spirit of transparency, but that the commission would have to share its internal documents in that same spirit.“We will request that the Commission share any memos, meeting minutes or additional information as state officials have not been told precisely what the Commission is looking for,” she said in a statement. “This lack of openness is all the more concerning, considering that the Vice Chair of the Commission, Kris Kobach, has a lengthy record of illegally disenfranchising eligible voters in Kansas.”Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos (D) told HuffPost that his office would only disclose the information required under the Freedom of Information Act. The panel requested the states provide information by July 14 ― a deadline he said would be difficult for his five-member team to meet. Kay Stimson, a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State said other secretaries of state intended to treat the information like a FOIA request, which would mean the kind of information released would vary by state.The panel intends to match voter data against a Department of Homeland Security database of undocumented people in the United States, The Washington Times reported Wednesday. Previous attempts to weed out illegal voting using the same DHS database have produced faulty results and led to incorrectly identifying eligible voters as noncitizens.Separately on Wednesday, states received a letter from the Department of Justice requesting information on how they purge voters from their rolls in compliance with the National Voter Registration Act. There have been several lawsuits in recent years over illegal purges.Condos said he didn’t see anything unusual about the DOJ’s letter but that both letters arriving on the same day was unusual.Sam Bagenstos, a former principal deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Obama administration, said the DOJ letter clearly signaled the department was preparing to take action against states.The committee’s first public meeting is scheduled for July 19 in Washington, D.C."

Started five years ago by Micah Hendler, a Jewish-American, the chorus has around 30 students, about evenly split between Israelis and Palestinians. They come from schools in East and West Jerusalem, are Christian, Jewish and Muslim, and represent a range of political beliefs. The group’s goal is to provide a space for young people to get to know their peers from other backgrounds ― who they might not otherwise meet due to the segregation of schools and in Israeli society in general. The group aims to lead by example ― for their local community and the world at large ― on how it can be possible, even in a deeply divided region, to “meet on an equal playing field and see one another’s humanity,” Hendler told HuffPost.HuffPost spoke to Hendler and chorus members about how their efforts finding common ground could help Americans feeling politically divided today.“I think there are definitely political divides now in the U.S. that can somewhat mirror those that we have here in Israel,” Shifra, a 19-year-old Jewish Israeli chorus member, told HuffPost by email (the teens only provided their first names). “Being in the chorus for five years, as much as it can be easy to refuse to speak with the other side, it is undeniable that you can’t make any progress when you have a one-sided struggle.” “As much as it is easy to say the ‘other’ will not understand you … sitting down with someone and disagreeing with them and discussing it for hours until we see eye-to-eye and respect each other is what we did,” she said. “And it truly works.”While the violent conflict between Israel and Palestine obviously doesn’t parallel the U.S. political divide, Hendler said that from his work with the chorus, he sees some useful lessons for Americans in how to engage with others they disagree with politically.  “One of the things that I noticed in the lead up to and after the [U.S.] election, as an American, was that I saw how similar the political discourse was getting to the one in Israel and Palestine,” said Hendler, a 2012 graduate of Yale University who was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. “I saw there was an increasing dehumanization on both sides of ‘the other,’ an increasing sense that somehow truth is relative and not [just that] they disagree with me, but that we can’t even talk to them about it,” he said.In the United States over the past few decades, the divide between the Democratic and Republican parties has widened, with “partisan animus at an all-time high” today, one expert told the New York Times. Members of the two parties are more likely to say they dislike one another, and describe each other as threats to the nation. In one stark illustration, a 2010 YouGov poll found that a third of Democrats and almost half of Republicans would be upset if their child married someone from the opposite political party. That’s up from 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the 1960s.“Turning into a partisan context where no one talks to anyone means even things that are shared become partisan,” Hendler said. “If there are even fundamental things most Americans agree on, but I can’t even talk to that person to find common ground, we’re really in trouble.”As a national debate now rages in Congress on efforts to remake the U.S. health care system, several public figures have called on Americans to stop seeing the issue solely through a partisan prism.“Our politics are divided. They have been for a long time. And while I know that division makes it difficult to listen to Americans with whom we disagree, that’s what we need to do today,” former President Barack Obama wrote in a June 22 Facebook post on the subject. But calling for unity is easier than acting on it ― and the Jerusalem Chorus knows that all too well. During the past five years, its members have continued to come together despite divisive moments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, from terror attacks to cases of police brutality. The continued construction of new Israeli settlements have further fueled divisions. “In the beginning, we [in the chorus] started as two separated groups, and each group won’t talk to the other group because of our differences,” Saleem, a 17-year-old Christian Palestinian who has been in the chorus for two years, told HuffPost by email. “But despite all of our differences we moved on and found something that both sides share: first humanity, and secondly our love to music. And these made us a close, big family despite our differences.”The key to overcoming tense political moments, according to Hendler, has been providing a space, with trained facilitators, for the students to discuss issues head on. For instance, after a particularly violent few weeks in 2014, the students, who were on summer break, called for a dialogue session to talk it out.“One said ‘I can’t believe you wrote on Facebook that you hope rockets fall on their houses, that’s my cousin you’re talking about,’” Hendler remembered. “That’s the problem with social media, it distances us from what we say, the people we’re attacking. That’s why dialogue is important, it puts you face-to- face, and it changes the way you talk.”After talking it out, the kids were able to air grievances and come to a mutual understanding ― even if not always full agreement ― before performing a concert together, Hendler said. “I think there need to be more places, in the Middle East or the U.S, for people of opposing viewpoints to talk about stuff ― and not on Facebook,” he added.Calling for increased dialogue doesn’t preclude people from taking other routes to voice their opinions, such as political action, he said.“That’s not to say resistance isn’t also called for,” Hendler said. “I think it’s important to do both: stand up for your beliefs, but not at the expense of somebody else’s humanity.” Since the U.S. election, there have been many calls for people to simply talk to others across America’s political divide ― and critiques that such efforts shouldn’t put the burden on people from marginalized groups to do the work of convincing others who would deny their humanity.Hendler said such concerns and critiques are valid ― and that these conversations are not for everyone. But done right, he said he believes they can be transformative, for both parties.His group takes specific steps to try to ensure harmful dynamics don’t occur in the chorus’ dialogues. For instance, while allowing for multiple viewpoints, hate speech isn’t tolerated and “certain basic values, like equality,” are maintained, Hendler said.Lilit, a 17-year-old Jewish Israeli in the chorus, told HuffPost by email that “the people from the ‘opposite side of the conflict’ are not necessarily Palestinians,” they are fellow Israelis who support “the occupation [of Palestinian territory], racists, and in general people with whom I have radical disagreements concerning political and social issues.” “Personally, I understand right-wing people better when I actually talk and listen to them,” Lilit added. “Beyond grasping different opinions, dialogue also enables people to be just that ― people. We are more than just our opinions. Dialogue is not a debate ― it’s a conversation that makes us realize that at the end of the day, we are all human beings.”Hendler said he has been thinking of adapting the chorus model to the United States to try to bridge ideological divides. For some of the students in the chorus, such efforts would be an easier endeavor than in Israel.“I see in my personal perspective that it will be easy to change the division between left and right in America, because at the end of the day you are all Americans,” Ala, a 20-year-old Muslim Palestinian who’s been in the chorus for five years, told HuffPost by email.Referring to himself as a “Palestinian under occupation,” he said he sees easing America’s political divide “as simple, as far as I’m concerned, but maybe for you it’s complicated.”Hendler doesn’t think a Democratic-Republican chorus would solve America’s problems, of course ― after all, the Jerusalem chorus hasn’t solved the conflict in Israel. But that was never the goal. It was about expanding people’s worldview and understanding of “the other,” to show that a chance at peace and common ground exists.“I don’t mean to come across like I have the solution ― I think I have something that would maybe help,” Hendler said. “If we can do this with Israelis and Palestinians, but we can’t even do this with Americans and Americans, then we’re really in trouble.”"

Started five years ago by Micah Hendler, a Jewish-American, the chorus has around 30 students, about evenly split between Israelis and Palestinians. They come from schools in East and West Jerusalem, are Christian, Jewish and Muslim, and represent a range of political beliefs. The group’s goal is to provide a space for young people to get to know their peers from other backgrounds ― who they might not otherwise meet due to the segregation of schools and in Israeli society in general. The group aims to lead by example ― for their local community and the world at large ― on how it can be possible, even in a deeply divided region, to “meet on an equal playing field and see one another’s humanity,” Hendler told HuffPost.HuffPost spoke to Hendler and chorus members about how their efforts finding common ground could help Americans feeling politically divided today.“I think there are definitely political divides now in the U.S. that can somewhat mirror those that we have here in Israel,” Shifra, a 19-year-old Jewish Israeli chorus member, told HuffPost by email (the teens only provided their first names). “Being in the chorus for five years, as much as it can be easy to refuse to speak with the other side, it is undeniable that you can’t make any progress when you have a one-sided struggle.” “As much as it is easy to say the ‘other’ will not understand you … sitting down with someone and disagreeing with them and discussing it for hours until we see eye-to-eye and respect each other is what we did,” she said. “And it truly works.”While the violent conflict between Israel and Palestine obviously doesn’t parallel the U.S. political divide, Hendler said that from his work with the chorus, he sees some useful lessons for Americans in how to engage with others they disagree with politically.  “One of the things that I noticed in the lead up to and after the [U.S.] election, as an American, was that I saw how similar the political discourse was getting to the one in Israel and Palestine,” said Hendler, a 2012 graduate of Yale University who was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. “I saw there was an increasing dehumanization on both sides of ‘the other,’ an increasing sense that somehow truth is relative and not [just that] they disagree with me, but that we can’t even talk to them about it,” he said.In the United States over the past few decades, the divide between the Democratic and Republican parties has widened, with “partisan animus at an all-time high” today, one expert told the New York Times. Members of the two parties are more likely to say they dislike one another, and describe each other as threats to the nation. In one stark illustration, a 2010 YouGov poll found that a third of Democrats and almost half of Republicans would be upset if their child married someone from the opposite political party. That’s up from 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the 1960s.“Turning into a partisan context where no one talks to anyone means even things that are shared become partisan,” Hendler said. “If there are even fundamental things most Americans agree on, but I can’t even talk to that person to find common ground, we’re really in trouble.”As a national debate now rages in Congress on efforts to remake the U.S. health care system, several public figures have called on Americans to stop seeing the issue solely through a partisan prism.“Our politics are divided.

Amidst the closures of mom and pop shops and the migration of wealthy residents into Brooklyn’s gentrifying neighborhoods, natives of the city like Brooklyn Deep’s Executive Editor Mark Winston-Griffith, feel their voices aren’t being heard. Co-founded by Griffth in 2014, BK Deep is an online media platform aimed at telling the stories of Brooklyn’s native residents. The publication is responsible for projects such as the oral history series Voices of Crown Heights where they partnered with the Brooklyn Historical Society and the Third Rail podcast which combines storytelling with reporting. In the hopes of expanding their reach and impact, BK Deep recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production equipment, special projects and audience growth initiatives. “In a neighborhood in which Black culture is fading, Brooklyn Deep is an act of self-determination that celebrates the struggle and complex humanity of Black Brooklyn,” BK Deep’s Kickstarter page read. Brooklyn, with its growing population of young white affluent New York City transplants, Whole Foods grocery stores and coffee shops, has been an epicenter of gentrification and displacement. “As [a resident] of a low and moderate income neighborhood, I’ve been part of civic and institutional struggles over the years to bring improvement,” Griffith told HuffPost last week. “And I think it’s possible to [improve] in a way that doesn’t erase a population and make it completely unaffordable,” said Griffith, a native of the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.In 2015, the New York Times published an article titled “Gentrification in a Brooklyn Neighborhood Forces Residents to Move On” which highlighted long-term residents of Crown Heights, all of whom were of color, being pushed out of their homes due to soaring rent prices. The residents featured in the NYT article are exactly the people BK Deep wants to provide with a platform. “Over the last decade, when promoting a vision of Central Brooklyn’s future, the real estate industry and even many middle class interests within our own community implicitly equated improvement with non-blackness,” Griffith said.BKDeep’s Kickstarter closes on Friday.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595446db170000200010346a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Hundreds of activists marched around the Capitol on Wednesday to protest the Republican health care bill in a demonstration organizers called a “human chain” protest.Although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) canceled a vote on Obamacare replacement legislation on Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers warned against growing complacent and insisted that progressives must keep the pressure on if they are to defeat the bill for good.“Yesterday was not a victory, not even close,” said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. “Yesterday was an opportunity. It’s an opportunity keep making your voices heard.”Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) suggested the July Fourth weekend was an ideal time to express outrage to Republican members of Congress.“Take that moment to celebrate and then get back on the horse! Because I’ll tell you what: Nobody wants to get yelled at at a Fourth of July parade,” he said, drawing laughs from the crowd.The event was announced by liberal groups like MoveOn.org, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood days earlier when a vote on the Republican bill appeared imminent. Tuesday’s decision to delay the vote came a day after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its estimates that the Senate bill would result in 22 million fewer people having health care coverage over the next 10 years. For a time it seemed as though the Senate bill, plotted rapidly and behind closed doors for the last several weeks, did not inspire the same level of grassroots outrage as had the bill that passed the House of Representatives in May and a failed run at a vote in March. But the rally at the Capitol was the capstone of a week of smaller demonstrations, many of them by people with disabilities and other groups especially vulnerable to the bill’s cuts to Medicaid.Most of the crowd on Wednesday, which was filled with pink Planned Parenthood T-shirts, hailed from the metropolitan Washington area. Livestreams of the event were broadcast on Facebook to hundreds of thousands of people.One 32-year-old Washingtonian woman at the rally who declined to be named said she was worried the bill would hurt her personally. She is a college graduate and works in the arts, she said, but makes just $13 an hour and depends on Medicaid for her insurance.“There’s this misconception about people who are on Medicaid,” she said. “Thank God I can get Medicaid.”There were some health care advocates who traveled far distances to the rally, including Marcia Hams, chairwoman of the Boston-based organization Health Care for All.“We worked really hard to pass and make the Affordable Care Act work, so it’s really a terrible prospect that we might lose it and that so many people would lose their health care,” she said. “It’d be terrible for seniors, terrible for people with disabilities.”Other Obamacare supporters amassed outside the Trump International Hotel a few blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue. They greeted President Donald Trump with jeers as he arrived to attend a re-election fundraiser.In some ways the rally took on the feel of a 2020 presidential candidate cattle call, giving some of the Democratic Party’s rising stars a chance to connect with party activists. In addition to Schatz and Murray, young targets of presidential speculation already, Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.) received a warm reception. “You must now look at the face of history and say, ‘It is my turn to stand up, it is my turn to fight. It is my turn to unleash the forces of love on America,’” Booker told the crowd. “If we fight together, if we work together, and we love together and we get folk woke, this bill will die.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez were among the other leaders who spoke.Nonetheless, there were signs of the divisions between the party’s populist left wing and its more centrist faction.At the edge of the rally, several dozen activists from the Washington and Baltimore chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America stood with banners displaying their logo of two shaking hands and a rose, and placards that said, “Health care is a human right” and “Medicine for profit is a crime against humanity.” Periodically, one of the DSA members would yell out “single-payer,” only to be ignored by the other people assembled there. Attendees were disappointed that none of the speakers called for a single-payer health care system, or “Medicare for all,” but they were all happy to be protesting the Republican legislation with Democrats. The DSA, a dues-paying organization, works selectively with Democrats, even as it advances a more radical agenda. (Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Democratic Caucus who is favored by DSA members, did not speak, having already returned to Vermont for the holiday weekend.)“We have to do it through both evolutionary and revolutionary means, meaning we need to work with Democrats, but we also need to be in the streets,” said Jessica Crawford, 26, of Washington, D.C. “So we can do both.” This story has been updated to include comment from Hams."
50,ENTERTAINMENT,Fake Melania Trump Dreams Of Day She’ll Retire Role As Donald's Wife On 'Colbert',Todd Van Luling,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fake-melania-trump-stephen-colbert-laura-benanti_us_595404bde4b05c37bb7ba73b,"The ""Late Show"" star just wants this to end.",2017-06-29,"Laura Benanti at the 62nd Annual Drama Desk Nominations on April 27, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595406d317000020001033f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Laura Benanti was “Daniel Day-Lewis-ing” (her words) a Melania Trump impersonation among Stephen Colbert’s staff when her husband jokingly told her something to the effect of, “I don’t like this, this is scaring me.”The Tony Award-winning actress had only had hours to whip together a Melania character. She woke up one morning in Delaware to “a flurry of emails and calls” from “The Late Show” asking her to appear that night. The task would be to parody the Republican convention speech the future first lady had apparently just plagiarized from Michelle Obama, then the current first lady.Her impersonation developed over the course of a train ride between Wilmington and New York City. Benanti sat next to a stranger on the train. “I was practicing and trying to get her mannerisms down,” said Benanti to HuffPost over a phone conversation. “And I’m pretty sure that guy thought I was going to murder her.”Earlier in 2016, Benanti had appeared on the show to promote the play “She Loves Me.” During the appearance, Colbert presented side-by-side photos of Benanti and Melania to highlight the similarities in their appearance. When the show wanted to do their Melania sketch in a pinch, Benanti became entrusted with the role.“I had such a short amount of time to work up the impression, that basically I just stayed in character for the four hours that I was at Colbert,” said Benanti. “I’m sure everyone was like, calm down, but you know, it’s not a lot of time to prepare something.”The video ended up becoming the first political sketch to go extremely viral for “The Late Show,” garnering over 9.3 million views on YouTube alone to date. The segment was so good that it essentially became a cornerstone for the success the show has built over the last few months, with Colbert pivoting to focus heavily on Donald Trump.For Benanti, the original and subsequent impersonations have greatly elevated her profile and are now helping her fulfill a goal of getting more comedic acting opportunities.But despite the success, Benanti wants this role to end as soon as possible.“The best day of my life will be the last impression,” said Benanti about dreaming of the day the Trump family leaves the White House. “Where Melania can break free, and we are breaking free. That will be the happiest I have ever been.” Other than ― “my wedding to my husband and the birth of my daughter” ― of course.“I would much prefer the good of our nation over my impersonation.” Benanti is no fan of Donald Trump.“I’ve always thought of him as sort of a brash egomaniacal loud mouth with a show that people inexplicably watched,” said Benanti. “I didn’t think much of him [before the election]. And I mean that in both ways.”She’s particularly frustrated by the hypocrisy. “Everyone complaining about celebrities or actors or whomever telling them how they should live their lives, I mean, that’s who was elected,” said Benanti.Of course, the actress is not parodying Donald. She’s playing Melania. Benanti wrestles with that distinction.“I think [Melania is] a beautiful woman, she speaks five languages and I don’t think she ever thought she would be a first lady,” explained Benanti. “I don’t want to come after her or Baron. I don’t want it to be a nasty impression. I want to make fun of him. And I can’t do a Donald Trump impression, so that’s my sort of angle.”As the impersonation has evolved ― and Melania became the First Lady ― Benanti refined the angle into something relatable to the similarly scared and angry country.“My take on it subsequently has been that we’re essentially all his reluctant wife now,” said Benanti. “Like, we are all reluctantly married to Donald Trump. So, we have to ― for the most part ― make the best of it and figure out how to hashtag resist.”Benanti loves “The Late Show” team and has no interest in quitting the role. Colbert has great ratings. The impersonation has opened new doors for her professionally. But being in this position is still, inherently, a bad situation. And she’d like to break free.“We’re all reluctantly married to him now,” she reiterated. Watch the original sketch below: "
51,WOMEN,"From Hidden Figures to Wonder Woman, Invisible Stories Become Visible","Jess Weiner, ContributorCEO, Talk to Jess, LLC",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-hidden-figures-to-wonder-woman-invisible-stories_us_595456e1e4b0f078efd98756,"Over the past decade, we’ve seen a shift in the media aimed at deepening the representation of women in media and pop culture",2017-06-29,<p>The incredible Katherine Johnson and the cast of Hidden Figures. #SquadGoals</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5954576f170000280010348c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past decade, we’ve seen a shift in the media aimed at deepening the representation of women in media and pop culture. There have been great steps taken in democratizing the images we see and the stories we absorb. Wonder Woman just made box office history and will likely be the standout of the summer, even though it took 75 years for her to make it to the big screen. Mad Max: Fury Road saw Furiosa saving her people from a crazed tyrant and proved that leading ladies can be the heroes of their own stories. Characters like Christina Yang on Grey’s Anatomy, Alicia Florrick on The Good Wife, Issa Dee on Insecure, and Selina Meyer on Veep all show we can have leading ladies who are complex, flawed, confusing, and (gasp) at times, unlikeable.Yet, we still have plenty of work to do. Women only comprise one third of the speaking parts in major films, despite the fact that we make up over half of the ticket-buying audience. If you look behind the camera, the numbers get depressingly worse. According to Dr. Stacy L. Smith and USC Annenberg’s Media Diversity and Social Change Initiative, in 2015, only 3.4% of film directors were women.Many amazing women’s stories are hiding in the shadows and it’s time to bring them into the spotlight. This is not just a moral imperative, it’s a business imperative as well. According to the 2017 Hollywood Diversity Report, quality storytelling plus rich, diverse performances equals box office and ratings success. Hidden Figures and Hidden StoriesIt helps when we put women in charge. After Disney named Kathleen Kennedy the new President of Lucasfilm in 2012, the consequent Star Wars films, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, both followed complex, interesting, and capable women. Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman finally gave DC’s most iconic female superhero the film she deserved, allowing Diana Prince to be the center of her own story.However, despite these massive successes, it’s important to note the lack of women of color with major speaking roles in popular blockbuster films. In the past few years, almost every top-grossing female-led film has starred a white woman. One exception was 2016’s Hidden Figures. Directed by Theodore Melfi, the film tells the true story of three African American women who were integral to NASA’s space program, all while fighting racism in the late 1950s. These women are an integral reason for NASA’s success, and yet it took almost sixty years for their story to be told. Hollywood studios are still hesitant to put female stars front and center, even though box office numbers prove that women can carry a film and further a franchise. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has made more than one billion dollars in the six months since its release; Star Wars: The Force Awakens has grossed more than double that. Wonder Woman has only been out for a few weeks and has already taken in $435 million at the box office. Hidden Figures was nominated for three Oscars and made $230 million. We don’t need to wring our hands over whether a movie about women will sell or not. Audiences want to see great stories -- period.Ava DuVernayFemale directors are so rare that Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins was only the second to direct a film with a budget over $100 million. For female directors of color, it’s even harder; Ava DuVernay became the only black woman to direct a film with a budget over $100 million this year when she directed Disney’s upcoming A Wrinkle in Time. DuVernay used the opportunity to create an even more diverse world by featuring stars like Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and newcomer Skye Reid.Ava DuVernay embodies a feminine leadership that challenges Hollywood directorial expectations; she directs with compassion and kindness and she uses her success to lift up others. DuVernay and frequent collaborator Oprah Winfrey hired all female directors for their OWN series Queen Sugar and they make sure that every episode produced features a scene that passes the Bechdel test. She is the shining example of what can come from putting a woman at the helm: more stories about women, more ethnicities on camera, and more women in key production roles.Jill SolowaySince 2014, Jill Soloway has made their name making television that showcases women who are typically invisible in mainstream media. Their first series, the Emmy & Golden Globe award-winning Transparent, examines the ripple effects that come with a parent coming out as trans to her adult children. Soloway’s new series, I Love Dick, explores female desire and sexual orientation when a married couple both find themselves infatuated with the same man.Soloway’s work gives voice and opportunity to women who are often marginalized; Transparent employed more than twenty trans crew members and sixty trans extras in its first season and I Love Dick features women and gender queer people of color in leading and supporting roles. Soloway takes people who have lived most of their lives outside of the spotlight and brings them into the narrative and to the creative process through her work. She directs her cast and crew from a place of collaboration, respect and honesty.Why does this matter? Because when people don’t see themselves reflected in the media, it sends a message that their lived experiences aren’t real or worthy of being shared. When we take those experiences and make them visible, we legitimize them, and we create a world where people feel included and seen. Real Beauty ProductionsShonda Rhimes has long been an advocate for ordinary diversity. The stories told in her network dramas are reflective of the way that the real world looks: different genders, different races, different sexual orientations. We live in a time when 71% of women and 67% of girls wish that the media did a better job of portraying women with diverse physical appearances. Shonda speaks to that desire by refusing to limit her stories to fit into society’s lazy and outdated stereotypes.In her latest venture, Real Beauty Productions, Shonda partnered with Dove to create short films committed to telling the stories of real women who are underrepresented in the beauty narrative. Their first short film, Meet Cathleen, centers on Cathleen Meredith, creator of Fat Girls Dance. The piece follows Cathleen’s journey of learning to love her body and her talent through choreographing and releasing one dance video per week for an entire year. It’s a powerful narrative from a woman who might not been featured otherwise. By seeking out real women whose real experiences have not yet been seen, Shonda and Dove are seeking to expand the definition of beauty so that everyone fits.You!Hollywood may be the driving force behind what stories are made visible but don’t forget that we, too, hold the power as storytellers. As consumers, we have the ability to utilize our own platforms to bring to light the stories that deserve to be told. Many of us now sit on social media platforms with more followers than major brands. Whether you speak to 20 people or 2 million, you can use your social channels as a way to honor the journey of being a woman in the world. And in real life, we can use mentorship as a way to share wisdom and experience with those around us. Most of us keep our stories hidden because we may not feel they deserve to be told. It is when we fill screens big and small with the real stories of women; messy, broken, brilliant, and brave, that we teach the world to tell different stories about women and we teach women to tell different stories about themselves.And most of all, we need to continue to vote with our voice and our dollar when media we consume actually challenges these tired tropes and replaces them with interesting and inclusive stories.

The President’s “Energy Week” underscored his conviction that the virtually unfettered production of coal, oil and natural gas will give us energy independence, global energy dominance, and the ability to export lots of fossil fuels to other countries. The week also made clear that Trump’s energy aspirations are outdated, unrealistic, out of synch with market forces, bad for America’s international standing and contrary to the wishes of the American people. If his energy agenda is implemented, the United States would not only be the biggest outlier in the international campaign to fight climate change; we would be a country with few constraints on its own carbon emissions and one of the world’s biggest profiteering merchants of carbon pollution. Trump’s energy priorities have plenty of domestic downsides, too. Like President Obama, he advocates an “all of the above” energy policy, but it’s clear that clean and renewable energy, the preferred resources in a carbon constrained world, will be confined to the rumble seat in Trump’s fossil fuel juggernaut. This is no surprise. During his campaign, Trump called renewables a “big mistake” and “just an expensive way of making the tree-huggers feel good about themselves”. Many Americans, public officials and business leaders do not agree. A new survey by Pew Research Center found that 83% of Americans say “increasing use of renewable energy resources is a top or important priority for the country’s energy policies.” A study issued two months ago by a coalition of organizations including Calvert Investments documented that 63% of America’s largest 100 companies have established renewable energy goals. “A growing number of companies are setting 100% renewable energy goals and science-based greenhouse gas reduction targets that align with the global goal of limiting temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius,” the study’s authors found. Many states and cities, red and blue, are betting on renewable energy, including the 29 states with formal renewable energy goals. All five of the states that are most bullish on wind power are traditional Republican strongholds. Texas was the national leader in wind power last year. In Iowa, wind and solar power together contributed 37% of the state’s electricity. Wind and solar provided at least 20% of energy in six other states. Another survey, released a couple of days ago by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, found that nearly 70% of the cities that responded already generate or purchase renewable electricity; 63% buy green vehicles for their fleets; and 66% have energy efficiency policies for their municipal buildings. At their annual conference this week, more than 250 mayors, Republicans and Democrats alike, adopted a resolution urging cities to obtain 100% of their energy from renewable resources by 2035. As a result of this rising market demand, wind and solar energy have just achieved a milestone: For the first time, they generated more than 10% of the nation’s electricity, still small but growing rapidly. Trump’s desire for energy independence is nothing new; it has been a reliable political slogan since the oil crises of the 1970s. But his strategy to achieve independence is futile. “If we are going to become energy independent,” Trump has written, “we need to keep drilling.” In fact, the opposite is true. So long as the United States depends on oil, even domestic oil, we will be vulnerable to manipulation by other countries. Energy analysts have pointed out repeatedly that oil prices and supplies are determined by the world petroleum market, not by individual nations. In the middle of our fracking boom last year, we were reminded about our vulnerability when OPEC decided to keep oil prices low. Oil wells shut down and there were widespread layoffs of U.S. oil workers. Even if we ended our oil addiction completely, significant oil shocks in other countries could have ripple effects in the United States — one reason we should export renewable energy technologies rather than oil and gas.Fossil energy advocates point to the nation’s large reserves of fossil fuels, but their estimates do not ensure long-term energy security. There is a difference between how much oil, coal and gas is underground and how much we can technically, safely and profitably extract. As the coal sector discovered, rising competition from alternative sources of energy also can keep the reserves underground. Today, solar and wind have entered the competition with coal, gas and oil. In short, the viable path to relative energy independence is an economy-wide transition to clean, inexhaustible and indigenous solar, wind, geothermal and hydroelectric energy, where “fuel” is readily available and free. What about new jobs? An accurate assessment of coal’s history offers an important lesson. Mechanization and the shift to surface mining in places like Appalachia, combined lately with competition from natural gas, have been responsible for the substantial decline in coal jobs since early last century. Now, oil workers trying to return to work reportedly are finding that new production efficiencies and extraction technologies have made some of their jobs obsolete. Meantime, solar and wind energy jobs have grown 20% annually, 12 times faster than jobs in the overall economy. Nearly 1 million Americans are working near- or full-time in the energy efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors, close to five times the current number of coal, gas, and oil workers in the electric industry, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The fastest growing job market between 2012 and 2016 was for men and women who assemble and install rooftop solar panels. In addition, solar and wind power are good for rural America, where many of Trump’s votes came from last November. Wind and solar installations stimulate rural economies with new property tax revenues, new income for farmers who lease land for wind turbines, and new jobs. In a letter he co-signed to Trump, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas noted “The nation’s wind and solar resources are transforming low-income rural areas in ways not seen since the passage of the Homestead Act over 150 years ago.” There is no question that national energy policy should encourage the creation of good jobs and give us greater security. The issue that poses the biggest longterm threat to our quality of life, energy security and the vitality of our economy, however, is climate change. Trump’s skepticism does not make that less true. In fact, climate change is advancing much more rapidly than predicted and we already are suffering its effects. More rapid and severe climate change is the ultimate consequence of Trump’s energy policy. So why is President Trump so far out of step with the American people, reality and the rest of the world? That will be the topic of my next post."

And 6 in 10 believe it is affecting U.S. weather. But only 1 in 3 say they’ve personally felt its effects. That disconnect stuck with Heidi Cullen. “You’re never going to think of it as an issue that’s urgent unless you recognize the fact that you’re already being impacted,” says Cullen, chief scientist for the nonprofit Climate Central. Now in its ninth year, Climate Central is part research hub and part journalism outfit — an unusual hybrid that tries to connect climate change to people’s lives. The organization’s latest project, World Weather ­Attribution, identifies direct links between extreme weather events and global warming. Cullen and her team created the program after realizing that while the tools for attributing such events have evolved, the results were coming out too late to influence the conversation. ­Cullen also worried that media covering extreme weather operated off outdated information: They would say you couldn’t tie any specific event to climate change. “Now the techniques exist,” Cullen says. So she set out to provide objective answers, swiftly. Researchers from Climate Central and other institutions around the world combine information from climate models, on-the-ground observations, and a range of peer-reviewed research to supply evidence for their reports. Recently, her team determined that global warming made 2017’s exceptionally warm February in the U.S. at least three times more likely.Connecting science to regular people’s lives is second nature to Cullen, but that wasn’t always the case. Back in 2002, when she was forecasting droughts at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, ­Colorado, a producer from the Weather Channel called. They ­wanted to hire a climate expert to appear on air. It was four years before An Inconvenient Truth, and many Americans were just opening their eyes to global warming. “It seemed like a really important moment,” Cullen says. She packed up and headed for Atlanta.Cullen arrived at the Weather Channel a complete communication novice, unsure of how to convey any scientific info ­succinctly, and clueless about makeup and other ­accoutrement of television personalities. She would submit scripts for short segments to the producers, “and they would shake their heads” at the overly complex, jargon-laden writing, she recalls. “I’d walk down the hallway, and they would start singing ‘She Blinded Me with Science.’” Eventually, though, Cullen became a pro, earning her own weekly show.In 2008, Princeton ecologist Stephen ­Pacala contacted her about joining Climate ­Central. Her first project was a program to enable ­meteorologists to connect the dots between local weather and global warming. For World Weather Attribution, Cullen is as likely to do the research that will be used in reports as write up results based on others’ investigations.For someone who’s been immersed in the scary realities of global warming for so long, Cullen is surprisingly optimistic. She credits two things. One, she’s found a proven method for staying upbeat: puppies, which she trains for the Seeing Eye, the nation’s oldest guide-dog training program. Her current charge is a Lab/golden cross named Earl. “It’s a counterpoint to climate change.” The other, she says, is that in her field, “you look with this long-term perspective.” That’s helping her ride out the current administration’s direct attacks on science. “Four years isn’t a long time.”This article originally appeared in the July-August 2017 issue of Popular Science."

Good thing Republicans have assured me there’s no such thing as global warming, or I would’ve been worried.The night before, I drove straight from the airport to Deb Shomsky’s house where the Indivisible Owls meet every Monday night. There they prepare for Resist Trump Tuesday, a regular demonstration now outside Heller’s office at 10 AM, before it gets too hot. OK, so maybe it was only about 100 when we started yesterday, not 106. What’s a little hyperbole in the age of Trump. That night, I spontaneously led the Indivisible Owls in a rewrite of our old Sha Na Na closing theme, the Spaniels’ classic that started with my bass part: “Doh doh doh doh doh Goodnight Trumpcare, well it’s time to go…” Great rehearsal!We reprised our number at the actual rally when Sheila Humphries, leader of one of the three Indivisible groups who joined us, fetched Sen. Heller’s Regional Director Jack Finn for his weekly confrontation to urge Sen. Heller to vote “No!” on Trumpcare. Jack seemed to enjoy the concert and even applauded at the end.But we weren’t just musical guests. We also deluged Jack with lots of info. That 122,500 Nevadans are likely to lose coverage if Trumpcare passes. That his constituents thank Senator Heller for his promise to vote “No,” but that he’s going to be held to keeping that promise. That we were wise to the almost $800 billion in cuts that would destroy Medicaid (and Nevada’s a Medicaid expansion state) representing a massive reverse Robin Hood shifting of wealth to cover $590 billion in tax cuts for the richest Americans.I even noted directly to Jack that I spent my career in the upper brackets, am still there today, and, no, I do not need a tax cut, thank you. Jack had a tough time coming up with a response for that one, so he offered none. He was cordial throughout and promised he’d reflect everyone’s comments back to Senator Heller. It really does seem as if the constant constituent barrage combined with the rational, constituents-above-party position of Nevada Governor Sandoval have moved Heller to a pretty firm “No” approaching his reelection year of 2018.Turns out that while we were demonstrating, Mitch McConnell postponed the vote till right after the July 4th recess. A small victory worthy of some celebratory soft drinks afterward to fight the scorching desert heat. But everyone knows this is when McConnell is most dangerous—the second you let down your guard. The protests will become more frequent, not less. Resist Trump Tuesdays will actually spread throughout this entire pivotal week. And I’ll leave Nevada in the capable hands of its passionate activists. I love them all.Goodnight, Trumpcare! Goodnight!"

We are living in anarchy.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5954281d1500002000bfb4e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Venezuelan authorities are still on the hunt for a man who launched a stunning aerial assault on the Caracas Supreme Court building Tuesday evening ― the latest major escalation in a crisis-torn nation that has suffered months of violent, spiraling political chaos.Gunshots were fired and grenades were dropped from a stolen helicopter ― believed to have been piloted by investigative police officer and movie actor Oscar Perez ― before it disappeared. No one was injured.Social media posts show the chopper circling the building while displaying an anti-government poster. A video posted online before the attack shows a man who purports to be Perez condemning Venezuela’s “criminal government” and describing his fight against “tyranny” on behalf of a coalition of military, law enforcement and civilian officials.“On this day, we are carrying out a deployment by air and land with the sole purpose to return the democratic power to the people and to ensure the laws to establish constitutional order,” the man in the video said.Socialist President Nicolás Maduro swiftly denounced the incident as a thwarted “terrorist attack” that was intended to topple his regime. The embattled leader, who frequently accuses the U.S. of leading a plot to oust him from power, also suggested the CIA aided Perez. Maduro responded to Tuesday’s events by deploying armed forces “to defend tranquillity.”But curious circumstances, like the pilot’s clean getaway, have stirred suspicion that the attack was a set-up by the Maduro regime orchestrated to justify its continued crackdown on dissent.Maduro, whose approval rating has hovered around 20 percent, was narrowly elected in 2013 after the death of President Hugo Chávez. He is fiercely devoted to continuing his predecessor’s legacy and policies, even amid a socioeconomic crisis that has brought extreme shortages of food and basic goods.The president’s critics accuse him of deep-seated corruption and blame him for Venezuela’s devastating recession and hyperinflation. They are demanding an election to replace him before his term ends in 2019.But Maduro has managed to cling to power, warning opponents in March, “You won’t get rid of me.” His government canceled a recall referendum that could have removed him from office last year.In January, the opposition-controlled National Assembly declared that Maduro had abandoned his post as president by failing to carry out his duties and by allowing the economic crisis to deteriorate. The Supreme Court, which has consistently backed Maduro, ruled that the parliament does not have the authority to declare abandonment.Tensions in Venezuela flared again in late March after the Supreme Court accused the National Assembly of contempt and announced it would assume legislative powers from the body. The court rescinded its decision days later, after the opposition denounced the move as a coup and clashes erupted across the country.Three consecutive months of explosive anti-government protests have resulted in scores of deaths, hundreds of injuries and thousands of arrests. Humanitarian organizations have decried the country’s use of military courts to prosecute civilians and have accused Venezuelan security forces of killing demonstrators. Even though the motives and culprits behind Tuesday’s attack remain unconfirmed, the incident will enable the government to intensify its oppressive clampdown on Venezuelans as they take to the streets to protest Maduro’s widely contested bid to rewrite the constitution.The president boldly suggested such reforms will “restore peace” in the divided country. But critics accuse him of using the move to distract from the unrest and secure his re-election. Voting to elect a constituent assembly, which will be poised to rewrite the constitution and override the authority of several other Venezuelan institutions, is set for July 30.Maduro’s controversial plans for the constituent assembly prompted the head of Venezuela’s National Defense Council, Alexis López Ramírez, to resign earlier this month due to his “disagreement with the way of proceeding to summon a national constituent assembly” without allowing Venezuelans the right to vote on the reforms in a referendum.The government is trying “to use this as a tool in order to produce more violence and more repression in Venezuela,” National Assembly President Julio Borges told CNN of the constitutional reform efforts on Wednesday.Tuesday’s helicopter assault on the Supreme Court and the government’s retaliatory response have only exacerbated the crisis, Borges warned.“Every day we have a real crisis in Venezuela. We are living in anarchy.”"

No other details about the person or their condition have been released.At the time of publication, no other cases of measles had been reported or were being investigated in the state. Bennett said in a statement that health officials were working to “identify potentially exposed individuals and make appropriate recommendations to prevent transmission.” People may have been exposed to the virus if they were at several locations in Franklin County in Maine between June 15 and June 19, and in the town of Lac-Mégantic in Quebec, Canada, on June 18, the Maine CDC said.Click the release below for more details.The state agency said people potentially exposed to the virus “should review their vaccine history and monitor for symptoms.” It added that vaccination is the best protection against measles. Two doses of the vaccine are about 97 percent effective at fending off the disease. This year, about 100 people from a dozen states, including California, Michigan and New York, have been diagnosed with measles in the U.S. Most of them were unvaccinated, according to the federal CDC. Measles patients of all ages are vulnerable to serious complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and even death. Symptoms typically appear about one to two weeks after exposure to the measles virus. They can include high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body."
61,POLITICS,Inside The NAACP’s Fight To Stop Betsy DeVos From Expanding Charter Schools,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/naacp-charter-schools_us_5952ea88e4b0da2c731f7cb7,The nation's oldest civil rights organization is gearing up for a bigger battle with education reformers.,2017-06-28,NAACP California State Conference President Alice Huffman attends the NAACP convention in 2011. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5952f0671700001f0010313f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump may call education the “civil rights issue of our time,” but just weeks before he was elected, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization strongly rejected the very type of schools he loves to champion. In October, the NAACP voted on a controversial resolution calling for a moratorium on the growth of charter schools, which exist in 43 states. Over six decades after the organization fought to eliminate school segregation through the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, leaders said charter schools were perpetuating the very same segregation they fought so hard to stop. Not only that, but charter schools also divert resources away from traditional public school systems.Charter school activists opposed the move. So did some of the very people the NAACP seeks to serve, like the hundreds of thousands of black families that choose charter schools for their children every year. The controversial stance threw the nation’s oldest civil rights organization into the spotlight during a time when they were fighting for relevancy. In the months since, a task force of a dozen NAACP leaders has traveled the country, listening to both charter school advocates and opponents, parents and teachers, about what steps the organization should take next.Next month the NAACP will release a report detailing what the task force found. HuffPost, through conversations with several task force leaders, received a glimpse into what these findings might look like.After spending time in seven cities, NAACP Task Force on Quality Education chair Alice Huffman says she is more convinced than ever that the call for a moratorium was the correct decision. The election of Trump, and his subsequent appointment of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, has given the issue specific urgency. DeVos, a notorious champion of school choice, would like to see more charter schools, and her department’s proposed budget has put funding behind them. “Nobody is convinced ... after going all across the country, that the moratorium was wrong,” said Alice Huffman, president of the California NAACP. “My mind wasn’t as made up as it is now.”Not all task force members were necessarily committed to the idea of a moratorium before setting out on their nationwide listening tour. What they heard in cities like Detroit and New Orleans convinced them to stick with it. Gloria Sweet-Love, a task force member, has a grandson currently attending a charter school, and she calls it “wonderful.” She highlights Tennessee’s charter school system as a national bright spot. But she emerged from the travel with a critical conviction: “Charters won’t fix what’s wrong with public education,” said Sweet-Love, the president of the Tennessee NAACP state conference.Sweet-Love is no stranger to the harms of educational inequity. As a child growing up in western Tennessee, she attended all-black schools, where “new” textbooks arrived only after the white students from a nearby school had used them for years and finally decided to get rid of them. In science class, they didn’t even have beakers to conduct experiments. Many decades after her high school graduation in 1965, schools in America are no longer legally segregated. But Sweet-Love still sees black children ― both in charters and outside them ― getting the short end of the educational stick. Charters, she says, often exacerbate many of these issues.“We have seen charters that work well, but we still contend what we said in the beginning. All of them should be accountable and transparent, they ought to be able to help all children, including children with disabilities and children with discipline problems,” said Sweet-Love.Charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run, were popularized during the 1990s. They were born out of the idea that operating outside the traditional public school system ― a system filled with powerful teachers unions and layers of thick bureaucratic red tape ― could allow them to act as labs of innovation that share ideas with the traditional system.In reality, said Huffman, that’s not what happened.“There’s no mechanism for feeding ideas back into public school. That experiment has failed and nobody even contends that it exists, so it’s a myth,” she said.But charter school leaders contend that restricting charter schools won’t fix what’s wrong with public education, and will only succeed in cutting off access to high-performing schools. These leaders, like Shavar Jeffries, also see themselves on the forefront of a civil rights issue. As a former civil rights attorney, Jeffries spent time working for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and now heads the group Democrats for Education Reform. Jeffries told HuffPost that he would like to see the NAACP pass a moratorium on all failing schools, regardless of the type.“At the end of the day, the most important thing for us is the quality of the services being delivered. And if any particular provider is providing high quality services to our young people, particularly our most vulnerable, we will push any advocates of children to support that,” said Jeffries.But NAACP leaders point to evidence showing that charter schools are more racially segregated than their traditional counterparts, and have higher suspension rates. NAACP critics say these schools cherry-pick the best students, leaving behind students with special needs, while draining resources from the traditional system. They complain charter schools are not subject to the same accountability or transparency measures as normal schools. And while most charter schools have nonprofit status, some are for-profit or virtual, designed to make money over providing enrichment.On the flip side, studies show that these schools provide small but meaningful academic benefits, especially for disadvantaged students. Proponents cite surveys showing that African-American parents are strongly supportive of charter schools. They say these schools give low-income parents the luxury of choice, a comfort often reserved for affluent families. Many of the problems perpetuated by charter schools ― like racial segregation ― are also major failures of the traditional public school system.Still, if you only listen to the words of the leaders from both camps, it can be difficult to distinguish between the goals of some groups that fight for charter schools and those that fight against them. Both employ civil rights rhetoric to further their aims. They both say they are singularly dedicated to lifting the prospects of low-income black and brown children who have suffered in white supremacist school systems.But they starkly diverge on the means to achieve this end.“Kids don’t have time to wait while adults argue,” said Ron Rice, senior director for government relations at the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. “If schools are working and they’re public, then we should be embracing them, and we should not be fighting about the details about the delivery system. It’s just that simple.”Huffman told HuffPost she hopes to make the release of the task force’s report one of the centerpieces of the NAACP annual convention in late July. Then, she hopes to inspire a national campaign of actions against charter schools.She says she plans on taking a page from the playbook of the Koch brothers, conservative billionaires who donate heavily to political causes. “We put some initiatives out across the country that everybody can work on,” said Huffman. “We’ll have people there for every state.”"

The new policies will replace the electronics ban instituted in March on flights from certain airports. Every single flight, on both domestic and foreign airlines, coming into the U.S. from more than 280 airports around the world will be subject to new passenger screening and security measures, both in planes and airports, DHS Secretary John Kelly said Wednesday during a news conference. Laptops and other devices larger than cell phones will be allowed back on those flights if airlines follow the new rules.DHS wouldn’t reveal the details of these measures for security reasons, but did hint that there would be more security dogs at airports.The new policies will be implemented in phases, DHS said, and will affect 180 airlines in 105 countries ― and about 2,000 flights and 325,000 passengers per day.Some of the measures have already been tested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Boston’s Logan International Airport will be the next test site, according to DHS.Once airlines have implemented these new requirements, the current ban on electronics will be removed. Yet if an airline fails to comply with the new rules, DHS will subject it to “additional security restrictions,” including an electronics ban in the cabin and cargo areas.Individual carriers are expected to communicate any changes in protocol to their passengers, DHS added.Commercial flights remain a major target for terrorists, DHS said. Terror groups have developed innovative methods for hiding explosives in electronic devices and for hijacking planes. The U.S. electronics ban that’s been in effect since March targeted 10 airports in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The ban applied to nine foreign airlines. Immediately following the U.S. announcement, the U.K. government imposed its own ban, which affected both foreign and domestic carriers.“There’s been repeated [al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] and Islamic State attempts to build explosives into electronic devices,” Clinton Watts, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told HuffPost in March. “The threats date to a foiled 2009 plot to fill a printer cartridge with explosives.”“Our enemies are adaptive and we have to be adaptive as well,” Kelly said Wednesday. “We are taking prudent steps to to make aircraft more secure, to reduce insider threats and to identify suspicious passengers.”This story has been updated with comment from John Kelly."

Leyva, who will also play science professor Mrs. Warren in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” said she felt “fortunate” to have been given opportunities to show that Latina actresses can be more than eye candy on-screen.“Latinas are still, unfortunately—or fortunately for some— just looked at as sex objects, as people that maybe are just there to show their curves, to make people laugh by their mispronunciations of names or words,” Leyva said in the interview published Tuesday. “We’re actors; we’re trained. I love the fact that I can play Gloria Mendoza, a prisoner and now be in ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’ as a teacher.”The 45-year-old actress has spoken about Latino representation in Hollywood for years. During a 2013 interview with HuffPost, the actress explained why a series like “OITNB” was so important for Latinas. “In Hollywood, we always have to deal with the one Latina representing us,” Leyva said. “And they usually latch on to one Latina per year or one network says ‘we believe in diversity’ and they have one Latina or one Latino in one out of ten shows.”″[With ‘OITNB’] I think there is celebration in the Latino community,” she added. “I don’t think we’ve ever had five, six Latinas in a show this huge worldwide. We haven’t. And I think that the writers aren’t focusing on any stereotypes, they’re telling stories, real stories that can happen to anyone regardless of race.”"

Chlorpyrifos, sold under the trade name Lorsban and used on a variety of crops since the 1960s, has been linked to learning disabilities in children.“EPA has no new evidence indicating that chlorpyrifos exposures are safe,” the groups say in the joint letter. “As a result, EPA has no basis to allow continued use of chlorpyrifos, and its insistence in doing so puts all children at risk.”The EPA proposed in November 2015, during the Obama administration, permanently banning the chemical on food crops, citing potential risks to human health. The move was based on a 2007 petition filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network North America.Pruitt said the proposed ban relied largely on studies “whose application is novel and uncertain.” He claimed his rejection of the petition was about “returning to using sound science in decision-making — rather than predetermined results.”Chlorpyrifos is used in nearly 100 countries on more than 50 kinds of crops, including corn, soybeans, cranberries and broccoli. It was largely banned as a pesticide for at-home use in the U.S. in 2000, but continues to be widely used on American farms. CORRECTION: An earlier version misstated the state Sen.

That will not happen, and now some Republican senators say they are willing to start working with Democrats in search of a bipartisan fix to the existing Affordable Care Act. Such a move would likely find widespread support among the public but stoke anger among the GOP’s conservative voting base.Trump initially ignored such matters in his morning tweets.“The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don’t even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!” he wrote at 6:49 a.m.A little over an hour later, he tweeted: “The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!”Trump did address health care in a 6:58 a.m. tweet, but only in the context of claiming he has expertise in the subject and further attacking the news media: “Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong, I know the subject well & want victory for U.S.”That assertion has plenty of skeptics among health care experts as well as GOP House and Senate members, who have complained privately that Trump knows very little about the subject and doesn’t care much about what passes so long as he can declare victory when he signs it.Trump had the opportunity to display his knowledge of the issue during a pair of photo opportunities at the White House Wednesday. Asked about the Medicaid service cuts the Senate bill would bring, Trump answered: “It’s going to be great. This will be great for everybody.”A few hours later, when he was asked for details about his claim that health care was “working along very well,” Trump answered: “We’re going to have a great, great surprise.”Trump’s Wednesday’s tweets were only the latest among dozens he has sent in recent days. Most have been attacks on the news media or the FBI investigation that includes looking into possible collusion between his campaign and Russian officials who worked to help him win last year’s election.A new poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans believe Trump’s tweets are an unhelpful distraction, but the White House has steadfastly defended them. Press secretary Sean Spicer earlier this month confirmed that they are “official statements by the president of the United States.” Administration lawyers, in a formal response to the House intelligence committee, quoted his tweets verbatim.Deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday said she wasn’t aware of the new poll results, but that Trump’s tweets are a great boon to him.“The president speaking directly to the American people is always a good thing,” she said.As to what Trump meant by “internet taxes” ― Amazon collects sales taxes from customers in most states on their orders ― Sanders said she wasn’t sure.“I haven’t had a chance to talk to him about it,” she said ― the eerily similar response other officials have given when asked if they know his position on climate change."

Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday launched a petition to help stop the deportation of an undocumented immigrant who helped clear hazardous materials at ground zero following the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Shortly after the petition was filed, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced they released Carlos Humberto Cardona from custody on Wednesday afternoon.“Cardona will be required to check-in periodically pending the outcome of his immigration case,” ICE public affairs officer Rachael Yong Yow told HuffPost in a statement.Cardona, 48, fled violence in Colombia and moved to New York City over 30 years ago. He maintained regular contact with U.S. immigration officials during the past several years but was detained in the early days of President Donald Trump’s presidency over a 27-year-old drug conviction.Cardona suffers from respiratory and gastrointestinal problems because he inhaled poisonous fumes at ground zero. He has developed other health problems since being detained, including depression.“Instead of expressing our gratitude as a nation that Mr. Cardona helped clean and contain the World Trade Center site, our government is doing everything it can to deport a man who is facing serious health problems because of the work he did on our behalf. This is shameful,” Crowley wrote in the petition addressed to President Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly and acting director for ICE Thomas Homan.Crowley called Cardona’s release a “positive step,” urging the Homeland Security department to allow Cardona to establish a permanent legal residence in the U.S.“It’s the least we can do for a man who helped New York after the 9/11 terrorist attacks,” he said.Cardona’s wife, Liliana, said her husband didn’t worry about his immigration status when he volunteered to help in the recovery effort after Sept. 11.“When he was working in 9/11, they didn’t ask for his papers,” she told The New York Daily News. “They asked him to help.”Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) granted Cardona clemency. The governor argued that Cardona’s health problems would not be adequately addressed if he was deported to Colombia.The agency has aggressively stepped up its immigration enforcement following Trump’s inauguration, detaining and deporting people with felony and misdemeanor convictions. ICE agents have also sought to arrest undocumented immigrants at courthouses, schools, and hospitals.Crowley said the issue was larger than just that of Cardona’s case.“Deporting Mr. Cardona would send a message to the immigrants who call our country home that even if they serve our country during its darkest days, we will not welcome them in our communities,” the congressman said."

Lewis hadn’t always eyed a career in Detroit — she planned on working in New York City after graduating with a degree in advertising from Michigan State University in 2015.“The press I read about Detroit wasn’t reflective of what I saw in my hometown,” Lewis said, thinking about her decision to reject an opportunity to study fashion marketing at LIM College in Manhattan. “My intuition told me to stay in Detroit and be an agent to change the narrative. My intuition was right.”Lewis was hired by Duggan’s chief of staff, Alexis Wiley, in 2016 after she participated in the Marcus Graham Project, an organization that helps people of color enter the marketing and advertising industries. Since then, Lewis said she has brought much-needed awareness to the administration’s efforts to help invigorate the city and its residents.“The biggest part about these opportunities is creating awareness around them, and that’s why my role is so important,” Lewis told HuffPost. “It’s getting information about programs and initiatives out to the public by telling the story of Detroiters who have benefitted from them, opposed to just saying that these programs are available.”Programs like Motor City Match, which provides funding to entrepreneurs for businesses throughout the city, or Motor City Restore, which assists local business owners who need to make improvements, are some that have benefited from Lewis’ social media campaigns.  “There are so many programs and initiatives designed to improve the quality of life for Detroit residents happening in the neighborhoods that really make what I do meaningful,” Lewis said.But the young Detroiter can have fun with the social media channels, too. Engaging social media campaigns like #DetroitLoveLetter and #DetroitCommandments have caught the attention of residents and local businesses active on Twitter and Facebook.“I’m proud to make the city’s social channels more fun and engaging through our campaigns and content,” Lewis said.In 2013, the Motor City filed the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in the nation’s history. The city is still recovering from that setback, but Lewis is hopeful. “I think Detroit is an interesting but good and exciting space.

My intuition was right.”Lewis was hired by Duggan’s chief of staff, Alexis Wiley, in 2016 after she participated in the Marcus Graham Project, an organization that helps people of color enter the marketing and advertising industries. Since then, Lewis said she has brought much-needed awareness to the administration’s efforts to help invigorate the city and its residents.“The biggest part about these opportunities is creating awareness around them, and that’s why my role is so important,” Lewis told HuffPost. “It’s getting information about programs and initiatives out to the public by telling the story of Detroiters who have benefitted from them, opposed to just saying that these programs are available.”Programs like Motor City Match, which provides funding to entrepreneurs for businesses throughout the city, or Motor City Restore, which assists local business owners who need to make improvements, are some that have benefited from Lewis’ social media campaigns.  “There are so many programs and initiatives designed to improve the quality of life for Detroit residents happening in the neighborhoods that really make what I do meaningful,” Lewis said.But the young Detroiter can have fun with the social media channels, too. Engaging social media campaigns like #DetroitLoveLetter and #DetroitCommandments have caught the attention of residents and local businesses active on Twitter and Facebook.“I’m proud to make the city’s social channels more fun and engaging through our campaigns and content,” Lewis said.In 2013, the Motor City filed the largest-ever municipal bankruptcy in the nation’s history. The city is still recovering from that setback, but Lewis is hopeful. “I think Detroit is an interesting but good and exciting space. We are building, expanding and creating new opportunities that all Detroiters can benefit from,” she said. "
69,POLITICS,The Inside Story Of How Bernie Sanders Became The Greatest Online Fundraiser In Political History,Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-fundraising_us_59527587e4b02734df2d92c1,The operatives who turned a septuagenarian independent socialist into a money-raising juggernaut explain for the first time how they did it.,2017-06-28,Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign raised $218 million a little at a time.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/595276bc1700002000102fa8.jpeg?cache=KJ1otS2e6H&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) became famous during his 2016 presidential run for his rumpled suits, the bird that took perch on his lectern at a campaign stop in Oregon, his calls for free college and universal health care ― and, of course, $27. At every stop, important debate moments, and primary night speeches, the Democratic candidate never let audiences forget that the average contribution to his campaign was $27. He ran ads about it. There was a tab on his website for supporters to donate $27. He became as consistent as any TV pitchman. And for good reason: The strategy worked. Those small donations provided a fundamentally new template for how presidential campaigns can raise money.Sanders owes his historic success to a team of strategists who were invited to join the campaign just three days before his candidacy was officially announced.The strategists ― Tim Tagaris, Robin Curran and Michael Whitney, employees of the firm Revolution Messaging ― thought Sanders’ message could resonate. But they never imagined the fundraising successes it would produce. In their initial meeting with Sanders, Tagaris suggested the senator might be able to raise $30 million to $50 million from online donations. Whitney put the range at $15 million to $20 million.On the day Sanders announced his bid, the campaign took in more than $1 million. By the end of the campaign, the team had raised $218 million online.On this episode of the “Candidate Confessional” podcast, Tagaris, Curran and Whitney reveal in detail for the first time just how they did it and what it was like to be part of a historic fundraising juggernaut. There was no secret sauce, they insist. Just an opportunistic mindset ― like turning Sanders’ “damn emails” debate line into a $1.2 million fundraising campaign ― a preternatural commitment to message discipline and a keen understanding of their base. “Bernie was the only candidate who could have done that in 2016 and also provides a template for other candidates in 2020 and beyond,” Whitney says. They also explain just how easy it is for seasoned operatives such as themselves to be drawn emotionally into the campaign on which they are working. Bernie, for them, wasn’t so much a candidate as an opportunity to fundamentally change politics for the better. When he came up short, the sense of loss was particularly profound. “When you are working toward something that is just inspiring so many people across the country and for a candidate you believe in and defying any and all expectations for your result, it is impossible not to get entirely wrapped up in what you’re doing,” Tagaris says.

70,RELIGION,Missing In Action -- Where Was The U.S. Women's Movement On Justice For Nabra Hassanen?,"Hibaaq Osman, ContributorFounder and CEO of Karama",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/missing-in-action-where-was-the-us-womens-movement_us_59537c79e4b0c85b96c65dea,"If an organization has concerned itself with the rights of women in majority Muslim countries but ignored the rights, dignity and safety of Muslim women in their own backyard, we have to ask why that is.",2017-06-28,"<p>Members of the Arab Regional Network on Women, Peace and Security show their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter protestors.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59537ca717000027001031ec.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some time ago I attended a meeting of women’s rights activists from across the Arab region. We were in Cairo to discuss the great threats that women faced at the time ― the murder of human rights activists in Libya, the escalating war in Syria, the growing threat of a full-scale civil war in Yemen, as well as the violence and discrimination that women face in everyday life.During lunch, our discussion turned to the growing protests against police violence in the U.S. As women who had grown up under dictators, who had been mistreated, victimized by the authorities, who faced daily suspicion and discrimination, we could recognize ourselves in the protesters. As activists, we wanted to show our solidarity with those demanding justice for the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York, and countless other victims of police violence in the U.S. We made our own placards declaring #ICantBreathe and #BlackLivesMatter, and posed for photos to share on social media.I was reminded of that moment last week after the brutal murder of Nabra Hassanen, killed as she walked home from her Mosque in Virginia. Here was another face we recognised. A young, Egyptian-American woman whose life was ended by an appalling act of male violence. Having worked with many activists in the women’s movement in the U.S., I had hoped to see them express their solidarity with Nabra, but I waited in vain.My work has always involved reaching across communities, across borders. It has been about building movements whose strength comes from diversity and credibility. Working with women’s movements in Europe, in the U.S., everywhere we could find allies, has always been part of our method. Through this approach groups in the Arab region have collaborated on important work with American partners aimed at ending violence against women. These partnerships have always been appreciated.But just as we value the efforts made by the women’s movement in the U.S. to eliminate violence against women in the Arab region by, for example, tackling FGM, we also notice their silence when a Muslim woman is murdered on their own doorstep.I have been proud to serve as an advisor to women’s groups across the world, and to recommend women experts from my region when American activists have sought to understand the problems that we face, and build responses based on local experience. Representation is central to dealing with the particular issues facing communities. Giving women a platform to discuss their problems is far more effective than thinking you can speak on their behalf.If an organization has concerned itself with the rights of women in majority Muslim countries but ignored the rights, dignity and safety of Muslim women in their own backyard, we have to ask why that is. It would be harder, if not impossible, for these crimes to go unremarked if women from minority and marginalised communities were sufficiently represented within the ranks of these organisations.The women’s movement in the U.S. has recently seen a huge boost in energy and activism. Millions took to the streets across the country as part of the Women’s March. There is a moment to be grasped here, to recognize the assault on the rights and freedoms of women in the U.S. In order to seize the opportunity, the movement needs to reflect the experience of all women. Much has been said about the panel of white men in the Senate conspiring behind closed doors to take healthcare away from millions of Americans, but far fewer people have recognized and reported that the reinstated ban on refugees will disproportionately affect women.The Women’s March, Black Lives Matter and the unrelenting racism and misogyny of the Trump administration have hugely energised women of colour. The established women’s movement needs to recognise this. If the old guard does not welcome these activists into the fold and start addressing the intersectional relationship between all forms of discrimination, they risk becoming irrelevant to millions of women.Women’s groups in the U.S. have been great allies for the women’s movement in the Arab region, but that support for ending violence against Muslim women cannot stop at the border. Where were your calls for justice for Nabra Hassanen?"
