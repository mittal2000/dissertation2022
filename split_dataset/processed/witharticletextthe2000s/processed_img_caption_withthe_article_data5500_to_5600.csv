A lot of daughters are born during this process, too. The report estimates that these “unwanted” girls number more than 21 million. As they grow up, they often receive poorer nourishment and less schooling than their brothers.Despite those “unwanted” girls, India’s male-to-female sex ratio at birth still tilts significantly in favor of males. And it hasn’t improved even as incomes rise. The skewed ratio crosses socioeconomic classes. Even families in wealthier Indian states show a preference for having sons. “The challenge of gender is long-standing, probably going back millennia, so all stakeholders are collectively responsible for its resolution,” the report’s authors write. “India must confront the societal preference ... which appears inoculated to development.” For India as a whole, the sex ratio at birth is about 1,108 males per 1,000 females, the report states. In two higher-income states, Punjab and Haryana, the sex ratio for those between infancy and 6 years of age is even worse: 1,200 males per 1,000 females. The natural sex ratio at birth is about 1.05 males for every female, according to the report.How has the male-to-female ratio been skewed in India? Tests to determine the sex of a fetus are illegal in India, but families still test and then procure sex-selective abortions. The authors estimate these abortions, in conjunction with the country’s higher mortality rates for female children, have led to a gender gap of about 63 million women, whom they classify as “missing.”And yet the researchers also found that India had improved on several indicators of gender equality, including women’s education and women’s power to make decisions in their households. “In some sense, once born, the lives of women are improving but society still appears to want fewer of them to be born,” the authors write.The report suggests several possible reasons for India’s preference for sons. Male offspring perform important religious rituals for their parents. Property is often passed down within the male line, while women are traditionally expected to move in with their husbands’ families, taking their labor with them.Sending a young woman to her new husband with a dowry has been illegal in India for decades, but many families still practice this custom. This means the birth of girls represents an extra financial burden for their parents.The authors of the report urge Indian society as a whole to reflect on this cultural preference for sons ― especially with the growing evidence that when women acquire greater personal agency and participate equally in the labor force, it can boost the economy of an entire country.“The intrinsic values of gender equality are uncontestable,” the authors write."

3,POLITICS,House Republicans Vote To Release Classified Memo They Wrote Attacking Russia Probe,"Ryan J. Reilly, Jessica Schulberg, and Nick Baumann",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/release-memo-trump-mueller_us_5a6fa783e4b0a52682fecdc7,The memo's release is part of a sustained GOP attack on investigations into Trump and Russia.,2018-01-29,"President Donald Trump, left, and special counsel Robert Mueller, right.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6fa8fa2d00004900943202.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s Republican allies in Congress advanced their monthslong assault on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on Monday, voting along partisan lines to release a classified memo slamming officials from the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation who have investigated the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia. The episode has more than a touch of Washington theater to it: Republican staffers wrote the memo, and Republican members of Congress, who always had the power to vote to release it, spent weeks calling on themselves to do so. But it was still an extraordinary event. In a letter last week, a top Justice Department official said releasing the classified memo would be an “unprecedented action” that would be “extraordinarily reckless” and could “risk harm to national security and to ongoing investigations.”The department did not “understand why the Committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the Intelligence Community,” the letter read.It is extremely unusual for lawmakers — especially Republican lawmakers — to clash so publicly with law enforcement on issues of national security and classification. Trump has five days to block the memo’s release, but has indicated he will side with congressional Republicans on the matter, over the objections of the Justice Department.Republicans argued that releasing their own memo is a matter of transparency. Making the GOP memo public will allow journalists and the public to at least partially assess the claims it makes. But fully judging its merits will also be difficult without access to the underlying intelligence information, which is also classified and will not be released.At the same time, Republicans voted down a Democratic effort to release a memo authored by Democratic staffers that they say combated some of the inaccuracies in the GOP memo. While members of Congress will be allowed to read the Democratic memo, the public will not.“The ‘release the memo’ crowd, apparently, doesn’t want to release the memo,” Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the vote. “We have crossed a deeply regrettable line in this committee, where for the first time in the 10 years or so that I’ve been on the committee, there was a vote to politicize the declassification process of intelligence, and potentially compromise sources and methods,” Schiff added.There’s indeed more at stake than D.C. grandstanding: The release of the document is part of a pattern of behavior by the president and his congressional allies — all of it apparently aimed at undermining Mueller’s probe and shielding Trump from scrutiny. Since Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey — then the official responsible for the Russia investigation — last summer, the president, Republican members of Congress and the right-wing media have battled to undermine public perceptions of the bureau and of the Justice Department:Andrew McCabe, Comey’s former deputy, stepped down Monday after weeks of pressure from Trump and Republicans. Republicans have charged that McCabe was biased against the president because his wife ran for a Virginia state Senate seat as a Democrat, but FBI documents released earlier this month indicate he followed bureau recusal rules. The day after Trump fired Comey, the president called McCabe to complain about Comey being allowed to take a government-funded plane back to Washington, NBC reported Monday. When McCabe said he wasn’t asked to authorize the flight but would have approved it, Trump told McCabe to ask his wife — who lost her race for state Senate — how it feels to be a loser, and hung up the phone, according to NBC.The president, Republicans in Congress, and the right-wing media have spun tales of a dark conspiracy involving Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, two FBI officials who were having an affair and exchanged text messages critical of Trump and other politicians from both parties. The evidence suggests Page and Strzok were actually driven more by loyalty to the FBI than partisan political considerations.The memo the House voted to release Monday reportedly focuses on criticizing Rod Rosenstein, a Republican Trump appointee at the Justice Department who now has responsibility over the Mueller probe. The memo, The New York Times reported, accuses Rosenstein of approving an application to surveil a former Trump campaign official last spring. Trump has long resented Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel after Trump fired Comey. Trump reportedly considered firing Rosenstein last summer, but instead ordered Mueller’s firing — only to back away the decision after his lawyer threatened to quit. The sustained assault on the FBI seems to have affected perceptions of the bureau among Republicans and independents. Just over half of the public has at least a fair amount of trust in the FBI, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, down 12 points since 2015. The percentage of Republicans and independents saying they trust the agency dropped by 22 points and 15 points, respectively.The GOP memo lays the groundwork for that distrust. It was the work of the office of Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman and close Trump ally who recused himself from the committee’s investigation into ties between Trump and Russia after he was caught last year promoting a different surveillance scandal with intelligence cooked up by Trump White House officials.The memo reportedly suggests that FBI agents obscured their reliance on a controversial dossier about Trump’s ties to Russia when they sought a warrant to spy on Carter Page, a Trump campaign adviser. Republicans have long sought to discredit the dossier, which was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. Committee members voted along partisan lines earlier this month to allow any member of Congress to read Nunes’ classified memo. Some of the Republicans who read the memo described the allegations as “sickening” and “worse than Watergate.” Democrats who read it said it was a partisan hack job. “Rife with factual inaccuracies,” said Schiff. “This may help carry White House water, but it is a deep disservice to our law enforcement professionals.”Ariel Edwards-Levy contributed to this article."
4,BLACK VOICES,Diddy Looks Back on Hip-Hop's Rise In Tweet Celebrating The Genre,Princess-India Alexander,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diddy-looks-back-on-hip-hops-rise-grammys_us_5a6e63a0e4b01fbbefb2dccd,“It was so raw and infectious that it broke out of just being a trend and became the culture.”,2018-01-29,"Jay-Z and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs attend a Roc Nation brunch on Saturday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6e7c692d00004900942fe9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The diversity of Grammy nominees this year has Sean “Diddy” Combs reminiscing about how far hip-hop has come. In a tweet Sunday night, the rapper and entertainment mogul hailed the award show for having its most diverse list of nominees yet, with hip-hop well-represented.“Hip Hop was seen as a non priority in the 90s, it was seen as a genre of music that wouldn’t last,” Diddy tweeted. “It was so raw and infectious that it broke out of just being a trend and became the culture.”For the first time since 1999, Album of the Year nominees did not include a white man. Four of the five nominees were people of color. It’s a stark change considering a white act has won the category for the past nine years. The diversity in nominees may be due in part to changes to the voting process implemented by the Recording Academy this year. As Diddy pointed out, this led to more recognition for hip-hop, a genre that was largely ignored when it was first created.The Grammys have a contentious relationship with hip-hop. Although Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z led the pack in nominations this year, with seven and eight, respectively, neither has won Album of the Year. Most notably, Lamar was snubbed in 2016 when Taylor Swift’s “1989” won over “To Pimp a Butterfly.” On Sunday, Lamar took home a number of awards including the category Rap Album, but Album of the Year remained elusive for both hip-hop artists. Instead it went to R&B artist Bruno Mars."

Nassar was recently sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.“It is abundantly clear that a full and complete investigation of what happened at Michigan State University — from the president’s office down — is required,” Schuette said during a Saturday news conference. “My department ... will find out who knew what and when, who took action, who failed to take action, what did or did not happen, and what should have happened.”Schuette said the investigation began last year, but the attorney general’s office waited to announce the news until every survivor read her victim impact statement in court during sentencing. Over 160 survivors and family members read victim impact statements in court this month after a weeklong sentencing hearing for Nassar. The investigation will be led by Bill Forsyth, a veteran prosecutor from Kent County, Michigan, with 42 years of experience who was named as the special independent counsel. Michigan State Police director Col. Kriste Etue, her team and a team of prosecutors from the attorney general’s office will assist in the investigation. “I’ve been doing this for a long time and I have never seen anything like this,” Forsyth told CNN. Schuette said this investigation is “priority one” for him and his office. “No individual and no department at Michigan State University is off-limits,” he added. “Too many voices of too many victims had been unheard for too long.”Schuette said he has asked Patrick Fitzgerald, MSU’s independent investigator turned legal counsel, to turn over any and all information the attorney has gathered while working on the Nassar case “to ensure our investigation leaves no stone unturned.” (Scroll down to see a copy of the letter from Schuette and Forsyth to MSU’s board of trustees obtained by HuffPost.) Once the investigation is concluded, Schuette said, the report will be available to the public. In a statement following Schuette’s announcement, MSU’s board of trustees said it supports the investigation. “We are committed to taking the right actions to create a culture that provides a safe environment for all members of our community, and the transition to new leadership will be a key component in helping us change course. The Board will play an integral role in these efforts and in making MSU a leader locally and nationally in preventing sexual abuse,” the statement reads. “We cannot change the past, but we can and will devote our time and resources to foster healing and move forward together.”Nassar, who is serving an additional 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three other counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, will be in prison for the rest of his life. Many of his survivors, however, are asking for the institutions that enabled him for so long to be held accountable. Multiple Nassar victims say they reported his behavior to MSU coaches and other officials, but their complaints were repeatedly brushed under the rug. Others question whether USA Gymnastics knew of Nassar’s rampant abuse. At least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar’s abuse and failed to report it.“I knew that he abused me. I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,” survivor Amanda Thomashow said during her victim impact statement. Fellow survivor Olivia Cowan added a similar sentiment in her impact statement: “MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full.”In the wake of the Nassar sentencing, heads have begun to roll with the resignation of MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA opened an investigation into MSU and a congressional committee is scrutinizing major sports organizations, including USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, about their policies against sexual abuse. “We will put a bight light in every corner of the university,” Schuette said. “This will be done right.

Wynn, who resigned Saturday as the Republican National Committee’s finance chair, was accused of sexual harassment and misconduct spanning several decades in a bombshell Wall Street Journal report published Friday. Wynn vehemently denies the allegations.Since the claims were made public, Democrats have called for the RNC and members of the GOP to give back money donated and raised by the Las Vegas casino owner. Republicans reacted similarly when film producer and major Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein was accused last year of rape, sexual misconduct and harassment.Ryan’s office confirmed that the speaker received a $1,000 donation in 2016 from Wynn Resorts Limited Initiative for Public Policy. Ryan will give the funds to a local charity, according to The Hill.Earlier over the weekend, Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.), who won a special election in June, said she’d donated the $2,700 in campaign funds she received from Wynn. According to Time, a spokesperson for Handel said the funds went to a nonprofit organization focused on helping survivors of domestic violence and sexual abuse.The RNC has not commented on whether the organization will return the funds donated by Wynn, but Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that the group should do so if the accusations “have merit.”“If it’s ― you know, the allegations have merit, then we should return the money like we asked of the Democrats,” Graham said on ABC’s “This Week.”“I don’t think we should have a double standard for ourselves,” he added."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6e9ee51d000026006ad093.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Logic sent a powerful message of solidarity to women at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. Alessia Cara and Khalid appeared on stage with the rapper to perform “1-800-273-8255,” which gets its name from the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The single was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Music Video. At the end of the performance, Logic spoke to the audience and touched upon the themes of the “Time’s Up” anti-harassment initiative.“Black is beautiful, hate is ugly,” he said. “Women are as precious as they are stronger than any man I have ever met. And unto them, I say stand tall and crush all predators under the weight of your heart that is full of the love they will never take away from you. Be not scared to use your voice, especially in instances like these when you have the opportunity.”The performance of “1-800-273-8255” came after the Grammy’s in memoriam segment ended with a photo of Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington, who died by suicide in July. People who had either lost loves ones to suicide or had attempted suicide themselves joined the three artists on stage, and wore shirts featuring the phrase “You are not alone” and the phone number of the suicide prevention lifeline.Logic, who was born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, told music site Genius in April that conversations with fans had inspired him to write a song about suicide prevention.“[Fans had] said things like, ‘Yo, your music has saved my life. You’ve saved my life,’” the artist said. “And I was always like, ‘Aw, so nice of you. Thanks.’ And I’d give them a hug and shit but in my mind, I’m like, ‘What the fuck?’ And they’re really serious. ... I was like, ‘Man, I wasn’t even trying to save nobody’s life.’”“And then it hit me, the power that I have as an artist with a voice,” he added. “I wasn’t even trying to save your life. Now what can happen if I actually did?”The rapper also said the song’s first hook and verse is sung from the perspective of someone calling the suicide prevention hotline.It appears the lyrics have motivated some people seek help.The day the song was released in April, the lifeline received what was then its second-highest number of calls ― over 4,573. The day after Logic performed the song at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, the lifeline received 5,041 calls. That performance also featured people wearing T-shirts with the hotline number on them. The song’s Grammy-nominated music video, which tells the story of a black teen coming to terms with his sexuality while being rejected by his family and peers, also made a significant impact. Calls to the lifeline went up between 30 percent and 50 percent after the video went viral in August, according to the suicide prevention line’s director, John Draper.“That’s thousands of callers who otherwise wouldn’t have called,” Draper told the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. “Messages like Logic’s, where he says, ‘I’m thinking about suicide, but I want to get help’ ... are a very positive model.”In November, Logic tweeted statistics from the lifeline on the song’s impact. Logic performed “1-800-273-8255” at the Latin Grammys in November with Cara and Colombian singer Juanes. The three artists sang a bilingual rendition of the single and promoted the lifeline’s Spanish-language hotline: 1-888-628-9454.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Alessia Cara and Khalid appeared on stage with the rapper to perform “1-800-273-8255,” which gets its name from the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The single was nominated for Song of the Year and Best Music Video. At the end of the performance, Logic spoke to the audience and touched upon the themes of the “Time’s Up” anti-harassment initiative.“Black is beautiful, hate is ugly,” he said. “Women are as precious as they are stronger than any man I have ever met. And unto them, I say stand tall and crush all predators under the weight of your heart that is full of the love they will never take away from you. Be not scared to use your voice, especially in instances like these when you have the opportunity.”The performance of “1-800-273-8255” came after the Grammy’s in memoriam segment ended with a photo of Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington, who died by suicide in July. People who had either lost loves ones to suicide or had attempted suicide themselves joined the three artists on stage, and wore shirts featuring the phrase “You are not alone” and the phone number of the suicide prevention lifeline.Logic, who was born Sir Robert Bryson Hall II, told music site Genius in April that conversations with fans had inspired him to write a song about suicide prevention.“[Fans had] said things like, ‘Yo, your music has saved my life. You’ve saved my life,’” the artist said. “And I was always like, ‘Aw, so nice of you. Thanks.’ And I’d give them a hug and shit but in my mind, I’m like, ‘What the fuck?’ And they’re really serious. ... I was like, ‘Man, I wasn’t even trying to save nobody’s life.’”“And then it hit me, the power that I have as an artist with a voice,” he added. “I wasn’t even trying to save your life. Now what can happen if I actually did?”The rapper also said the song’s first hook and verse is sung from the perspective of someone calling the suicide prevention hotline.It appears the lyrics have motivated some people seek help.The day the song was released in April, the lifeline received what was then its second-highest number of calls ― over 4,573. The day after Logic performed the song at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, the lifeline received 5,041 calls. That performance also featured people wearing T-shirts with the hotline number on them. The song’s Grammy-nominated music video, which tells the story of a black teen coming to terms with his sexuality while being rejected by his family and peers, also made a significant impact. Calls to the lifeline went up between 30 percent and 50 percent after the video went viral in August, according to the suicide prevention line’s director, John Draper.“That’s thousands of callers who otherwise wouldn’t have called,” Draper told the Los Angeles Times earlier this month. “Messages like Logic’s, where he says, ‘I’m thinking about suicide, but I want to get help’ ... are a very positive model.”In November, Logic tweeted statistics from the lifeline on the song’s impact. Logic performed “1-800-273-8255” at the Latin Grammys in November with Cara and Colombian singer Juanes. The three artists sang a bilingual rendition of the single and promoted the lifeline’s Spanish-language hotline: 1-888-628-9454.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

10,POLITICS,Lawmakers To Bring Sexual Assault Survivors And Activists To State Of The Union,Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-survivors-state-of-the-union_us_5a6f3d95e4b01fbbefb43a59,"“Because one more victim is too much,"" said one advocate accompanying a congresswoman to the event.",2018-01-29,President Donald Trump's first State of the Union will air Tuesday at 9 p.m. Eastern time.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6f803b1d000026006ad25c.jpeg?cache=g3qjy8KnPz&ops=crop_10_120_5247_3144%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"At least eight members of Congress plan to bring sexual assault survivors or activists to the State of the Union address Tuesday night. Many of these lawmakers said the Me Too movement, which has shed light on sexual harassment and other gender-based misconduct across various industries, had inspired them to invite their guests. “I have never seen such an extraordinary opportunity to change the culture of society in my lifetime,” Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) told HuffPost. “I will use every opportunity to underscore how important it is for us to stay on this issue and clean up the mess that has been impacting women in the workforce for decades.” Others said they hoped to remind viewers that at least 21 women have accused President Donald Trump of sexual harassment or assault. In addition to Speier, Reps. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Susan Davis (D-Calif.) and Annie Kuster (D-N.H.) have invited activists or survivors to join them at the State of the Union. Several female Democratic lawmakers also plan to wear black Tuesday night to show support for movements protesting sexual harassment and assault. Speier said she’s bringing Travis Moore, who advocates to Congress on behalf of survivors of sexual harassment and violence. “I hope [Travis’ presence] sends a strong message to survivors that we believe them, we respect them and we are going to take action against persons who engage in sexual harassment in the workplace and hold them accountable for their conduct,” Speier said. Coleman is to be accompanied by Rose Gunter, niece of the late Recy Taylor. Taylor was a black woman who reported six white men for gang-raping her in 1944.Lawrence plans to bring Danielle McGuire, whose 2011 book, At The Dark End Of The Street: Black Women, Rape, And Resistance, told the story of Taylor’s life and legacy. Coleman, Lawrence and some of their colleagues have said they will wear red “Recy” pins during the address. Frankel has invited Laura Germino, an anti-trafficking activist and co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a human rights organization that promotes safe and fair conditions for farmworkers.Germino said she will wear black to the State of the Union.“I represent not myself, but what we can all achieve when we work together. I carry the message that it’s real, it can be done,” Germino said. “Because one more victim is too much, when there’s a proven way to put a stop to harassment. Our path may be long and sometimes challenging, but with commitment and collaboration, we can convert the #MeToo moment into a movement.” The seasoned activist said it’s time to focus on ending workplace harassment. “It’s all the more outrageous that women ― and men ― continue to suffer sexual abuse in the workplace when it’s proven highly preventable,” Germino said. “The solution is here, and now: It’s past time for corporations and industries to ensure that all employees — women and men ― are protected. We’ve had inquiries from dairy, janitorial and construction workers, Olympic Committee members, the entertainment and fashion sectors ― the model is only confined now by the will to implement it. What we are truly talking about is #MeTooNoMore.” Erin Walton, the executive director of Rape Victims Advocates, will join Quigley on Tuesday; Kuster has invited Chessy Prout, a high school sexual assault survivor. “I’ve been inspired by the incredible strength and courage of Chessy as she has grown into a strong advocate on behalf of survivors of sexual assault and harassment,” Kuster said in a press release. “The conversation about sexual harassment and assault in our nation is long overdue, but through the efforts of Chessy and the #MeToo movement it is finally gaining steam.” Speier said she wasn’t very hopeful about how Trump would respond to seeing these guests at the State of the Union. “I don’t know that we can send any message to President Trump. I think that he will recognize how serious all of us are to changing the culture in Congress and in the private sector,” she said. “We know there are issues that occur in the executive branch, but the degree to which they are handled appropriately is not something that we have been as successful in dealing with. But I intend to make that a high priority moving forward.”Some House Democrats, including Reps. Maxine Waters (Calif.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), John Lewis (Ga.) and Frederica Wilson (Fla.), are planning to skip the State of the Union. Others, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Rep. Debbie Dingell (Mich.), are bringing Dreamers to protest Trump dismantling the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) invited Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King, a transgender soldier, to protest the transgender military ban Trump introduced. Other activists, including #MeToo creator Tarana Burke and National Domestic Workers Alliance Executive Director Ai-jen Poo, are hosting an “alternative event” on Tuesday called “State of Our Union.” “It’s now time for action and solutions ― on everything from sexual assault and harassment to low wages and pay equity, from elder care and childcare to paid family leave,” Poo said in a press release. “There is nothing more powerful than women coming together and demanding change, and that is exactly what we plan to do.” The State of the Union address will air Tuesday at 9 p.m. Eastern time."

Osborne said to the crowd just before the performance.Fans on Twitter found the tribute “lovely” and heartbreaking:Prior to the performance, Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the Recording Academy, said in a statement to ET online:“Live music events have always provided a safe space for fans to gather in a shared celebration of music. Sadly, that wasn’t always the case this past year. We believe it’s incredibly important to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in these senseless tragedies and to remind musicians and music lovers alike that live music will continue to be a powerful force that unites us all.”These feelings were echoed by Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards, who also told the publication that he “didn’t feel like we’d be doing our jobs if we didn’t reflect on these tremendous losses.”Morris said in a pre-show interview with Billboard that she wasn’t going to take the performance lightly and that she felt it was a “momentous deal”:“It was very, very traumatic to see our fans, you know, never get to go home. Never get to go to another concert again. When Ken Ehrlich of the Grammys reached out to the four of us to do the tribute, because we’d been there ― it was a really momentous deal to all four of us. So, during rehearsals last night it was really emotional, but I’m so glad I have those guys out there with me. ... If one of us had to do it on our own, I don’t think it would have been possible so to have those guys who are my friends up there doing what we do, I think it’s gonna be OK. ... It’s a really moving performance.”Everytown, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control, sent a statement to HuffPost earlier this week applauding the Grammy Awards’ decision to recognize and remember the Las Vegas shooting victims.“As survivors of the Route 91 Harvest Festival mass shooting in Las Vegas, we applaud the Recording Academy for using its national platform to honor the lives of gun violence victims and survivors at the Grammy Awards on Sunday,” the statement said.“Americans should be able go about their lives free from the fear of gun violence, whether at school, a shopping mall or a concert. But, it’s not just cultural leaders who must speak out about gun violence ― our nation’s elected leaders must speak out and take action to help save lives. Inaction is not a solution.”The Brothers Osborne were nominated for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for “It Ain’t My Fault” and Maren Morris was nominated for Best Country Solo Performance for “I Could Use a Love Song.” Neither won in their respective category."

Rodney Frelinghuysen, a 12-term Republican from New Jersey and chairman of the most sought-after committee in Congress ― the Appropriations Committee ― announced Monday that he would not run for re-election.Frelinghuysen’s announcement was a bit of surprise, considering he could still serve as the top Republican on the powerful Appropriations Committee for another four years under House GOP rules. But faced with the prospect of a tough race ― Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump in that district by only 1 point in 2016 ― as well as internal discussions about removing Frelinghuysen as chairman after he voted against the party’s tax bill, the 71-year-old GOP moderate decided to call it quits.“I have worked in a bipartisan manner, not just in times of crisis but always, because I believe it best serves my constituents, my state and our country,” Frelinghuysen said in a long statement that called on others to take up public service. “My father reminded me often that we are temporary stewards of the public trust. I have sincerely endeavored to earn that trust every day and I thank my constituents and my home state of New Jersey for the honor to serve and I will continue to do so to the best of my abilities through the end of my term.”Frelinghuysen is political royalty in New Jersey, as his father also represented the state in Congress for more than 20 years. The two are also descendants of Frederick Frelinghuysen, who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.But as well-known as he was in New Jersey, Rodney Frelinghuysen would have been battling a difficult political climate. Frelinghuysen was a key vote for the GOP Obamacare repeal in the House, though he initially helped sink the first repeal attempt when he came out against it, and he was unable to significantly change the GOP tax bill, which would raise taxes on a number of his constituents by scaling back deductions on state and local taxes.Frelinghuysen’s decision is yet another bad electoral sign for Republicans, as there are now twice as many open seats currently held by Republicans as there are by Democrats. The announcement already prompted the Cook Political Report to change its rating of the district on Monday from “Lean Republican” to “Toss Up.”Frelinghuysen’s retirement could also set off a race for the top spot on the Appropriations Committee, the panel that controls how much money the government spends. The two front-runners are Reps. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) and Kay Granger (R-Texas), though other Republicans could also vie for the spot."

Joe Kennedy III is bringing a transgender soldier as his guest to Tuesday’s State of the Union address to protest the transgender military ban supported by the Trump administration.According to a report in The Boston Globe on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat invited Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King to accompany him. “I have served for almost 19 years,” King told The Globe. “And all of a sudden, it is all hanging in the balance.”“You’re trying to work up the courage to make that leap, and once you do, gravity does the rest,” she added.King realized she was transgender in 2013 at the end of her last deployment and was the first service member to have the military pay for her gender reassignment surgery.“There are much easier ways to get surgery covered than enlisting in the military, [facing] the possibility of deployment, and dealing with the stigma of being a transgender service member,” she said.Kennedy, the grandson of the late Robert Kennedy, will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union, Democratic leaders announced Thursday. They called Kennedy a “relentless fighter for working Americans.” His decision to bring a transgender member of the military comes after Trump announced in July that all transgender individuals would be banned from serving in the U.S. military. That ban has since been halted by a federal court and transgender individuals have been able to enlist this year.In a statement on the invitation and upcoming response by Kennedy, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) spoke of Kennedy’s understanding of the American people:“While President Trump has consistently broken his promises to the middle class, Congressman Kennedy profoundly understands the challenges facing hard-working men and women across the country.”"

Notably, the logo won’t be going away entirely. The ban extends only to on-field displays, meaning Chief Wahoo will still be a fixture on merchandise that’s available throughout northern Ohio.“Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game,” MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said in a statement Monday.“Over the past year, we encouraged dialogue with the Indian’s organization about the Club’s use of the Chief Wahoo logo. During our constructive conversations, [team owner] Paul Dolan made clear that there are fans who have a longstanding attachment to the logo and its place in the history of the team,” Manfred continued. “Nonetheless, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use … and I appreciate Mr. Dona’s acknowledgement that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course.” Manfred acknowledged the logo’s deeply problematic nature in April 2017, when the league awarded the 2019 All-Star Game to the Indians, and in related meetings pressured the team to “transition away from the Chief Wahoo logo,” MLB spokesman Pat Courtney said.At the time, Bob DiBiasio, the Indians’ senior vice president of public affairs, indicated the team would be receptive to a future change. “We certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo ― those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a long-standing attachment to its place in the history of the team,” he said in a statement.“We fully expect to work with the Commissioner throughout the remainder of this season on finding a solution that is good for the game and our organization.”The long-simmering issue escalated in the fall of 2016 during the American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Indians, when an indigenous Canadian filed suit, seeking to prevent the logo from being used during games in Ontario.The Change the Mascot campaign, a group that has long opposed the offensive logo, welcomed the Indians’ decision as a recognition “that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots.”The group used the news to once again revive calls for the Washington football team to take similar action.“For too long, people of color have been stereotyped with these kinds of hurtful symbols ― and no symbol is more hurtful than the football team in the nation’s capital using a dictionary-defined racial slur as its team name,” Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, the group’s leader, said in an emailed statement.“Cleveland’s decision should finally compel the Washington football team to make the same honorable decision,” Halbritter continued. “Washington Owner Dan Snyder needs to look at Cleveland’s move and then look in the mirror and ask whether he wants to be forever known as the most famous purveyor of bigotry in modern sports, or if he wants to finally stand on the right side of history and change his team’s name.“We hope he chooses the latter.”The NFL team didn’t respond to a request for comment.This story has been updated with statements from Manfred and the Change the Mascot campaign."

Prime Minister Turnbull described the plan as an “ambitious, positive plan” to boost Australian industry, increase investment, and create more jobs.“A strong, exporting defence industry in Australia will provide greater certainty of investment, support high-end manufacturing jobs and support the capability of the Australian Defence Force,” he said, according to The Guardian. The government will set aside $US16.2m a year to implement the strategy, including $5.145m to implement strategic multi-year export campaigns.The strategy identified key markets in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand; the Indo-Pacific region, the Middle East region and in Europe.Such a plan marks a significant ramp up in Australia’s arms exports. Australia is ranked the 20th largest arms exporter in the world.Amnesty International Australia condemned the plan.“When the Government talks about expanding arms exports to the Middle East, where exactly does it mean,” Amnesty International Australia’s Crisis Campaigns Coordinator Diana Sayed said in a statement.“Syria? Saudi Arabia? And when it talks about the Indo-Pacific, is it contemplating Myanmar?

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Repeatedly rated one of the healthiest and happiest places to live in the United States, this medium-sized college town with spectacular views of the Blue Ridge Mountains tends to attract entrepreneurs, freelancers and creative types who can live anywhere they want because they’re not tied to a corporate job.But this year, many of those untethered workers may be wishing they lived anywhere but here. Residents of Charlottesville and three surrounding counties who buy health insurance without employer support or government subsidies have been hit with the highest health insurance premiums in the country — more than three times the price they paid last year.Premiums are also substantially higher than average, although not as high as in Charlottesville, in southwestern rural Georgia, certain Colorado ski resort towns, the Connecticut suburbs of New York City, and large parts of Wisconsin and Wyoming, among other places.Charlottesville’s premium spike may be an anomaly. But insurance experts say it could be an indication of what might happen in other parts of the country next fall, when insurers post their final rates for 2019.Nationwide, premiums for average-priced policies — according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis — offered on and off the health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act rose by more than a third compared with 2017. The biggest statewide hikes were in Iowa (88 percent), Utah (78 percent), New Hampshire (78 percent), Wyoming (72 percent), and Virginia (66 percent).The underlying cause of the rate hikes is clear: efforts last year by the Trump administration and its allies in Congress to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — and promises of further attempts in the year ahead.“It all added up to chaos and uncertainty in the insurance market,” said Sabrina Corlette, a Georgetown University research professor and insurance expert. “And uncertainty always leads to higher premiums.”This year, a handful of Democratic-led states are gearing up to curb further rate hikes by enacting laws and adopting insurance regulations designed to shore up the traditional insurance industry and restore parts of the ACA, known as Obamacare.At the same time, at least one Republican-leaning state has moved to further unravel the federal health law by encouraging insurance companies to offer cheap policies with fewer benefits. Others are expected to follow.Both red and blue states are reacting to a series of federal actions.The federal tax overhaul enacted in December repealed the individual mandate, which required everybody to have health insurance or pay a financial penalty. The requirement was designed to ensure that healthy people signed up for insurance so that premiums for everyone remained affordable.Two months earlier, President Donald Trump withdrew billions in federal insurance industry subsidies that allowed insurers to keep premiums affordable while holding down copays and deductibles.Around the same time, Trump also cut the health exchange enrollment period in half. And earlier in the year, he slashed the marketing budget for federal exchanges to further damage the health law by curtailing enrollment.This year, both branches of government promise further attacks on the health law, including final actions on two administration proposals. One would encourage insurers to offer short-term policies with variable copays and deductibles, and the other would allow people to form groups to create so-called association health plans with cheap premiums and limited benefits.States RespondIn Idaho, Republican Gov. Butch Otter followed the administration’s cues, signing an executive order this month that directs the state insurance agency to draft rules allowing insurance companies to offer cheap plans with stripped-down benefits.Going in the opposite direction, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Maryland are considering legislation that would recreate the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate by requiring nearly all residents to enroll in a health plan or pay a fee. Massachusetts has a mandate on the books that it said it intends to enforce.Taking a different tack — one that has been endorsed by members of both political parties — Alaska, Minnesota and Oregon have created so-called reinsurance programs designed to cover higher-than-average claims with state money and thereby reduce overall risk for insurance companies so they can offer consumers lower premiums.Under the health law, the federal government can reimburse states for any money spent on reinsurance programs that results in lower premiums, and thus reduced federal tax subsidies, as long as the reimbursements do not exceed federal savings. Washington state and Wisconsin are considering similar programs this year.In New Jersey, newly elected Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed an executive order this month directing state agencies to invest in greater outreach and education to encourage more people to sign up for coverage on the state insurance exchange when it opens in November. California and New York launched similar advertising and marketing campaigns last year for the same reason.By encouraging more people to enroll, states can improve the odds that their insurance markets will stabilize and premiums will remain affordable.“Consumers are still confused about health insurance subsidies, and they’re hearing a lot of bad news about the ACA,” said Sarah Lueck, an insurance analyst at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “States need to tell consumers that the market isn’t crumbling, because it’s not. There are still some really good deals out there.”It’s too early to know how many other states will move this year to fill the policy gaps in the tattered Affordable Care Act. But consumer advocates are urging lawmakers and governors to act sooner rather than later.“States need to prepare now if their initiatives are going to have the desired effect,” Lueck said. If states want to stabilize the insurance industry by establishing individual mandates or reinsurance programs, they need to have their policies in place before spring and summer, when companies are required to file preliminary rates for 2019, she said.For states that want to follow New Jersey’s lead and beef up outreach and marketing for their insurance exchanges this year, there’s a little more time. Insurance exchange marketing typically doesn’t start until September, two months prior to open enrollment in November.But there’s another approach states can take at any time to protect their traditional insurance markets from the continued uncertainty created by attacks on the ACA from Congress and the Trump administration.Once federal agencies finalize rules allowing cheaper, substandard health policies, states can prohibit those policies from being sold within their borders unless they comply with ACA consumer protections, according to a recent article by a group of consumer advocates in the policy journal Health Affairs.New Jersey and New York already have such prohibitions, and Minnesota allows non-complying health plans to be sold only under limited circumstances.Unsubsidized ConsumersBefore the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014, people who were self-employed, between jobs or working part time and were not offered employer-sponsored health plans typically had to pay the highest prices for health coverage because insurers considered the relatively small pool of individuals riskier than larger groups.Many people who faced high-priced individual insurance policies took their chances and went without coverage. Others opted for cheaper plans with high out-of-pocket expenses and limited benefits.For this group, the ACA’s consumer protections were a huge boon. Confident they could find affordable health insurance, many workers were able to strike out on their own for the first time.Insurers were prohibited from refusing coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or charging people higher premiums because of their medical history. And although individual market premiums still tended to be higher than group plans, rates and coverage improved in the first four years after the federal health law took effect.But last year’s revisions to the law may have changed all that.As a result, many states can be expected to take action this year to protect this group of consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, said Timothy Jost, a retired law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia and an ACA expert. They will either be propping up the ACA and the traditional health insurance market, or further undermining the federal health law by promoting cheaper, lower quality policies, he said.The result, he said, will be even greater disparities than already exist between states in the number of people who can afford quality health care coverage.In fact, the Trump administration’s tactics are likely to bolster the overall proportion of Americans enrolled in Medicaid and federally subsidized exchange policies, said Joel Ario, a health care analyst with the law firm Manatt, Phelps and Phillips who worked in the Obama administration. That’s because the policies will remain affordable and people will enroll in them even without the coercion of the individual mandate, he said.Left out will be people not covered by employer-sponsored insurance and with incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid or federal exchange subsidies. Nationwide, about 22 million people purchase insurance in the individual market, according to Kaiser. About 43 percent of them have incomes too high to qualify for federal tax subsidies on the exchange.Charlottesville resident Sara Stovall is among them. She, and fellow residents Ian Dixon and Karl Quist, have hired an attorney to represent them and a group of more than 700 other locals who in November were hit with exorbitant premiums. They’re arguing in a case before the Virginia Insurance Bureau that the rates filed by Optima Health — a Virginia-based insurance carrier and the sole remaining provider of health coverage in their area — violated federal law.But even if they win the case and the state orders Optima to issue refunds, they and the others in their group won’t personally benefit. The money would go to a regional insurance pool and ultimately would be deducted from future premiums for all policies.Stovall, Dixon and Quist, all of whom had incomes just above the federal limit, could not afford their 2018 insurance premiums, roughly $3,000 a month for a family of four. Stovall, whose husband’s freelance photography business is growing, said their premiums would have been more than their mortgage payment.Dixon, a self-employed software developer, said he and his family moved from Washington, D.C., to Charlottesville two-and-a-half years ago, when he quit his day job. “I heard there was a good startup community here,” he said. “But if individual insurance rates had spiked that year like they did this year, we never would have come here.” Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Repeatedly rated one of the healthiest and happiest places to live in the United States, this medium-sized college town with spectacular views of the Blue Ridge Mountains tends to attract entrepreneurs, freelancers and creative types who can live anywhere they want because they’re not tied to a corporate job.But this year, many of those untethered workers may be wishing they lived anywhere but here. Residents of Charlottesville and three surrounding counties who buy health insurance without employer support or government subsidies have been hit with the highest health insurance premiums in the country — more than three times the price they paid last year.Premiums are also substantially higher than average, although not as high as in Charlottesville, in southwestern rural Georgia, certain Colorado ski resort towns, the Connecticut suburbs of New York City, and large parts of Wisconsin and Wyoming, among other places.Charlottesville’s premium spike may be an anomaly. But insurance experts say it could be an indication of what might happen in other parts of the country next fall, when insurers post their final rates for 2019.Nationwide, premiums for average-priced policies — according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis — offered on and off the health insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act rose by more than a third compared with 2017. The biggest statewide hikes were in Iowa (88 percent), Utah (78 percent), New Hampshire (78 percent), Wyoming (72 percent), and Virginia (66 percent).The underlying cause of the rate hikes is clear: efforts last year by the Trump administration and its allies in Congress to dismantle the Affordable Care Act — and promises of further attempts in the year ahead.“It all added up to chaos and uncertainty in the insurance market,” said Sabrina Corlette, a Georgetown University research professor and insurance expert. “And uncertainty always leads to higher premiums.”This year, a handful of Democratic-led states are gearing up to curb further rate hikes by enacting laws and adopting insurance regulations designed to shore up the traditional insurance industry and restore parts of the ACA, known as Obamacare.At the same time, at least one Republican-leaning state has moved to further unravel the federal health law by encouraging insurance companies to offer cheap policies with fewer benefits.

The old mining town has art galleries, live music venues, and stories — many of them revolving around the supposedly haunted Copper Queen Hotel — in abundance.Until a few years ago, Bisbee also had plenty of something it didn’t want: plastic bags. They sullied the streets, helicoptered through the air and draped the cactuses, according to Mayor David M. Smith. The problem grew so dire that in 2012, the town barred retailers from providing plastic bags to customers.Some local businesses opposed the ban, but most residents were thrilled, according to Smith. “It made a huge difference,” said the mayor, who voted for the ordinance as a member of the city council. “After, they were all gone.”But that was just the beginning of Bisbee’s bag battle. The Arizona Food Marketing Alliance, which represents the state’s grocers and food suppliers, lobbied the Legislature for legislation that would quash Bisbee’s ban and prevent other cities and towns in Arizona from following its lead. In 2015, they succeeded.Republican lawmakers typically tout the benefits of local control. But in states across the country, they have taken action to rein in cities that want to enact progressive measures such as gun control laws and minimum wage hikes. Now plastic bags have become an unlikely flashpoint in the conflict between blue cities and their red state legislatures.In recent years a handful of states — Arizona and Missouri in 2015, Idaho, Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, Minnesota in 2017 — have enacted “bans on bans,” joining a group that already included Florida, Indiana and Iowa.State Sen. Warren Petersen, the Republican who led the push for Arizona’s law, said it is intended to protect individual rights. In addition to prohibiting plastic bag bans, the measure prohibits local governments from regulating the use of boxes, bottles and containers “used for transporting merchandise to or from a business.”“It’s not the government’s job to tell you whether or not you should use a plastic bag,” Petersen said. “Are we going to micromanage every decision of every consumer?”The issue also has attracted national players. The American Progressive Bag Alliance, an offshoot of the Plastics Industry Association, has spent millions of dollars to defeat the local bans and support legislation that preempts local governments from implementing them. And the American City County Exchange, an offshoot of the conservative advocacy group the American Legislative Exchange Council — better known as ALEC — has drafted model legislative language for prohibitions on bag bans.“A patchwork of bag laws is never good for the consumer and never good for businesses,” said Matt Seaholm, executive director of the American Progressive Bag Alliance. “It should be done at the state level if it’s that important of an issue.”In Arizona, Bisbee refused to repeal its bag ban — until last fall, when the threat of losing nearly $2 million in state aid finally forced it to relent.“The state was basically extorting us, saying that we either had to repeal this ordinance or lose our state sharing revenues,” Smith said. “That would have literally bankrupted the city.”San Francisco Leads the WaySan Francisco in 2007 became the first city in the United States to impose a ban on single-use plastic bags. Roughly 150 municipalities in California, including San Jose, Malibu and Santa Monica, eventually followed suit.After a series of battles in the lower state courts, the California Supreme Court in 2011 upheld the rights of cities to ban single-use plastic bags and ruled they did not have to complete an environmental impact analysis before adopting such bans.Buoyed by victory, supporters pushed for a statewide ban, which Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2014.But bag proponents weren’t through. In the last three months of 2014, the Progressive Bag Alliance spent over $3 million to collect enough signatures to put a reversal of the ban on the 2016 ballot. (Hilex Poly, a leading plastic bag manufacturer, contributed $1.7 million, Superbag Corporation gave $500,000, and Formosa Plastics contributed $400,000 in the successful effort.)Then, to attract voter support for the ballot measure, the alliance spent another $2.6 million.Still, Californians upheld the statewide ban, with 53 percent voting in favor. The ban allows stores to offer paper or reusable plastic bags for a 10 cent minimum fee, and certain businesses — like restaurants and department stores — are exempt.Environmentalists say discarded plastic bags, in addition to being unsightly, are often eaten by animals such as fish and eventually end up in human food, which can make people sick. Citing data collected by the California Coastal Commission, a state agency, environmentalists say bag bans can go a long way toward minimizing those risks.In 2010, volunteers picked up about 65,000 plastic bags littered along state beaches and rivers during the Coastal Commission’s annual cleanup day. Plastic bags accounted for 7.4 percent of all the items of trash collected throughout the day — the third most common item after cigarette butts and food wrappers.In 2016, according to the commission, the number of littered plastic bags collected dropped by 63 percent compared to 2010. Plastic bags accounted for only 3.4 percent of the items picked up during the cleanup. In 2017, the number of plastic bags collected continued to drop, down to 3.1 percent of items picked up.“This is a big win for the coast of California and the state in general,” said Mark Vargas, a commissioner on the Coastal Commission. “And it is proof that [these bans] work.”Paper or Plastic?But opponents of plastic bag bans maintain that they do little to protect the environment — and may even harm humans.Minnesota state Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen, a Republican who successfully pushed a measure prohibiting local bag bans in his state, pointed out that single-use plastic bags can be reused or recycled at many grocery stores. He also argued that single-use plastic bags are more sanitary than reusable bags, and that manufacturing single-use plastic bags creates a smaller carbon footprint than the production of single-use paper bags.Other bag-ban opponents argue that reusable bags pose sanitary risks. Many cite a 2013 study that found that reusable grocery bags, a common substitute for plastic bags, contain potentially harmful bacteria. The researchers found that emergency room admissions related to these bacteria spiked in San Francisco after it adopted its ban in 2007.In Minnesota, state lawmakers acted quickly to preempt a bag ban that Minneapolis approved in spring 2016. Days before the city’s ban was slated to go into effect, state lawmakers in 2017 enacted a statewide prohibition on cities imposing bans on any type of bag in stores.In 2016, the Progressive Bag Alliance spent $20,000 on lobbying at the state level in Minnesota, and the American Chemistry Council — an organization that helped found the Progressive Bag Alliance — spent $270,000.City councilman Cam Gordon, a member of the Green Party who introduced the Minneapolis ordinance, said he and other proponents of the measure met with business groups and adjusted the ban to address retailers’ concerns.

Though they initially sat together at the same table, Holmes briefly walked out of the room a few moments before the gala host and music producer announced Foxx’s presence.That prompted Davis to say, “This lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her. She was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else.”With Holmes by then sitting at another table, he added, “If you’re going to sit together, what better night than tonight?”Foxx found the commentary hilarious, while Holmes looked more than a little uncomfortable to be “caught.”Despite the mild awkwardness, Holmes, 39, and Foxx, 50, appeared to be happy and enjoying their time together in many of the shots captured at the event. In addition to that time last September they were seen holding hands, the two have been spotted together on and off since 2013. They have not confirmed to the public that they’re in a relationship.

While Kardashian unloaded on former brother-in-law Lamar Odom earlier this month, the family had stayed silent on another sister’s ex-partner, Scott Disick. Disick, 34, has recently and somewhat controversially been dating model Sofia Richie, 19. He and oldest sister Kourtney Kardashian were together for years and share three kids ― sons Mason, 8, and Reign, 3, and daughter Penelope, 5 ― but called it quits for good in 2015.Well, Kendall was feeling some kind of way when she saw a photo of Disick and Richie in a car with one of his offspring on a fan’s Instagram account and basically broke the family’s silence on the matter.“Awww Scott and his kids,” Jenner commented, adding a laughing face emoji.The 22-year-old Jenner is not the only one who has reservations about the relationship. Richie’s father, Lionel, confessed that he was “scared to death” of his daughter dating Disick, given the age gap and Disick’s hard-partying reputation. Before he was linked to Richie, Disick was seen out and about with actress Bella Thorne, 20, cuddling at the Cannes Festival. When photos of the two made the internet rounds, Kim Kardashian called the self-proclaimed “Lord” “desperate” and “malicious” for trying to make her sister jealous with that fling. Kourtney, 38, meanwhile, has been living her best life in various exotic locales around the world with her considerably younger boyfriend, 24-year-old model Younes Bendjima.

While on assignment to write a profile on the TV icon, the initially cynical Junod’s perspective on Rogers (and life) transforms as the two cultivate a friendship.The profile Junod wrote, “Can You Say... Hero?” was published in Esquire in 1998. More than just a portrayal of Rogers’ essence, it’s also a meditation on what is lost as we grow up, and taking Rogers’ lessons with us as we do.Heller told Variety she was “thrilled to be making ‘You Are My Friend,’” saying the “script knocked me out with its message of kindness and its exploration of the human spirit.”“As a mother, I am so inspired by the teachings of Fred Rogers and as a human I am in awe of his life’s work,” Heller said. “I can’t wait to bring his story to the public and be a part of such a thoughtful, smart group of people who are all coming together to make this film, which truly feels to me like an antidote to our very fractured culture.”As for Hanks’ role in the project, it’s not known when he’ll begin shooting. He’s expected to be in several upcoming blockbusters, including “Toy Story 4,” “Greyhound” and “Bios.”Fans of Rogers know him as the the cardigan-wearing star of the children’s TV series “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” which ran for 33 years on PBS. Rogers died in 2003 at the age of 74."

The Rock Princess Is Still Defying The Odds.,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pink-grammys_us_5a6e6202e4b0ddb658c78517,Pink was one of the women shut out at this year's Grammys. Her performance on Sunday night was a quiet spectacle anyway.,2018-01-29,Pink performs at the 2018 Grammy Awards on Jan. 28 in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6e8bc91600004500139077.jpeg?cache=O5clZSJwvc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday night, we watched with excitement as four veteran female vocalists competed to take home the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance. But fans of Kelly Clarkson (“Love So Soft”) and Kesha (“Praying””) and Lady Gaga (“Million Reasons”) and Pink (“What About Us”) were ultimately disappointed. None of them took home the prize. They lost out to the lone man in their category: Ed Sheeran (“Shape Of You”).And he wasn’t even there to accept the honor.Pink, for one, seemed unfazed by her loss. A few beats later, she took the Grammys stage to perform a stripped-down version of her song “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken.” As her husband Carey Hart and their 6-year-old daughter Willow watched from the crowd, Pink ― dressed in a white, off-the-shoulder T-shirt, loose jeans and minimal makeup ― stood alongside a sign-language interpreter and sang her heart out. Unlike her past performances, this involved no aerial stunts, no elaborate stage design or costumery. It was just Pink and her commanding lyrics. And little else.Alecia Moore, aka Pink, has been a part of the competitive music industry since the late 1990s. This year, almost two decades since the rebellious girl with a hot pink pixie cut opted to become a solo artist with her biting debut album “Can’t Take Me Home” ― the one everyone described as angry or sassy ― she’s not only continuing to line up Grammy nominations, she’s managing to do so on her own terms. “I’m just trying to be exciting,” she told Ryan Seacrest on the E! Red Carpet ahead of the show in New York. ”[A woman in a grocery store told me] she enjoys me because I like to F up in public a lot. She finds strength in knowing someone is out there screwing up like [her], too.” And just like that, Pink synthesized exactly what’s kept her going in a cutthroat business ― where only 9.3 percent of the Grammy nominees from 2013 to 2018 were women ― that was never designed to let her win.Born and raised in a small suburb of Philadelphia, Pink was heavily influenced by her parents’ tumultuous relationship and eventual divorce. The emotional fallout she experienced as a teen led her to pick up a guitar and write her own music, influenced by idols like Janis Joplin and Madonna. She broke into the industry as a member of the all-girl band Choice, but label executive L.A. Reid quickly told Pink she’d be better off going solo, so she signed with LaFace Records to do so. It’d be one of the last times she’d act on Reid’s advice.During the creation of her first album, Reid reportedly recommended, among other things, that Pink attend an etiquette class to reshape her image. She ignored him and exposed his misguidance on her second album, which sold more than 10 million copies. “L.A. told me you’ll be a pop star,” she sang in “Don’t Let Me Get Me,” “all you have to change is everything you are.”“I’ve always had to put pen to paper and scratch out my rage since I was little,” she said in the documentary “Pink: The Truth. ”[T]o be able to put that in motion to melody and have other kids scream it out the same way, and go to the same place I was at when I wrote it, it’s just like group therapy. Writing is everything to me.”It’s true. Beyond writing lyrics, Pink has been masterfully writing her own narrative for years, withstanding pressures to adhere to some ideal version of a female pop star and projecting her own, earnest version of it to the world instead.“Can’t Take Me Home” was a giant success, but Pink decided to do then what she’d go on to do many more times: reinvent herself. Gone were the days of her R&B-pop hits like “Most Girls” ― she craved more rock. Following her Grammy win for a full-pop collaboration on “Lady Marmalade” with Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, Missy Elliott and Mya, Pink recruited 4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry to co-produce her new sound on “Missundaztood,” with songs like “Get the Party Started,” which peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100 in 2001. “Missundaztood” Pink still sported an edgy, cropped haircut. She preferred pants over skirts; crop tops over blouses; heavy metal horns over peace signs. She didn’t want to be Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson, so she broke the mold originally cast for her ― and fans followed.She eventually won another Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance with “Trouble” off her third studio album, “Try This.” Her 2006, 2008 and 2012 albums “I’m Not Dead,” “Funhouse” and “The Truth About Love” each sold more than 6 million copies worldwide. And she wrote her successes into her music: “I’m still a rock star / I got my rock moves / And I don’t need you,” she sang ― partly to her estranged husband at the time, but also, we assume, to the people still doubting her triumphs. Her latest effort, “Beautiful Trauma,” topped the Billboard 200 in November. “I was never as big as Britney or Christina,” she said in a recent New York Times profile. “If you look at any paragraph about pop music, I don’t get mentioned — my name doesn’t come up. And yet, here I go again, right under the wave, duck-diving.”Speaking of maneuvers, it’s difficult to talk about Pink’s 2018 Grammy appearance without comparing it with her 2010 Grammy performance of “Glitter In The Air.” It’s hard to think of this year’s plain white T-shirt without thinking of the time she calmly walked onstage and sang some verses before breaking out in aerial acrobatics, spinning above the crowd in a soaking wet bodysuit. Some critics deemed it the most beautiful and memorable Grammy performance ever; her ability to continue belting out her lyrics ― no lip-syncing from Pink ― incited a standing ovation.“I’ve always seen dancers do [acrobatics] behind the singer, but the singer’s never done it,” she told Oprah. “Everyone’s pretty much done everything else that there is to do, so I said, ‘Why can’t I do it and sing?’ ... And I wanted to get all the famous people wet!” From then on, every time Pink took the stage, people paid attention.Sunday night, however, she decided to strip it all down. Her performance of “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken” was minimalistic compared with her trapeze acts, but that’s likely exactly how she hoped it’d be perceived. She knew that, no matter what, Grammy audiences would be watching her moves with baited breath, waiting for some imagined harness.“There’s not enough rope to tie me down / There’s not enough tape to shut this mouth,” she sang, with no spectacle in sight. “The stones you throw can make me bleed / But I won’t stop until we’re free / Wild hearts can’t be broken.”Men won all but one of the major categories at the Grammy Awards on Sunday; Alessia Cara was the only woman able to nab a major trophy, for Best New Artist.

33,ENTERTAINMENT,What About Pink? The Rock Princess Is Still Defying The Odds.,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pink-grammys_us_5a6e6202e4b0ddb658c78517,Pink was one of the women shut out at this year's Grammys. Her performance on Sunday night was a quiet spectacle anyway.,2018-01-29,Pink at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Frankfurt in 2001.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6e6c591d000027006ad056.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday night, we watched with excitement as four veteran female vocalists competed to take home the Grammy for Best Pop Solo Performance. But fans of Kelly Clarkson (“Love So Soft”) and Kesha (“Praying””) and Lady Gaga (“Million Reasons”) and Pink (“What About Us”) were ultimately disappointed. None of them took home the prize. They lost out to the lone man in their category: Ed Sheeran (“Shape Of You”).And he wasn’t even there to accept the honor.Pink, for one, seemed unfazed by her loss. A few beats later, she took the Grammys stage to perform a stripped-down version of her song “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken.” As her husband Carey Hart and their 6-year-old daughter Willow watched from the crowd, Pink ― dressed in a white, off-the-shoulder T-shirt, loose jeans and minimal makeup ― stood alongside a sign-language interpreter and sang her heart out. Unlike her past performances, this involved no aerial stunts, no elaborate stage design or costumery. It was just Pink and her commanding lyrics. And little else.Alecia Moore, aka Pink, has been a part of the competitive music industry since the late 1990s. This year, almost two decades since the rebellious girl with a hot pink pixie cut opted to become a solo artist with her biting debut album “Can’t Take Me Home” ― the one everyone described as angry or sassy ― she’s not only continuing to line up Grammy nominations, she’s managing to do so on her own terms. “I’m just trying to be exciting,” she told Ryan Seacrest on the E! Red Carpet ahead of the show in New York. ”[A woman in a grocery store told me] she enjoys me because I like to F up in public a lot. She finds strength in knowing someone is out there screwing up like [her], too.” And just like that, Pink synthesized exactly what’s kept her going in a cutthroat business ― where only 9.3 percent of the Grammy nominees from 2013 to 2018 were women ― that was never designed to let her win.Born and raised in a small suburb of Philadelphia, Pink was heavily influenced by her parents’ tumultuous relationship and eventual divorce. The emotional fallout she experienced as a teen led her to pick up a guitar and write her own music, influenced by idols like Janis Joplin and Madonna. She broke into the industry as a member of the all-girl band Choice, but label executive L.A. Reid quickly told Pink she’d be better off going solo, so she signed with LaFace Records to do so. It’d be one of the last times she’d act on Reid’s advice.During the creation of her first album, Reid reportedly recommended, among other things, that Pink attend an etiquette class to reshape her image. She ignored him and exposed his misguidance on her second album, which sold more than 10 million copies. “L.A. told me you’ll be a pop star,” she sang in “Don’t Let Me Get Me,” “all you have to change is everything you are.”“I’ve always had to put pen to paper and scratch out my rage since I was little,” she said in the documentary “Pink: The Truth. ”[T]o be able to put that in motion to melody and have other kids scream it out the same way, and go to the same place I was at when I wrote it, it’s just like group therapy. Writing is everything to me.”It’s true. Beyond writing lyrics, Pink has been masterfully writing her own narrative for years, withstanding pressures to adhere to some ideal version of a female pop star and projecting her own, earnest version of it to the world instead.“Can’t Take Me Home” was a giant success, but Pink decided to do then what she’d go on to do many more times: reinvent herself. Gone were the days of her R&B-pop hits like “Most Girls” ― she craved more rock. Following her Grammy win for a full-pop collaboration on “Lady Marmalade” with Aguilera, Lil’ Kim, Missy Elliott and Mya, Pink recruited 4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry to co-produce her new sound on “Missundaztood,” with songs like “Get the Party Started,” which peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100 in 2001. “Missundaztood” Pink still sported an edgy, cropped haircut. She preferred pants over skirts; crop tops over blouses; heavy metal horns over peace signs. She didn’t want to be Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson, so she broke the mold originally cast for her ― and fans followed.She eventually won another Grammy for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance with “Trouble” off her third studio album, “Try This.” Her 2006, 2008 and 2012 albums “I’m Not Dead,” “Funhouse” and “The Truth About Love” each sold more than 6 million copies worldwide. And she wrote her successes into her music: “I’m still a rock star / I got my rock moves / And I don’t need you,” she sang ― partly to her estranged husband at the time, but also, we assume, to the people still doubting her triumphs. Her latest effort, “Beautiful Trauma,” topped the Billboard 200 in November. “I was never as big as Britney or Christina,” she said in a recent New York Times profile. “If you look at any paragraph about pop music, I don’t get mentioned — my name doesn’t come up. And yet, here I go again, right under the wave, duck-diving.”Speaking of maneuvers, it’s difficult to talk about Pink’s 2018 Grammy appearance without comparing it with her 2010 Grammy performance of “Glitter In The Air.” It’s hard to think of this year’s plain white T-shirt without thinking of the time she calmly walked onstage and sang some verses before breaking out in aerial acrobatics, spinning above the crowd in a soaking wet bodysuit. Some critics deemed it the most beautiful and memorable Grammy performance ever; her ability to continue belting out her lyrics ― no lip-syncing from Pink ― incited a standing ovation.“I’ve always seen dancers do [acrobatics] behind the singer, but the singer’s never done it,” she told Oprah. “Everyone’s pretty much done everything else that there is to do, so I said, ‘Why can’t I do it and sing?’ ... And I wanted to get all the famous people wet!” From then on, every time Pink took the stage, people paid attention.Sunday night, however, she decided to strip it all down. Her performance of “Wild Hearts Can’t Be Broken” was minimalistic compared with her trapeze acts, but that’s likely exactly how she hoped it’d be perceived. She knew that, no matter what, Grammy audiences would be watching her moves with baited breath, waiting for some imagined harness.“There’s not enough rope to tie me down / There’s not enough tape to shut this mouth,” she sang, with no spectacle in sight. “The stones you throw can make me bleed / But I won’t stop until we’re free / Wild hearts can’t be broken.”Men won all but one of the major categories at the Grammy Awards on Sunday; Alessia Cara was the only woman able to nab a major trophy, for Best New Artist.

34,LATINO VOICES,"'Despacito' Was Robbed At The Grammys, And We’re All Worse Off For It",Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/despacito-grammys-2018_us_5a6d1f5fe4b06e25326824ea,"By nearly every measure, it was the biggest song of 2017.",2018-01-29,Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's performance at Sunday's Grammys was a trending topic on Twitter. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6f497d2d00001f00943146.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Despacito” was on the verge of making history at Sunday night’s Grammy Awards.The single’s remix, performed by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and featuring Justin Bieber, nearly became the first mostly Spanish-language song in Grammy history to win either record of the year or song of the year. The song had also been nominated in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category.But by the end of music’s biggest night, “Despacito” had no more Grammys than it did at the start. The Recording Academy’s shutout of the single revealed just how hollow the often-uttered platitude “music is a universal language” actually is. Here’s why.By nearly every measure, “Despacito” was the world’s biggest song of 2017. It not only broke nearly every record under the sun, but it finally made clear to the U.S. mainstream market the true power of Latin music on a global stage. The single began its climb up the charts worldwide when Fonsi and Yankee released the original version in January 2017. It was already a global phenomenon by the time Bieber remixed the hit in April, catapulting it up the U.S. charts.By May, “Despacito” had become the first mostly Spanish-language No. 1 single in the country since the “Macarena” in 1996. By July, it had been crowned the most streamed song of all time. And by August, the music video had become the most viewed video in YouTube history. (As of Monday, the video still held that record with more than 4.7 billion views.)By the end of the year, “Despacito” had earned a total of 1.322 billion on-demand streams, according to Nielsen Music. Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You,” which won the Grammy for best pop solo performance on Sunday, came in a distant second place with 999.69 million streams.And “Despacito” has only continued to dominate in 2018. As of Saturday, the track and remix is one of only 18 songs to be certified diamond by the Recording Industry of America ― and it’s the first Latin song ever to do so. Even at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, the single stood out as the only song to be nominated for both record and song of the year, a first for a foreign-language hit since Los Lobos’ “La Bamba” received both nods 30 years ago. And still, it got snubbed in both categories. “Despacito” was everywhere in 2017, and that wasn’t just a fad or a fluke. It was an overdue acknowledgement of the growing power that Latin music ― particularly Spanish-language urban music ― has around the world.All other things being equal, Spanish-language music dominated worldwide in 2017 in a way that mainstream American music failed to. Six of YouTube’s top 10 music videos of the year were Spanish-language hits, and seven were by Latino artists.On streaming platforms, the popularity of Latin music is undeniable. In December 2016, Spotify told Billboard that it only took two years for the “Baila Reggaetón” playlist to become the platform’s second most popular playlist globally.“Last year at this time, we had 1.1 million subscribers. Today, we have 3.3 million,” Rocío Guerrero, Spotify’s global head of Latin content programming, told Billboard then. “It was a wake-up call for everyone. Now, Latin is a big priority for the company.”There’s no debate that “Despacito” is worthy of a Grammy ― in fact, it netted four Latin Grammys in November, including song of the year and record of the year. If it had taken either of those major honors at Sunday night’s ceremony, it would have been the first foreign-language song to win in either category since “Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu (Volare)” by Domenico Modugno won at the very first Grammy Awards in 1958.This history of exclusion of foreign-language music from major categories suggests the Recording Academy doesn’t really view music as such a transcendent force. Because if music is really a universal language and it really knows no borders, then why do the Latin Grammys exist? The idea that the world, or even the country, can come together through music right now is crucial, if you ask Fonsi.“The one thing about music is we can express ourselves through a song and kind of come together,” the Puerto Rican singer told HuffPost on the Grammys red carpet Sunday. “What ‘Despacito’ has done [is] to be able to break the language barrier, in a time when people, you know, they want to build walls and sort of separate and kind of forbid you from speaking your own language or celebrating your culture.”It’s more important than ever to end the marginalization and segregation of Latin music in the industry ― and the Grammys’ inability to recognize that is devastating.Read what people on Twitter had to say about the “Despacito” snub.

But in a blog post published last week, he said he came to realize that he could no longer be married to his partner, Laurel Weed, who is a straight woman. Together, the pair also apologized to queer Mormons for the way their story “has been used to bully others.”“We’re sorry for any degree that our existence, and the publicity of our supposedly successful marriage made you feel ‘less than’ as you made your own terribly difficult choices. And we’re sorry if our story made it easier for people in your life to reject you and your difficult path as being wrong,” the Jan. 25 blog read. “If this is you, we want you to know: you were right.”“You listened to your gut and to God and did a brave, brave thing. Now I’m following your example.”In 2012, Josh Weed wrote a viral blog post in which he came out as a gay Mormon who was “very happily” married to a straight woman. He wrote that his wife, a childhood friend, knew about his sexual orientation before they were married and that he decided to marry her because he believed in the doctrines of the Mormon church, wanted to have a traditional family and genuinely loved his wife.The story attracted a flurry of media attention, leading to features on ABC’s “Nightline” and the VH1 reality television show “I’m Married To A...” Now, he says his former approach toward queer sexuality was a “manifestation of lingering internalized homophobia.” While he believes his marriage was beautiful and he still thinks of his wife as his “very best friend,” the relationship contained an “undercurrent of pain” the pair were not able to see clearly for years, he said.He also wrote that he had always thought of himself as a “broken straight person” ― someone who was meant to be straight and whom God would one day fix. But he realizes now that viewing himself as “fundamentally broken” has led to overwhelming sadness in his life and at times, to suicidal thoughts, he added. “The things I talked about in my coming out post in 2012 weren’t false. The joy I felt was real! The love I felt was real, but something in me wanted to die,” he wrote. “It’s the thing that wants to die in all of us when we don’t have hope for attachment to a person we are oriented towards.”After about 15 years of marriage, the idea of going for decades more without experiencing authentic romantic and sexual attachment was finally too great a burden to bear ― for both of them, the couple said. In the post, Laurel Weed wrote about how being married to her husband had brought her both immeasurable joy and pain. There was a “void” in their connection, and it wasn’t just about sex, she wrote.“Platonic love is simply not enough, no matter how much we hoped it was,” she said. “God designed us to need and want romantic attachment.”The pair also wanted to acknowledge how their story had caused pain for others in the queer Mormon community. When they went public with their story in 2012, Josh Weed said that he and his wife had “very little exposure” to gay people. But not long after their post went viral, they began to receive messages from queer Mormons about how the Weeds’ mixed-orientation marriage had been used as an impossible standard. Kathy Carlston, a queer Mormon from Syracuse, Utah, told HuffPost she feels the Weeds have often spoken against their story being used as an example for other queer Mormons. Still, she said that didn’t prevent straight Mormons from holding it up as a standard and implying that, “if they can do it, so can you.”Carlston said she had been publicly out of the closet for about a month when the Weeds’ original blog post went viral in 2012. At least 10 different members of her church sent it to her “as if they had given me the panacea for my gayness,” she said. “I personally felt insulted and unheard, as none of those who had sent me the link had taken time to ask me what my experience had been like as a queer Mormon,” Carlston said. “Admittedly, the experience at the time was a bit humiliating. I had never found myself to be a lightning rod for folks to unleash their evangelizing before. It showed me a bit of what would lie ahead for me in the church: people who were uninformed or unconcerned about the realities and direness of the queer Mormon experience.”In November 2015, the Mormon church clarified its approach toward same-sex relationships with a series of policy changes. Mormons in same-sex relationships were declared apostates. The church also resolved that the children of these couples would not be allowed to be baptized until they were 18, at which point they would need to move out of their parents’ home and disavow their parents’ relationship to be considered for membership in the church.The church made its position on queer sexuality even clearer in 2016, when it updated a web page meant to serve as a resource for gay and lesbian Mormons and their allies. The website emphasized that the church believes it’s OK to be Mormon and gay ― as long as members don’t act out on what the church calls “same-sex attraction.” The page shares the stories of Mormons who identify as gay but have pledged to pursue a life of celibacy or who have committed themselves to mixed-orientation relationships. “Entering into a mixed-orientation marriage or remaining celibate were held up as the only acceptable goal to achieve throughout my youth and young adult life, and continue to be held up as the standard,” Carlston told HuffPost.In his post, Josh Weed wrote that this conservative religious approach toward queer sexuality was both cruel and dangerous. He said the church’s stance can fill queer Mormons with “self-loathing and internalized homophobia.”“The thing that is most cruel to religious LGBTQIA folks is not the lack of partners, but the lack of hope for a partner—that is the thing that makes them want to die,” he wrote. “Not the loneliness, per se, but the decades and decades before them with no hope of attachment.” “It is for this reason that comparisons of gay people to simply single people who have not married yet are so woefully lacking in nuance. I once heard the difference between these groups stated this way and it’s always stuck with me: single Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will fall in love with someone tomorrow; gay Mormons go to bed every night pleading with the Lord that they will never fall in love with someone.”He said that he and his wife have felt that God is calling them to separate from each other and pursue true love. They hope to continue raising their children together. The plan is to acquire a property that will accommodate their family and “the addition of future partners if that time comes.”He also said that he isn’t sure whether the Mormon church will continue to accept him or allow his two youngest children to be baptized if he ends up in a same-sex relationship. Still, he said he would like to be a part of the church, “though the institution itself might consider me an outsider,” he wrote. Five years ago, he said, he believed that a gay person could choose to live the life of a straight person. But now he knows that isn’t possible without serious consequences to mental health.Instead, he said he’s focusing on the things he can choose. “I can choose to love Lolly with every ounce of love a gay man can have for a woman. And I can choose to find a partner and love him as well, adoring him and attaching to him in the beautiful way I was always intended to.”If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

His job required cleaning freezers, and the cold temperatures exacerbated his ailment. DeVolid kept his other job at Walmart, where he earns $10 an hour moving carts 32 hours a week. But the change cut his annual income from $40,000 to $20,000, and he had to give up the health insurance benefits provided at Tyson’s. He figured it would only take a few weeks for his coverage to kick in at Walmart.But before it did, the husband and father of two suffered a severe heart attack, and had to undergo triple bypass surgery. Then there was a second surgery to drain the fluid surrounding his heart. He took six weeks off work to recover and was paid half his wages. The family quickly drained their $5,000 savings, and racked up $8,000 in debt ― and more medical bills are on the way. He has no idea where he’ll find the money to cover the rest of the costs. “It’s been rough on the whole family,” DeVolid told HuffPost while on his lunch break at his Walmart job. “I wouldn’t wish this on nobody.

Of those surveyed, just 39 percent of respondents said they’d be able to cover an unexpected $1,000 bill with funds from their savings. Most of the other respondents said they would have no choice but to accrue debt ― by paying with a credit card, borrowing from family and friends, or getting a loan. Medical bills are particularly foreboding. In 2016, medical expenses were the largest contributor to increasing the number of individuals living in poverty, according to a Census Bureau report. That year, 10.5 million people fell below the poverty line due to medical bills.“Medical expenses have long been a common path into financial ruin for Americans,” Ann Huff Stevens, deputy director of the Center for Poverty Research at UC Davis, told HuffPost. “Without health insurance, it is very easy to get into levels of debt that are impossible to recover from.”Struggling Americans may actually be able to afford far less than the Bankrate report suggests. According to a Federal Reserve report released last year, 44 percent of adults wouldn’t be able to afford an unexpected $400 emergency expense. They’d either borrow the money or sell something to cover the bill. That figure is on the decline, though. It’s dropped from 50 percent since 2013. To better protect against such unpredictable financial situations, Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial officer, recommends that everyone set aside some funds each month in a savings account, with the goal of having enough to cover three-to-six months’ worth of expenses.But for people who live paycheck-to-paycheck, allocating such a substantial amount of funds each month often isn’t possible.“It’s no shock that a very large percentage of Americans can’t cover an unexpected emergency expense, but the advice Bankrate offers ― ‘Be sure you save every month!’ ― smacks of ‘Let them eat cake,’” Keith Taylor, president of New York-based nonprofit Modest Needs Foundation, told HuffPost. “When you’re earning $2,400 a month, and your basic bills cost $2,285, what exactly is the person supposed to do?

The organization vets each case and pays money directly to the service provider, whether that be a hospital or an energy company, for example. Since launching the nonprofit in 2002, Taylor said not much has changed in terms of the amount of money his clients need. But what has changed is why people need that help. When he first started out, the majority of the requests focused on housing payments. Now it’s medical bills. Modest Needs hopes to collect about $1,300 for the DeVolids, which would cover two bills from Arkansas Hospital. The fundraiser won’t eliminate their debt, but it’s a start. The DeVolids never envisioned themselves needing handouts, and only solicited help from Modest Needs after exhausting their other options.“You can save, but there’s no way we would’ve been able to save for something like this ― even with two jobs,” said his wife Susan, who works in the accounts payable department at an Internet company and earns around $50,000 a year. “You just can’t when you have a family to support.”After his heart attack, the family purchased health insurance through COBRA, so that DeVolid would continue to be covered under his Tyson Foods health plan.

His job required cleaning freezers, and the cold temperatures exacerbated his ailment. DeVolid kept his other job at Walmart, where he earns $10 an hour moving carts 32 hours a week. But the change cut his annual income from $40,000 to $20,000, and he had to give up the health insurance benefits provided at Tyson’s. He figured it would only take a few weeks for his coverage to kick in at Walmart.But before it did, the husband and father of two suffered a severe heart attack, and had to undergo triple bypass surgery. Then there was a second surgery to drain the fluid surrounding his heart. He took six weeks off work to recover and was paid half his wages. The family quickly drained their $5,000 savings, and racked up $8,000 in debt ― and more medical bills are on the way. He has no idea where he’ll find the money to cover the rest of the costs. “It’s been rough on the whole family,” DeVolid told HuffPost while on his lunch break at his Walmart job. “I wouldn’t wish this on nobody.

Thank you,” Federer, cradling the Norman Brookes Cup, said with a quivering voice before breaking down in tears.The show of emotion triggered a standing ovation in the terraces, the tears spreading to his wife Mirka and parents in the players’ box.Tennis great Rod Laver, 79, snapped the moment on his mobile phone for posterity.Joining Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson as the only men to win six Australian Open trophies, Federer also emulated Laver by winning his fourth grand slam title after his 30th birthday.“It is a different emotion, clearly. The first (grand slam title) is like ‘oh my god! I was able to win one’. The rest now doesn’t really matter at this point,” Federer told host broadcaster Channel Seven in front of hundreds of fans at Melbourne Park’s Garden Square.“This one here tonight reminded me more of maybe the 2006 win when I beat (Marcos) Baghdatis in the finals.“I had a great run to the finals (in 2006) and was a huge favorite going in ... I was just so relieved when everything was said and done I think I felt the same way tonight.“That is why I couldn’t speak, it was terrible.”Having qualified for an astonishing 30th grand slam final, Federer admitted that nerves had got the better of him during a scorching hot day as he waited to take his place for the evening match.“My thoughts were all over the place. All day I was thinking ‘What if I lost? What if I won?’ Every minute of the day,” he said. “Thank God I slept to 11.”The nerves returned for the Swiss at several stages through the three-hour three-minute clash, and he felt the trophy slipping from his grasp after the fourth set.He had to save two break points in an epic service game at the start of the fifth set before riding the momentum home as Cilic’s power game wavered.“At the end of the second (set) I got nervous and that is the reason I lost the second set and I couldn’t take control of the match,” added Federer.“It got tight and Marin held me out in the third and the fifth. I got lucky tonight.”(Editing by Pritha Sarkar)"

But the president backed off once the White House Counsel Don McGahn threatened to resign, the Times reported.Trump has denied the story, calling it “fake news.” Short, in his Sunday comments, said he’s unsure what Trump would do if Congress passed a bill to protect the status of the special counsel, which would make it harder ― or almost impossible ― for the president to try to remove Mueller.Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) noted on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Trump cannot directly fire Mueller. He would have to pressure deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to do so.She said that at a Senate hearing last year, she questioned Rosenstein “at length on this issue, and he was adamant that he would never give in to any White House pressure to remove” Mueller.Asked about the Times story, she said, “the president had a bad idea” on firing Mueller. “He talked with his counsel, who explained to an angry and frustrated president why it was a bad idea, and that was seven months ago.”Short was somewhat dismissive of Mueller’s probe, saying “taxpayers have spent millions and millions of dollars on investigations [that have] not proven any collusion thus far” between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign.The White House, he added, “continues to cooperate in every manner providing any document the special counsel has asked for. We have continued to comply fully.” Still, Short said, “I know the president has been frustrated by this investigation.”Short said that Trump’s also agitated by the unwillingness of the House Intelligence Committee to release a four-page classified memo that reportedly suggests FBI officials may have used politically motivated sourcing to justify a request for a secret surveillance warrant in the Russia probe’s early stages.Confirming a report from The Washington Post, Short said Trump believes the memo should be made public. This is at direct odds with advice from the Justice Department, which said it would be “extraordinarily reckless” to release the memo. “Those are rational concerns,” said Short. “At the same time, I think the president is more inclined for transparency in this investigation.”"

The announcement from Attorney General Eric Schneiderman follows an in-depth New York Times investigation into Devumi, which it alleges has sold automated followers to politicians, celebrities and other public figures, often using the names, pictures and personal details of real people on those bot accounts.If the accusations prove true, Schneiderman tweeted, Devumi may be found guilty of impersonation and deception. The violations alleged in the Times, he added, unfairly allow people with money to buy “apparent influence.”Devumi, which the Times described as trafficking in “counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence,” advertises on its website that $10 will buy customers at least 500 Twitter followers in one to two days. For $49, it guarantees 10 times that number in two weeks or less. The firm also offers other forms of online social currency, such as retweets and video views. Customers run the gamut. The Times named China Xinhua News, the country’s state-run news agency; Michael Dell, the computer billionaire; Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Lenín Moreno, president of Ecuador; and a slew of actors, athletes, reality stars and other public figures. Devumi did not immediately return a request for comment on Schneiderman’s investigation. Meanwhile, social media giants, Facebook and Twitter in particular, face immense scrutiny as they struggle to protect their users from the misinformation spreading on their platforms. While the federal government continues to probes Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, Facebook admitted in September that an operation likely based in Russia had spent $100,000 on thousands of U.S. ads on its platform promoting divisive social and political messages in a two-year period leading up to May 2017.

One woman, who was not identified in the BuzzFeed story, accused Piven of grabbing her by the arms and trying to kiss her in his hotel room around 1994. Another woman, an extra on the 1990s sitcom “Ellen,” in which Piven co-starred, said the actor exposed himself, pinned her on his bed and forcefully kissed her while giving her a tour of his home in 1996.Susan McCain Olson, an extra in the 1986 film “Lucas,” told BuzzFeed that Piven, who played a school bully in that movie, followed her into a trailer on the set, pinned her down on a sofa and forcefully kissed her.“At one point I kind of was like, ‘This is it, this is where I’m going to get raped,’” McCain Olson told BuzzFeed. “I kept trying to push him away. I was like, ‘No, get off me.’”Piven steadfastly denied the new allegations, noting in a statement to BuzzFeed that he had passed a polygraph test in which he said he had never forced himself on anyone nor exposed himself to anyone or restrained anyone against their will.Evan Spiegel, Piven’s attorney, called the allegations “simply not true” in a statement to HuffPost on Sunday.“As has been previously reported, to help prove that the allegations against him are not credible and that the media cannot rely on these people’s unverified stories, Mr. Piven previously provided polygraph results to BuzzFeed and other outlets to support his denials,” Spiegel said.Piven was first publicly accused of sexual misconduct in early October 2017 by actress Ariane Bellamar, who tweeted that he had groped her in his trailer on the “Entourage” set in 2005. Weeks later, actress Cassidy Freeman accused him of “predatory behavior” in an Instagram post.In November, BuzzFeed reported on three other women accusing Piven of sexual misconduct, including one who alleged that he’d grabbed her breasts without consent on the set of “Entourage” in 2009.

Trump was elected to the U.S. presidency later the same year.When asked if May was in a “good position” regarding the ongoing Brexit talks, Trump replied: “Would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn’t negotiate it the way it’s negotiated ... I would have had a different attitude.”Pressed on how his approach would be different, he said: “I would have said the European Union is not cracked up to what it’s supposed to be. I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out.”May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his inauguration in January last year and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands.But the “special relationship” between the two nations has since faced several ups and downs, including Trump rebuking May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.He said in an earlier extract from the same interview that he had not intended to cause offense in Britain by sharing the videos and that he would apologize if the original posters were horrible racists.Trump’s comments on militant attacks in Britain have angered some and he has often exchanged barbs on social media with London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Trump also said in the interview that he had anticipated the Brexit referendum result because of many Britons’ concerns over immigration ― also a key plank of his U.S. election campaign.“I said because of trade, but mostly immigration, Brexit is going to be a big upset. And I was right,” he said. “I know the British people and understand them.”“They don’t want people coming from all over the world into Britain, they don’t know anything about these people.”Trump also said he had been invited by May to make two visits to Britain this year.Earlier this month, he canceled a trip to London to open a new embassy, saying he did not want to endorse a bad deal agreed by the Obama administration to sell the old one for “peanuts.” Some Britons are angry at the prospect of a visit by Trump, with large protests expected when he does arrive.Asked in the interview if he had been invited to the wedding of Britain’s Prince Harry and his American fiancee Meghan Markle, Trump said: “Not that I know of.”He declined to say if he would like to attend the wedding at Windsor Castle but added: “I want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy.“They look like a lovely couple.”(Reporting by Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Catherine Evans)"

In his letter, McTaggart explains why MPR cut ties with Keillor and answered questions sent to the station in response to his firing, including ones accusing MPR of tarnishing Keillor’s reputation.“Listeners smelled a rat,” Keillor wrote in his statement, which was sent to HuffPost and published on his website. “Listeners know me far better than MPR management does and they know I’m not abusive.”MPR fired Keillor in November and launched an investigation after a woman who worked on his show, “A Prairie Home Companion,” accused him of acting inappropriately. Keillor later told Minnesota’s Star Tribune that the claim stemmed from an incident in which he “accidentally” put his hand on the woman’s bare back. In his statement, Keillor accused MPR’s management ― which he referred to as “McTaggart” and “his committee of faceless people who are in a panic” ― of failing to meet with him in person to talk about the accusations. If they had done so, Keillor wrote, “this all would’ve been avoided.”Keillor also claimed his accuser was “a friend” who was employed by him, not by MPR, and worked from home as a freelance researcher. He also accused her of signing off on her emails by writing, “I love you.”“Our friendship ― which was mutual, reciprocal and respectful ― continued in frequent emails about our kids and travel and family things that continued to my last show and beyond,” Keillor wrote. “She signed her emails ‘I love you’ and she asked if her daughter could be hired to work here, and so forth,” he added.This week, MPR News published an investigative report on Keillor that suggested the host did far more than place his hand on a woman’s back.The report claims Keillor wrote and displayed a suggestive poem about an employee in his bookstore, sent $16,000 and a confidentiality agreement to a subordinate he was romantically involved with, and told a 21-year-old student in his writing class that he was intensely attracted to her. It also revealed a 1998 lawsuit filed against MPR by a former employee who claimed Keillor discriminated against her based on her age and gender.The report did not include information on the incident which resulted in MPR firing Keillor.In his statement, Keillor called the woman’s complaint “a highly selective and imaginative piece of work” and said he would write of this experience in a novel.“If I am guilty of harassment, then every employee who stole a pencil is guilty of embezzlement,” Keillor wrote. “I’m an honest fiction writer and I will tell this story in a novel.”"

Others including Janelle Monáe sported a black-and-white Time’s Up pin in a show of solidarity with the initiative. “It represents hope and peace and sympathy and resistance, and I thought those were very lovely things for every human to encompass and to also share with others,” singer Kelly Clarkson said on the red carpet about the symbolism of the white rose.A group called Voices in Entertainment came up with the idea for celebrities to wear white roses on the red carpet. The group includes over a dozen women in entertainment including Meg Harkins, senior vice president of marketing at Roc Nation, and Karen Rait, head of rhythmic promotion at Interscope/Geffen/A&M Records. “We choose the white rose because historically it stands for hope, peace, sympathy and resistance,” the group wrote in a recent letter to celebrities.“Women make up 51 percent of the workforce and it’s about time that we’re paid equal,” singer Cyndi Lauper said on the red carpet. “Equality and power in the workforce would help not just women but men too.” The Time’s Up pin, which many celebrities also wore at the Golden Globes, was created by actress Reese Witherspoon and stylist Arianne Phillips in December. Phillips told The Hollywood Reporter that the idea for the pins came out of an initial Time’s Up brainstorming meeting with actresses, producers and others in the industry. “I met so many great women, and it was such an honor to be called to action,” Phillips said. The Time’s Up initiative, which was announced on New Year’s Day, consists of more than 300 women in television, film and theater. The project, inspired by the #MeToo movement, hopes to combat sexual misconduct in all workplaces by creating a legal defense fund to help less-privileged women come forward with their stories. "

The Rev. Dr. Chloe Breyer, executive director of the Interfaith Center of New York, told HuffPost she hoped the action provided a feeling of safety and security for the worshippers, many of whom were students from nearby New York University.“It’s practically important and symbolically important to stand with people of different faith traditions,” Breyer said. “It’s what we should do as Americans.”The rally at the square on Friday was an echo of what took place in the same location last January, when up to a thousand protesters gathered the night before the first travel ban was issued to voice frustration with Trump’s plans. The president issued the order on immigration on Jan. 27, 2017, but was forced to issue two revised versions after court challenges. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the third version of the ban. All three iterations placed restrictions on citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. A watered-down version of the ban went into effect in June and expired in October. Trump also drastically cut America’s refugee admissions quota to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year ― the lowest it’s ever been.Tamara Ilias, a Syrian refugee who spoke at Friday’s rally, told HuffPost she was shocked when she first heard about the travel ban. After fleeing civil war in Syria, she said her family lived in Lebanon for one year, waiting to be reunited with relatives in New York. The Lebanese government places restrictions on Syrian refugees’ ability to live and work in the country. She said her four children were unable to attend school, like many other refugee kids in Lebanon.With the help of Catholic Charities’ refugee resettlement program, Ilias and her family were able to resettle in New York last May. Now, she’s speaking up for the many others waiting in limbo in Lebanon.“There are many people like me,” Ilias told HuffPost. “I’m lucky, I’m here. But many people are waiting, many people need help. Many people have families, have kids. It’s not easy, it’s so hard.”Trump’s drastic cuts to refugee admissions came at a time when an unprecedented 65 million people are displaced worldwide, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency. Murad Awawdeh, vice president of advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, one of the groups that organized the rally, said that in the months that followed the ban, the Trump administration’s attacks on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and those with temporary protected status betrayed an anti-immigrant agenda. Although he said the initial fervor around protesting the travel ban has died down since last January, Awawdeh hopes Friday’s rally shows that there’s much work left to do.“The Trump administration didn’t just go after the Muslims. They were the first targets,” Awawdeh said. “This is going to continue to be a fight and a struggle.”"

Teal is the official color of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, which occurs in April, according to the National Violence Resource Center.MSU beat the University of Wisconsin, 76-61.Over 140 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. After dozens of women delivered emotional statements in court, Nassar, 54, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for child sexual abuse this week. Some students channeled Raisman’s fierce words to Nassar ― “You are nothing” ― by printing the statement on their apparel.Raisman, who revealed in November that she was also a victim, expressed her disgust with Nassar last week in court.“Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” the Olympic gymnast told the doctor.“The tables have turned, Larry. We are here, and we are not going anywhere.”In the wake of Nassar’s sentencing, MSU has faced its own firestorm of criticism. The university’s president, Lou Anna Simon, and athletic director, Mark Hollis, have succumbed to the pressure and resigned this week.Nassar’s victims blame Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics for enabling the doctor to treat athletes even after allegations of abuse were reported.Over the course of two decades, eight young women say they told at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives about Nassar’s sexual abuse, yet university officials did nothing to stop him, The Detroit News reported last week. Simon told Detroit News that she learned about abuse compliants against Nassar in 2014, when a Title IX complaint and police report were filed.The university didn’t officially fire Nassar until September 2016."

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) is slated to provide her own nationally televised response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday.Waters will deliver her remarks on the BET program “Angela Rye’s State of the Union,” according to a report by BuzzFeed News. Waters’ speech is not part of the Democratic Party’s official response to the president, which is due to be delivered by Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.).It is nonetheless likely to make a splash thanks to Waters’ large internet following. Waters ― or “Auntie Maxine,” as she is affectionately known ― has become a viral sensation thanks to her fierce and colorful denunciations of Trump and her confrontations with administration officials.Waters, the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, famously grilled Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin about an unanswered letter during a July hearing. Dissatisfied with Mnuchin’s explanations, Waters repeatedly interrupted him to inform him that she was “reclaiming my time” ― a refrain that has since become an internet meme and feminist rallying cry.Waters is a passionate advocate for Trump’s impeachment. In a keynote speech at the Women’s Convention, an October gathering in Detroit, Michigan, sponsored by organizers of the Women’s March, Waters dubbed Trump the “most dishonorable and despicable” president ever and led the crowd in chants of “impeach 45.”"

Or worse.,2018-01-27,"President Donald Trump signs the first ban, Jan. 27, 2017. It barred travel from Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, suspected the refugee resettlement program for 120 days and indefinitely banned the entry of Syrian refugees.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a69b30a2d00004900942c20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It feels like just yesterday that a collective revolt surged in opposition to the signing of President Donald Trump’s first travel ban, enacted one year ago Saturday. To those it has affected directly, however, the last year has felt like a lifetime ― one in which a fresh start in the United States represented their last resort.Trump enacted three different travel bans in 2017. All three banned travel from citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. The first two also suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days.Implemented for a few days, sometimes a few weeks or months, the three bans were all in some form temporarily dismantled in federal court, with the latest version heading to the Supreme Court. In June, a watered-down version of the ban did go into effect, keeping people out unless they could prove a “bona-fide relationship” to a U.S. person or entity. That expired in October, when the Trump administration also slashed the annual resettlement quota from 110,000 to 45,000, the lowest it’s ever been in U.S. history.These repeated attempts to shut out the needy, along with the chaos that’s ensued, have cast a long-lasting shadow on the resettlement program. They’ve left tens of thousands of the world’s most vulnerable people fighting for survival in foreign lands they’re not welcome in.“They don’t really have other options for safety,” said Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for Church World Service’s Immigration and Refugee program. Niloufar Cheteian, 27, an Iranian Kurdish refugee, fled to Turkey in 2012 in an attempt to escape persecution as an ethnic minority. In 2015, she found out that the U.S. would be interviewing her as part of its refugee resettlement program. She did two rounds of preliminary interviews, but then abruptly received notice about 10 months ago that her case had been denied, she told HuffPost. She appealed, and it was denied again.Officials refused to offer an explanation as to why, even though her case closely resembles that of other Iranian refugees who have successfully been resettled in America (including her sister and brother-in-law).She can’t go back to Iran, she said, because she faces detention and torture as a non-Persian. She also fears repercussions from her recent divorce, explaining that her ex-husband’s family has threatened to harm her should they split up.Yet she conceded that the situation is Turkey is equally hopeless. She hides out in the home she shares with other Iranian and Syrian refugees, afraid of emerging in public because gangs of young men have beaten her numerous times in the street, leaving her with scars on her chest. “To be a woman, to be a refugee, to be a Kurd are very serious crimes here,” she said. Cheteian no longer has a source of income aside from remittances from her U.S.-based family members. Like many other refugees living in Turkey, she had been working under the table for a textile manufacturing company until her employer stopped paying her. “I kept asking and begging him but he denied that I worked for him,” she said.Facing a total impasse, Cheteian considered paying a smuggler to send her onto the shores of Greece in a rubber dinghy ― a journey more than 1 million people have taken since 2015, but one that thousands didn’t survive. The cost, plus stories of friends who perished at sea, stopped her. “The refugees here say I should have at least $13,000 if I want to safely arrive in Germany or other counties,” she noted. “Even if I go to European countries I am not sure that they would accept me and recognize my case since many refugees have been deported in recent months.”Two other refugees HuffPost spoke with also mused about attempting the crossing into Greece, including Abbas Mohammed, 26, an Iranian LGBTQ refugee whose name was changed in this article because of security concerns. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services canceled his second resettlement interview on multiple occasions following the first travel ban. He hasn’t heard back from the agency since last August.“If USCIS officers don’t come [to Turkey] earlier than November I have to go [to Europe] because the weather will be worse after that,” he had said in July. “Right now one smuggler has agreed to take me there for $200.”He conceded, though, that it was a “dead end” solution. “Borders are closed and there is not any way for us to leave here,” he said. He wondered if he’d have to resort to prostitution to continue supporting himself while he holds out hope for an eventual response from the U.S. As of this week, Mohammed remains in Turkey.Both Cheteian and Mohammed also said they’ve contemplated suicide.“No country is taking me, I have no way to go forward and no way to go back,” Cheteian said. “I am an international orphan.”Kamal Hazbawi, 41, another Iranian refugee, is facing a deportation order from Turkish authorities. He expects to be tortured or executed if they send him back to Iran, he said, and the U.S. halted his resettlement process last July. He said he emailed the U.S. officers he’d already communicated with on Wednesday about his pending deportation. They responded, but told him there was nothing they could do. “I don’t know what to do. I’m really stressed and confused,” he said. The order to deport only affects him, meaning he’d be leaving his wife and three young children behind if he gets taken away.More than 3.7 million refugees ― mainly Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans, Iranians and Somalis ― currently languish in Turkey, according to European Union statistics. Another 18.8 million people are refugees worldwide, more than half of whom are under the age of 18.The U.S. once exerted global leadership over the legal resettlement process, taking in more refugees through the resettlement pipeline than any other country. While the numbers always represented a mere drop in the bucket, it’s a legacy, tied to the ethos of the country’s founding that many hold dear.“We have always led on the issue of refugees, we’ve done that because it is part of who we are as Americans,” Ryan Crocker, a former ambassador and dean and executive professor at the George Bush School of Government & Public Service at Texas A&M University, said on a press call. “It’s right there on the Statue of Liberty. Virtually all of us came here from somewhere else.”Even though the quota for this fiscal year is 45,000, the administration has only resettled a little over 6,000 refugees since the start of October, according to State Department data.“We’re already well into the second quarter,” Smyers said. “That’s less than half the amount of refugees we’d have to be resettling to keep pace with that 45,000 number.”The International Rescue Committee predicts that only 15,000 people will get resettled by the end of the fiscal year ― a 72 percent drop from the year before.Smyers added that she wouldn’t be surprised if a new ban is in the cards. The third ban, proclaimed on Oct. 24, expired last week (even though it had been enjoined in federal court anyway). “Will [a new ban] be as direct, or will it be one of these more cunning ways of damaging the program through 1,000 cuts?” she wondered.

The government’s latest efforts to curb illegal logging and deforestation have been hampered by poor law enforcement, high-level corruption and the state’s own crackdown on its environmental critics. And as Phnom Penh grants companies economic land concessions ― or long-term land leases ― to establish rubber and palm oil plantations, local community members have found themselves on a daunting mission to protect what remains of their beloved forests.An investigative report by U.K.-based NGO Global Witness describes a “multi-million dollar black-market trade” through which loggers are granted safe passage and immunity from penalties to smuggle Cambodian rosewood to China. At the helm of this reported operation is tycoon Try Pheap, an associate of the prime minister. Hun Sen has lashed out against a cascade of damning accusations by local media and watchdogs like Global Witness, once calling the anti-graft organization ignorant, stupid and “crazy.” But an official probe last year also found that dozens of Cambodian police officers, military personnel and senior state officials accepted bribes to assist Vietnamese timber smugglers. The Environmental Investigation Agency doubled down on these allegations months later, reporting that approximately 300,000 cubic meters of logs had been smuggled out of the country with the help of Cambodian authorities and laundered in Vietnam in less than a year, to the tune of more than $13 million.These illicit networks have had devastating ramifications in Cambodia, where rural poor and indigenous communities have relied on forested areas as a vital source of income for thousands of years. With one of the highest rates of tree cover loss in the world, the country saw nearly 2 million hectares, or 20 percent of its forests, diminish between 2001 and 2016. Satellite images from NASA show the drastic transformation over time. Cambodia’s Environment Ministry in Phnom Penh dismissed the data as “incitement” by NASA and an attempt at “confusing the public with the desire to criticize the government.” But analysts point to an alarming trend that places the future of Cambodia’s forest ecosystems ― and the communities who depend of them for their livelihoods ― in jeopardy.“At the rate Cambodia has been going, it’s losing over 1 percent of its total forest every year. You can’t do that indefinitely,” Nancy Harris, research manager for Global Forest Watch, told HuffPost. “Over the 1990s and 2000s a lot of illegal logging happened and so there’s now very little intact primary forest, compared to what there used to be,” she added. “Right now it’s just sort of the Wild West.”Officials at the Environment Ministry, which manages Cambodia’s protected areas, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.“This is a country whose natural resources are being rapidly depleted,” Emma Burnett, a senior campaigner with Global Witness, told HuffPost.“Rather than the profits from the sale of those resources being channeled through the national treasury and into public services ... they’re being creamed off by high-ranking politicians and their business partners and used to consolidate wealth and power on the part of the regime,” she said.“Then you have these people on the ground, the Prey Lang community, who are really desperately trying to preserve their livelihoods and their way of life. It’s a bit of a David and Goliath story, really.”The grassroots movement to protect Cambodian forests has seen activists and journalists killed in recent years. Members of a campaign known as the Prey Lang Community Network try to document and prevent illegal logging and the timber-smuggling trade in the vast Prey Lang Forest, which spans four northern provinces.Watch the 360 GlobalBeat video below to follow members of the PLCN deep into the forest as they patrol the region for illegal loggers.Saddled on motorbikes and equipped with smartphones to report offenders, hundreds of PLCN patrollers scour the forests for days at a time, several times each month. Many belong to indigenous minority groups who rely on forest resources, although the government has urged them to become less dependent.Speaking in 2015 about economic land concession grants, Environment Minister Say Samal said Cambodia was trying to “develop our agriculture industry to create jobs for our people, so hopefully they don’t have to depend on the forests anymore.” Instead, he suggested, they should “depend on something else, like a skill.”The government has barred the PLCN from conducting independent excursions, but many patrollers reject the ban. The network, which has won several international awards including the UNDP Equator Initiative Prize, describes its process on its website:When PLCN members encounter loggers during patrols, the first step is to initiate a peaceful dialogue with them. We then check whether they have logging permits. If they do not, which is usually the case, we inform them about the destructive effects of logging on the forest and communities.“The Prey Lang Community Network are people who love the forest. Our network is not supported by the government, so we work as volunteers,” Phai Bunleang, the defacto PLCN leader for Kratie Province, told an NYU reporting team. “It is difficult to monitor the Prey Lang because it is huge. There are many roads deep inside the forest, and we have limited volunteers.”Confronting illegal loggers can be an extremely perilous task for the under-resourced and sometimes outnumbered group. In 2016, PLCN activist Phorn Sopheak was attacked with a machete and seriously injured while on patrol.“They were all young illegal loggers. When they attacked, they chose the person closest to them. Unfortunately, that happened to be me,” she recalled to NYU reporters in March.In 2012, a military police officer fatally shot environmental investigator Chut Wutty. The activist was showing an illegal logging operation to journalists in southern Cambodia when he was killed.Even when PLCN patrollers or police make arrests in the forest, they’re often not catching the true culprit, according to Fred Stolle, a senior associate with World Resources Institute.“They catch the guy with the chainsaw, but he’s just the guy who was hired by the company, and the police don’t go further than that,” Stolle told HuffPost. “It’s very difficult to figure out who is paying people to cut trees, because middlemen use middlemen, and so on.”Although protecting the Prey Lang is both dangerous and exhausting, Phai Bunleang believes it is a necessary endeavor. He is hopeful, but not optimistic, for more support from the government.“It’s regrettable when the PLCN works hard as volunteers ― independent and without pay, spending our own money and energy ― that this is still going on,” he said.But for Cambodia’s forests, time is running out. Experts warn that the rate of deforestation is “massively unsustainable” as timber smuggling networks prevail. “It goes to show how deeply entrenched corruption is in the forestry sector,” said Burnett. “There have been efforts over the years to try to crack down on this stuff, but politics just pedals in the opposite direction.”"

The Environmental Investigation Agency doubled down on these allegations months later, reporting that approximately 300,000 cubic meters of logs had been smuggled out of the country with the help of Cambodian authorities and laundered in Vietnam in less than a year, to the tune of more than $13 million.These illicit networks have had devastating ramifications in Cambodia, where rural poor and indigenous communities have relied on forested areas as a vital source of income for thousands of years. With one of the highest rates of tree cover loss in the world, the country saw nearly 2 million hectares, or 20 percent of its forests, diminish between 2001 and 2016. Satellite images from NASA show the drastic transformation over time. Cambodia’s Environment Ministry in Phnom Penh dismissed the data as “incitement” by NASA and an attempt at “confusing the public with the desire to criticize the government.” But analysts point to an alarming trend that places the future of Cambodia’s forest ecosystems ― and the communities who depend of them for their livelihoods ― in jeopardy.“At the rate Cambodia has been going, it’s losing over 1 percent of its total forest every year. You can’t do that indefinitely,” Nancy Harris, research manager for Global Forest Watch, told HuffPost. “Over the 1990s and 2000s a lot of illegal logging happened and so there’s now very little intact primary forest, compared to what there used to be,” she added. “Right now it’s just sort of the Wild West.”Officials at the Environment Ministry, which manages Cambodia’s protected areas, did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.“This is a country whose natural resources are being rapidly depleted,” Emma Burnett, a senior campaigner with Global Witness, told HuffPost.“Rather than the profits from the sale of those resources being channeled through the national treasury and into public services ... they’re being creamed off by high-ranking politicians and their business partners and used to consolidate wealth and power on the part of the regime,” she said.“Then you have these people on the ground, the Prey Lang community, who are really desperately trying to preserve their livelihoods and their way of life. It’s a bit of a David and Goliath story, really.”The grassroots movement to protect Cambodian forests has seen activists and journalists killed in recent years. Members of a campaign known as the Prey Lang Community Network try to document and prevent illegal logging and the timber-smuggling trade in the vast Prey Lang Forest, which spans four northern provinces.Watch the 360 GlobalBeat video below to follow members of the PLCN deep into the forest as they patrol the region for illegal loggers.Saddled on motorbikes and equipped with smartphones to report offenders, hundreds of PLCN patrollers scour the forests for days at a time, several times each month. Many belong to indigenous minority groups who rely on forest resources, although the government has urged them to become less dependent.Speaking in 2015 about economic land concession grants, Environment Minister Say Samal said Cambodia was trying to “develop our agriculture industry to create jobs for our people, so hopefully they don’t have to depend on the forests anymore.” Instead, he suggested, they should “depend on something else, like a skill.”The government has barred the PLCN from conducting independent excursions, but many patrollers reject the ban. The network, which has won several international awards including the UNDP Equator Initiative Prize, describes its process on its website:When PLCN members encounter loggers during patrols, the first step is to initiate a peaceful dialogue with them. We then check whether they have logging permits. If they do not, which is usually the case, we inform them about the destructive effects of logging on the forest and communities.“The Prey Lang Community Network are people who love the forest. Our network is not supported by the government, so we work as volunteers,” Phai Bunleang, the defacto PLCN leader for Kratie Province, told an NYU reporting team. “It is difficult to monitor the Prey Lang because it is huge. There are many roads deep inside the forest, and we have limited volunteers.”Confronting illegal loggers can be an extremely perilous task for the under-resourced and sometimes outnumbered group. In 2016, PLCN activist Phorn Sopheak was attacked with a machete and seriously injured while on patrol.“They were all young illegal loggers. When they attacked, they chose the person closest to them. Unfortunately, that happened to be me,” she recalled to NYU reporters in March.In 2012, a military police officer fatally shot environmental investigator Chut Wutty. The activist was showing an illegal logging operation to journalists in southern Cambodia when he was killed.Even when PLCN patrollers or police make arrests in the forest, they’re often not catching the true culprit, according to Fred Stolle, a senior associate with World Resources Institute.“They catch the guy with the chainsaw, but he’s just the guy who was hired by the company, and the police don’t go further than that,” Stolle told HuffPost. “It’s very difficult to figure out who is paying people to cut trees, because middlemen use middlemen, and so on.”Although protecting the Prey Lang is both dangerous and exhausting, Phai Bunleang believes it is a necessary endeavor. He is hopeful, but not optimistic, for more support from the government.“It’s regrettable when the PLCN works hard as volunteers ― independent and without pay, spending our own money and energy ― that this is still going on,” he said.But for Cambodia’s forests, time is running out. Experts warn that the rate of deforestation is “massively unsustainable” as timber smuggling networks prevail. “It goes to show how deeply entrenched corruption is in the forestry sector,” said Burnett. “There have been efforts over the years to try to crack down on this stuff, but politics just pedals in the opposite direction.”"
57,POLITICS,EPA Chief Under Nixon And Reagan: GOP’s Climate Denial Is 'Killing Everything',Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ruckelshaus-climate-gop_us_5a6b96f1e4b06e25326783fd,"William Ruckelshaus, the first and fifth EPA administrator, has been a fierce critic of Scott Pruitt.",2018-01-27,"Then-President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to William Ruckelshaus, the first and fifth Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, during an East Room ceremony on Nov. 24, 2015, at the White House.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6b97db2d00001f00942ea8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The nation’s first Environmental Protection Agency chief, who returned as administrator in 1983 under President Ronald Reagan, excoriated his own party on Friday, warning that Republicans’ ideological opposition to widely-accepted climate science would prove lethal. “It’s a threat to the country,” William Ruckelshaus, whom President Richard Nixon appointed in 1970 to lead the newly-created EPA, told HuffPost in a wide-ranging interview by phone from his home in Seattle. “If you don’t step up and take care of real problems, and don’t do anything about it, lives will be sacrificed.” “They certainly are killing everything,” he added, noting that President Donald Trump’s assault on climate change policies would be a cornerstone of his legacy. Ruckelshaus, 85, has emerged over the past year as a fierce critic of current EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.In March, less than a month after Pruitt was sworn into office, Ruckelshaus cautioned the former Oklahoma attorney general against gutting regulations and coddling polluting industries. He compared Pruitt’s zeal for deregulation to Anne Gorsuch, Reagan’s first EPA administrator, whom Ruckelshaus replaced after she resigned and was held in contempt of Congress. On Friday, he again drew parallels between the two. “They don’t believe in the mission of the agency,” he said, adding that Pruitt is the only EPA administrator he has never met. “Neither one of them did. Anne Gorsuch did not, and I don’t think Pruitt does either. They think we’re over-regulating.”But he said now, even more than in the early 1980s, Pruitt’s radical view of the agency he leads represents the partisan dogma of the moment. The Republican Party inched toward serious action on climate change in the mid-2000s. John McCain, the GOP presidential nominee in 2008, called for renewable energy investments, caps on greenhouse gas emissions and subsidies for electric cars, though he supported aggressive oil drilling and remained skeptical of joining international agreements like the Kyoto Protocol. During the Obama years, the billionaire brothers behind fossil fuel giant Koch Industries became political kingmakers in the Republican Party, and engineered an ideological shift toward climate change denial.Even now, Republicans who acknowledge the basic realities of climate science are few and far between, and radical new megadonors, such as Robert and Rebekah Mercer, are funding some of the most fringe climate-denial proponents.“To a certain extent, the Republican position for years now, really starting with Gorsuch, has been ideologically antagonistic to these kinds of controls over industry,” Ruckelshaus said. “Republicans tend to spend more time on economic impacts of what they’re doing than Democrats, but they were all serious about it, and they didn’t think it was nonsense.”“Pruitt has already had success ― ideological success ― because he seems to be complying with the wishes of the Republican Party,” he added. Last week, three former EPA administrators told HuffPost it could take decades for the next agency chief to restore the staffing, reputation and regulatory muscle lost under Pruitt. Carol Browner, who served as administrator under President Bill Clinton from 1993 to 2001, said it would take up to 20 or 30 years. When Ruckelshaus returned to the EPA in 1983, employees greeted him with a banner proclaiming: “How do you spell relief? Ruckelshaus,” according to a New York Times report from 1984. He increased the eviscerated budget and revitalized morale, earning him the nickname “Mr. Clean.” Doing the same after Pruitt, and reversing some of his regulatory decisions, could take a matter of years. He said reconsidering rejected pesticide bans, installing advisers who take air pollution science seriously, and reviving climate change regulations akin to the Clean Power Plan that Pruitt proposed repealing would be critical first steps.Restoring trust in the agency could prove a greater challenge, he said.“The agency would have to open up completely,” Ruckelshaus said. “Not just surreptitiously reinstating what the Trump administration took away.”As an example, he pointed to Gina McCarthy, the Obama-era administrator who, in 2014, toured oil-rich states like North Dakota as a “listener and a saleswoman,” saying she had to be “everywhere” because “people have to have a relationship with me.” From his own experience, Ruckelshaus recalled the well-known case of a copper smelter outside Seattle, which blamed its closure on EPA regulations, despite being slated to shut down before new arsenic rules were passed. Ruckelshaus said he countered the company’s claims by going public.“We had very public hearings, TV cameras were there, and everyone was hearing what was going on,” he said. To be sure, the toxic legacy of that smelter lives on three decades later, as residents of Tacoma, Washington, still struggle with lead and arsenic exposure. And Ruckelshaus’ calls for more debate on the merits of regulating sulfur dioxide, the cause of acid rain, delayed clean-up efforts until the next administration. “I did all that I could,” he said. “I don’t tend to think back on those kinds of assignments and think of the things I didn’t do. But I was not successful in grasping acid rain.” Yet he warned that climate change poses a much more complex challenge than acid rain ― and one that will become more difficult to deal with as key agencies like the EPA lose scientists researching the problem. “If your position is, ‘I don’t believe the science, therefore I’m going to get rid of all the scientists studying this, and let’s not mention it in any public announcement,’ that’s just crazy,” Ruckelshaus said. “ What you want to do is more science.” That, however, may have to wait for the next administration. “I don’t think Pruitt cares about this stuff at all,” Ruckelshaus said. “He’s just like Trump, he’s got an ideological approach to it, an approach that affects the large contributors in his party in Oklahoma.” "
58,IMPACT,What Happens When One Of The World's Biggest Cities Doesn't Recycle,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shanghai-informal-recyclers_us_5a537b92e4b0efe47ebadf88,"In Shanghai, an army of secret recyclers has been credited with keeping mountains of trash out of the city's landfills.",2018-01-27,"Mr. Wang, an informal recycler, pays another recycler for delivering a washing machine in Shanghai. Recyclers like Mr. Wang have been credited with keeping a significant amount of trash out of Shanghai's landfills.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a5790f2200000c22e57d9a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"SHANGHAI — On a narrow side street in a leafy residential neighborhood, a man who identified himself only as Mr. Wang piles large appliances onto his flat-bed truck. Stacking them higher than would seem physically possible, he expertly balances rusty washing machines atop old industrial fridges, tightly strapping them down so they don’t topple. Men on motorbikes and a few women arrive in the alley, carting their unwieldy machines, which Mr. Wang packs onto his truck, arranging and rearranging his mound like an expert Tetris player. Mr. Wang parks his truck at this spot almost every day, from early morning to late afternoon, collecting items that would otherwise be sent to a landfill or incinerator. He’s one of Shanghai’s thousands of informal recyclers, a citywide network of unlicensed workers, mostly migrants, who experts and locals alike say have done far more to recycle Shanghai’s waste than has the government or any formalized system. “It’s invaluable what these guys have done to reduce the trash in the city,” said Richard Brubaker, an environmental activist and founder of Collective Responsibility, a Shanghai-based sustainability consultancy. “Two out of five of Shanghai’s landfills are already filled today. The other three would definitely be full by now if it wasn’t for them.”China’s massive waste problem is no secret. The country has consistently ranked as the globe’s worst ocean polluter. A 2015 report found that China was responsible for one-third of all plastic waste polluting the world’s oceans.According to researchers, a majority of this ocean pollution stems from China’s failure to properly manage its domestic waste, which includes inadequate recycling systems. Though China ― often described as the world’s waste basket ― has developed a robust system for recycling imported waste from other nations, what little domestic recycling has occurred in cities like Shanghai has mostly been undertaken by informal waste workers.Exact numbers are difficult to ascertain, but researchers have suggested that the informal system could account for 70 percent or more of recycling for items like plastic bottles and e-waste in major cities like Shanghai and China’s capital, Beijing. A 2015 report by Columbia University researchers said Beijing’s informal collectors could be responsible for “removing as much as 30 percent of total waste in the city.”These informal waste workers aren’t driven by environmental concerns or government mandates. Instead, they saw a gap in the waste disposal system and sought to fill it. “People may not realize it, but these guys, they’re entrepreneurs,” said Rose Martin, a consultant at Collective Responsibility, as she observed Mr. Wang working on that September afternoon. Informal recycling in Shanghai (at 24 million residents, it’s the most populous city in the world) is a well-oiled machine, with every participant appearing to have a clear role.Mr. Wang, a specialized “consolidator,” is near the top of the pyramid, amassing recyclables of a specific type (in his case, large appliances) across several neighborhoods. These items will end up at a larger sorting center and eventually at a recycling plant. Below Mr. Wang are the neighborhood-level collectors and waste pickers — modern-day rag-and-bone dealers — who collect recyclables from households and businesses or things discarded in the trash. A homeowner wanting to sell her old refrigerator may call her local waste collector, who’ll pay her a small sum for the appliance. This collector, who usually also specializes in a particular type of recyclable material, may then contact another, who will pay him a slightly larger amount to take the item. Every time an item changes hands, someone gets paid. In just an hour, almost 10 people rode by to deliver appliances to Mr. Wang. He’d pull out a fat stack of colorful renminbi from his pocket whenever a new person would drop by, doling out cash for the items delivered. The deliverymen sometimes lingered, for a cigarette and a chat. Men from the neighborhood popped by too, making small talk. A neighborhood fixture, Mr. Wang’s collection point has become something of a community gathering place. Mr. Wang, who said only that he was “in his 40s,” said he’d been coming to this spot for several years to ply his trade.“It’s very hard work,” he said as he loaded the truck. “My body aches. I have a lot of problems with my neck.” As Shanghai and China as a whole undergo something of a “green revolution,” with city and federal officials becoming increasingly concerned about environmental issues, including domestic waste, experts say the livelihoods of informal recyclers like Mr. Wang could soon be under threat.A number of regulations have already been enacted in Shanghai that could change their way of life. It remains to be seen, however, whether the state will be able to create a formalized recycling system that’s better than the vast and intricate unofficial one that exists.A handyman earlier, Mr. Wang said he moved about a decade ago to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, located north of the city, and stumbled into this business. His three children — ages 10, 14 and 20 — live with their grandparents back home. He and his wife see them two or three times a year. He misses them, yes, but, “I work to survive,” he said with a shrug. As the sun began to dip behind the trees, Mr. Wang climbed into the truck’s cab and, with a wave goodbye, inched out of the small side street ― his wares stacked so high they smacked into lower branches as he drove away. He would be making the 1½-hour drive back to his home in Kunshan, an industrial city on the outskirts of Shanghai. He hoped to avoid rush-hour traffic. If he got stuck, the journey could take more than two hours.Until last May, Mr. Wang said he’d lived within the city limits, but he’d been “kicked out” by “authorities.” He wouldn’t elaborate. Once he got home, he and his wife would dismantle appliances till late, separating the parts to be recycled from the bits that would be thrown away. The next morning, he’d be up before sunrise to repair any appliances he thought could still be resold whole. By 8, he’d be back behind the wheel of his truck, making the journey back to this small street in central Shanghai. Every neighborhood in this sprawling city has its own Mr. Wang. Ask any resident about informal recyclers and they’ll invariably tell you about their local “plastic bottle uncle” or “paper lady.” “They’re an iconic sight, these recyclers,” said Jake Newby, TimeOut Shanghai’s editor-at-large. “Think of Shanghai and you might think of these guys on tricycles piled high with paper or plastic bottles — piled so high that if the guy got off, the whole thing would tip over.” No one knows exactly how many recyclers and waste pickers there are in Shanghai. But Yifei Li, an assistant professor of environmental studies at New York University Shanghai and an expert on the city’s waste sector, estimates it’s in the “tens of thousands,” if not more ― most of them migrant workers who, like Mr. Wang, came to Shanghai seeking work. Across China, there are as many as 2.5 million to 6 million informal waste workers, according to a 2013 study.It’s not just neighborhoods that have their local collectors and pickers. Large residential and commercial complexes are have their own groups. To illustrate this, Brubaker, who has spent years researching Shanghai’s informal recycling sector, offered a tour of the basement of a residential complex in the heart of the city. In a corner of the parking lot, Brubaker pushed open an unmarked door. Inside was a large room, dark and dank, in which every corner was filled with detritus. Here, a pile of wires and small electronic items; there, huge bales of paper and cardboard, and a stash of plastic bottles. At the very back of the room, there was evidence of life and living: crumpled sleeping bags on the ground; damp laundry hanging on makeshift clothing lines; cobwebbed potted plants lined up in a corner; and a red-and-gold paper sign with the Chinese character for “fortune.”“This is where all the trash from the apartments ends up, and they sort it all,” said Brubaker, waving his arms around the room.No one was there when he entered, but Brubaker said four or five men and women live in the room. They’re not paid by the property’s management, but they’d struck some sort of deal, Brubaker said. The building’s managers turn a blind eye, allowing the pickers to live and work here, unseen and unheard by the residents above. “A lot of people don’t know this is down here,” Brubaker said. In turn, the managers get a small cut of the group’s earnings. At a mall in northern Shanghai a few days later, a woman with a large rucksack over her shoulder reached into trash cans and pulled out plastic bottles and other recyclables. When quizzed, a local identified her as the mall’s unofficial waste picker. “She’s here almost every day,” he said.Michelle Huang, an NYU Shanghai student who spent a summer researching the city’s waste sector, said there are usually “two or three pickers in any mall or large building.”“They get what they can — but for a city this big, they can’t possibly compensate for the sheer amount being thrown away,” said Huang.Shanghai Daily reported in 2015 that the city’s residents were generating some 22,000 tons of garbage per day, at least 40 percent of which was being incinerated. Experts say the waste problem in China is getting worse every year. The World Bank has estimated that China’s solid waste production will more than double to 500 million tons annually by 2025. China is expected to produce twice the amount of solid waste as the United States by 2030.  With these staggering numbers in mind, and as the nation’s landfills run out of room and concerns mount about health and environmental hazards of trash incineration, Chinese authorities have begun to make domestic waste management a priority. Last year, China told the World Trade Organization that it would no longer be accepting 24 categories of imported waste from other nations, sending shockwaves across Europe and North America, which have for decades relied on China to handle millions of tons of its waste. Observers say this move hints at China’s commitment to focusing more on managing its own waste streams. Progress, however, won’t come overnight. “For years, there have been no government recycling trucks or recycling bins in the city. There are no trash sorting sites either ― so everything gets dumped into one truck and incinerated or brought to a landfill,” said Huang, who rode in garbage collection trucks managed by the city government as part of her research. “There are conferences and discussions every year but things don’t really seem to be getting better.”There are whispers of evidence, however, that change is afoot. Li, the NYU professor, said the city government had recently launched pilot recycling projects in a limited number of apartment complexes around Shanghai.In one neighborhood, a recycling center has been set up by a state-run charity. Residents can deposit paper, plastic and even e-waste in exchange for “prizes,” such as shampoo, toothpaste and toilet paper. When photographs of the center ― all shiny and new with its color-coded bins ― were shown to residents of other neighborhoods, some of whom had lived in Shanghai for decades, most expressed bewilderment. “This is Shanghai?” they’d marvel.At the same time, the city government seems determined to push out unlicensed recyclers. This year, for instance, Shanghai police have been cracking down on motorized tricycles, which is how many recyclers transport their goods. The official line is that these vehicles pose a danger to traffic safety, but the effect on recyclers is clear. Many have had their tricycles taken away and can’t afford different vehicles. In June, police said they’d seized more than 2,500 motorized tricycles. Authorities have also been cracking down on Shanghai’s “urban villages,” low-income neighborhoods on the city’s outskirts where migrants mostly live. In the name of “beautification,” these villages are being demolished to make way for modern buildings and green spaces. But the result is that recyclers are finding themselves with nowhere to live in China’s most expensive city.According to the Chinese magazine Sixth Tone, 30,000 residents and migrant workers were displaced when Hongqi, Shanghai’s largest urban village, was shut down last year. An additional 3,000 migrant residents from a different urban village were evicted last January, in the days leading up to the Chinese New Year festivities.Experts say that it’s still unclear just how much the government hopes to formalize or centralize the system, and many expressed skepticism over whether a more formalized network could be more efficient and effective. “Informal recycling is a sector that’s been here for so long. It’s very deeply rooted and is a very robust network,” said Li. “If the state takes over that business, it’ll be a lot of work. This is a successful business model for a lot of people. How do you fold that into a state apparatus?” But though the city’s informal recyclers have been praised for the work they’ve done to reduce Shanghai’s waste, it’s a sector not without flaws. Without proper regulation or oversight, the work can be unsafe. None of the recyclers interviewed for this article wore protective clothing or gear. At one recycling site where groups were sorting through paper, metal and wood, unmasked workers were exposed to gusts of dust. What’s known about the informal recycling sector in Shanghai is that individual collectors like Mr. Wang bring their items either to a recycling market, where they’ll be further sorted, or to an industrial recycling plant, where the recycling of the materials actually takes place. What is not transparent is who runs these recycling plants and whether these facilities and their owners are following legal practices that are sound for human health and the environment.Taking a break from loading his truck, Mr. Wang leaned against a stack of TVs and lit a cigarette. “Yes, I’m worried,” he said, when asked whether he’d seen any changes in the recycling business lately. “I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t do this anymore.”For now, however, the recyclers of Shanghai continue their work.“There is no rest for us,” a jovial young man from Anhui province told me as he sorted through large bales of plastic bottles at a recycling site. He looked up the sky, wincing at the sun. “Maybe if there’s a typhoon, we can stop.”"

Large residential and commercial complexes are have their own groups. To illustrate this, Brubaker, who has spent years researching Shanghai’s informal recycling sector, offered a tour of the basement of a residential complex in the heart of the city. In a corner of the parking lot, Brubaker pushed open an unmarked door. Inside was a large room, dark and dank, in which every corner was filled with detritus. Here, a pile of wires and small electronic items; there, huge bales of paper and cardboard, and a stash of plastic bottles. At the very back of the room, there was evidence of life and living: crumpled sleeping bags on the ground; damp laundry hanging on makeshift clothing lines; cobwebbed potted plants lined up in a corner; and a red-and-gold paper sign with the Chinese character for “fortune.”“This is where all the trash from the apartments ends up, and they sort it all,” said Brubaker, waving his arms around the room.No one was there when he entered, but Brubaker said four or five men and women live in the room. They’re not paid by the property’s management, but they’d struck some sort of deal, Brubaker said. The building’s managers turn a blind eye, allowing the pickers to live and work here, unseen and unheard by the residents above. “A lot of people don’t know this is down here,” Brubaker said. In turn, the managers get a small cut of the group’s earnings. At a mall in northern Shanghai a few days later, a woman with a large rucksack over her shoulder reached into trash cans and pulled out plastic bottles and other recyclables. When quizzed, a local identified her as the mall’s unofficial waste picker. “She’s here almost every day,” he said.Michelle Huang, an NYU Shanghai student who spent a summer researching the city’s waste sector, said there are usually “two or three pickers in any mall or large building.”“They get what they can — but for a city this big, they can’t possibly compensate for the sheer amount being thrown away,” said Huang.Shanghai Daily reported in 2015 that the city’s residents were generating some 22,000 tons of garbage per day, at least 40 percent of which was being incinerated. Experts say the waste problem in China is getting worse every year. The World Bank has estimated that China’s solid waste production will more than double to 500 million tons annually by 2025. China is expected to produce twice the amount of solid waste as the United States by 2030.  With these staggering numbers in mind, and as the nation’s landfills run out of room and concerns mount about health and environmental hazards of trash incineration, Chinese authorities have begun to make domestic waste management a priority. Last year, China told the World Trade Organization that it would no longer be accepting 24 categories of imported waste from other nations, sending shockwaves across Europe and North America, which have for decades relied on China to handle millions of tons of its waste. Observers say this move hints at China’s commitment to focusing more on managing its own waste streams. Progress, however, won’t come overnight. “For years, there have been no government recycling trucks or recycling bins in the city. There are no trash sorting sites either ― so everything gets dumped into one truck and incinerated or brought to a landfill,” said Huang, who rode in garbage collection trucks managed by the city government as part of her research. “There are conferences and discussions every year but things don’t really seem to be getting better.”There are whispers of evidence, however, that change is afoot. Li, the NYU professor, said the city government had recently launched pilot recycling projects in a limited number of apartment complexes around Shanghai.In one neighborhood, a recycling center has been set up by a state-run charity. Residents can deposit paper, plastic and even e-waste in exchange for “prizes,” such as shampoo, toothpaste and toilet paper. When photographs of the center ― all shiny and new with its color-coded bins ― were shown to residents of other neighborhoods, some of whom had lived in Shanghai for decades, most expressed bewilderment. “This is Shanghai?” they’d marvel.At the same time, the city government seems determined to push out unlicensed recyclers. This year, for instance, Shanghai police have been cracking down on motorized tricycles, which is how many recyclers transport their goods. The official line is that these vehicles pose a danger to traffic safety, but the effect on recyclers is clear. Many have had their tricycles taken away and can’t afford different vehicles. In June, police said they’d seized more than 2,500 motorized tricycles. Authorities have also been cracking down on Shanghai’s “urban villages,” low-income neighborhoods on the city’s outskirts where migrants mostly live. In the name of “beautification,” these villages are being demolished to make way for modern buildings and green spaces. But the result is that recyclers are finding themselves with nowhere to live in China’s most expensive city.According to the Chinese magazine Sixth Tone, 30,000 residents and migrant workers were displaced when Hongqi, Shanghai’s largest urban village, was shut down last year. An additional 3,000 migrant residents from a different urban village were evicted last January, in the days leading up to the Chinese New Year festivities.Experts say that it’s still unclear just how much the government hopes to formalize or centralize the system, and many expressed skepticism over whether a more formalized network could be more efficient and effective. “Informal recycling is a sector that’s been here for so long. It’s very deeply rooted and is a very robust network,” said Li. “If the state takes over that business, it’ll be a lot of work. This is a successful business model for a lot of people. How do you fold that into a state apparatus?” But though the city’s informal recyclers have been praised for the work they’ve done to reduce Shanghai’s waste, it’s a sector not without flaws. Without proper regulation or oversight, the work can be unsafe. None of the recyclers interviewed for this article wore protective clothing or gear. At one recycling site where groups were sorting through paper, metal and wood, unmasked workers were exposed to gusts of dust. What’s known about the informal recycling sector in Shanghai is that individual collectors like Mr. Wang bring their items either to a recycling market, where they’ll be further sorted, or to an industrial recycling plant, where the recycling of the materials actually takes place. What is not transparent is who runs these recycling plants and whether these facilities and their owners are following legal practices that are sound for human health and the environment.Taking a break from loading his truck, Mr. Wang leaned against a stack of TVs and lit a cigarette. “Yes, I’m worried,” he said, when asked whether he’d seen any changes in the recycling business lately. “I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t do this anymore.”For now, however, the recyclers of Shanghai continue their work.“There is no rest for us,” a jovial young man from Anhui province told me as he sorted through large bales of plastic bottles at a recycling site. He looked up the sky, wincing at the sun. “Maybe if there’s a typhoon, we can stop.”"

Experts say there may be tens of thousands of such informal recyclers working in the city.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a579650210000280059106d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"SHANGHAI — On a narrow side street in a leafy residential neighborhood, a man who identified himself only as Mr. Wang piles large appliances onto his flat-bed truck. Stacking them higher than would seem physically possible, he expertly balances rusty washing machines atop old industrial fridges, tightly strapping them down so they don’t topple. Men on motorbikes and a few women arrive in the alley, carting their unwieldy machines, which Mr. Wang packs onto his truck, arranging and rearranging his mound like an expert Tetris player. Mr. Wang parks his truck at this spot almost every day, from early morning to late afternoon, collecting items that would otherwise be sent to a landfill or incinerator. He’s one of Shanghai’s thousands of informal recyclers, a citywide network of unlicensed workers, mostly migrants, who experts and locals alike say have done far more to recycle Shanghai’s waste than has the government or any formalized system. “It’s invaluable what these guys have done to reduce the trash in the city,” said Richard Brubaker, an environmental activist and founder of Collective Responsibility, a Shanghai-based sustainability consultancy. “Two out of five of Shanghai’s landfills are already filled today. The other three would definitely be full by now if it wasn’t for them.”China’s massive waste problem is no secret. The country has consistently ranked as the globe’s worst ocean polluter. A 2015 report found that China was responsible for one-third of all plastic waste polluting the world’s oceans.According to researchers, a majority of this ocean pollution stems from China’s failure to properly manage its domestic waste, which includes inadequate recycling systems. Though China ― often described as the world’s waste basket ― has developed a robust system for recycling imported waste from other nations, what little domestic recycling has occurred in cities like Shanghai has mostly been undertaken by informal waste workers.Exact numbers are difficult to ascertain, but researchers have suggested that the informal system could account for 70 percent or more of recycling for items like plastic bottles and e-waste in major cities like Shanghai and China’s capital, Beijing. A 2015 report by Columbia University researchers said Beijing’s informal collectors could be responsible for “removing as much as 30 percent of total waste in the city.”These informal waste workers aren’t driven by environmental concerns or government mandates. Instead, they saw a gap in the waste disposal system and sought to fill it. “People may not realize it, but these guys, they’re entrepreneurs,” said Rose Martin, a consultant at Collective Responsibility, as she observed Mr. Wang working on that September afternoon. Informal recycling in Shanghai (at 24 million residents, it’s the most populous city in the world) is a well-oiled machine, with every participant appearing to have a clear role.Mr. Wang, a specialized “consolidator,” is near the top of the pyramid, amassing recyclables of a specific type (in his case, large appliances) across several neighborhoods. These items will end up at a larger sorting center and eventually at a recycling plant. Below Mr. Wang are the neighborhood-level collectors and waste pickers — modern-day rag-and-bone dealers — who collect recyclables from households and businesses or things discarded in the trash. A homeowner wanting to sell her old refrigerator may call her local waste collector, who’ll pay her a small sum for the appliance. This collector, who usually also specializes in a particular type of recyclable material, may then contact another, who will pay him a slightly larger amount to take the item. Every time an item changes hands, someone gets paid. In just an hour, almost 10 people rode by to deliver appliances to Mr. Wang. He’d pull out a fat stack of colorful renminbi from his pocket whenever a new person would drop by, doling out cash for the items delivered. The deliverymen sometimes lingered, for a cigarette and a chat. Men from the neighborhood popped by too, making small talk. A neighborhood fixture, Mr. Wang’s collection point has become something of a community gathering place. Mr. Wang, who said only that he was “in his 40s,” said he’d been coming to this spot for several years to ply his trade.“It’s very hard work,” he said as he loaded the truck. “My body aches. I have a lot of problems with my neck.” As Shanghai and China as a whole undergo something of a “green revolution,” with city and federal officials becoming increasingly concerned about environmental issues, including domestic waste, experts say the livelihoods of informal recyclers like Mr. Wang could soon be under threat.A number of regulations have already been enacted in Shanghai that could change their way of life. It remains to be seen, however, whether the state will be able to create a formalized recycling system that’s better than the vast and intricate unofficial one that exists.A handyman earlier, Mr. Wang said he moved about a decade ago to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, located north of the city, and stumbled into this business. His three children — ages 10, 14 and 20 — live with their grandparents back home. He and his wife see them two or three times a year. He misses them, yes, but, “I work to survive,” he said with a shrug. As the sun began to dip behind the trees, Mr. Wang climbed into the truck’s cab and, with a wave goodbye, inched out of the small side street ― his wares stacked so high they smacked into lower branches as he drove away. He would be making the 1½-hour drive back to his home in Kunshan, an industrial city on the outskirts of Shanghai. He hoped to avoid rush-hour traffic. If he got stuck, the journey could take more than two hours.Until last May, Mr. Wang said he’d lived within the city limits, but he’d been “kicked out” by “authorities.” He wouldn’t elaborate. Once he got home, he and his wife would dismantle appliances till late, separating the parts to be recycled from the bits that would be thrown away. The next morning, he’d be up before sunrise to repair any appliances he thought could still be resold whole. By 8, he’d be back behind the wheel of his truck, making the journey back to this small street in central Shanghai. Every neighborhood in this sprawling city has its own Mr. Wang. Ask any resident about informal recyclers and they’ll invariably tell you about their local “plastic bottle uncle” or “paper lady.” “They’re an iconic sight, these recyclers,” said Jake Newby, TimeOut Shanghai’s editor-at-large. “Think of Shanghai and you might think of these guys on tricycles piled high with paper or plastic bottles — piled so high that if the guy got off, the whole thing would tip over.” No one knows exactly how many recyclers and waste pickers there are in Shanghai. But Yifei Li, an assistant professor of environmental studies at New York University Shanghai and an expert on the city’s waste sector, estimates it’s in the “tens of thousands,” if not more ― most of them migrant workers who, like Mr. Wang, came to Shanghai seeking work. Across China, there are as many as 2.5 million to 6 million informal waste workers, according to a 2013 study.It’s not just neighborhoods that have their local collectors and pickers.

However, unwilling to accept the fate of previous years – where meaningful breakthroughs have long been absent – they have a new plan to find their missing daughter.“We’re fed up,” Jennifer’s father, Drew Kesse, told HuffPost. “We’re suing the Orlando Police Department. They’ve had probably 150 investigators look at Jennifer’s case. There’s been million-dollar rewards, the largest searches in the southeast, and yet we’re no further than we were on day three.”The Kesse family made their intention public on Jan. 19, with the announcement that they are seeking a court order to compel authorities to open the case files. Kesse said the decision was made after the police department refused to cooperate with them.“We have a team of investigators – former federal agents – who are willing to help and we’d asked [Orlando police] to please let us bring them in to look at the files,” Kesse said. “We explained that we simply want to find our daughter and they said they would not allow that.’”In a statement to the media, the Orlando Police Department said, “If we were to release any active criminal investigative material to the Kesse family … it could jeopardize the investigation. That’s not something we want in this case or in any other active criminal investigation.”Kesse argues the department is missing the point.“I’m not interested in seeing [the files],” he said. “I’m not an investigator. All we want is one of our investigators to be able to go in and read the files. Do they hold any answers? I don’t know, but I think at this point we all know it’s a cold case. We don’t want to wait another 12 or even 20 years to find Jennifer.”Jennifer was 24 years old when she vanished in Orlando on Jan. 24, 2006. On that day, her family was notified she’d not shown up for work at Central Florida Investments.When calls to her phone went directly to voicemail, her family contacted Orlando police and made the two-hour drive from their home in Bradenton to Orlando.Inside Jennifer’s apartment, the Kesses found nothing to indicate where she was. The shower had been used and a few items of clothes were laid out on the bed, but there were no obvious signs of foul play.By 4 p.m. that day, family and friends of Jennifer were already searching the area surrounding her condominium, which was located next to Orlando’s Mall at MilleniaThe most promising lead came two days later, when Jennifer’s car was found abandoned at a condominium complex roughly one mile from where she lived. Police bloodhounds tracked a scent from where the car was found to Jennifer’s condo, but that’s where the trail ended.Surveillance cameras at the condo complex where the car was found captured an unknown person parking Jennifer’s car and waiting approximately 30 seconds before exiting the vehicle and walking away without looking back. Despite intense media coverage of the video, the identity of the driver remains a mystery.The surveillance video was the last known break in the case.Fast forward to 2018, whereupon the Orlando Police Department on Wednesday held a press conference about Jennifer’s case. The day marked not only 12 years since Jennifer’s disappearance, but the passage of just five days since her family had announced their intention to sue.At the press conference, Orlando Police Chief John Mina announced that a detective had been assigned to “focus exclusively” on the case. He also unveiled a city bus with Jennifer Kesse’s photo on it and said the department was having Jennifer’s face displayed on 18 digital billboards throughout the region.Jennifer’s brother, Logan Kesse, was visibly angry – the police chief’s words, in his mind, sowing the seeds of discontent. By the time it was over, those seeds had fully germinated.“This is an absolute slap in the face,” Logan told reporters. “It’s been 12 years. Did they do this last year? No. The year before? No … This is only being done because … we are on their ass and they fucked up.”Drew Kesse told HuffPost that promises made during the press conference, specifically that of a dedicated detective, were nothing new.“This is the fourth time they’ve said that,” he explained. “Don’t get me wrong, the bus is beautiful – incredible – but at this point it feels like they’re an adversary. I mean, if this works and jerks somebody’s mind and this all comes to an end tomorrow, great. If that happens, I don’t give a crap if the chief of police snubs his nose in my face and says, ‘There, we found her. La, la, la, la, la.’ I’d kiss him. But I really don’t think that’s going to happen.”Kesse suspects police are concerned the files contain mistakes that were made in the early stages of the investigation.“We already know of verifiable mistakes, but we’re not interested in that,” he said. “We just want to find Jennifer. We all make mistakes. If we wanted to sue them for mistakes we would’ve done that years ago, but that doesn’t bring Jennifer back.”Drew Kesse said his family suffered another blow after the press conference. Upon walking back to their vehicle, they’d discovered someone had broken in.“It happened with the cops and the press right there,” he said. “A cellphone, wallet, credit cards, and money were gone. To top it, we waited around an hour and 53 minutes after we’d called police and they never showed up. I called them back and said, ‘I guess you just don’t really want to help the Kesses today. We’re leaving. Bye.’”Kesse paused while recounting the incident and then chuckled.“It’s just like holy shit,” he explained. “If I don’t laugh, I’ll cry in the corner.”As of Friday, Orlando police have yet to be served with the lawsuit. According to Kesse, the legal action is in the works.“Once you step in lawyer land it’s a whole different world,” he said. “It’s going to be a very uphill and expensive battle. Ultimately, we are her family and we are responsible for finding her. [The police] can quit at any time. It doesn’t matter to them. We can’t. We’ve already lost everything ― our careers and everything. All we have left is our house and we’re about to sell it. But we don’t care about that. Finding Jennifer is all that matters. It’s a shame they won’t help us do that.”At the time of her disappearance, Jennifer Kesse was 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 135 pounds. She had shoulder-length sandy blonde hair and green eyes.Anyone with information in the case is asked to contact Orlando police detective Teresa Sprague at 407-246-3982.

62,IMPACT,"Luxury Developments, Gentrification, Airbnb: The Battle For Boston's Chinatown","Melissa Hung, On assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boston-chinatown-gentrification_us_5a6b05fae4b01fbbefb0b992,“We’re being eaten up little by little. Chinatown is getting very small.”,2018-01-27,"A family walks along Oak Street in Boston's Chinatown, where protestors for affordable housing have written on the sidewalk in front of an Airbnb rental.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6b067d1d000026006ace31.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"One snowy winter day, after standing at his restaurant job washing dishes, Jinlong Chen came home to the apartment that he and his wife shared with several other families on Beach Street in Boston’s Chinatown. He opened the door to their room to find water and debris everywhere. Part of the ceiling had collapsed.Chen notified his landlord. The landlord told him to move out. “Back then, I didn’t know my rights as a tenant,” Chen, 66, says in Mandarin through an interpreter. “I avoided that part of the ceiling. I moved the bed to the other side of the room.” A few months later, with the ceiling still gaping, Chen and his wife moved.Landlords neglecting their buildings and harassing tenants in order to get them to leave have become a common story in Chinatowns across the country as these traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhoods become gentrified. A study of the three largest Chinatowns on the East Coast — Boston, New York, and Philadelphia — by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund found that Chinatowns are losing their Asian residents as the white population grows. Asians now account for less than half of the population in all three Chinatowns.As those with more means move in, immigrant residents of Chinatowns increasingly squeeze into shared quarters, like Jinlong Chen and his housemates did.In Boston, “there’s a lot of real estate speculation,” says Lydia Lowe, a Chinatown community leader for more than 30 years. Boston’s Chinatown, located adjacent to the Financial District, has long been affected by development, Lowe says. During urban renewal in the 1950s and ’60s, an estimated 1,200 units of housing were demolished when two major highways, I-93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, were routed through Chinatown, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund study says. Then, Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, now the Tufts Medical Center, took over one-third of Chinatown’s land area.But the pace of development has exploded in recent years. “We’ve just seen luxury tower after luxury tower being built in the area and this has led to rapid gentrification,” Lowe says. Lowe now serves as executive director of the Chinatown Community Land Trust, founded in 2015. In a community land trust model, the trust owns land and can deed-restrict the buildings on it to be permanently affordable. The Chinatown Community Land Trust intended to do just that, but its attempts to buy properties have failed. “That’s not looking so good right now,” Lowe says. “Because of the market we’re not able to even get our hands on buying a smaller property.”A dilapidated three-story row house that would have gone for about $800,000 two or three years ago is now selling for $2 million to $3 million, Lowe says.So, the land trust looks for other ways to preserve affordable housing in Chinatown. One way is to advocate for stronger tenant protections and policies. Several Chinatown organizations — including the Chinatown Community Land Trust, Chinese Progressive Association, and the Asian Community Development Corp. — are part of the Welcome Home Coalition, which is calling for stricter regulation of Airbnbs to keep residents from being displaced.The Chinatown organizations are also pushing for stronger enforcement of zoning. “We have zoning in theory, but many times large projects get a lot of variances and zoning relief,” says Angie Liou, executive director of the Asian Community Development Corp., which builds affordable housing. The developments obtain variances for height, for example. “Comparing Chinatown to other more upscale neighborhoods, it makes me question whether developers in those neighborhoods would have dared to propose such a thing,” Liou says.The community is also fighting to preserve existing affordable housing. One battle is taking place at Mass Pike Towers, a 200-unit low-income development. When developer Trinity Financial purchased the towers in 2000, it did so using public funding, including low-income housing tax credits, and agreed to give tenants and the city government an opportunity to purchase the property in 15 years.In 2016, the city agreed to buy the property and turn it over to the tenants, who would finance the purchase. The tenants plan to convey the land to the Chinatown Community Land Trust.But the tenants and Trinity have been locked in ongoing litigation over the purchase price of the building. The tenants offered $42 million. Trinity wants $61 million, citing a city-ordered independent appraisal. The tenants argue that the appraisal is based on rental income that was not weighed in the original agreement.Bill Oranczak, president of the Mass Pike Towers Tenants Association, has lived in the complex since 2008 and says that Trinity previously proposed to build market-rate condos on Mass Pike Towers’ parking lot, a proposal that the tenants successfully fought.“Every time I turn around, there’s a new set of cranes,” Oranczak says. “When we see what’s going on in Chinatown with all the development, it’s important for us to try to preserve some of the property and the land to slow down gentrification. That’s a big reason why we’re doing this.”Serene Wong, who has lived in Mass Pike Towers since 1992, says she would like to see Chinatown remain a landing spot for working-class Chinese immigrants, as it’s been for more than 100 years.“Chinatown used to be, for us, a stepping stone to adjust to the culture, to adjust between American and Chinese,” Wong says.When Wong immigrated to America from Hong Kong in 1987, she didn’t speak much English. Living in Chinatown, where other people spoke Cantonese like her, eased her adjustment. She enrolled in a training program offered by a community organization. Today, she serves as vice president of the tenants association, and was one of its founders. “We’re being eaten up little by little. Chinatown is getting very small,” Wong says.The affordability subsidies for Mass Pike Towers don’t expire until 2070, so the tenants still have time. But for residents of the many row houses in Boston’s Chinatown, the situation is more precarious.“After all these towers being built right now, the housing stock that is most at risk are the row houses,” says Karen Chen, executive director of Chinese Progressive Association.Jinlong Chen (no relation) lives in one of those row house. After moving out of the apartment with the collapsed ceiling in 2011, he and his wife moved a few more times and eventually settled into an apartment with another couple. Living in Chinatown is important to him, he says, because he’s not proficient in English. When he leaves Chinatown, he gets lost.But in 2016, the landlord said he wanted to renovate the building and served them an eviction notice. This time, Chen went to Chinese Progressive Association to ask for help.Community organizers represented the couple at housing court and won a reprieve. They can stay in the building — at least for now. But Chen worries. The landlord recently raised the rent by $100. (Chen’s monthly income is about $1,000, and his portion of the rent is $650). Will the landlord try to kick them out again? Where would they go?“My ideal is that there will be more elderly housing in Chinatown, so that the elderly like me, who’ve worked all my life, could move there and have affordable housing,” he says.For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.

A study of the three largest Chinatowns on the East Coast — Boston, New York, and Philadelphia — by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund found that Chinatowns are losing their Asian residents as the white population grows. Asians now account for less than half of the population in all three Chinatowns.As those with more means move in, immigrant residents of Chinatowns increasingly squeeze into shared quarters, like Jinlong Chen and his housemates did.In Boston, “there’s a lot of real estate speculation,” says Lydia Lowe, a Chinatown community leader for more than 30 years. Boston’s Chinatown, located adjacent to the Financial District, has long been affected by development, Lowe says. During urban renewal in the 1950s and ’60s, an estimated 1,200 units of housing were demolished when two major highways, I-93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, were routed through Chinatown, the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund study says. Then, Tufts University and the New England Medical Center, now the Tufts Medical Center, took over one-third of Chinatown’s land area.But the pace of development has exploded in recent years. “We’ve just seen luxury tower after luxury tower being built in the area and this has led to rapid gentrification,” Lowe says. Lowe now serves as executive director of the Chinatown Community Land Trust, founded in 2015. In a community land trust model, the trust owns land and can deed-restrict the buildings on it to be permanently affordable. The Chinatown Community Land Trust intended to do just that, but its attempts to buy properties have failed. “That’s not looking so good right now,” Lowe says. “Because of the market we’re not able to even get our hands on buying a smaller property.”A dilapidated three-story row house that would have gone for about $800,000 two or three years ago is now selling for $2 million to $3 million, Lowe says.So, the land trust looks for other ways to preserve affordable housing in Chinatown. One way is to advocate for stronger tenant protections and policies. Several Chinatown organizations — including the Chinatown Community Land Trust, Chinese Progressive Association, and the Asian Community Development Corp. — are part of the Welcome Home Coalition, which is calling for stricter regulation of Airbnbs to keep residents from being displaced.The Chinatown organizations are also pushing for stronger enforcement of zoning. “We have zoning in theory, but many times large projects get a lot of variances and zoning relief,” says Angie Liou, executive director of the Asian Community Development Corp., which builds affordable housing. The developments obtain variances for height, for example. “Comparing Chinatown to other more upscale neighborhoods, it makes me question whether developers in those neighborhoods would have dared to propose such a thing,” Liou says.The community is also fighting to preserve existing affordable housing.

The announcement came after allegations emerged of recurrent sexual harassment by the Las Vegas casino mogul.The billionaire businessman has been accused of a decades-long pattern of sexual harassment and abuse toward workers at his casinos, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Wynn, who also served as the Republican National Committee’s finance chairman until his resignation on Saturday, recently appeared as a guest on the Fox News special.In a statement on Friday, Fox said it would no longer book Wynn should the show return.“We will not be booking Steve Wynn on any potential future installments of ‘The Wise Guys,’ if it moves forward beyond a one-off special,” a spokesperson told HuffPost.Dozens of current and former employees at Wynn’s gambling establishments said they had experienced or witnessed chronic abuse by the billionaire, who owns several sprawling casinos and is estimated to be worth over $3.6 billion.The allegations detailed in the Journal article ranged from lewd comments and inappropriate touching to soliciting sex acts from women who worked as manicurists and massage therapists at Wynn’s Las Vegas casinos.One former employee at Wynn Las Vegas said the mogul pressured her into having unwanted sex with him after she gave him a manicure in 2005. Wynn later agreed to pay the woman a $7.5 million settlement after she filed a report.“The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” Wynn said in a statement shared with HuffPost. “We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits. It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mercers-climate-denial_us_5a6a4661e4b06e253265e832,The New York financiers’ donations to climate misinformation think tanks are finally attracting the scrutiny long reserved for the Koch brothers and Exxon Mobil.,2018-01-26,"Billionaires Rebekah Mercer, left, and her father, Robert, attended the Heartland Institute's annual International Conference on Climate Change in March 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a46fb1600002000138d5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, are best known as the secretive billionaire megadonors who bankrolled and organized President Donald Trump’s campaign, poured at least $10 million into Breitbart News, and showered millions on a network of right-wing websites and think tanks. The family has spent $36.6 million on Republican races and super PACs since 2010.The Mercers are less well known as patrons of the climate change denial movement, yet their spending has been equally generous and appears to be increasing, according to new, previously unreleased tax filings reviewed by HuffPost.The Mercer Family Foundation in 2016 gave $800,000 to the Heartland Institute, a right-wing think tank and major proponent of climate change denialism, up from $100,000 the previous year. Heartland received about $5.2 million in average annual income between 2011 and 2015, meaning the Mercers’ donation could make up 15 percent of the organization’s funding in 2016.The foundation gave $200,000 for a second year in a row to the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a discredited medial research group best known for spreading a hoax petition in 2009 claiming that 30,000 climatologists rejected global warming. Based on the organization’s average income for the last few years, that donation could make up anywhere from one-third to 62 percent of its budget. The Mercers made first-time donations to two other prominent groups last year: the CO2 Coalition, an organization born from the ashes of the defunct George C. Marshall Institute, which denied global warming and lobbied against the science behind acid rain and smoking-caused cancer, received $150,000; and the Arizona-based Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, an oil-funded think tank run by former Peabody Energy executive Craig Idso, got $125,000. In its first year, the CO2 Coalition raised $404,384, so the donation the Mercers disclosed for last year increased the budget by nearly 40 percent. For Idso’s outfit, which took in just $194,757, according to its most recent filing, the Mercer money would mark a 64 percent budgetary increase. Tax disclosures typically become public a year after a nonprofit files, so the most recently available documents are from 2015. The Mercers’ contributions are detailed on the foundation’s most recent 990 tax form, which researchers at the nonpartisan Climate Investigations Center obtained and shared with HuffPost. Neither the Mercer Family Foundation, nor any of the four organizations, responded to a request for comment on Thursday afternoon.The spending is notable not only for the large amounts, but because it seems to mark a shift in the world of climate-denial funding, which was once bolstered mainly by fossil fuel titans like Koch Industries and Exxon Mobil Corp. but has now become too extreme even for some of its original benefactors. The Mercers have long donated to an array of conservative groups that oppose regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. The foundation also provided nearly $2.3 million to the Donors Trust, a conservative funding group that does not take an official position on climate change but has for years funneled money to denial proponents, earning it the nickname “the dark-money ATM of the conservative movement.”But the Mercer Family Foundation appears to have discontinued funding for other climate denial groups. They gave a total of $800,000 in 2013 and 2014 to the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise. Ron Arnold, the group’s executive vice president, serves as a policy adviser to Heartland, and has been quoted as saying his goal is “to eradicate the environmental movement.”The foundation began donating to Heartland around the time the Illinois-based think tank transitioned from defending cigarette companies under the auspice of “smokers’ rights” to aggressively denying climate change and attacking scientists. In 2008, the Mercer foundation gave Heartland $1 million, inflating the group’s budget to about $7.6 million that year, according to a tax filing. Heartland has banked on six-figure grants from the Mercers since, though the donations dwindled over the years, falling to their lowest level in 2015. Between 2008 and 2016, the Mercer foundation gave Heartland nearly $5.9 million. The resurgent funding in 2016 came at a pivotal moment for Heartland. The organization has become more powerful than ever over the past year, wielding unprecedented influence at the EPA. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt joined Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). in November to speak at Heartland’s America First Energy Conference in Houston. But Heartland has also faced public embarrassments. In October, HuffPost reported that the group included a convicted child sex offender in a list of scientists it submitted to the EPA. Last week, a months-long investigation by HuffPost revealed Heartland had protected a former executive charged with stalking and harassing a female colleague half his age. After both stories published, Heartland accused HuffPost of attempting to smear the organization.The Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine was among the Mercer foundation’s earliest ventures into climate denial funding. The foundation gave the group $60,000 in 2005, increased its donation to $100,000 in 2010, then granted $965,000 in 2012. After that, funding tapered off for three years, until the foundation gave $200,000 in 2015.That the Mercers are now funding smaller, more fringe groups such as the Oregon Institute for Science and Medicine, the CO2 Coalition and the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change demonstrates a doubling down on climate change denial by the ascendant right-wing benefactors. Riley Dunlap, an Oklahoma State University sociologist who studies climate misinformation groups, called the four among “the most extreme.”The climate denial movement, relegated to the political fringe during Barack Obama’s presidency, has returned with a vengeance over the past year, notching considerable victories under the Trump administration. Four days after taking office, Trump signed executive actions to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline and invite TransCanada to reapply to build the controversial Keystone XL project. In June, Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, a deal to cut greenhouse gases signed by every other nation on Earth. In October, the EPA proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan, the federal government’s only major policy to reduce planet-warming emissions.The Mercers have emerged amid a growing rift between climate change deniers and the fossil fuel giants that propped them up for decades, as InsideClimate News reported in December. That tension brewed into what E&E News described as a “civil war” at an American Legislative Exchange Council meeting in November. At the summit, Heartland pushed ALEC to adopt a resolution calling on the EPA to overturn the finding that lists greenhouse gas emissions as a threat to public health and underpins the federal government’s climate policies. Exxon Mobil ― which spent decades funding climate denial ― and a group of big companies and utilities opposed the resolution and convinced ALEC to withdraw it. In response, Heartland President Tim Huelskamp, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, described Exxon Mobil as a long-standing member “of the discredited and anti-energy global warming movement.” “They’ve put their profits and ‘green’ virtue signaling above sound science and the interests of their customers,” he said in a statement. Despite its reluctance to invest in renewable energy, Exxon Mobil has scaled back its funding for climate change denial in recent years and even publicly urged Trump against withdrawing from the Paris climate deal in June. The company added a climate scientist to its board of directors last January. In December, the Texas-based behemoth bowed to shareholder pressure to start disclosing financial risk associated with climate change. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research has concluded that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are blanketing the planet in heat-trapping gases, while a research review published in 2015 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise. Sixty-nine percent of Americans believe global warming is happening, and 52 percent understand it is caused by humans, according to 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication.Still, misinformation on climate change commands outsized influence in public debate, according to John Cook, a researcher at George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication.“Denial annihilates facts,” Cook wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Therefore, we can’t ignore denial ― we need to respond to it.” Over the past few years, investors have pushed companies to abandon skepticism on climate change. Yet as corporate culture has become more hostile to a bluntly contrarian climate stance, the network of organizations built on promoting that view has found new allies in far-right politics. “The climate misinformation campaign is so integral now with these modern, hardcore conservative efforts that it would make sense they’re putting their money down on what is really the fringe elements of the climate countermovement,” said Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Drexel University who tracks climate change denial groups. Despite the Mercers’ decade-long relationship with groups like Heartland, the family has kept a relatively low profile in the climate denier world. “Their names have not historically come up when people talk about the major funders,” said Dunlap, the Oklahoma State university sociologist. “I’m guessing this was their big entree into it.” Myron Ebell, a stalwart climate change denier who works at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said he has never met the Mercers but that he welcomes their money to a funding apparatus propped up by some of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful people and corporations. “We don’t have much money on our side,” Ebell, who led Trump’s EPA transition team, said. “So anyone who is a generous donor is going to have an outsized positive effect.” The increased funding is making the Mercers a new target for environmentalists and scientists. On Thursday, more than 200 scientists called on the American Museum of Natural History to drop Rebekah Mercer from its board of directors. The Mercer Family Foundation donated $625,000 to the museum in 2016, bringing the total contributions to nearly $4.1 million since 2012, according to filings. In 2016, activists ousted David Koch from the museum’s board after a months-long campaign highlighting the billionaire’s history of funding climate change denial and attacks on scientists. The Natural History Museum, the nonprofit watchdog group that organized the last campaign, has set its sights on Rebekah Mercer. “We’re asking the museum to cut ties to Mercer as part of the board,” Beka Economopoulos, the New York-based group’s executive director, told HuffPost. “It’s an unusual gesture for scientists to single out an individual on a science institution’s board.

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mercers-climate-denial_us_5a6a4661e4b06e253265e832,The New York financiers’ donations to climate misinformation think tanks are finally attracting the scrutiny long reserved for the Koch brothers and Exxon Mobil.,2018-01-26,"The majority of Americans understand that climate change is a reality, 2016 survey data from Yale University shows.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a48dc1600002000138d5f.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, are best known as the secretive billionaire megadonors who bankrolled and organized President Donald Trump’s campaign, poured at least $10 million into Breitbart News, and showered millions on a network of right-wing websites and think tanks. The family has spent $36.6 million on Republican races and super PACs since 2010.The Mercers are less well known as patrons of the climate change denial movement, yet their spending has been equally generous and appears to be increasing, according to new, previously unreleased tax filings reviewed by HuffPost.The Mercer Family Foundation in 2016 gave $800,000 to the Heartland Institute, a right-wing think tank and major proponent of climate change denialism, up from $100,000 the previous year. Heartland received about $5.2 million in average annual income between 2011 and 2015, meaning the Mercers’ donation could make up 15 percent of the organization’s funding in 2016.The foundation gave $200,000 for a second year in a row to the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a discredited medial research group best known for spreading a hoax petition in 2009 claiming that 30,000 climatologists rejected global warming. Based on the organization’s average income for the last few years, that donation could make up anywhere from one-third to 62 percent of its budget. The Mercers made first-time donations to two other prominent groups last year: the CO2 Coalition, an organization born from the ashes of the defunct George C. Marshall Institute, which denied global warming and lobbied against the science behind acid rain and smoking-caused cancer, received $150,000; and the Arizona-based Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, an oil-funded think tank run by former Peabody Energy executive Craig Idso, got $125,000. In its first year, the CO2 Coalition raised $404,384, so the donation the Mercers disclosed for last year increased the budget by nearly 40 percent. For Idso’s outfit, which took in just $194,757, according to its most recent filing, the Mercer money would mark a 64 percent budgetary increase. Tax disclosures typically become public a year after a nonprofit files, so the most recently available documents are from 2015. The Mercers’ contributions are detailed on the foundation’s most recent 990 tax form, which researchers at the nonpartisan Climate Investigations Center obtained and shared with HuffPost. Neither the Mercer Family Foundation, nor any of the four organizations, responded to a request for comment on Thursday afternoon.The spending is notable not only for the large amounts, but because it seems to mark a shift in the world of climate-denial funding, which was once bolstered mainly by fossil fuel titans like Koch Industries and Exxon Mobil Corp. but has now become too extreme even for some of its original benefactors. The Mercers have long donated to an array of conservative groups that oppose regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. The foundation also provided nearly $2.3 million to the Donors Trust, a conservative funding group that does not take an official position on climate change but has for years funneled money to denial proponents, earning it the nickname “the dark-money ATM of the conservative movement.”But the Mercer Family Foundation appears to have discontinued funding for other climate denial groups. They gave a total of $800,000 in 2013 and 2014 to the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise. Ron Arnold, the group’s executive vice president, serves as a policy adviser to Heartland, and has been quoted as saying his goal is “to eradicate the environmental movement.”The foundation began donating to Heartland around the time the Illinois-based think tank transitioned from defending cigarette companies under the auspice of “smokers’ rights” to aggressively denying climate change and attacking scientists. In 2008, the Mercer foundation gave Heartland $1 million, inflating the group’s budget to about $7.6 million that year, according to a tax filing. Heartland has banked on six-figure grants from the Mercers since, though the donations dwindled over the years, falling to their lowest level in 2015. Between 2008 and 2016, the Mercer foundation gave Heartland nearly $5.9 million. The resurgent funding in 2016 came at a pivotal moment for Heartland. The organization has become more powerful than ever over the past year, wielding unprecedented influence at the EPA. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt joined Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). in November to speak at Heartland’s America First Energy Conference in Houston. But Heartland has also faced public embarrassments. In October, HuffPost reported that the group included a convicted child sex offender in a list of scientists it submitted to the EPA. Last week, a months-long investigation by HuffPost revealed Heartland had protected a former executive charged with stalking and harassing a female colleague half his age. After both stories published, Heartland accused HuffPost of attempting to smear the organization.The Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine was among the Mercer foundation’s earliest ventures into climate denial funding. The foundation gave the group $60,000 in 2005, increased its donation to $100,000 in 2010, then granted $965,000 in 2012. After that, funding tapered off for three years, until the foundation gave $200,000 in 2015.That the Mercers are now funding smaller, more fringe groups such as the Oregon Institute for Science and Medicine, the CO2 Coalition and the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change demonstrates a doubling down on climate change denial by the ascendant right-wing benefactors. Riley Dunlap, an Oklahoma State University sociologist who studies climate misinformation groups, called the four among “the most extreme.”The climate denial movement, relegated to the political fringe during Barack Obama’s presidency, has returned with a vengeance over the past year, notching considerable victories under the Trump administration. Four days after taking office, Trump signed executive actions to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline and invite TransCanada to reapply to build the controversial Keystone XL project. In June, Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, a deal to cut greenhouse gases signed by every other nation on Earth. In October, the EPA proposed repealing the Clean Power Plan, the federal government’s only major policy to reduce planet-warming emissions.The Mercers have emerged amid a growing rift between climate change deniers and the fossil fuel giants that propped them up for decades, as InsideClimate News reported in December. That tension brewed into what E&E News described as a “civil war” at an American Legislative Exchange Council meeting in November. At the summit, Heartland pushed ALEC to adopt a resolution calling on the EPA to overturn the finding that lists greenhouse gas emissions as a threat to public health and underpins the federal government’s climate policies. Exxon Mobil ― which spent decades funding climate denial ― and a group of big companies and utilities opposed the resolution and convinced ALEC to withdraw it. In response, Heartland President Tim Huelskamp, a former Republican congressman from Kansas, described Exxon Mobil as a long-standing member “of the discredited and anti-energy global warming movement.” “They’ve put their profits and ‘green’ virtue signaling above sound science and the interests of their customers,” he said in a statement. Despite its reluctance to invest in renewable energy, Exxon Mobil has scaled back its funding for climate change denial in recent years and even publicly urged Trump against withdrawing from the Paris climate deal in June. The company added a climate scientist to its board of directors last January. In December, the Texas-based behemoth bowed to shareholder pressure to start disclosing financial risk associated with climate change. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research has concluded that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are blanketing the planet in heat-trapping gases, while a research review published in 2015 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise. Sixty-nine percent of Americans believe global warming is happening, and 52 percent understand it is caused by humans, according to 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication.Still, misinformation on climate change commands outsized influence in public debate, according to John Cook, a researcher at George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication.“Denial annihilates facts,” Cook wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Therefore, we can’t ignore denial ― we need to respond to it.” Over the past few years, investors have pushed companies to abandon skepticism on climate change. Yet as corporate culture has become more hostile to a bluntly contrarian climate stance, the network of organizations built on promoting that view has found new allies in far-right politics. “The climate misinformation campaign is so integral now with these modern, hardcore conservative efforts that it would make sense they’re putting their money down on what is really the fringe elements of the climate countermovement,” said Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Drexel University who tracks climate change denial groups. Despite the Mercers’ decade-long relationship with groups like Heartland, the family has kept a relatively low profile in the climate denier world. “Their names have not historically come up when people talk about the major funders,” said Dunlap, the Oklahoma State university sociologist. “I’m guessing this was their big entree into it.” Myron Ebell, a stalwart climate change denier who works at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said he has never met the Mercers but that he welcomes their money to a funding apparatus propped up by some of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful people and corporations. “We don’t have much money on our side,” Ebell, who led Trump’s EPA transition team, said. “So anyone who is a generous donor is going to have an outsized positive effect.” The increased funding is making the Mercers a new target for environmentalists and scientists. On Thursday, more than 200 scientists called on the American Museum of Natural History to drop Rebekah Mercer from its board of directors. The Mercer Family Foundation donated $625,000 to the museum in 2016, bringing the total contributions to nearly $4.1 million since 2012, according to filings. In 2016, activists ousted David Koch from the museum’s board after a months-long campaign highlighting the billionaire’s history of funding climate change denial and attacks on scientists. The Natural History Museum, the nonprofit watchdog group that organized the last campaign, has set its sights on Rebekah Mercer. “We’re asking the museum to cut ties to Mercer as part of the board,” Beka Economopoulos, the New York-based group’s executive director, told HuffPost. “It’s an unusual gesture for scientists to single out an individual on a science institution’s board. It really speaks to the moment of how damaging Mercer’s funding of climate denial is, with the consequences playing out on the national stage.” "

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.): In the hot seat again.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6ad1e81d000026006acdce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A watchdog group has filed a new ethics complaint against House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), alleging he leaked confidential information.The complaint, filed by the Campaign for Accountability, which describes itself as a “non-profit, nonpartisan watchdog organization” on its website, calls on the Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether Nunes or committee staff leaked closed-door testimony of the head of the company that produced the bombshell dossier of Russian information on Donald Trump.Parts of the confidential testimony apparently were “selectively leaked” to discredit Fusion GPS and to “retaliate against Fusion for its role in investigating” Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia, according to the complaint. It alleges the leak further aimed to “deter the firm from engaging in any continued investigation.” This month, a transcript of the entire testimony of Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson with the Senate Judiciary Committee was released by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the panel, at Simpson’s request. The House Intelligence Committee later released its full transcript of Simpson’s testimony as well.Simpson believed the transcripts would provide a more accurate picture of what he said, rather than selectively leaked bits to put the company in a bad light. The full transcripts included information about Trump’s possible Russian connections.The Campaign for Accountability complaint also says Nunes or his staff “improperly obtained” information about the identity of Fusion’s bank from the Senate Judiciary Committee. Nunes subsequently issued a subpoena for bank records without anyone’s approval — and likely leaked the bank’s identity to the press, the complaint says. Nunes recused himself from the House Russian probe in April after officials revealed he was under investigation for possible leaks.Nunes went after the bank’s records in an attempt to identify who had hired Fusion for the dossier, the complaint says. Fusion GPS was paid during the GOP primaries by the conservative website Washington Free Beacon. Once Trump won the primary, the research was funded by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.Nunes’ office didn’t immediately respond to the complaint.Nunes has been embroiled in controversy over a secret memo he reportedly orchestrated that alleges the FBI abused its surveillance powers investigating the Trump campaign’s involvement in Russian election interference. Last month, the House Ethics Committee cleared Nunes of an earlier complaint alleging he had disclosed classified information. "

Before that, Reilly was a chief geologist for nearly 15 years at Dallas-based oil and gas company Enserch Exploration, Inc., where he focused on exploring offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico.That work “resulted in the discovery of over 115 million barrels of oil and over 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas,” he writes on his LinkedIn page. Along with his time in space, Reilly spent approximately 22 days in deep submergence vehicles, according to the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.“Dr. Reilly currently serves United States and allied militaries as a subject matter expert on space operations, and he is a technical advisor supporting the National Security Space Institute of the U.S. Air Force,” the White House noted in a release Friday.Reilly will replace acting director William Werkheiser.USGS is the scientific arm of the Interior Department and is responsible for monitoring and studying natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, as well as managing water, energy and other natural resources.If confirmed to the post by the Senate, Reilly will play a key role in the administration’s efforts to boost America’s production of critical minerals. In a December report, USGS found that the U.S. relies on foreign sources for a majority of the minerals essential in manufacturing, as Reuters reported. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has said the country’s reliance on foreign minerals poses national and economic security risks.“Other nations are far ahead of us with mapping of their mineral resources, leading to private sector investment overseas rather than right here at home,” Zinke said in a statements last month when he signed a secretarial order aimed at identifying domestic sources. “Drafting a complete topographical and geographic survey of the United States is exactly the kind of task the USGS was created to do.”"

He told the News-Courier of Athens that members on the Republican Executive Committee voted Tuesday to reject his bid for sheriff. Two weeks prior to the vote, White said he took a meeting with roughly 10 of the committee members. They asked him what his two biggest weaknesses as a candidate would be.“I said the fact I was fired and that I’m gay,” White told the publication. White was fired from the Athens Police Department in 2012 after allegations that he used criminal justice information center to look up information on his ex-wife.He said the subject of his sexuality became the focal point of the conversation.“We’re a small Southern town; how are we going to get around that?” one member allegedly told him.Noah Wahl, chairman of the committee, told HuffPost he would not comment on the story out of “respect” for White. He later directed HuffPost to comments he made to the News-Courier. “The news media can try to make this about Mr. White’s sexual orientation, but that would be extremely dishonest to the people of Limestone County,” Wahl said in the statement to the publication. “The challenge to Mr. White’s request for candidacy as a Republican was simple, was he a Republican? After careful deliberation the committee could not answer that question with a yes.”Wahl added that White does not take part in Republican events in the community, and that the committee did not feel comfortable accepting someone who did not vote for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.White said he may run as an independent.“I’m disappointed, but I’m not deterred,” he told the publication."

Billy is a young, queer teen who suddenly has to deal with the painful realities of a quintessential American high school after his mother (Bette Midler) pushes the responsibility for his well-being onto her husband (Larry Pine) years after their divorce.Bloom, who enjoys dressing up and presenting his gender nontraditionally, is forced to find a way to live at his new ultra-conservative high school ― and ultimately decides to run for homecoming queen against one of his biggest bullies, Lynette (Abigal Breslin).“Freakshow” is based on a book of the same name by James St. James, of “Party Monster” and Club Kid culture fame. St. James told HuffPost he hopes the film contributes to a larger conversation about the bullying that queer and genderfluid kids face every day in schools all across America.“The book was written almost 10 years ago, long before the subject of LGBTQ bullying was a national dialogue, and long before LGTBTQ teens were actually running for ― and becoming! ― prom queens and homecoming queens,” St. James told HuffPost. “In that way, it’s ahead of its time. And, in a way, I’m glad that it took so long to make. The themes of bullying feel more relevant now in Trump’s America than they did back then. I hope the movie furthers the discussion of bullying and the acceptance of the genderqueer and genderfluid kids out there who are defiantly making an impact and getting their voices heard.”The film also tackles another important topic: the bonds between queer youth and their straight peers, and how precious these relationships can feel.The central relationship in the film is the one between Bloom and his best friend Flip ― a straight jock whose kindness and compassion literally save Bloom’s life at one point.“The characters of Billy and Flip could not be more different, and yet they find a commonality,” St. James said. “They bond and form a friendship that they both learn from and both grow because of it ... This story feels modern in that it focuses on two boys, one gay one straight, and how they form a powerful lifelong bond based on mutual respect. I hope kids can learn from that.”“Freakshow” is now playing in select cities and through video on demand."

Wynn later agreed to pay the woman a $7.5 million settlement after she filed a report.“The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” Wynn said in a statement shared with HuffPost. “We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits. It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.”Wynn, who turns 76 on Saturday, went on to blame the allegations on his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, who is suing him to lift restrictions preventing her from selling her stock in Wynn Resorts Limited.At one time a rival of fellow casino businessman Donald Trump, Wynn was appointed to head the RNC’s finance committee in January 2017. He has supported both the Democratic and Republican parties with financial contributions over the years. But Wynn threw his support behind the latter during the 2016 election cycle, donating some $833,000 to Republican joint fundraising, according to Forbes.The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations against Wynn. A spokesperson for Wynn Resorts declined to comment on whether the businessman intends to step down from his role with the RNC.In a statement to HuffPost, the Wynn Resorts representative said the company is “committed to operating with the highest ethical standards and maintaining a safe and respectful culture.” The spokesperson also noted that the company requires employees to receive annual anti-harassment training, and that it offers a hotline for employees to submit harassment claims anonymously. “Since the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that hotline regarding Mr. Wynn,” the representative said.Current and former employees who spoke with the Journal said they were nervous about coming forward due to Wynn’s influence in the casino industry. Wynn is worth over $3.5 billion, by Forbes’ estimate. He owns two sprawling Las Vegas casinos ― the Wynn and Encore resorts ― as well as two other complexes in Macau. Another $2.4 billion Wynn casino is in construction in the Boston area.His power and influence, like those of other prominent men who have been accused of recurrent sexual abuse, may have led him to feel invincible in his own domain.Current and former employees told the Journal that Wynn would frequently walk around in short shorts with no underwear, exposing his genitals when he sat to receive a pedicure. He would proposition female employees in his private office and even allegedly asked a former executive to get him the phone numbers of casino cocktail waitresses.“Everybody was petrified,” said Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the resort’s on-site salon, who told the Journal that female employees would hide in bathrooms and back closets when they heard Wynn was approaching.One former employee who Wynn allegedly harassed told the Journal she tried to laugh off his advances.“I would say, ‘Oh Mr. Wynn,’” she recounted. “I was just trying to get on with my job.”This article has been updated with remarks from a Wynn Resorts representative."

One year after Trump first issued an executive order restricting immigration, some of these agencies are reflecting on a policy many religious leaders feel has been detrimental to the country. The Christian refugee agency World Relief, a humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, issued a strong condemnation Thursday of the “various incarnations of the travel ban,” saying the policy has prevented thousands of families fleeing conflict in Syria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Myanmar from seeking shelter in America. “Make no mistake, this has been a net loss for our country,” the organization said in a statement. “Refugee families don’t tear America apart, they make us stronger ... We pray that President Trump and elected officials from each side of the aisle would ensure that we remain a beacon of hope to ALL people seeking a better a way of life.”The president signed his first executive order on immigration on Jan. 27, 2017, and followed it up with two other modified iterations of the ban. All three versions placed travel restrictions on citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. The first two bans also suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the third version of the ban.A watered-down version of the ban went into effect in June and expired in October. That same month, Trump dropped the refugee admissions quota from 110,000 to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year, an all-time low for the United States’ refugee resettlement program. The cuts came at a time when an unprecedented 65 million people are displaced worldwide, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.Six of the nine voluntary agencies that the federal government tasks with refugee resettlement are faith-based, and many have been speaking up for refugees over the past year.In its statement, World Relief said less than 30,000 refugees had been admitted to the United States in 2017, compared to over 99,000 in 2016. Broken out into religious affiliation, World Relief estimated that the number of Christian refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2017 was 63 percent lower than the number admitted in 2016. About 80 percent fewer Muslim refugees were admitted during that time. Even though Trump capped refugee arrivals for 2018 at 45,000, the country is only on track to resettle half that number, World Relief reports.“The combination of drastically reducing the refugee arrivals ceiling with the various executive orders affecting refugees over the past year have harmed persecuted Christians as well as those of other faiths,” World Relief said in its statement.Linda Hartke, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, told HuffPost the ban has meant that vulnerable refugees, including torture survivors, unaccompanied refugee children, persecuted religious minorities and those with severe medical needs, continue to be in harm’s way. “As Christians, we are called to love and serve the neighbors God gives to us and provide places of safety and protection for those fleeing danger,” Hartke said in an email. “The administration’s decisions have been a clear violation of these values, as well as our American ideals of compassion and acceptance. America is diminished when we abandon our values and close our doors on those in need.”The Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS, founded as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, released a video to mark the anniversary of the first travel ban. In it, the writer and actor Scott Rogowsky recounts the history of the ban, which was first enacted on Holocaust Remembrance Day. He also points to the mandate in Jewish scriptures to love and welcome the stranger. “Donald Trump sows fear and proclaims risk,” Rogowsky says in the video. “We are at risk but not from the refugee. We are at risk of losing what America stands for. We are at risk of becoming a country that treats human beings like numbers.”"

All three versions placed travel restrictions on citizens from mainly Muslim-majority countries. The first two bans also suspended the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the third version of the ban.A watered-down version of the ban went into effect in June and expired in October. That same month, Trump dropped the refugee admissions quota from 110,000 to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year, an all-time low for the United States’ refugee resettlement program. The cuts came at a time when an unprecedented 65 million people are displaced worldwide, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.Six of the nine voluntary agencies that the federal government tasks with refugee resettlement are faith-based, and many have been speaking up for refugees over the past year.In its statement, World Relief said less than 30,000 refugees had been admitted to the United States in 2017, compared to over 99,000 in 2016. Broken out into religious affiliation, World Relief estimated that the number of Christian refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2017 was 63 percent lower than the number admitted in 2016. About 80 percent fewer Muslim refugees were admitted during that time. Even though Trump capped refugee arrivals for 2018 at 45,000, the country is only on track to resettle half that number, World Relief reports.“The combination of drastically reducing the refugee arrivals ceiling with the various executive orders affecting refugees over the past year have harmed persecuted Christians as well as those of other faiths,” World Relief said in its statement.Linda Hartke, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, told HuffPost the ban has meant that vulnerable refugees, including torture survivors, unaccompanied refugee children, persecuted religious minorities and those with severe medical needs, continue to be in harm’s way. “As Christians, we are called to love and serve the neighbors God gives to us and provide places of safety and protection for those fleeing danger,” Hartke said in an email. “The administration’s decisions have been a clear violation of these values, as well as our American ideals of compassion and acceptance. America is diminished when we abandon our values and close our doors on those in need.”The Jewish refugee resettlement agency HIAS, founded as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, released a video to mark the anniversary of the first travel ban. In it, the writer and actor Scott Rogowsky recounts the history of the ban, which was first enacted on Holocaust Remembrance Day. He also points to the mandate in Jewish scriptures to love and welcome the stranger. “Donald Trump sows fear and proclaims risk,” Rogowsky says in the video. “We are at risk but not from the refugee. We are at risk of losing what America stands for. We are at risk of becoming a country that treats human beings like numbers.”"

The reports emerged a week after The Guardian published a story detailing widespread misconduct and abuse at the intergovernmental organization.On Thursday, The Guardian followed up its initial investigation to report that Mick Lorentzen, the World Food Programme’s Afghanistan director, and Luiz Loures, deputy executive director of programme at UNAIDS and assistant secretary-general of the U.N., are under investigation for sexual harassment.Italian Insider first reported the investigation of Lorentzen, who has been suspended from his post during a disciplinary process. Loures has not been suspended, The Guardian reported.Allegations of sexual harassment and assault have long plagued the U.N. and were thrown into sharp relief last week after The Guardian published an investigation detailing accounts from current and former employees.In the Jan. 18 story, 15 current and former female U.N. staffers said they had experienced harassment or assault in the past five years. Seven of the women said they had reported the offenses, which ranged from verbal harassment to rape.Dozens of other current and former employees told The Guardian they had witnessed “a culture of silence” at the organization in which victims feared their jobs would be compromised if they came forward about misconduct."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amnh-rebekah-mercer-nyc_us_5a6a6815e4b06e2532661b9c,"Rebekah Mercer’s growing support for climate change denial movements threatens the storied museum’s credibility, the scientists say.",2018-01-26,"Protesters from the group Revolting Lesbians hold placards and chant slogans outside New York City's American Museum of Natural History on Jan. 21, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a685f1600004500138d75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 200 scientists and researchers on Thursday released a public letter urging the American Museum of Natural History to cut ties with Rebekah Mercer ― a right-wing philanthropist and mega-donor to President Donald Trump who has poured millions into think tanks and websites that vilify researchers and deny human-caused climate change.The letter calls Mercer, whose family foundation has donated $4.1 million to the museum over the past four years and who’s sat on its board since 2013, an “anti-science propagandist.”“Rebekah Mercer and the Mercer Family Foundation, political kingmakers and the financiers behind Breitbart News, have given tens of millions to organizations who broadcast climate science denial and block policy and technological solutions to the climate crisis,” the letter reads.The statement launches a new campaign by activists and scientists who last formed a coalition in 2015 to call for the ouster of David Koch, the fossil fuel billionaire who helped bankroll the movement to discredit and attack climate researchers. The coalition hailed victory when the 77-year-old tycoon stepped down from the museum’s board of trustees in January 2016.Last Sunday, a progressive group called Revolting Lesbians staged a protest on the museum’s marble steps facing Manhattan’s Central Park West to demand Mercer’s removal. Calling Mercer “the first lady of the alt-right,” a representative from the group, Anne Maguire, told HuffPost they sent letters to every board member ahead of the rally.In a statement on Thursday, the museum said it believes “human-induced climate change is well-supported by scientific evidence and is one of the most serious issues currently facing our planet.” “As a scientific and educational institution, the Museum deeply respects the work and views of scientists ― both those who work as colleagues at the Museum and those from the broader scientific community,” Roberto Lebron, a spokesman for the museum, said in the statement emailed to HuffPost. “The Museum itself, however, does not make appointment decisions concerning staff or Trustees based on political views.” The Thursday evening announcement comes amid new scrutiny of donor influence over how one of the nation’s top science museums presents the evidence of human-caused climate change. Nearly three weeks ago, Jonah Busch, an environmental economist at the nonpartisan Center for Global Development, accused the museum of promoting misinformation on climate change in its David H. Koch Dinosaur Wing. In a widely-shared Twitter thread, Busch posted photos of a museum plaque that minimized human influence on global warming. While the exhibit said greenhouse gas pollution “may also have an effect on the Earth’s climatic cycles,” it said “there is no reason to think another ice age won’t come.”Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research has found that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farming are enshrouding the Earth in heat-trapping gases, while a research review published in 2015 found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of studies that concluded otherwise. The influx of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions “will postpone the next glacial inception by at least 100,000 years,” according to a 2016 study published in Nature, which Busch cited.“When you’ve got people like Mercer on the board, it just makes it that much harder to give the benefit of doubt when they are putting up inaccurate information about climate change,” Busch, who is not involved in the campaign to oust Mercer from the board, told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. “Something you could give a pass to as an innocuous mistake starts to have the appearance of something more sinister.” At a time when surveys regularly show eroding public trust in newspapers, government agencies and science academies, museums buck the trend. Over 78 percent of Americans agreed that natural history museums were highly credible sources of information, second only to history museums, according to an ongoing national survey conducted by the research firm Impacts with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. By contrast, 67 percent said the same of daily newspapers, and just 51.4 percent of federal agencies.The decline in public trust comes as the Republican-controlled Congress and White House target scientists conducting research that could hurt donors’ profits with probes and investigations they frequently compare to “witch hunts.” In October, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt ― an unabashed climate change contrarian with deep ties to gas and chemical companies he now regulates ― put new rules in place to give more power to industry-funded researchers on the EPA’s science advisory boards. Since taking over as chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology nearly six years ago, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) transformed the committee from a sleepy bastion of bipartisan agreement to a political cudgel and blunt instrument for industry groups. “Science has never been more important to the country, yet it’s under more attack than we’ve seen in decades,” Jon Foley, executive director of the California Academy of Sciences, told HuffPost by phone Thursday. “It’s a bit worrisome to see prominent ― not just donors but trustees ― of major museums on the one hand supporting science, but on the other undermining it by funding groups that are deliberately trying to sabotage science on things like climate change.”In 2015, Foley’s museum announced plans to completely divest from fossil fuels and bar contributions from oil, gas and coal companies. Foley said the decision alienated at least one longtime donor whose wealth came from fossil fuels a few generations back. But he said the move was necessary to preserve the integrity of the California Academy of Sciences’ reputation. “We decided that’s simply incompatible to our mission,” said Foley, who is not involved with the American Museum of Natural History campaign. “When we talk about trustee candidates, it’s not about their politics ― it’s do people support science wholeheartedly, regardless of their opinion of how it affects their business or political ideology.”“Sometimes that means not working with certain people and certain organizations, but that’s OK,” he added. “At the end of the day, it’s better for science and better for a public-serving institution to be OK with this kind of thing.” Mercer and her father, Robert, made their fortune at the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies. The secretive family rose to prominence in 2016 after funding and organizing Trump’s presidential campaign. The Mercers invested at least $10 million into Breitbart News, the right-wing website, and have spent $36.6 million on Republican races and and super PACs since 2010.The Mercer Family Foundation has donated heavily to climate misinformation groups over the years, contributing nearly $5.9 million to the Heartland Institute, a leading proponent of climate science denial, between 2008 and 2016, according to previously unreleased tax filings reviewed by HuffPost. The foundation ramped up spending on climate denial in recent years, giving money to think tanks and groups that spread climate misinformation, including $200,000 to the Oregon Institute of Science and medicine, $150,000 to the CO2 Coalition and $125,000 to the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change. “Their funding is as egregious as the Kochs,” Beka Economopoulos, whose New York-based nonprofit The Natural History Museum organized the letter, told HuffPost. “They’re a lightning rod for controversy. The spotlight of public scrutiny is starting to shine on the Mercers.”This article was updated with additional details from Revolting Lesbians and to reflect the most recent tally of scientists’ signatures."

But the actor was digitally removed from the cover spread shortly before publication, per The Hollywood Reporter.“We made a decision not to include James Franco on the Hollywood cover once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him,” a spokesperson for Vanity Fair confirmed to THR on Thursday.Franco apparently sat for a photo shoot with Annie Leibovitz and was interviewed for the issue, which has been in the works since November. But he was scrubbed from the magazine after numerous women accused Franco of sexual misconduct on Twitter in early January, following the actor’s decision to wear a Time’s Up pin — part of a campaign to combat sexual misconduct amid the #MeToo movement — at the Golden Globes.An explosive Los Angeles Times report soon afterward didn’t help Franco, either.The “Disaster Artist” star denied the allegations made against him during a Jan. 9 appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”“The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,” Franco said then, “but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn’t have a voice for so long.”The actor added that if he has “done something wrong,” he will “fix it.”"

She stood up at a podium, the 155th woman to do so in a Lansing, Michigan courtroom over the past week, and faced both the man she says abused her and Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, the judge who held that man’s fate in her hands. After years of being ignored, disbelieved and silenced, Lorincz and the more than 160 other women Nassar victimized were finally heard. So often, our justice system fails victims of sexual violence, but in Aquilina’s courtroom, 156 women spoke unencumbered as the world watched. Nassar, who pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct, was sentenced on Wednesday to serve 40 to 175 years in prison. (He will be sentenced for three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in another court on Jan. 31.) Media outlets like The New York Times, CNN, ESPN and HuffPost covered Nassar’s case for more than a year before he entered a plea. The number of public accusers rose rapidly in the meantime ― from two to 16 to 100 to 140.But even after months of media coverage, many of the victims felt they were being ignored. They felt as though the public, despite being in the midst of a #MeToo moment, did not care about the stories of female athletes, even when those female athletes formed an army of more than 160 survivors. “I haven’t sensed the outrage,” Nassar survivor Larissa Boyce told HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos just days before the disgraced doctor’s sentencing began. But as woman after woman stood up in that courtroom and began telling her story, something clicked. Perhaps it was the volume of stories ― 156 from victims, and more from coaches and family members. Or maybe it was the simplicity of the setting that got the public to pay attention ― a camera in a courtroom focused on each survivor as she spoke, cutting away only for an occasional glance at Nassar or the judge.The format practically demanded that we listen to each person’s words unedited, resisting “hot takes” and sloppy commentary. Those of us who watched were forced to absorb each word spoken, no matter how unsettling or painful or heart-wrenching or infuriating.The first survivor to deliver a victim impact statement was Kyle Stephens, a former family friend of Nassar’s. Stephens was abused from the age of 6, and when she told her parents at age 12, they didn’t believe her.“Larry Nassar wedged himself between myself and my family, and used his leverage as my parents’ trusted friend to pry us apart until we fractured,” she said. “I was 12 years old when I told my family, ‘When Larry rubs my feet, he uses his penis.’ My parents confronted him and he denied any such action… My parents chose to believe Larry Nassar over me.”Many of the women who spoke after Stephens described being confronted with authority figures who did not listen to or believe their accounts of the abuse they had experienced. At least six women reported Nassar’s actions to administrators at Michigan State University. All were dismissed. One of those women was Boyce, a former gymnast who said she told MSU coach Kathie Klages in 1997 that Nassar had touched her inappropriately, and that Klages replied that she must have misunderstood the procedure. A 2014 MSU Title IX investigation into Nassar’s conduct reached a similar conclusion: that there was no wrongdoing on the doctor’s part, because, according to the Detroit Free Press, “The investigator determined that the woman likely misinterpreted what Nassar did because she didn’t understand the ‘nuanced difference’ between an appropriate osteopathic medical procedure and sexual assault.” “I knew that he abused me,” said gymnast Amanda Thomashow during her victim impact statement. “I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure.”At every turn, these young women were considered to be unreliable narrators of their own experiences. And the result was that a predator had access to a steady stream of young women to abuse for more than two decades. After all, who would believe a girl ― or even a handful of girls ― over a respected, decorated, beloved doctor? As Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman explained, “From the time we were little, we are taught to trust doctors.” And despite the fact that Nassar consistently made Raisman feel “uncomfortable,” she says she “felt guilty” for doubting his authority. “I assumed I was the problem for thinking badly of you,” she stated. Research has shown that when women report being in pain, they are more likely than men to be undertreated for that pain. Similarly, when women come forward and say they have experienced sexual violence, they are often doubted. Doctors, especially male ones, are assumed to be trustworthy. Young women aren’t even considered experts on their own internal lives.The phrase “believe women” only exists because the default has traditionally been not to. But for women to be believed, they must first be heard. Thanks to Judge Aquilina, Larry Nassar’s victims were. It was Aquilina who decided that she would give time to any accuser who wanted to come to Michigan and speak. The court initially expected that 88 women would give statements. But as the week went on, more women decided that they, too, wanted their day in court and their chance to face their abuser. They had become a collective ― an “army of survivors.”It was also Aquilina who made the decision to directly address every woman who gave a statement, looking them in the eye and thanking them for being there. She often added assurances that their testimony would matter. We tend to think of courtrooms as cold, methodical, legal places. Aquilina’s courtroom was full of emotion and empathy, at least for Nassar’s victims.“People will listen to you. I’ve listened to you,” she told Olympian Jordyn Wieber. “You are really very strong, not just as an athlete; as a woman, as a survivor.” (The judge has also faced criticism for crossing a line in the commentary she directed to Nassar himself.) Since the 1991 Supreme Court case Payne v. Tennessee, the right of victims to deliver impact statements in front of the court has been widely recognized. But rarely does the public get to see those statements delivered.“Victims testify every day in every courtroom about the harms they have suffered at the hands of perpetrators,” said Jennifer Gentile Long, CEO of AEquitas: The Prosecutors’ Resource on Violence Against Women. “In many ways the proceedings [over the past week] gave a voice to all of those victims.”And Nassar’s victims’ words reverberated far beyond the courtroom, even making their way onto signs at Women’s Marches across the nation. “Little girls don’t stay little forever. They grow into strong women that destroy your world,” read one sign, quoting Stephens. “We are here, we have our voices and we are not going anywhere,” read another. A third, cheekier sign simply stated: “What Aly Raisman said.” After years of being made to feel isolated, silent and small, Nassar’s survivors had, as Raisman predicted, become “a force.”"

At least six women reported Nassar’s actions to administrators at Michigan State University. All were dismissed. One of those women was Boyce, a former gymnast who said she told MSU coach Kathie Klages in 1997 that Nassar had touched her inappropriately, and that Klages replied that she must have misunderstood the procedure. A 2014 MSU Title IX investigation into Nassar’s conduct reached a similar conclusion: that there was no wrongdoing on the doctor’s part, because, according to the Detroit Free Press, “The investigator determined that the woman likely misinterpreted what Nassar did because she didn’t understand the ‘nuanced difference’ between an appropriate osteopathic medical procedure and sexual assault.” “I knew that he abused me,” said gymnast Amanda Thomashow during her victim impact statement. “I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure.”At every turn, these young women were considered to be unreliable narrators of their own experiences. And the result was that a predator had access to a steady stream of young women to abuse for more than two decades. After all, who would believe a girl ― or even a handful of girls ― over a respected, decorated, beloved doctor? As Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman explained, “From the time we were little, we are taught to trust doctors.” And despite the fact that Nassar consistently made Raisman feel “uncomfortable,” she says she “felt guilty” for doubting his authority. “I assumed I was the problem for thinking badly of you,” she stated. Research has shown that when women report being in pain, they are more likely than men to be undertreated for that pain. Similarly, when women come forward and say they have experienced sexual violence, they are often doubted. Doctors, especially male ones, are assumed to be trustworthy. Young women aren’t even considered experts on their own internal lives.The phrase “believe women” only exists because the default has traditionally been not to. But for women to be believed, they must first be heard. Thanks to Judge Aquilina, Larry Nassar’s victims were. It was Aquilina who decided that she would give time to any accuser who wanted to come to Michigan and speak. The court initially expected that 88 women would give statements. But as the week went on, more women decided that they, too, wanted their day in court and their chance to face their abuser. They had become a collective ― an “army of survivors.”It was also Aquilina who made the decision to directly address every woman who gave a statement, looking them in the eye and thanking them for being there. She often added assurances that their testimony would matter. We tend to think of courtrooms as cold, methodical, legal places. Aquilina’s courtroom was full of emotion and empathy, at least for Nassar’s victims.“People will listen to you. I’ve listened to you,” she told Olympian Jordyn Wieber. “You are really very strong, not just as an athlete; as a woman, as a survivor.” (The judge has also faced criticism for crossing a line in the commentary she directed to Nassar himself.) Since the 1991 Supreme Court case Payne v. Tennessee, the right of victims to deliver impact statements in front of the court has been widely recognized. But rarely does the public get to see those statements delivered.“Victims testify every day in every courtroom about the harms they have suffered at the hands of perpetrators,” said Jennifer Gentile Long, CEO of AEquitas: The Prosecutors’ Resource on Violence Against Women. “In many ways the proceedings [over the past week] gave a voice to all of those victims.”And Nassar’s victims’ words reverberated far beyond the courtroom, even making their way onto signs at Women’s Marches across the nation. “Little girls don’t stay little forever. They grow into strong women that destroy your world,” read one sign, quoting Stephens. “We are here, we have our voices and we are not going anywhere,” read another. A third, cheekier sign simply stated: “What Aly Raisman said.” After years of being made to feel isolated, silent and small, Nassar’s survivors had, as Raisman predicted, become “a force.”"
82,POLITICS,"As Republicans Attack The DOJ And FBI, Sessions Vows To Stand Up To 'Unfair' Criticism",Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doj-fbi-sessions-gop-attacks_us_5a6b7e16e4b0ddb658c63d1d,GOP politicians have been questioning the integrity of the nation's premier law enforcement agency in an effort to undermine the Mueller probe.,2018-01-26,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions stands during a news conference, in Washington, D.C., Dec. 15, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6b7ef91d000026006aceff.jpeg?cache=n6y045SDDw&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With his Justice Department and FBI facing broad attacks from some of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that he’ll stand up to any “unfair” attacks on the men and women of the Justice Department he now oversees.Sessions, in a speech in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday, mentioned the “sharp criticisms” of DOJ coming from Congress. He said the Justice Department demands “the highest level of integrity, ethics, and professionalism from every person” in it, and that all employees are expected to “advance the mission of the Department honorably” in the service of the American people.“If anyone falls short of these high standards, we will not hesitate to take appropriate action, and we will do so in accordance with the rules and procedures of the Department,” Sessions said. “And, while we are open to fair criticism, we will of course defend our investigators and prosecutors from criticism that is unfair.”Such criticism has recently been coming from within Sessions’ own party. As they’ve sought to protect President Donald Trump from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, some Republicans on Capitol Hill have made broad attacks on the FBI’s integrity. They’ve suggested there’s a “deep state” operation against Trump, and that there was a “secret society” working within the FBI to stop him from ever taking office. After reading a secret memo authored by Republican staffers, members of Congress claimed to know about “absolutely shocking,” “sickening” and “jaw-dropping” information that was “worse than Watergate” and comparable to the actions of the KGB.The comments from members of his party ― and from his own boss ― have put Sessions in a tricky spot. He has a delicate relationship with the president, who blames him for the existence of the probe threatening his administration and members of his family.“He has his own detractor, and that detractor is the president of the United States,” Ron Hosko, a former FBI official, told HuffPost before Sessions’ speech. “He probably senses that he’s at risk, because of the recusal [from the Russia probe] and because of the deference to [Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein and the subsequent appointment of Bob Mueller. That’s stuck in Donald Trump’s craw, period.”Hosko, now part of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, praised Sessions’ work on law enforcement issues. But he said he wished the attorney general would step out in the bureau’s defense.“Sessions is at risk. How quickly does he step up to back the men and women of the FBI while this scandal ― which is what it is ― kind of plays itself out?” Hosko said, prior to Sessions’ remarks on Friday. “I would certainly love it if the attorney general steps up and says, ‘Hey, look, let’s keep in mind there are 30-some thousand FBI employees who are out there defending our freedom and protecting Americans every day. We’ve got to keep that in mind as we work our way through this.’”In his speech, Sessions said he loves the Justice Department and the “great people” who work there. “The vast majority are dedicated, hardworking, patriotic Americans. It’s an honor to serve with them,” he said.A Justice Department official told HuffPost that Sessions’ comments on the criticism DOJ has been facing were added to his speech in recent days.Sessions said his goal was “absolutely eliminating political bias or favoritism ― in either direction ― from our investigations and prosecutions,” saying that is the “antithesis of what the Department stands for, and I won’t tolerate it.”Sessions said the best way to respond to criticism is for DOJ to “hear the concerns, and act on them professionally, fairly and completely, in order to maintain the public’s trust in their government.”He also said the department should work on “identifying mistakes of the past, and correcting them for the future,” and should address problems “head on” instead of “sweeping them under the rug.”Criticism from Congress, Sessions said, isn’t a bad thing.“We welcome Congress as a partner in this effort,” he said. “When they learn of a problem and start asking questions, that is a good thing. Sunlight truly is the best disinfectant. Truth produces confidence.”Sessions has not confirmed that he offered his resignation to Trump. His Justice Department has refused to confirm or deny the existence of his reported resignation letter, claiming that disclosing the existence of such a letter would violate Sessions’ personal privacy.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

83,POLITICS,DCCC Makes First Investment In Pennsylvania Democrat's Special Election Bid,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dccc-conor-lamb-pennsylvania-special-election_us_5a6a70ade4b06e2532661eb2,"To start, the party organ is buying $224,000 worth of TV ads.",2018-01-26,"Democrat Conor Lamb drew a crowd of about 85 people at an American Legion post in Houston, Pennsylvania, on Jan. 13, 2018.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a79c32d00001f00942d40.jpeg?cache=Gv5oq44uwM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making a modest initial investment in support of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate running in the special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional district.The DCCC, which helps elect Democrats to the U.S. House of Representatives, purchased $224,000 of television ads boosting Lamb, HuffPost confirmed with a Democratic source familiar with the ad buy. The ads will air for two weeks beginning on Jan. 30. Election Day is March 13.Although the contribution is relatively small, it could kick off larger contributions from big donors and outside groups. The National Republican Congressional Committee, which elects House Republicans, responded on Friday with a $300,000 ad buy of its own. The GOP group blocked out broadcast space from Monday through Election Day to air the campaign spots.Lamb, a 33-year-old former assistant U.S. attorney and veteran of the Marines, has thus far mounted his underdog bid against Republican Rick Saccone, a 59-year-old conservative state representative, without any meaningful backing from the national party. Lamb has nonetheless attracted the endorsement of the federal PAC End Citizens United and Daily Kos, a liberal site through which he has raised nearly $49,000.The two candidates are vying to fill a seat vacated by Tim Murphy, an anti-abortion Republican congressman who resigned in October following revelations that he asked a woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion. At first glance, Saccone should be a shoo-in in the district. President Donald Trump won the southwestern Pennsylvania district, which the state GOP gerrymandered to favor Republicans, by nearly 20 percentage points.But Lamb, a polished speaker with deep roots in the suburbs south of Pittsburgh, is the first formidable candidate the Democratic Party has fielded in the district in several election cycles. In a year of higher-than-normal Democratic enthusiasm, Lamb has drawn significant crowds at campaign events ― often in historically Democratic industrial towns that have increasingly trended conservative in national elections.Lamb also has the backing of the steel- and coal-heavy district’s influential labor unions. Murphy, who ran uncontested the last two cycles, aligned himself enough with organized labor to secure the endorsement of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in 2016. Saccone, by contrast, is a supporter of right-to-work laws and other anti-labor measures.Lamb’s candidacy has spooked top Republicans, including Trump, who held a thinly-veiled pro-Saccone event in the district last week that was supposedly to promote the president’s tax cut law.Republican super PACs have also dumped millions of dollars of dark money in the race. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC associated with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), announced this week that it was adding another $1.5 million in TV ads to its effort to take down Lamb. Republicans have sought to characterize Lamb as a liberal stooge for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).Lamb has insisted he would not vote for Pelosi as leader and emphasized his traditional values and commitment to bipartisanship.In Lamb’s second campaign ad, he fields a question from a military veteran in the district who is angry about partisan gridlock.“In the military, as you know, when you don’t get the job done, you get relieved,” Lamb tells the man. “We need more of that in Washington.”This story has been updated to reflect new information about the size of the DCCC ad buy, as well as the NRCC’s investment in response."

His attempt to defend himself afterward didn’t go so well, either. Hannity had blasted a New York Times report that said President Donald Trump tried to fire special counsel Robert Mueller last year. But by the end of his show, Hannity admitted that Fox News had just confirmed the story. Then, for good measure, he cut to footage of a police chase and car crash. On social media, Hannity tried to explain his reluctance to put any stock in the Times report. Then, he added: Hannity confessed that he added the coloring to the above photo. Yet what he didn’t admit was that he posed for the Times feature story last year.“You want to know the truth? I gave them that picture,” he said on his radio show at the time, after first complaining about the photo, per the Hollywood Reporter.That little detail was quickly pointed out to him along with some other criticism: "
