0,THE WORLDPOST,The Istanbul Nightclub Attack Finally United A Divided Country,"Ilgin Yorulmaz, ContributorFreelance Turkish Journalist, East West Center Fellow",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/istanbul-nightclub-attack-unity_us_586be3f8e4b0d9a5945ca474,"Perhaps there’s something Turkey and the West can learn from this tragedy: ""the opposite of life is not death but indifference.""",2017-01-05,"In the face of senseless carnage, reactions of solidarity gave some Turks hope in tragedy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586be61d1500002300916ec8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The routine is now eerily familiar for Turkish expats around the world. It starts with a quiet ping from their smartphone’s WhatsApp messaging app late at night. A sad face emoji appears as the first line of the chat. Their hands shake as they try to open and read the rest of the message. When they do, a devastating screenshot, usually captured from CNN Turk or some other news channel, appears and announces yet another terrorist act in Turkey. The attack on New Year’s Eve at one of Istanbul’s most popular nightclubs patronized by Turks and foreigners alike left at least 39 people dead and 69 wounded.It is fast becoming branded as “Turkey’s Bataclan,” named after the nightclub attacked in Paris in November 2015. My home in Turkey is five minutes from Reina. I used to walk by it every day.The attack came as many Turks abroad ― myself included ― were preparing to sit down to dinner in their adopted countries and as Turks at home had already gone to bed after New Year’s Eve festivities. Both groups desperately wished for a better 2017 for their home country.They were met with the terrible news and once again, their hopes for normalcy dashed.Only this time, they may have sensed something unusual. The reaction on the ground from all sides was inclusive and not divisive, giving them at least some reprieve in the face of this senseless carnage. The most significant post-attack statement for secular Turks, as well as those lucky survivors at Reina nightclub that evening, their families, and many others who could potentially have been celebrating there on any night, came from a rather unexpected character whom nobody associates with the liberal profile frequenting venues like Reina.Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s soft-spoken top cleric and president of Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı, or the Religious Affairs Directorate, which is the state body in charge of religious administration, took it upon himself to reassure everyone, liberals and conservatives alike, that, “there is no difference whether this barbarous action would be done in a bazaar or a place of worship or in an entertainment place.” The Religious Affairs Directorate isn’t normally the official source to go to after a terrorist attack. But in this case, before Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım and even before President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan made a statement, Görmez identified that, “the only nuance” is that this time, the attack “aims to divide the nation and confront people from different lifestyles by inciting them.” Investigations are still under way. However, compared to past attacks, most of which were aimed at security personnel or tourist spots, the attack on Reina seems to target a secular side of Islam. It is seen by many in Turkey as a confrontation of the democratic Islam this country is famous for succeeding at. According to reports, victims came from 14 different nationalities. Except a few, all foreigners who died in the attack are believed to be Muslims from countries such as Morocco, Tunisia and Lebanon, each of which celebrate the new year in their own ways and not necessarily following a materialistic tradition. Even the pope showed sympathy for the victims and solidarity with the survivors in his first address of the new year in Rome.There is no doubt the emphasis in Görmez’s sentence is on “different lifestyles.” That’s what makes this attack ― one in so many others in my home country ― stand out. Whatever its message may be, secularists fear that what happened that night was additionally an attack on their own way of living. Which is why Görmez’s kind of tolerant approach came both as a surprise and a relief, considering the Religious Affairs Directorate’s Friday sermon just one day before the attack, dissuading the public from “non-Muslim” actions like excessive New Year’s Eve celebrations, which the directorate declared “unlawful.”Turkey is a wonderfully diverse country with people on a varying scale of piousness, living side by side. It’s the country where Sinem Uyanık, a young, modern club-goer and survivor of the Reina attack with a completely different lifestyle from a conservative female in headscarf, chose the same last prayers, reportedly reciting Allah’s and the Prophet Muhammad’s name, believing that she would certainly die that night. It’s the country where many LGBTQ members, who are among the most marginalized groups in Turkish society, choose to fast during Ramadan like their religious friends. It’s also the country where literally next door to Reina, the attacked nightclub, stands Huqqa, an equally chic café. Dubbed the “Reina for the conservatives,” it serves its namesake shisha or hookah, non-alcoholic drinks and a halal menu. Living in Bebek-Ortaköy area for a long time, I have always liked the vibe of Huqqa combining the Bosphorus view with a conservative menu since I don’t drink. It is against this backdrop that Görmez’s comments are much needed to unite an increasingly divided nation where the power struggle between Islamists, the secularist army and the elites is not new but exacerbated. Turkey has long been suffering from the toxic side effects of increased polarization between secularists and conservatives. So much so that they even have a term for it: ötekileştirme, or “otherization,” meaning intolerance toward the opposite side and labeling it as the other. There have been serious provocations by both conservatives and secularists especially during the Gezi protests of 2013. Secularists have always thought of the conservatives as the backward and the uneducated, who are forever trying to scrap Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s modernization efforts since the founding of the Turkish republic in 1923. In a statement delivered Wednesday to a group of muhtars or village heads, that represent the heart of Turkey, President Erdoğan pointed out what he saw as a double standard, and urged people to compare the Reina attack in cosmopolitan Istanbul to those like the bombing of a wedding in Gaziantep in Southeast Anatolia this past summer: “Would the same reactions be shown if the attacker committed this act not there that night, but the next day at a marketplace?” he asked. He also added, “In Turkey, nobody’s lifestyle is systematically under threat, we would never allow this. … Just as it is wrong to not be able to tolerate an imam’s call to prayer, it is also wrong to pressure someone who doesn’t do namaz [praying five times a day].” Based on this statement and his disapproval in the past of the discrimination against girls who were denied entry to schools because of their headscarves, secularists want President Erdoğan not to tolerate the increase of violent attempts by the Islamist vigilantes who frequently storm Western art and music events in big cities on the grounds that alcohol is being consumed. Fueled by the conservative media, marginal religious chauvinism was again on the rise in the run-up to New Year’s Eve.Meanwhile, the killer of so many innocent people in Reina that night is still on the loose. My friends who are planning to meet these days are looking for a place that the killer won’t think to find them, one where they can take shelter if he strikes again. Putting aside these anxieties, which is pretty much the only way millions of people in Turkey can function at the moment, there is one bitter truth that the Reina attack has revealed. One friend, an IT specialist, put it in writing beautifully in this post on her LinkedIn account: “My friends overseas used to ask me if I was OK after explosions in Turkey and yet I am with disappointment noticing that they didn’t ask after the last three explosions/shootings…” she wrote.It hurts her a lot that her friends abroad “got used to these strange (from their point of view) and deadly explosions taking place in Istanbul.” She shudders at the thought of Istanbul becoming a war zone like the once-beautiful Beirut from where some of the casualties at Reina came from. “The opposite of life is not death but indifference between life and death,” Elie Wiesel, the late Holocaust survivor and human rights champion, once said. Perhaps for foreigners, the Reina attack hit home more than other attacks in Turkey. It resonated, because not only were victims of so many different nationalities, but it could have happened in any club anywhere in the world, and not just in a Muslim-majority country. Our foreign friends do care of course and ask us, liberals and conservatives, what this latest chaos in Turkey is all about. Most of us inside and outside Turkey are watching the events in our country with increasing alarm. Like them, we have no clue in these crazy times. Those still in Turkey take one day at a time, telling themselves that everything is eventually going to get better, much like people who whistle while walking through the graveyard at night. They are under incredible pressure from trauma after trauma created by terror attacks, a failed coup d’etat and a refugee crisis.These people need the West more than any time.They need its media to understand that Turkey, a NATO country, has suffered more deaths in the last couple of years than, “anything France, Belgium, Germany and the U.S. have had to counter,” according to Guardian, and not to concentrate only on what President Erdoğan may or may not have done against these traumas. They need Western citizens to stop pitying them and to start to actively support them and pay attention to ordinary people like them, not just when a nightclub is attacked. The same selective attitude goes for the entire Middle East: On the same day of the Reina attack, a blast in a Baghdad market killed at least 28 people and injured some 50 others. But the attack barely made major news channels.My people are afraid that the West will soon become indifferent to them and like Baghdad, Istanbul will be dismissed as a war zone. In short, they need their allies and friends in London, Berlin and elsewhere to go beyond just showing solidarity.As a non-drinker, I fully share President Erdoğan’s tolerant view that even if these people were drinking and not praying, they still shouldn’t feel unsafe. In that sense, this horrific attack, because it hit at the heart of Turkey’s religious pluralism, could at least help heal those divides between Turkey’s two sides. Only then can we end these pings and sad emojis that wake us up in the middle of the night."
1,POLITICS,Trump’s Trade Rep Pick Gets Some Actual Praise From Progressives,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-trade-representative-trump-robert-lighthizer_us_586c106ae4b0de3a08f9de09,"OK, the praise is not wildly enthusiastic, but still.",2017-01-04,Donald Trump made bringing back manufacturing jobs a centerpiece of his campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c12f11500002300916ff5.jpeg?cache=kxi3hDZ2hQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Robert Lighthizer, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to serve as the next U.S. trade representative, is drawing some positive reviews from progressive critics of current U.S. trade policies.They look at his history and predict he’ll prioritize greater enforcement of existing trade laws ― to the benefit of American workers ― over signing onto new trade agreements.In fact, their biggest concern about Lighthizer’s nomination is that he will likely not be the main decision-maker on trade policy in the Trump administration.Lighthizer served as a deputy U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration, during which time he helped broker a 1985 deal with Japan, Germany and other countries that is widely credited with creating more favorable conditions for American manufacturing. Today he’s a Washington-based partner with powerhouse law firm Skadden whose clients include American manufacturers accusing other nations of unfair trade practices. He has also been a vocal critic of China’s trading relationship with the U.S.Trump made bashing trade deals in general, and the terms of U.S. trade with China and Mexico in particular, a key theme of his winning presidential campaign. Many liberal trade experts share his broad critique that recent free trade agreements have been structured in ways that disadvantage American workers ― even if those experts typically frame their arguments in far less nationalistic terms and do not agree with Trump on all of the solutions.Those shared concerns were evident in several progressives’ warm words for Lighthizer.“What sets [Lighthizer] aside among high-level Republican trade experts is that for decades his views have been shaped by the pragmatic outcomes of trade agreements and policies rather than fealty to any particular ideology or theory,” said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.She acknowledged that Lighthizer will likely not advance a progressive vision on trade. “But he also has had quite a different perspective on trade policy than the Republican congressional leaders and most of Trump’s other cabinet nominees who have supported the TPP and every past trade deal,” she added.A number of incoming Trump officials ― including Vice President-elect Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, Trump’s choice to head the National Economic Council; and Trump’s picks for secretary of state, secretary of defense and ambassador to China ― have publicly backed the mammoth Trans-Pacific Partnership, Wallach noted. Lighthizer, for his part, has disparaged “the recent blind faith some Republicans have shown toward free trade.”Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who co-wrote a paper with Wallach outlining a “progressive approach to globalization,” called the Lighthizer pick “interesting.”Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, described the USTR pick as “way more experienced” in his field than many of Trump’s other picks.“He’s more willing to fight back against tactics by trade partners that exacerbate trade imbalances than the typical Republican, or even Democrat, U.S. trade representative,” said Bernstein.Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an organization jointly funded by the steel industry and the United Steelworkers union, was more effusive in his praise.Citing Lighthizer’s experience obtaining penalties against foreign companies that violate U.S. trade laws and his record in the Reagan administration, Paul described him as a “great pick.”“Mr. Lighthizer’s selection as USTR — as well as that of Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, the director of the new White House National Trade Council — is hopefully a signal that the incoming Trump administration intends to take on trade cheats like China, but the proof is always in the policy,” Paul said in a statement.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) struck a more cautious note in a statement on Lighthizer’s nomination.“We need to dramatically reorient our trade policy so it helps working families, not giant multinational corporations. I plan to ask Mr. Lighthizer whether he shares that goal and has a plan for achieving it,” Warren said.The Trump transition team’s press release announcing Lighthizer’s selection said he “will work in close coordination” with Ross and Navarro. And transition spokeswoman Jessica Ditto told The Huffington Post that “all of our trade positions will work together to achieve the President’s agenda in a collaborative fashion.” But Trump’s team previously indicated that Commerce Secretary-designate Ross will be the administration’s top trade policymaker, Reuters reported.Ross has received a more mixed reception among the labor unions and other progressive organizations that make up the Democratic Party’s trade skeptic wing. A billionaire investor who specializes in buying up distressed companies, he has won past accolades from unions for saving American manufacturing jobs. But he often demanded steep concessions ― a process that Paul once likened to “trauma surgery” that saves a patient’s life at the cost of a limb.Ross also argues that rolling back regulations and cutting corporate taxes ― policies commonly opposed by progressive critics of trade deals ― are key to boosting U.S. exports.On balance, then, Ross’ apparent role at the helm of Trump trade policy undermines some of the positive impact of the Lighthizer selection, according to Shane Larson, legislative director of the Communication Workers of America. Larson emphasized Ross’s support for the TPP, which Larson’s union helped lead the fight against. He also pointed to a comment Ross made in 2004 touting a plan to open a factory in Guatemala because it would allow his company to pay “realistic wages.”“With Wilbur Ross as the nominee as Commerce Secretary, we’re troubled that the sort of pro-TPP sentiments he and many of the other pro-corporate ‘free trade’ Cabinet nominees have expressed are what will dominate the Trump Administration’s thinking on trade,” Larson said.Larson’s caveats illustrate the difficult path that liberal critics must navigate when it comes to Trump’s trade policies. Many of these progressives challenged the Obama administration for not cracking down harder on China’s currency devaluation and fought the outgoing president bitterly over the TPP.At the same time, they oppose policies that try to boost domestic manufacturing at the expense of labor and environmental standards ― two areas that Trump has demonstrated little concern about. And they are wary of enabling a president-elect many regard as a racist demagogue.Bernstein said he would like to see “a lot more nuance” in the incoming administration’s trade plans. Currently, the president-elect is focusing on tough posturing toward China, which Bernstein called “about ten years misplaced,” and threatening major new tariffs against foreign countries, “which simply invite retaliation.”“Beyond claiming credit for stuff that would likely have happened anyway, what’s the plan?” Bernstein asked."
2,POLITICS,California AG Will Not Appeal Ejection Of Orange County DA In Notorious Mass-Murder Case,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/orange-county-california-district-attorney-recuse-appeal_us_586c65b1e4b0d9a5945d172b,"The attorney general's office, as it prepares to take over one murder case, also fights the removal of the DA's office in another one.",2017-01-04,Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has been criticized in a wide-ranging jailhouse informant scandal.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c73971500002e00e9e4da.jpeg?cache=Ur9KLPuZI5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES ― The California attorney general’s office will not appeal a decision that tossed Orange County’s entire district attorney’s office off a high-profile mass murder case over its involvement in a jailhouse informant scandal.“Our office has decided not to seek review,” said Kristin Ford, press secretary for the state’s AG office, in an email late Tuesday to The Huffington Post. The case involves Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing his ex-wife and seven other people at a Seal Beach hair salon in 2011. The investigation into the jailhouse informant program arose when Dekraai’s lawyer found that his client had been put in a cell next to a known snitch. Since then, the scope, secrecy and alleged malfeasance surrounding the county’s jail informant program has become a centerpiece of the Dekraai case and more than a dozen others.The state attorney general’s office will now take over as the prosecution in Dekraai’s penalty phase.Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals, who has been presiding over the Dekraai case, ruled in 2015 to recuse the DA’s office. In November, a three-judge panel of the state’s 4th District Court of Appeal, in a blistering opinion, agreed with Goethals, saying that the DA’s office had a “disqualifying conflict of interest,” noting its “substantial” failures in turning over evidence. “The magnitude of the systemic problems cannot be overlooked,” the District Court panel said.The justices also had excoriated Attorney General Kamala Harris’ office for arguing that Goethals’ decision to eject the DA’s office was “a remedy in search of a conflict.” “Nonsense,” the court responded. “The court recused the OCDA only after lengthy evidentiary hearings where it heard a steady stream of evidence regarding improper conduct by the prosecution team. To suggest the trial judge prejudged the case is reckless and grossly unfair. These proceedings were a search for the truth.”The court also criticized Harris’ office for arguing that the responsibility rested solely on the shoulders of the sheriff’s department and that the DA’s office was not to blame for the informant program.For the past three years, the Orange County district attorney’s office and sheriff’s department have been embroiled in a sprawling jailhouse informant scandal ― one that may have involved the violation of multiple defendants’ civil rights and that threatens to upend a number of already settled cases."
3,POLITICS,Judge Sides With Dreamers Over In-State Tuition In Georgia,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-daca-tuition_us_586d1d1ae4b0de3a08fa5bb4,Young undocumented immigrants don't get to take advantage of those rates just yet.,2017-01-04,"More than 23,400 undocumented young people in Georgia have received protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d256c1900002a000e2eba.jpeg?cache=rLWNHDPdsQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Georgia’s ban on in-state tuition for young undocumented immigrants with deferred action could be in jeopardy after a court ruling ― that is, if these young people retain any protections when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.A superior court judge ruled on Tuesday that recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, are eligible to receive in-state tuition at Georgia colleges and universities. The more than 23,400 DACA recipients living in Georgia currently aren’t able to receive the tuition discounts given to their peers, meaning they must pay thousands of dollars more for college even if they grew up in the state.The ruling doesn’t mean that DACA recipients, often called Dreamers, will immediately be able to pay in-state tuition, thanks to a separate court’s opinion, and the state university system’s board of regents’ plans to appeal. Plus, DACA may soon cease to exist. Trump has promised to dismantle the program as soon as he becomes president, which could lead to Dreamers losing their work permits and the ability to get driver’s licenses and, in many places, in-state tuition. Still, this week’s ruling was a victory for Dreamers and immigrant rights advocates who have been fighting against Georgia’s in-state tuition policies, particularly since the state’s Supreme Court ruled last February that DACA recipients weren’t eligible to sue the board of regents in the first place. That ruling didn’t determine whether the Dreamers should or should not get in-state tuition ― just that the board of regents is shielded from legal liability under the principle of “sovereign immunity.”The latest ruling gets at the more central question of whether DACA makes Dreamers eligible for in-state tuition if they or their parent lived in the state continuously for at least a year before enrollment. Fulton Superior Court Chief Judge Gail Tusan came down on the side of the Dreamers. In-state tuition in Georgia is granted to legal residents of the state, based both on a 2008 state law and the board of regents’ policy. Some leaders there say that means DACA recipients are ineligible, based on their immigration status.But the federal government considers DACA recipients to have what’s known as “lawful presence” in the United States. It’s not the same as lawful status ― it lasts only as long as their DACA permit does ― but it’s enough for many states to consider them residents for purposes of tuition rates and driver’s licenses.Tusan ruled that the state university system must apply the federal definition of lawful presence for DACA recipients, which would make them eligible for in-state tuition.“Defendants have refused to accept the federally established lawful presence of plaintiffs and many other similarly situated students ― students who are Georgia taxpayers, workers, and graduates of Georgia public high schools pursuing an affordable option for higher education,” she wrote. “Such refusal of a faithful performance of their duties is unreasonable and creates a defect of legal justice that has already negatively impacted thousands of Georgia students.”Along with the board of regents’ plan to appeal, Republican state Sen. Josh McKoon said he would file a bill to prevent people from paying in-state tuition rates if they do not have legal status, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Georgia is the state with the eighth-highest number of DACA recipients, although it’s unclear how many would be seek in-state tuition if it became available ― some may have already finished college or may not plan to pursue it, or may be ineligible based on the length of time they continuously resided in the state.Twenty states ― including California and Texas, where the largest populations of DACA recipients live ― allow certain undocumented immigrants to pay in-state tuition rates. Six states, including Georgia, block undocumented immigrants from receiving in-state tuition. Of course, the entire suit will not matter if Trump ends DACA entirely, as Georgia Senior Assistant Attorney General Russell Willard noted during a hearing on the lawsuit in December.“Regardless of how one feels about the results, there has been a national election,” Willard said, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “There is going to be a new administration in January. And the future of the DACA program is very much in doubt with the incoming administration.”"

But residents of the town and their allies across the state and country have come up with several ingenious ways to show that love is stronger than the hate.The rally was initially proposed by the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, according to the Associated Press. Site publisher Andrew Anglin, who has been labeled an extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center, authored several posts calling for a rally against “Jews, Jewish businesses and everyone who supports either.” He was reportedly reacting to a claim that Sherry Spencer, mother of the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and a resident of Whitefish, was being harassed because of her son’s ties to the so-called “alt-right” movement, a branch of conservatism that mixes racism with white nationalism and populism. The Daily Stormer called for an “old fashioned troll storm” and posted personal contact information of several Jewish residents of Whitefish and members of the local advocacy group “Love Lives Here In The Flathead Valley.” According to the Associated Press, the Jewish residents, their families, and business owners who have supported “Love Lives Here” in the past have received anti-Semitic messages and threats in the days since the website’s call to action. “Love Lives Here” has denied claims that the organization harassed Sherry Spencer. Anglin told ABC Fox Montana on Monday that his march will take place on January 15 and claimed that he’s received donations to help ship people in. Whitefish police chief Bill Dial has said in the past that he doesn’t believe the march will actually materialize, although his department is working with federal and local authorities to plan for it, if it does occur.After hearing reports about the proposed rally, the Montana Human Rights Network teamed up with the Justus & Karin Rosenberg Foundation, a Jewish organization, to issue a challenge to deter the march.The Foundation is encouraging people to make a donation to the MHRN for every minute of the rally. The funds for the project will go towards purposes that the neo-Nazis detest, such as increased security for Jews and Jewish institutions, trainings for community members on how to de-escalate and intervene in hate incidents, and educational events about the dangers of white supremacy and racism.The JKR Foundation made an initial pledge of $10 for every minute of the march, up to $2,500.Kenneth S. Stern, executive director of the Brooklyn-based JKR Foundation, told The Huffington Post that he hopes the pledge drive gives people something tangible to do in response to the proposed march.“The march will or will not happen, but the underlying problems of hatred will not disappear,” Stern said. “This will help institutions and structures that will serve the community in the long haul.” MHRN co-director Rachel Carroll Rivas told The Huffington Post that they’ve received pledges from hundreds of people in the last few hours, from the Jewish community in Montana, and local and national allies.“Hopefully having folks pledge per minute the racists march, deters them from doing so,” Carroll Rivas told HuffPost. “Maybe we raise no money, and that’s the best thing, or we do raise the funds. Either way, we’ll take those funds and put them towards things white supremacists hate.”Montana’s Democratic and Republican lawmakers spoke out against the proposed rally in an open letter, warning that those who seek to publicize anti-Semitic views” shall find “no safe haven” in Montana.Carroll Rivas told The Huffington Post that since President-elect Donald Trump’s election, her organizations has received a marked increase in reports of hate activity, ranging from graffiti using Nazi symbols, to hate language being directed to people on the street. She added that a number of hate incidents have happened in local schools.Carroll Rivas tied the uptick to the candidacy and election of Trump, whom she believes emboldened the radical right.“It’s more important now than ever for folks to get in organization and to be involved and to respond, to stand up and resist,” Carroll Rivas said. Jessica Laferriere and Dominica Cleveras, two residents of Montana’s Flathead Valley, are gearing up to do just that. With the support of “Love Lives Here” and MHRN, the two friends are organizing a “Love Not Hate” community gathering on January 7, in Whitefish’s Depot Park. The community block party will feature interfaith speakers and local artists, and aims to showcase the community’s diversity. Cleveras told The Huffington Post that the event has been in the works for some time, and isn’t meant to be a response to the Daily Stormer’s proposed march. Instead, she sees it as a way to address the increase in hate speech she’s seen in her community and to celebrate the Flathead Valley’s diversity. “I love this place with all my heart. So for me, when I realized that it was beginning to garner a false reputation of being a haven for white supremacist activity, I felt like I had to defend the community and boost morale by showcasing what we are actually about,” she told The Huffington Post.Saturday’s event will be the first “Love Not Hate” event in Whitefish, and Cleveras hopes it won’t be the last.“Sure, it’s going to be a block party and lots of fun, but if people can witness it and be reminded that love and acceptance exits, maybe they’ll be inspired to plant it elsewhere, on and on,” she told The Huffington Post."
7,RELIGION,Montana Town Celebrates Diversity Amid Threats Of An Armed Neo-Nazi March,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/montana-responds-to-proposed-neo-nazi-march_us_586be90ce4b0d9a5945ca931,These Montanans are making sure love has the last word.,2017-01-04,"Richard Spencer is a key intellectual leader of the alternative right, a label he coined in 2008 to describe the radical conservative movement defined by white nationalism and a fervent resistance to multiculturalism and globalism.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c33691500002f00e9e45b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A neo-Nazi website is calling for an armed protest against Jews in Whitefish, Montana. But residents of the town and their allies across the state and country have come up with several ingenious ways to show that love is stronger than the hate.The rally was initially proposed by the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, according to the Associated Press. Site publisher Andrew Anglin, who has been labeled an extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center, authored several posts calling for a rally against “Jews, Jewish businesses and everyone who supports either.” He was reportedly reacting to a claim that Sherry Spencer, mother of the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and a resident of Whitefish, was being harassed because of her son’s ties to the so-called “alt-right” movement, a branch of conservatism that mixes racism with white nationalism and populism. The Daily Stormer called for an “old fashioned troll storm” and posted personal contact information of several Jewish residents of Whitefish and members of the local advocacy group “Love Lives Here In The Flathead Valley.” According to the Associated Press, the Jewish residents, their families, and business owners who have supported “Love Lives Here” in the past have received anti-Semitic messages and threats in the days since the website’s call to action. “Love Lives Here” has denied claims that the organization harassed Sherry Spencer. Anglin told ABC Fox Montana on Monday that his march will take place on January 15 and claimed that he’s received donations to help ship people in. Whitefish police chief Bill Dial has said in the past that he doesn’t believe the march will actually materialize, although his department is working with federal and local authorities to plan for it, if it does occur.After hearing reports about the proposed rally, the Montana Human Rights Network teamed up with the Justus & Karin Rosenberg Foundation, a Jewish organization, to issue a challenge to deter the march.The Foundation is encouraging people to make a donation to the MHRN for every minute of the rally. The funds for the project will go towards purposes that the neo-Nazis detest, such as increased security for Jews and Jewish institutions, trainings for community members on how to de-escalate and intervene in hate incidents, and educational events about the dangers of white supremacy and racism.The JKR Foundation made an initial pledge of $10 for every minute of the march, up to $2,500.Kenneth S. Stern, executive director of the Brooklyn-based JKR Foundation, told The Huffington Post that he hopes the pledge drive gives people something tangible to do in response to the proposed march.“The march will or will not happen, but the underlying problems of hatred will not disappear,” Stern said. “This will help institutions and structures that will serve the community in the long haul.” MHRN co-director Rachel Carroll Rivas told The Huffington Post that they’ve received pledges from hundreds of people in the last few hours, from the Jewish community in Montana, and local and national allies.“Hopefully having folks pledge per minute the racists march, deters them from doing so,” Carroll Rivas told HuffPost. “Maybe we raise no money, and that’s the best thing, or we do raise the funds.

That year, the Packers had to win three road games just to earn the right to play Pittsburgh in the big game. That’s the beauty of this single-elimination tournament: It doesn’t matter how you got here. It just matters that you’re here. Wild Card weekend 2017, which kicks off this Saturday, will feature two of the hottest teams in the NFL. The Steelers boast a seven-game win streak and feature a trio of superstars, including unlikely MVP candidate Antonio Brown. But while Pittsburgh undoubtedly deserves our attention, let’s also take a moment to examine why the boys in green have become such a hot ticket.It all starts and ends with Aaron Rodgers ― the likely league MVP, and for good reason. His 40 touchdown passes are the most in pro football, and during Green Bay’s last six games ― all wins ― the 33-year-old signal caller has amassed 18 touchdowns and zero interceptions. However, it’d be wrong to simply dismiss the Pack as a one-dimensional, aerial attacking team. Longtime defensive coordinator Dom Capers has found the magic touch once more, and he’s done so after an ominous stretch where his defense flat-out couldn’t get off the field.The turnaround was heralded by a crucial December thrashing of NFC West champ Seattle, when the Seahawks mustered a measly 10 points and confused Russell Wilson to the tune of a career-worst five interceptions. Then, with the division on the line at Detroit in Week 17, Capers ― despite losing three cornerbacks in the game to injury ― coerced Lions MVP candidate Matthew Stafford into several third down errant throws and a crucial pick.Maybe the most surprisingly effective element for Green Bay, though, has been the running game, once completely dormant following the season-ending injury to starting back Eddie Lacy, along with a knee injury to backup James Starks.Head coach Mike McCarthy has preached offensive balance, but for much of the season, he simply couldn’t find a shred of it. During Green Bay’s four-game losing streak ― three of which were at the hands of non-playoff teams ― Rodgers averaged over 43 pass attempts per game and twice led the Packers in rushing, which is never a good sign. In fact, only twice all year have the Packers recorded a 100-yard rusher. And yet, great teams adjust. They find ways to achieve success ― check out my appearance on NFL Network ― even when it’s not how they originally conceived it.The oft-maligned McCarthy, to his credit, has done just that, discovering a legitimate solution in converted wide receiver Ty Montgomery. The second-year pro has become an explosive weapon who possesses surprisingly good vision out of the backfield.In fact, Pro Football Focus lists the former Stanford standout as the shiftiest running back in the league this season. No. 88 ― and yes, that should probably be changed to a number more befitting of a running back ― galloped for 163 yards and two touchdowns in a recent win over Chicago. Moreover, he has averaged a healthy 5.9 yards per rush, which would rank him first in the NFL if he had the qualified number of carries (100).“To me, him getting over that hurdle is been what I’ve been the most impressed of because I mean, he’s a football player,” McCarthy told Detroit media ahead of the Lions game. “We’ve always played him in there situationally or schematically as a change up, so you could always see the playmaking ability. But to do the every-day, all-three-downs nuances of the running back position has been very impressive. That’s just a real credit to him.”This is not to say Montgomery is better than otherwordly talents like Ezekiel Elliott or Le’Veon Bell. But his stellar play has undeniably provided the Packers with a dynamic threat lined up behind Rodgers. Better still, he has morphed into a terrific complement to the play-making Jordy Nelson (league-leading 14 touchdown catches) and Davante Adams (12 TDs) on the perimeter.The result has been a far more balanced and effective offense.During the team’s six-game winning streak, Rodgers has averaged 33 throws per game, 10 less than the 43 he was attempting during the Pack’s quartet of consecutive defeats, when they were seemingly out of the postseason race.

10,POLITICS,Trump Tweet Attacks A Car That’s Mainly Made In Ohio,Arthur Delaney and Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-chevy-cruze-general-motors_us_586d1d8de4b0de3a08fa5c10,His latest auto industry dig leads to head scratching.,2017-01-04,"The Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in a plant in Lordstown, Ohio.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d210c1500002e00e9e5f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Early Tuesday morning, while most people prepared to return to work after the New Year’s holiday, the president-elect of the United States decided to share his opinion about one small aspect of the operations of a major U.S. auto manufacturer.“General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border,” Trump tweeted at 7:30 a.m. “Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!”What prompted that tweet is puzzling.Trump spent a lot of time last year bullying companies that shift production from the U.S. to Mexico, including auto companies, but GM had not recently made any Cruze announcements. It said it would make a version of the car in Mexico back in March 2015.Trump has sometimes used Twitter to respond immediately to items he sees on TV, but cable news transcripts show no mention of the Chevrolet Cruze in the early hours on Tuesday. A spokesman for GM said he had “no idea” what caught Trump’s attention. A spokesman for Trump didn’t respond to a request for comment.Trump’s tweet did come hours before the Ford Motor Company announced that it had scrapped plans to build a new plant in Mexico in favor of expanding its investment at a factory in Flat Rock, Michigan. The company denied that Trump had any role in that switch, although Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. told reporters that he’d notified Trump prior to the announcement. It’s not clear exactly when they communicated.It could be that Trump, knowing Ford’s announcement was coming, tweeted about GM to suggest that he has been busy pressuring manufacturers to shift production back to the U.S. The president-elect has vowed to stop American companies from offshoring jobs, and news stories about a few high-profile examples could distract the public from the fact that hundreds of companies will continue to offshore jobs despite Trump’s threats.Yet the strangest thing about Trump’s tweet is that GM actually does make the Chevy Cruze in the U.S., at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio. It produces a hatchback version in Mexico that it mostly sells in other countries.“All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM’s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio,” GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said in an emailed statement. Of the 190,000 Cruzes sold in the U.S. last year, the company has said, just 2.4 percent were hatchbacks made in Mexico. So Trump was exercised about 4,500 cars.GM announced in November, one day after Trump’s election victory, that it would be laying off workers at the Lordstown plant. The company isn’t closing the facility, just reducing the number of cars made there, since U.S. demand for smaller vehicles like the Cruze has waned in favor of bigger cars ― which, industry analysts say, also happen to be a more profitable focus for domestic production.“The shift reduction at Lordstown is solely based on aligning production with demand,” Morrissey said.Jeremy Acevedo, an analyst at the auto site Edmunds.com, said low gas prices have made smaller cars like the Cruze less popular with U.S. consumers.“Gasoline has fueled a huge demand for light trucks. That’s really affected what GM can produce and where the market is,” Acevedo said. “You have an American buying public that’s made a very rapid shift to SUVs, pickups and vans.”The Lordstown factory is not even equipped to build the hatchback version of the Cruze, Glenn Johnson, president of the local United Autoworkers Union, told The Associated Press. As for Trump’s tweet, he said, “It makes for news, that’s all.”Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill said he regretted that the plant would lay off about 1,200 workers this month, but that he didn’t believe the company was doing so because of U.S. trade policy. “If your product isn’t selling, you can’t just keep churning them out,” Hill said.Trump’s tweet reminded Hill of one that the president-elect sent in November when he falsely claimed to have worked with Ford to prevent a plant closure in Kentucky. Ford had never said it would close the plant.“He did the same thing with Ford,” Hill said. “You say something but then after you get all the facts, you have to draw back.”Of course, Trump didn’t retract his false Ford tweets. Instead of drawing back, Trump usually pushes ahead on some other topic, often enough with another falsehood or attack.After he successfully bullied the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier into keeping a factory in Indiana last month, Trump couldn’t resist inflating the number of jobs the company had said would stay. When the president of the local union corrected those numbers in a live interview on CNN, Trump, who apparently had been watching, immediately tweeted that the union leader was terrible at his job.It could be that Trump tweeted about GM simply because the auto industry is an easy target for a president-elect looking to make an example of companies that have benefited from trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump campaigned on renegotiating. Over the last two decades, U.S. automakers have moved a significant amount of compact car production to Mexico, where labor is cheaper and sales of smaller vehicles are higher.“A lot of it has to do with the auto industry being so public and companies in it being household names,” Acevedo said. “It makes sense that they are targeted so often.”"
11,THE WORLDPOST,Trump's North Korea Red Line Could Come Back To Haunt Him,"David Brunnstrom and Arshad Mohammed, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trumps-north-korea-threat_us_586d05b4e4b0d9a5945d445c,Military action against Pyongyang is fraught with huge dangers.,2017-01-04,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks during the first party committee meeting in Pyongyang, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) December 25, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d061d1500002c009171fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In three words of a tweet this week, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump vowed North Korea would never test an intercontinental ballistic missile.“It won’t happen!” Trump wrote after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Sunday his nuclear-capable country was close to testing an ICBM of a kind that could someday hit the United States.Preventing such a test is far easier said than done, and Trump gave no indication of how he might roll back North Korea’s weapons programs after he takes office on Jan. 20, something successive U.S. administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have failed to do. Former U.S. officials and other experts said the United States essentially had two options when it came to trying to curb North Korea’s fast-expanding nuclear and missile programs - negotiate or take military action.Neither path offers certain success and the military option is fraught with huge dangers, especially for Japan and South Korea, U.S. allies in close proximity to North Korea.The Republican president-elect complained in a separate tweet that China, North Korea’s neighbor and only ally, was not helping to contain Pyongyang - despite China’s support for successive rounds of U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang.While many critics, including within President Barack Obama’s administration, agreed China could press North Korea harder, the State Department said it did not agree with Trump’s assessment that China was not helping.Experts said Trump’s tough stance toward Beijing on issues from trade to Taiwan could prove counterproductive in securing greater Chinese cooperation.James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said that with his North Korea tweet, Trump had drawn a red line he could later be judged by, like Obama’s 2012 warning to Syria over the use of chemical weapons.“This was a foolhardy tweet for Trump to send given the enormous challenges of constraining North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. I think this could be something that comes back to haunt him.”THREE OPTIONSU.S. officials, who did not want to be identified, said that if ordered, the U.S. military had three options to respond to a North Korean missile test - a pre-emptive strike before it is launched, intercepting the missile in flight, or allowing a launch to take place unhindered.One official, who did not wish to be named, said there were risks with pre-emptive action, including the possibility of striking the wrong target - or North Korean retaliation against regional allies.Arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis questioned whether U.S. missile defenses could shoot down a test missile, absent a lucky shot, and said destroying North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs would be a huge and risky undertaking.Lewis, at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, said it would require “a large military campaign ... over a fairly substantial period of time.”He noted that North Korea’s main nuclear and missile test sites were on different sides of the country and factories that supplied them were scattered over several provinces.“There’s a warren of tunnels under the nuclear site. And an ICBM can be launched from anywhere in the country because it’s mobile. You might as well invade the country,” Lewis said.Republican U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, writing on cnn.com, said he hoped Trump’s administration would impose “secondary sanctions” on firms and entities that help North Korea’s weapons programs, many of which were in China.‘PERIOD OF SERIOUS SANCTIONS’While Trump has not detailed his policy approach to North Korea, an adviser to his transition team told Reuters he believed “a period of serious sanctions” had “to be a major part of any discussion on the options available here.”State Department spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday the United States had not ruled out additional sanctions, but added: “Let’s not get ahead of where we are.”Victor Cha, who was an aide to former Republican President George W. Bush, said he believed Trump was serious about not letting North Korea have nuclear-capable ICBMs that could threaten the U.S. mainland.“How to stop this is of course difficult. It’s a combination of diplomacy (to get a freeze), sanctions (Chinese ones and Treasury), moving more military assets to the region for extended deterrence, strike options, and integrated missile defense. That’s what would be on my menu,” he said.Frank Jannuzi, a former State Department official who heads the Mansfield Foundation Asia dialogue forum, said Trump’s vow could prove as hollow as Obama’s pledge not to tolerate North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.“I worry ... that it only emboldens the North, because they see it for what it is: empty talk,” he said. “It lays down a red line. ... We don’t seem prepared to back up.”He said North Korea had long defied U.S. and U.N. sanctions to pursue its nuclear and missile programs, and added: “One hundred and forty characters from Donald Trump aren’t going to change that.”(Additional reporting by Idrees Ali in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

The shooting was caught on video by a Palestinian rights activist, and the footage, distributed to news organizations, ensured the incident drew international attention.Reading for 2-1/2 hours from the verdict, chief judge Colonel Maya Heller said Azaria shot the Palestinian out of revenge in March 2016 after the assailant stabbed and wounded a fellow soldier in the West Bank town of Hebron.“He deserves to die,” Azaria was quoted in the verdict as telling another soldier, just after fatally shooting the Palestinian in the head as the man, who had been wounded minutes earlier by Israeli military gunfire, lay motionless in the street.“One cannot use this type of force, even if we’re talking about an enemy’s life,” the court said in its verdict. “We unanimously convict the accused of manslaughter and of conduct unbecoming (a soldier).”Sentencing will be handed down at a later date.

Of the jail’s 1,511 inmates, 158 managed to escape, he said.Eight prisoners had since been caught, two had surrendered, while six were killed, according to the office of the president.Shirlyn Macasarte, acting governor of North Cotabato, said her office had been tipped off about the plan by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) to free its members as early as the second quarter of last year.“They were involved in murders and at the same time I think they have experience in bomb making so we watched them closely,” Macasarte told news channel ANC.The leader of the attackers, known by the alias Commander Derbie, had links with the BIFF, a splinter group of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Macasarte said.Some members of the MILF and BIFF were said to be behind the killing of 44 police commandos in a secret mission two years ago to capture a Malaysian bomb maker with a $5 million bounty from the U.S. State Department on his head.In 2014, the government signed a peace deal with the MILF, the biggest Muslim rebel group, but clashes still occur with smaller groups."

Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday an innovative plan to provide free tuition at public colleges for any New Yorker whose family earns less than $125,000 a year.The sweeping move would pay the entire tuition bill for students accepted to state and city schools and encompass almost a million middle- and low-income families.“College is a mandatory step if you really want to be a success ... and this society should say we’re going to pay for college because you need college to be successful,” Cuomo said at an event announcing the Excelsior Scholarship plan. “Other countries have already done it. It’s time this country catches up.”If it succeeds, the proposal would go into effect by 2019 and cost the state about $163 million a year, Reuters news agency notes.The proposal was unveiled alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during a speech at LaGuardia Community College. Sanders has long supported proposals for free college tuition and made the idea a key part of his platform during the presidential race. He continued those calls on Twitter shortly after Cuomo’s announcement:Student loan debt continues to be a major hurdle for young Americans. The class of 2015 left school with an average debt of more than $30,000, and Cuomo noted New Yorkers only fared slightly better with a burden of $29,320.The “program will alleviate the crushing burden of student debt and enable thousands of New Yorkers to realize their dream of a college education,” he wrote in a post on Medium Tuesday.“New York is the State of Opportunity and a college education must be accessible to all, not a luxury that only the wealthy can afford,” he added."

In the days that followed, Jackson’s emotional state shifted from utter shock to a foggy depression as she struggled to come to terms with the fact that our nation’s foremost leader will soon be a man who has publicly objectified, demeaned, humiliated, threatened and bragged about assaulting women without recourse. A man with plans to defund Planned Parenthood, to “punish” women for having abortions and to rescind decades of progress toward gender equality. Jackson was hardly alone in her feelings of disbelief, anger and fear. But she didn’t realize the extent of her support system until Nov. 14, 2016, when Jackson spontaneously posted a callout on Facebook. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!! Who’s interested???” she wrote, tagging women artists, curators, and writers in her circle.Shortly after posting, Jackson went offline to spend a day at work teaching ceramics. Unknown to her at the time, the message went viral as nasty artist after nasty artist recruited other like-minded ladies for the cause. “I had no idea how much this would escalate and evolve,” Jackson said. Within the first hour of posting, she had 300 responses. The reaction to Jackson’s idea was so enthusiastic and impassioned that the prospect of curating a neat and tidy exhibition, capped at a certain number of participants, no longer felt quite right. After discussing the burgeoning project with her co-organizer, curator Jessamyn Fiore, Jackson decided no nasty woman would be turned away or left behind. And thus, “The Nasty Women Art Exhibition,” a sprawling buffet of proudly rude, women-identifying artists, was born. In part, Jackson’s idea was inspired by her experience protesting outside of Trump Tower after election weekend and the overwhelming catharsis of being enveloped in a throng of united people. Through her art show, more of a visual protest than a traditional exhibition, she hoped to further communicate to nasty women everywhere that they are not alone. To do so, Jackson and her team, comprised of Jessamyn Fiore, Angel Bellaran, Barbara Smith, Haley Shaw, Young Sun Han, Clive Murphy, Carolina Wheat, Liz Nielsen, Stephanie Stockbridge, and Aimee Odum, invited women artists from all over the world to submit their work. The only requirement was that their piece measures under 12 inches in every direction (a simple limitation meant to help manage the large quantity of artworks coming in). No artist who offered work was denied inclusion, and as a result, the crew acquired approximately 1,000 pieces by the time submissions closed. “The Nasty Women Art Show” will be on view at Queens’ Knockdown Center starting Jan. 12 ― just one week before inauguration day. The multidisciplinary pieces, sent in by a whopping 694 artists, will be suspended from 12-foot tall sculptures that will read “Nasty Women” in hot pink letters. Some artists in the show, Jackson explained, are well-established in the New York art scene, but most aren’t names you’d find on the usual gallery roster. Some hail from small towns in red states, others from outside the U.S. completely, and many have never exhibited work before. The true force of the show, more than any singular name or piece, is the sheer amount of images on view and the solidarity that number represents. “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.” Another wonderfully anti-establishment element of the exhibition is that the works on view are priced at $100 or less, with all proceeds benefitting Planned Parenthood. Viewers, then, can come home with a $10 artwork or a $100 piece by an artist whose works usually bring in far more zeroes. Jackson described the show as “cash and carry,” meaning you won’t have to wait until the end of the exhibition to take your new, feminist masterpiece ― just make sure to bring some dollar bills. “Hopefully the show will just look like very naked letters at the end,” Jackson mused.It’s a strange time to be an artist in America. On the one hand, the urge to resist and express through creative means is stronger and more necessary than ever. And yet it’s easy for art to feel futile, insular and trivial amid dire political times.Jackson, whose ceramic sculptures often operate on the fringes of the feminine grotesque, found that, post-election, her glam-horror aesthetic was no longer so horrific. “I’ve been making these monsters, but they’re not dark enough, they’re not intense enough,” she said. “However scary a sculpture could look, it’s nothing compared to Trump in the White House. The reality is horrifying.”Yet rather than giving up on her craft, Jackson became more determined than ever to channel her skills into active resistance. For this reason, it was crucial to Jackson that the “Nasty Women” exhibition not just be “a group show of Bushwick artists,” as she put it, but an accessible visual protest that could reach beyond the borders usually ascribed to art happenings. Along with the New York-based show, there are currently 23 other “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the coming two months, taking place everywhere from Lubbock, Texas, to Brussels, Belgium. Jackson invites any and all other nasty women interested in getting involved to organize their own “Nasty Women” show, with instructions available on the show’s website. Her only request is that all shows adopting the “Nasty” name donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights. “I want this visual art protest to count,” Jackson said. “I want to inspire others, to continue to make art, to continue to march in protest, to resist as much as possible. This election has been a wake-up call. Our challenge is to not forget. We can’t just be defeated; we can’t just turn apathetic.

The true force of the show, more than any singular name or piece, is the sheer amount of images on view and the solidarity that number represents. “This show isn’t necessarily about highlighting individual artists,” Jackson explained. “It’s about female-identifying artists coming together against the Trump regime.” Another wonderfully anti-establishment element of the exhibition is that the works on view are priced at $100 or less, with all proceeds benefitting Planned Parenthood. Viewers, then, can come home with a $10 artwork or a $100 piece by an artist whose works usually bring in far more zeroes. Jackson described the show as “cash and carry,” meaning you won’t have to wait until the end of the exhibition to take your new, feminist masterpiece ― just make sure to bring some dollar bills. “Hopefully the show will just look like very naked letters at the end,” Jackson mused.It’s a strange time to be an artist in America. On the one hand, the urge to resist and express through creative means is stronger and more necessary than ever. And yet it’s easy for art to feel futile, insular and trivial amid dire political times.Jackson, whose ceramic sculptures often operate on the fringes of the feminine grotesque, found that, post-election, her glam-horror aesthetic was no longer so horrific. “I’ve been making these monsters, but they’re not dark enough, they’re not intense enough,” she said. “However scary a sculpture could look, it’s nothing compared to Trump in the White House. The reality is horrifying.”Yet rather than giving up on her craft, Jackson became more determined than ever to channel her skills into active resistance. For this reason, it was crucial to Jackson that the “Nasty Women” exhibition not just be “a group show of Bushwick artists,” as she put it, but an accessible visual protest that could reach beyond the borders usually ascribed to art happenings. Along with the New York-based show, there are currently 23 other “Nasty Happenings” scheduled for the coming two months, taking place everywhere from Lubbock, Texas, to Brussels, Belgium. Jackson invites any and all other nasty women interested in getting involved to organize their own “Nasty Women” show, with instructions available on the show’s website. Her only request is that all shows adopting the “Nasty” name donate their proceeds to an organization benefiting women’s rights. “I want this visual art protest to count,” Jackson said. “I want to inspire others, to continue to make art, to continue to march in protest, to resist as much as possible. This election has been a wake-up call. Our challenge is to not forget. We can’t just be defeated; we can’t just turn apathetic. We have to be active.” “The Nasty Women Art Exhibition” will run from Jan. 12 through Jan. 15 at The Knockdown Center, Maspeth, Queens, NYC.Every Friday, HuffPost’s Culture Shift newsletter helps you figure out which books you should read, art you should check out, movies you should watch and music should listen to.

Keaton recently explained why he quit the franchise after two films. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586caef71500002c00917178.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Michael Keaton held the title role in Tim Burton’s “Batman,” the highest-grossing film of 1989. He also starred in the sequel, “Batman Returns,” which was the third biggest movie of 1992.And then he walked away when director Joel Schumacher took over the franchise for the third installment, “Batman Forever.” Now, Keaton has explained why he left despite all the success, and the answer is pretty simple: He didn’t like the script for the third film. “It sucked,” Keaton told The Hollywood Reporter’s “Awards Chatter” podcast. “The script never was great. I didn’t understand why (Schumacher) wanted to do what he wanted to do.”Keaton said he attended “many meetings” over the film, and was “polite up to a point about things.” But he didn’t like the new direction Schumacher had in mind. “I knew it was in trouble when he said ‘Why does everything have to be so dark?’” he said. When it came down to it, Keaton said he just couldn’t do it. “Not like, I’m above it, or an artist, but maybe I’m enough of an artist to go, ‘I just don’t think I can do this without blowing my brains out,’” he said.Given that the Schumacher “Batman” films also introduced the infamous nippled Batsuit, Keaton’s instincts seem to have served him well. Check out the full podcast, an hourlong discussion of Keaton’s career. It includes highlights such as “Batman” and Beetlejuice” and his latest role: McDonald’s visionary Ray Kroc in “The Founder,” which is generating Oscar buzz. "

The mother of two earned $51 million between June 2015 and June 2016, according to recent estimates made public by Forbes. That’s a full $33.5 million more than her husband, Kanye West, who made $17.5 million over the same period. And she did it all despite giving birth to her son, Saint West, in December 2015. For simple comparison, the CEO of Goldman Sachs earned about half of that amount over another recent 12-month period. Kardashian’s earnings make her far and away the highest-paid reality star in the country. Next on that list is her sister Kylie Jenner, who earned about what Kanye did over the same period, $18 million. Together, the Kardashian-Jenner clan pulled in more than $122 million.While you may think most of Kim Kardashian’s money is a result of her family’s show, “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” that isn’t true.“These reality stars all make relatively little from their shows, which instead function as advertising and branding opportunities,” Forbes writes. “On-screen salaries hover in the low seven figures, but the bulk of the stars’ cash tends to come from endorsements, be it beauty products or liquors.” In Kardashian’s case, about two-fifths of her earnings come directly from her mobile game, “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.” But she also earns hefty paychecks from her emoji app ― appropriately titled Kimoji, which was launched the same month her son was born ― as well as from her subscription app and her Instagram endorsements. (For those wondering, the Kardashians and Jenners are now reportedly making at least $200,000 per sponsored Instagram post.)Plain and simple, Kardashian knows where the money is. She’s used that knowledge to turn her social media empire into a financial one ― and done it quickly. "
24,HEALTHY LIVING,"Offering Syringes Along With Prayers, Churches Help IV Drug Users","Taylor Sisk, Kaiser Health News",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/offering-syringes-along-with-prayers-churches-help-iv-drug-users_us_586d5985e4b06d0d7dfe8aea,"Some faith-based organizations are offering clean syringes to IV drug users, while others are voicing support for comprehensive treatment.",2017-01-04,James Sizemore pastor of Radiant Church in Fayetteville NC went from president of his high schools Just Say No club to a cocaine mule Once free of drugs he found his way back to the pulpit.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d5dbb1900002b000e3016.png?cache=eIb5EBDvoc&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kaiser Health NewsFAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — When Gov. Pat McCrory signed legislation in July legalizing syringe exchange programs in North Carolina, James Sizemore rejoiced.The pastor of a small church, Sizemore had — with the tacit approval of some, but not all, local law enforcement — been offering clean syringes to drug users to help them avoid contracting HIV and hepatitis C. Now he could do so without fear of arrest.Sizemore, who in 2007 launched Radiant Church, an affiliate of the Church of God of Prophecy, has sought to alleviate the effects of drug addiction, work that he sees as a natural extension of his other pursuits: feeding, clothing and otherwise offering sustenance to his parishioners and others in need.“It was never an issue of, ‘Is this the right thing to do spiritually, scripturally?’” Sizemore said of his efforts. “For us, it was the right thing to do … You can’t save somebody’s soul if they’re dead.”Churches and other faith-based organizations have increasingly voiced approval of syringe exchange programs, sometimes launching their own. Their efforts have contributed to growing support for the programs, which the federal Centers for Disease Control and other health organizations see as a valuable tool in combating the opioid epidemic. Most programs include components such as education, treatment and testing for HIV and hepatitis C, which can be spread by sharing needles. Some also distribute naloxone to reverse overdoses.The CDC offered further encouragement Nov. 29, reporting greater use of syringe exchanges by people who inject drugs. Even so, one-third of users cited in the CDC analysis reported in 2015 that they had shared a needle within the past year. Exchange programs allow drug users to turn in used syringes and get sterile ones.While more than half of states have not explicitly authorized syringe exchange, Corey Davis with the Network for Public Health Law said that most have at minimum removed the prescription requirement for syringes. A number have “patchworks” of what’s permitted in terms of exchange and what’s not.The North American Syringe Exchange Network, or NASEN, reports 228 syringe exchange programs operating in 35 states and Washington, D.C. But the number of programs is growing weekly in response to the rise in heroin overdose deaths across the country.Neither NASEN nor the Harm Reduction Coalition has an estimate of the number of faith-based churches and organizations directly involved in syringe exchange, but momentum is clearly gathering. Church-based programs are operating in communities across the country, including Seattle; Cincinnati; Albany, N.Y.; and even in traditionally conservative southern states.Institutions such as the United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), United Church of Christ and National Council on Jewish Women have issued statements of support for syringe exchange.“Ultimately, we want people to live without the burdens of addiction, but for many people the road to recovery is long and arduous, and protecting public health in the meantime is fundamental,” said Kara Gotsch, who until recently was director of advocacy for the Interfaith Criminal Justice Coalition.Hillary Brownsmith researches and writes about faith-based harm reduction initiatives and helps run the Steady Collective, a mobile syringe exchange program in Asheville, N.C. The program is based at the Haywood Street Congregation, a United Methodist Church ministry, and has received funding from three other congregations.Brownsmith has engaged ministers and churchgoers in theological conversations about reaching out to drug users, and said she’s received only positive feedback.“I think the tide is definitely shifting,” she said, with church officials and congregants recognizing that syringe exchange is in keeping with soup kitchens, temporary shelters and other outreach ministries.St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Fayetteville, Arkansas, launched its syringe exchange program last November. Shelby Carrothers, a church member, saw the need for one while offering HIV testing during a weekly free hot meal. She discovered that most of the people being tested identified as IV drug users.Carrothers said that while providing clean syringes is a critical service, “Almost equally important is that we provide a nonjudgmental space to talk about what they’re going through and answer questions that they might otherwise be afraid to ask.”Sherman Terry, 40, is among those who’ve found help at St. Paul’s. A former IV drug user, he came for a hot meal and has received a lot more.“Shelby, bless her heart …” Terry said during a recent Wednesday lunch at the church, recounting how Carrothers had introduced him to a variety of support services. No longer an IV drug user, Terry now advocates in the community for safe sex, clean needles, healthy living in general.Carrothers distributes some 300 to 400 syringes each week. But the need to help IV drug users continues to mount. She’s now talking with a Lutheran church in Fayetteville and Episcopal churches in Little Rock about hosting exchanges.In North Carolina, James Sizemore tells of his own circuitous route to harm-reduction advocacy.President of his high school’s “Just Say No” club, Sizemore went from being a Duke Divinity School student to a cocaine mule, transporting kilos from Miami to North Carolina. For five years, he struggled with addiction. Once free of drugs, he found his way back to the pulpit.Disenchanted with mainstream churches — which, he perceives, too often fail to embrace the marginalized members of their communities — Sizemore started his own, in a section of Fayetteville marked by poverty and drug use.Syringe exchange fits into his church’s primary mission, tending to an array of immediate needs.You can’t “preach salvation” to someone who’s in the throes of addiction, battling for their life, or turning tricks to feed their kids, Sizemore said. “They’re not interested in hearing anything about the spirit because they’re concerned about these issues first.”“Slowly, but surely,” he said, “we established a good enough relationship in the neighborhood that they trusted us enough to care for them spiritually.”This story was written by Taylor Fisk for Kaiser Health News.

25,POLITICS,"Kentucky Republicans Poised To Pass Right-To-Work Law, Delivering Blow To Unions",Travis Waldron and Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kentucky-right-to-work-law_us_586d43b4e4b0d9a5945d9f50,It would be the 27th state ― and the last in the South ― to go right-to-work.,2017-01-04,The election of Gov. Matt Bevin (R) in 2015 and a GOP takeover of the state legislature in November paved the way for the approval of right-to-work legislation in Kentucky.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586d46291900002a000e2f84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kentucky Republicans opened 2017 by introducing a slate of anti-union bills in both chambers of the state legislature, including legislation that would make the state the last in the South to adopt a so-called “right-to-work” law.Targeting unions has been a priority for the Kentucky GOP in past years, though Democratic control of the governor’s seat and state House kept right-to-work and other legislation from passing. But Gov. Matt Bevin (R) won election in 2015, and Republicans swept their way to their first majority in the state House in nearly a century in November, paving the way for an ambitious agenda with right-to-work at the top of the list.The proposed right-to-work bills, the first of which a state House committee approved Wednesday after a brief hearing, would end requirements that employees pay fees to a union. These bills would gut Kentucky’s unions politically and hurt their workers, local labor officials said.“First of all, when you pass right-to-work you’re racing to the bottom in terms of wages,” said Larry Clark, a retired union electrician and Louisville Democrat who served as speaker pro tempore in the Kentucky House before he stepped down in 2014. “Statistics show that there’s less per capita family income. Statistics show there’s less tax revenue because there’s less money spent.”Under U.S. labor law, a union must represent all the employees in a workplace it has unionized, even those who may not want representation. Unions say it’s only fair that all the workers in the bargaining unit pay fees to the union to cover the costs of bargaining.But right-to-work laws make such arrangements illegal, allowing workers to opt out of paying fees to a union that will nevertheless represent them ― a situation that unions derisively call “free riding.” Backers of right-to-work laws argue that no worker should be required to support a union, even if it bargains on his behalf.By helping to erode union membership, right-to-work laws hurt unions financially and weaken them (and, by extension, Democrats) politically. Right-to-work laws used to be a hallmark of conservative states in the South and West, but they have spread rapidly in recent years, even in the industrial Midwest. Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia have all gone right-to-work since 2012. West Virginia was the 26th state to pass such a law, marking a symbolic turning point for right-to-work proponents.F. Vincent Vernuccio, the labor policy director at the Mackinac Center, a conservative think tank that supports right-to-work efforts, said he expects Kentucky Republicans to move quickly after their success in the November elections. Vernuccio said Missouri and New Hampshire could follow Kentucky this year.“We may see up to 29 [states] before the spring,” Vernuccio said. “You’re definitely seeing a snowball effect, and more and more states are looking to give workers freedom.”Kentucky, home to organized industrial plants for Ford and General Electric, among other companies, had held back the tide prior to last year’s elections. The state had nearly 200,000 union members in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Counter to national trends, its share of workers represented by unions has risen in recent years. And ahead of a Wednesday committee hearing, critics of the legislation pointed to data which they said showed that Kentucky’s manufacturing sector had outperformed neighboring Indiana’s since Indiana approved a right-to-work law in 2012.But now, union officials in Kentucky say the package of legislation introduced Tuesday amounts to an even stronger attack on unions than laws passed in other states.The House right-to-work legislation, for instance, would prohibit public sector workers from striking, while similar legislation in the Senate would prevent private sector unions from devoting union dues to political causes like political action committees. A separate bill in the House, meanwhile, would repeal Kentucky’s prevailing wage law that applies to state construction contracts. That bill also passed a House committee Wednesday afternoon.“It’s devastating,” said Charlie Essex, the business manager and financial secretary for Local 369 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, based in Louisville. “It’s a blatant attack on union people.”While right-to-work has been a contentious issue across states, leaders from Kentucky’s construction unions are just as concerned about the repeal of the prevailing wage laws, which apply to between 30 and 40 percent of union construction work in the state, Essex said.Such laws require that companies bidding on public works projects pay certain minimum wages to the workers employed on the resulting jobs. Unions say the laws are crucial to prevent bidders from driving down wages in the local economy.Republicans have in the past argued that prevailing wage laws lead to unnecessary cost increases under state contracts, a point that union leaders have disputed. In 2001, the Kentucky Legislative Research Commission examined a period when the state’s prevailing wage law did not apply in certain circumstances and “concluded that prevailing wage has no statistically significant effect on construction cost,” with some caveats.Clark said that repealing the prevailing wage provisions ― which some studies have shown lead to higher-than-median wages for the Kentucky workers subject to them ― will have a detrimental effect on apprenticeship and job training programs that businesses and unions rely on. The combination of changes, labor leaders said, would also hurt workers’ wages.“They’re cutting workers’ pay through right-to-work and prevailing wage in Kentucky. That’s what we’re doing,” said Bill Finn, state director of the Kentucky State Building and Construction Trades Council. “People voted for a change in this election, but they didn’t vote for this. They didn’t vote for pay cuts.”More than 100 union members and activists gathered near the state Capitol on Wednesday, with plans to testify against the legislation in a last-ditch effort to stop it.But with Republicans firmly in control of the state legislature, there’s little optimism that the bills can be halted. Union officials in Kentucky say the bills could become law as soon as this weekend.“It’s on fast-forward. They can’t stop it,” Clark said. “We got our asses kicked in Kentucky. We never dreamed it would be this bad.” "

When Isaiah had a meltdown, she went above and beyond to help him find “his quiet, safe space” in the midst of the overwhelming sensory stimulation.“She wasn’t fazed by his screams; she understood his fears,” McCafferty recalled. “She figured out where it was he needed to go, which just so happened to be the floor, and she took him there.”The mom said Isaiah has a “beautiful soul” and a warm heart. “He is everything that you would want your child to be,” she said. “He’s fun and full of energy. He’s sweet and kind, and ridiculously funny. He loves with everything he has.”Isaiah’s love is especially boundless when it comes to his 6-year-old brother, Alex. “They have an amazing bond, and I credit Alex for a lot of the progress Isaiah has made with his social interactions,” McCafferty said. “Alex is able to comfort Isaiah when the rest of us can’t, and always seems to know just what Isaiah needs to soothe him.”McCafferty told HuffPost she hopes Isaiah’s haircut story will bring hope to other parents of kids with special needs. “I want them to realize that even though it can feel like it, they are not alone,” she said. “I want everyone to see just how much love and kindness matter.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that the mother lives in South Carolina. She lives in West Virginia."

Breaux didn’t mince words when it came to Kim Burrell, the gospel singer who made headlines in recent days when a video in which she made blatantly anti-gay comments in a church sermon surfaced Dec. 30. Burrell, who has performed with artists like Stevie Wonder, Missy Elliott and Harry Connick Jr., is featured on “Godspeed,” a song on Ocean’s 2016 album, “Blonde.”But if Breaux were to have her way, that wouldn’t be the case for long. On New Year’s Day, the LGBTQ icon’s mom offered a cheeky, but pointed, suggestion on Twitter: She continued: Burrell, who is also a pastor at the Love & Liberty Fellowship Church in Houston, has been facing intense criticism after video of a sermon in which she blasted LGBTQ people as “perverted” in a sermon surfaced on YouTube Dec. 30. “That perverted homosexual spirit, and the spirit of delusion and confusion, it has deceived many men and women. You as a man, you open your mouth and take a man’s penis in your face ― you are perverted,” Burrell says in the clip, which can be viewed below. “You are a woman and will shake your face in another woman’s breast, you are perverted.”Needless to say, the fallout from the video was swift. Pharrell Williams, who collaborated with Burrell on “I See A Victory” for the “Hidden Figures” soundtrack, hinted at the controversy in a Dec. 31 tweet, noting, “There is no room in this world for any kind of prejudice.” On Tuesday, Ellen DeGeneres confirmed that her team had scrapped Burrell’s planned performance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” alongside Williams, which had been slated for Thursday. No word from Ocean’s official camp just yet. But Breaux’s sentiments are a reminder that supportive, inclusive moms always know best.

They’re delicious and fun to eat, and I was about to make another batch when I was confronted with a handful of leftover Tuscan kale (cavolo nero – the dark, dark green leaves that are at their best along about now, when they’ve been exposed to freezing temperatures before harvest). I was also confronted with the need for a snack to serve with pre-dinner drinks. With apple turnovers in mind, I’d already made a mini-batch of pastry dough using 6 oz (170 g) flour, 4 oz (115 g) butter cut into thin slices, salt and just enough cold water to hold everything together in a ragged mess, and folding this in thirds and rolling it out five or six times, with a few minutes’ rest after every two roll-and-fold operations, by which time the ragged mess had become a smooth, easily rollable dough that when baked would be flaky but would not rise quite as much as puff pastry. It took but little brain to figure out that the same dough could be wrapped around a mouthful of chopped Tuscan kale for our snack. I’d cooked the kale in one of the usual ways: I’d stripped the leaves off the tough stems/ribs, washed them thoroughly, shaken off excess water and cut them into half-inch (13 mm) strips. I’d lightly browned a big clove of garlic, sliced, in plenty of olive oil, then added the kale, salt and a generous half cup (125 ml) of a simple tomato sauce (good canned tomatoes crushed by hand and simmered for 25 minutes with salt, a whole peeled clove of garlic, olive oil and a couple of sage leaves).I simmered the kale, first covered then uncovered, until tender but not without texture. In this state, it will keep in the fridge for a few days, though it soon becomes less interesting (how much of that deterioration is the Psychology of Leftovers I do not know).The handful that was left after a chicken dinner became the filling for our turnovers. I pressed it hard in a fine-mesh strainer to remove much of its moisture, then chopped it and added a heaping tablespoon each of grated parmesan and lightly toasted pine nuts (whole); a minced anchovy fillet or few chopped raisins would have been nice too, but entirely unnecessary.I rolled the dough thin – maybe 1/8 inch (3 mm) – and used an 8-cm (3-in) cookie cutter to make a dozen circles, which did not use all the dough: I rerolled the trimmings and froze them for future reference. Each circle I elongated using a small rolling pin (a large one would work well too if you’re careful), then placed a heaping teaspoonful of filling on each, folded the lightly moistened dough over the filling and crimped it shut using a fork. I brushed each with a little cream (egg would be even better, but it seemed profligate to open an egg when only a quarter of it would be used) and sprinkled sparsely with crunchy salt. I baked them for 20 minutes at 400º F (205º C); at this point they were golden but needed more cooking, so I lowered the heat a bit and left them in for a further 10 minutes, when they were a deeper golden brown. I let the turnovers cool on a wire rack, then when guests arrived reheated them in the oven for six minutes.As it should be, the delicious, airy, buttery pastry was an equal partner with the filling, in part because I didn’t make the mistake of over-stuffing the turnovers (which would in any case have risked leakage). And with the remaining dough, Jackie and I will still get our apple turnovers soon."

33,POLITICS,Why Dylann Roof Representing Himself Is A Constitutional Tragedy,"Scott E.

His reasons for going it alone are unclear since the court hearings on the subject have been closed to the public. Roof may have delusions of being a martyr for the cause of white supremacy, or perhaps he does not want evidence of mental illness to be brought to light. Whatever his motivation, the judge has ruled that Roof has a right to represent himself because the Supreme Court has said that the Constitution generally provides an accused the right to be his own lawyer given that it his fate at stake.This idea of the right to control one’s fate echoes a romantic vision of those who settled America as self-sufficient individuals willing to stand up to the Government on their own. This notion is perhaps appealing enough to tolerate the reality that representation by counsel is sometimes the difference between whether a defendant goes free or goes to jail. But to allow self-representation at the penalty phase of a capital case is constitutionally perverse, as it ignores the rights of the often-overlooked individuals who play a central role in the death penalty drama ― the twelve jurors who must decide his fate. They are the ones to whom the Constitution assigns the immense responsibility for deciding if the defendant morally deserves to die.These jurors have done nothing more than answer a jury summons and promised the court that they are capable of weighing whether to impose a life or death sentence. In return for that promise, however, the criminal justice system also made an implicit promise – that before they are asked to make what many jurors regard as the most difficult and heart wrenching decision of their lives, they would be fully informed about the person whose fate they hold in their hands. And jurors understandably want to know a host of facts – is the defendant intellectually disabled? Does the defendant suffer from a mental illness? Did the defendant have any spiritual or moral guidance growing up? Was the defendant subjected to excruciating sexual, physical or mental abuse? And lest one think that none of these facts would matter to a jury given the horrific nature of Roof’s crime, remember that a Colorado jury recently chose life over death for James Holmes, who killed twelve and wounded seventy people in a movie theater. That jury decided the ultimate sanction was not justified because of Holmes’ severe mental illness, information that a jury might never have heard if Holmes had decided to represent himself.The Supreme Court has justified the current death penalty regime on the premise that the jury will act as the conscience of the community. Jurors can only carry out this sacred function, however, if they hear all of the evidence, both for and against imposing a death sentence. Jurors often feel betrayed in cases when they later learn that a defense lawyer’s ineffectiveness meant they did not hear compelling evidence about a defendant’s mental illness or abusive childhood. And well they should. The justice system asked them to make a profoundly difficult moral and spiritual decision and then failed to give them the information that they needed to carry out their mandate.In Roof’s case, the court may believe that its ruling furthers certain values, but it has missed a far more important constitutional principle: a death sentence should never be imposed unless we have complete confidence that the jury’s decision is a reliable and knowing one based on all of the facts. With Dylann Roof representing himself, that outcome is simply impossible. We owe it to the jurors and to ourselves as the society for whom the jurors speak that they hear all about Roof’s life before we ask them whether he should be sentenced to death."
34,HEALTHY LIVING,Violence Spreads Like A Contagious Infection Among Friends,"Ronnie Cohen, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/violence-spreads-like-a-contagious-infection-among-friends_us_586bd2a4e4b0d9a5945c8f23,We can't punish our way out of this problem.,2017-01-03,"Kids with a friend who had badly hurt someone were themselves 183 percent more likely to report having badly hurt someone else, according to a new report.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586bd55c1900002b000e2a68.jpeg?cache=yO3IuTsYD6&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - - Adolescents who engaged in violent activities were more likely to have friends – and friends of friends – who had been violent, a new study shows.“Violent acts tend to cluster through social networks, and they spread like a contagious disease spreads from one person to another,” the study’s senior author Brad Bushman said in a phone interview.A psychology and communications professor at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Bushman analyzed interviews from the 1990s with nearly 6,000 American students in grades seven through twelve.Compared to students whose friends had never hurt anyone, kids with a friend who had badly hurt someone were themselves 183 percent more likely to report having badly hurt someone, too, the report in the American Journal of Public Health shows.If a friend had pulled a weapon on someone, the youth were 140 percent more likely to have pulled a weapon, and if a friend had been involved in a serious fight, the youth were 48 percent more likely to have been in a serious fight. Interviewers asked the students to name up to five boys and five girls they considered friends at their schools.In male students alone, the likelihood of seriously hurting someone rose 82 percent for each additional friend who had seriously hurt someone.The association extended beyond immediate friends and friends of friends with four degrees of separation for serious fights and three degrees of separation for threatening someone with a weapon.“It’s the first study we know of to see how far it spreads – up to four degrees, which is pretty amazing,” Bushman said.Dr. Gary Slutkin, an epidemiologist and infectious-disease control specialist, fully expected the results.“You’re doing what your friend is doing, who’s doing what his friend is doing, who’s doing what his friend is doing,” he told Reuters Health. “You’re not thinking about consequences. You’re thinking about what your friends do.”“This is one of now hundreds of studies that, if you add them all up, there’s no way of seeing it other than violence being a contagious epidemic health problem,” said Slutkin, founder of Cure Violence at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health.He has long thought about violence as a contagious disease and has worked to stop it in communities throughout the world by identifying the perpetrators and intervening in the same way he did with HIV carriers.When it was his mission to figure out how to stop the spread of HIV in Africa, Slutkin realized that explaining the deadly nature of AIDS failed to convince young men to wear condoms. But they would use condoms to protect themselves against the disease if they thought their friends wore them.Slutkin has applied his understanding of friends motivating friends for better or for worse in his work fighting street violence throughout the world.By employing former gang members to interrupt and prevent violence, he has seen communities slash violent crimes by 40 to 100 percent, he said.Punishment has not worked to control the spread of violence, Slutkin said.“People are very comfortable with punishment, and it is not the way of out this problem,” he said. “It’s like treating a patient over and over again with the wrong medicine.”It’s possible that the cure for violence could be spread through the same networks of friends as the violence itself, Bushman said.“Punishment is not a main driver of the changing of behavior,” Slutkin said. “In order to get behaviors to change, you have to be interactive with people in your own peer group and see that you’re getting approval from your own peer group,” he said.SOURCE: bit.ly/2ifRaip American Journal of Public Health, online December 20, 2016."

It was September 2010, and he had just woken up to find that both of his legs — along with plans to spend his career in the military — were gone. At the time, Mast had been serving in the Army for 12 years. “I was at the top of my game, and I loved what I was doing,” he told The Huffington Post. But when a roadside bomb in Afghanistan tore through his body and nearly ended his life, Mast knew his military days were over. Six years later, Mast, now 36, said he is both relieved and ready to be serving his country again — only this time, it’s not on the battlefield. Mast, a Republican, was sworn in Tuesday to represent Florida’s 18th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives. The newly elected congressman is fulfilling a goal he set for himself in a recovery room at Walter Reed. He had talked with his wife of almost 10 years and his father, who had also served in the Army, and they encouraged him to overcome the devastation of his situation and find a new way forward.One of the most poignant moments of that period, Mast said, was a conversation he had with his dad during the recovery.“He looks at me and says very sternly and very seriously, ‘Brian, you cannot let this keep you down. You have to find a way to get out there and pull yourself up,’” Mast recalled. “And he said very specifically, ‘You have to find a way to get back to work.’”Mast internalized that conversation. He promised himself, his wife and his 6-month-old son — their only child at the time — that he would fight every day for them and that he would not let his injury or his new reality keep him down. He refused to let the best example he set for his kids be something that happened in the past.“I think everybody has a purpose in life,” he added. “My purpose in life — and I say this quite literally — was serving and defending our country.” After his injury, he came to the conclusion that “in order for the best defense I could give, for that to be in front of me, I thought it would be maybe as a member of Congress.”To do that, he first had to learn to walk again, adjusting to his new prosthetic legs. He sought to find a normal routine for himself and for his family, which now includes three children under the age of 6. Then, he got back to work. In the Army, Mast had helped detect and destroy improvised explosive devices. In civilian life, he was able to apply his military skills at several federal agencies on counterterrorism. He worked for the National Nuclear Security Administration; taught classes on post-blast analysis and homemade explosives at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and worked as an explosive specialist for the Department of Homeland Security. Meanwhile, Mast was also finishing up a degree at Harvard. In the August primary for Florida’s 18th District, Mast defeated five other Republican contenders, and in November, he ran against businessman and Democrat Randy Perkins. (The seat is being vacated by Democrat Patrick Murphy, who lost a Senate race to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio in November.) On Nov. 8, Mast defeated Perkins by more than 10 percentage points, clinching a seat in the battleground district in southeastern Florida.Since Election Day, Mast has visited Washington, D.C., several times for new member orientation and training — or as he calls it, “kindergarten for Congress.” Much of that time is spent learning the fundamentals of the office, from hiring a staff to learning how to balance time between your district and the Capitol, but Mast said one meeting in particular stood out to him.One week after the election, each party held a closed-door, general committee meeting, he said. Mast said he was energized by what unfolded during the Republican Party’s meeting. “If it had been broadcast on C-SPAN, Americans would have been tuning in to see it,” he said. The delegation was debating what it meant to “drain the swamp” — a promise President-elect Donald Trump made during the final month of his campaign to clean up the establishment base, lobbyists and special interests in Washington. “It wasn’t about doing something for themselves. It was about fulfilling this mandate to the American people of ‘draining the swamp,’ getting to the root of what that really means, what each individual, each representative, thought that meant, and it’s inspiring,” he added. “I wish people could’ve seen it. It was encouraging, to hear people argue that way. It’s what people want to happen in Washington, and it’s what people miss seeing.”Locally, Mast said he will prioritize an everglades restoration program to repair the “dysfunctional” relationship between Lake Okeechobee and Florida’s coastal areas ― one that is contaminating the waterways and destroying the coastal estuaries. It’s an issue he says is extremely important to his constituents.Nationally, the young congressman plans to tap into his military background and advocate for veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs, specifically by ensuring veterans have quick, easy access to health care at all times. “Our veterans that were willing to risk their life for our country — they deserve the best possible care, the best possible treatment and the best possible attitude,” Mast said. “Every time they go to a VA medical center, they should be treated as though they’re the president walking in the door. If they’re treated any other way, then they’re not given what they earned.”Finally, Mast hopes to have continued involvement in counterterrorism efforts, whether it be through a committee seat or in another capacity.“The defense of this homeland is ... very, very close to my heart,” he said. “It’s how I spent my life, it’s how I nearly gave my life, and I don’t want anybody else to have to witness the kind of [violence] that I’ve witnessed.”This post was updated after Mast was sworn in Tuesday to reflect that had happened."

If they’re treated any other way, then they’re not given what they earned.”Finally, Mast hopes to have continued involvement in counterterrorism efforts, whether it be through a committee seat or in another capacity.“The defense of this homeland is ... very, very close to my heart,” he said. “It’s how I spent my life, it’s how I nearly gave my life, and I don’t want anybody else to have to witness the kind of [violence] that I’ve witnessed.”This post was updated after Mast was sworn in Tuesday to reflect that had happened."

A federal jury convicted Roof on Dec. 15 of all murder and hate crime charges stemming from the shooting.U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel made his decision Monday evening, following a full-day closed hearing that weighed the findings of a psychiatric evaluation of Roof in jail over the weekend, reports The Post and Courier.In a previous competency hearing in November, Roof was declared mentally fit for trial. But after the killer said he wanted to represent himself during the penalty proceedings, one of his lawyers called for another evaluation.It’s not clear what the latest psychiatric evaluation found because the hearing was closed to the public and press to ensure a fair trial, Gergel said. Attorney Jay Bender, who argued on behalf of The Post and Courier and other news outlets to open the hearing, said the extreme tragedy of the case was the very reason it should be completely transparent. “There is a wound in the community,” he argued, and open proceedings would be an opportunity for “catharsis.”Roof’s racist views developed online and ended in carnage when he killed the nine black worshipers. The New York Times reports that he plans to make an opening statement when the sentencing phase begins on Wednesday, but he doesn’t plan to call witnesses or present evidence.Gergel also ruled that Roof can’t approach witnesses or the jury during the proceedings, according to CBS News. He must also sit in a chair farthest from the jury and any victims’ family members who are attending the trial. "

The security of that personal data concerns the Obama administration, too, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson wrote in a letter to members of Congress dated Dec. 30 and provided by sources to news outlets on Tuesday. Johnson’s didn’t mention Trump by name in the letter. But he stressed the importance of the government’s promise to use information collected for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, solely for that purpose, with exceptions for potential security threats or criminal activity. “We believe these representations made by the U.S. government, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored,” Johnson wrote. The Trump team seems concerned that DHS may be working to protect DACA recipients and others, although the president-elect has insisted he will focus on criminals. The Trump transition team asked DHS whether immigrants’ records had been changed, which may be an attempt to root out whether anything was done to protect DACA recipients from deportation, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Trump hasn’t said exactly what he plans to do about so-called Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. He has vowed to end DACA, which has allowed more than 750,000 Dreamers to live without fear of deportation and legally drive and work. Trump has said he wants to “work something out” for Dreamers. But that comment, made without any specifics, gives little comfort to the DACA recipients he says should lose the protections, particularly when he has promised to ramp up deportations.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on plans for DACA, or on recipients’ information.Some Democrats have urged President Barack Obama, who created DACA in 2012, to do something to protect DACA recipients before he leaves office. More than 100 House Democrats wrote to Obama in early December asking him make an executive order saying information collected for DACA should not be used for other purposes. Another president could undo such an order, but Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) argued the move would at least require Trump to be open about his plans. If Trump does take action against DACA recipients, he would overturn decades of precedent, according to Johnson’s letter to House members. Johnson wrote that DHS and its predecessor have a longstanding practice of using information provided for deferred action only for that purpose, and not for enforcement except in extreme circumstances. This is true not just of DACA, but also of people who apply for other protections, such as visas provided to victims of crime and trafficking, or people provided temporary protected status because they cannot safely return to their home countries.White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Tuesday also emphasized the “longstanding precedent” against using deferred action applicants’ information for deportation. He noted that Trump has at times seemed to agree with Obama that it would be better to focus on deporting criminals than Dreamers ― but also that the president-elect’s comments have been been inconsistent.“When it comes to what he will do after Jan. 20th, even the current president of the United States is not sure exactly what the incoming president may decide to do,” Earnest said.

In season 8’s premiere, the former governor of California nixed Donald Trump’s famous “You’re fired!” catchphrase and gave it his own twist. “You’re terminated,” Schwarzenegger said to each of Monday night’s axed contestants. After unleashing the catchphrase on YouTube personality Carrie Keagan, Schwarzenegger added “Get to the chopper,” a reference to his film “Predator.”Following the termination of singer Carnie Wilson, he added, “Hasta la vista, baby,” a line from the movie “Terminator 2.” Apparently, “Crom laughs at your four winds” didn’t make the cut. Not yet anyway. While Trump’s signature line was fired, the president-elect’s presence was still felt on the show: He was listed as executive producer in the credits. "

After all, the AP introduced its prize in 1957 and has never given it to a wide receiver ― not even in 1987, when several other sports journalism groups bestowed the honor on Jerry Rice. But 28-year-old Antonio Brown of the Pittsburgh Steelers deserves the recognition as much as anyone this season. Let’s start with the obvious: His 106 catches (on 155 targets) rank second in the league and his 1,284 yards (he didn’t play in Week 17) slot him fourth. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive year that Brown has eclipsed the 100-catch barrier, tying an NFL record set by former Indianapolis Colts great and future Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison.Better yet, in an offense starving for big plays, the Central Michigan product ranks third with 22 catches of 20 yards or more, trailing only T.Y. Hilton and Julio Jones. As a reference point, consider that other elite wide receivers like Mike Evans, A.J. Green, DeAndre Hopkins, Kelvin Benjamin, Allen Robinson, Brandon Marshall, Brandin Cooks and Demaryius Thomas all have 15 or less.Plenty of credit for Brown’s production should go to his superstar quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger. But also remember that Pittsburgh severely lacks a second option at receiver. Dynamic deep threat Martavis Bryant is suspended for the year, Sammie Coates has been injured and second-year man Eli Rogers is a mixed bag. Versatile All-World running back Le’Veon Bell assumes the role at times, although Brown draws the top cornerback every week and often absorbs double coverage, only to beat it nearly every week.Brown, a former sixth-round pick, separates himself with his impeccable route running and a remarkable consistency to flat out catch the football. While No. 84 has been targeted on about 25 percent of Roethlisberger’s throws, he has dropped just two passes all season. In fact, the wideout’s 1.3 percent drop rate is fourth-best in the league for receivers with at least 60 catches (behind Doug Baldwin, Stefon Diggs and Pierre Garcon), according to SportingCharts.com. Simply put, nobody ― regardless of position ― is steadier or more lethal on a weekly basis.Perhaps the real genius of the 5-foot-10, 181-pound Brown ― well on his way to a fourth straight All-Pro selection ― is the sheer timeliness of his receptions.Take into consideration Pittsburgh’s crucial Week 16 comeback against Baltimore to clinch an AFC North title and, in turn, a playoff bid. With no timeouts left and the season dwindling, Brown’s Herculean effort to find the end zone sealed a 31-27 win. Moreover, his stellar play in the clutch is a key reason why Big Ben ranks second in the league in fourth-quarter quarterback rating.Additionally, Brown is second in the league for catches for first downs ― with 64, he’s behind only Tampa Bay’s resurgent Mike Evans ― and his 12 touchdown catches trail only Green Bay’s Jordy Nelson.Of course, realistically we know that the chances of Brown (and his unmistakeable touchdown celebrations) capturing MVP honors are extremely low, particularly with the sizzling play of Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady.The last non-QB to win the award was Vikings running back Adrian Peterson in 2012, when he had one of the single greatest seasons in NFL history.

She wouldn’t, and she didn’t.”The “Star Wars” heroine died on Dec. 27, 2016, days after suffering a heart attack onboard a flight bound for Los Angeles. Reynolds, a Hollywood icon, died just one day later following a stroke.“I’ve been having an out-of-body experience,” Joely said about the tragic loss. “The world lost Carrie and Debbie ... and we lost our hero.”Joely and her younger sister, Tricia, share a father, Eddie, with their well-known older half-sister. The two women told ABC’s Chris Connelly that Carrie was extremely generous and sensitive.“She was the coolest big sister in the world,” Tricia, 48, said. “She was a badass body gun-toting princess. Who has that?” Joely says she shared a final conversation with her late half-sister via text message the night before Carrie boarded the flight where she would suffer a fateful heart attack.“We talked about age because she was floored that she just turned 60. We talked about children. We talked about our frail mothers,” Joely, 49, said. “And I promised to see her for Christmas.”Joely kept her promise, though under tragic circumstances. She visited the beloved actress and mental health advocate in the hospital over the holiday.“I remember just holding [Carrie’s] hand and telling her that we were there,” Joely said. “That we would make sure that her daughter was whole, which she will be.” Joely described Carrie’s 24-year-old daughter Billie Lourd as “soulful” and “smart.” “She was obviously rattled to the core,” Tricia said of Lourd. “But she’s handling it.”"

According to the Guardian, Tesco ― which previously charged one pound for a pack of women’s razors and only 50 pence for a pack of men’s (that’s about one dollar and 20 cents for women and 85 cents for men) ― made the announcement on Monday in a letter to Labour party MP Paula Sheriff. “We have aligned the prices of these products so that the male and female razors are the same price per unit,” a Tesco representative wrote. “We have done this by reducing the cost of the women’s razors and keeping the cost of the men’s razors the same.”Last year, Sheriff led the campaign in the UK to scrap the “pink tax” for women’s hygiene products. “This is a welcome step from Tesco, and I hope other companies will identify and correct similar disparities,” she said after receiving the letter. Gendered pricing isn’t exclusive to Tesco ― a year ago, The Guardian reported that women in the UK ultimately pay 37 percent more than men do for the same things ― from clothing to toys to hygiene products. The issue is also a prevalent one in the U.S. In 2012, Ellen Degeneres mocked Bic for making “For Her” pens ― apparently, Bic thought women should pay more for a pen just because it’s pink or purple. Dry cleaning and haircuts are also costing women more money than men. Tesco’s plan to cheapen an already-cheap product might seem like a tiny step, but it’s a step in the right direction."

Poyang Lake can swell to over 1,700 square miles, an area larger than Rhode Island. But photographs released by China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency in November show it completely dry in parts, desiccated by drought.The website EcoWatch describes tourists walking “on large portions” of the parched lake, located in Jiangxi province. Photos show ships stranded on the exposed lakebed, while cattle graze on what is usually the lake floor. Poyang is connected to the Yangtze River and is home to several critically endangered species, including the Yangtze finless porpoise.The lake has been shrinking for years. Since 2003, Poyang’s dry period has been starting earlier and lasting longer, according to a 2015 study by researchers at the East China Normal University in Shanghai. This year, the dry season began more than 50 days earlier than usual.Climate change, industrial activities like sand mining and the construction of the enormous Three Gorges Dam, which opened in 2003 and spans the Yangtze River, are all possible culprits for the lake’s decline. Local authorities are now scrambling to save Poyang. But not everyone is thrilled with their plan.In 2008, the Jiangxi provincial government first proposed building a 10,000-foot sluice gate ― in effect, a dam that would be constructed across the channel that links Poyang to the Yangtze ― to keep more water in the lake during the dry season. According to a report published by local officials last month, the gate could help raise water levels, improve water quality and promote shipping on the lake, among other benefits. China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection recently began an environmental risk assessment of the plan, The New York Times reported last week. If senior officials do not reject the proposal for the gate, construction should start once the review is concluded. Environmentalists, however, are rushing to put the brakes on the project, saying the gate could trigger “irreversible” ecological damage.“I think [they’re] proposing a solution without understanding the causes of the problem,” David Shankman, a professor at the University of Alabama who has studied Poyang Lake, told the Times. “The whole idea of the dam is that there would be some economic benefit, but there may be potential long-term ecological problems.”For one, further cutting off Poyang’s connection with the Yangtze could cause drought conditions to worsen. “Rivers and lakes depend on each other,” environmental activist Wang Yongchen told Guangzhou Daily in 2012. “The Three Gorges Dam has already kept water from the Yangtze and the lake, and the new Poyang Lake dam would further obstruct the natural connection.”Scientists say the project could also “irreparably” change the lake’s seasonal flood pulse and cause abnormally high water levels during the dry season. This could submerge the lake’s wetlands, which provide a critical habitat for birds. Half a million migratory birds flock to Poyang Lake every year, including the critically endangered Siberian crane. About 3,000 of the birds remain on Earth, according to the International Crane Foundation.“The problem [with the dam] is not whether the Siberian cranes are coming to Poyang for the winter, the question is whether Siberian cranes will still exist in this world,” Zhou Haixiang, a researcher on migrating birds at the Shenyang University of Technology, told the South China Morning Post last month. “We have no other choice but to protect them.”The dam also threatens other endangered species that rely on the lake, activists say. Among them is the Yangtze finless porpoise, which lives exclusively in the Yangtze River and the two lakes connected to it, Poyang and Dongting.The rare porpoises have experienced a population decline of over 13 percent per year, and could become extinct in the next five to 10 years, the World Wildlife Fund said last year. Just 1,000 are left in the wild, according to the WWF.The WWF has opposed plans for the sluice gate, saying that it could “irreversibly and unpredictably” impact water quality and biodiversity. A “dam-free project” would be the “best option for Poyang Lake to sustain a healthy ecological system,” the group said in 2014.Instead of building the sluice gate, some scientists have proposed halting sand mining to save Poyang. The lake bottom is reportedly the world’s largest sand mine. A 2014 study by researchers from Chinese, American and French institutions estimated that 236 million cubic meters of sand is removed from the lake every year, largely to make concrete for construction projects. That’s about 30 times more than the amount of sand that flows in annually from tributary rivers. “I couldn’t believe it when we did the calculations,” the University of Alabama’s Shankman, who was one of the study’s authors, told the Pulitzer Center earlier this year of the findings.Lakepedia published a before and after image of Poyang lake on its blog to illustrate the extent of the water body’s decline. The “before” image was captured on October 9th, 2000, while the “after” image is from September 27th, 2016. Use the slider to compare the two images. The story continues below.Russia’s Lake Baikal, the world’s deepest lake, and America’s Great Lakes are also suffering from threats that include rising temperatures, low water levels and nearby forest fires.According to a 2015 study funded partly by NASA and the National Science Foundation, the world’s lakes are warming faster than the oceans and atmosphere. “The message we’re getting from our lakes is that they’re getting more and more stressed,” Catherine O’Reilly, the global study’s lead author, told The Associated Press. “With these rates of warming, the problems we’re seeing will become increasingly common.”"

Half a million migratory birds flock to Poyang Lake every year, including the critically endangered Siberian crane. About 3,000 of the birds remain on Earth, according to the International Crane Foundation.“The problem [with the dam] is not whether the Siberian cranes are coming to Poyang for the winter, the question is whether Siberian cranes will still exist in this world,” Zhou Haixiang, a researcher on migrating birds at the Shenyang University of Technology, told the South China Morning Post last month. “We have no other choice but to protect them.”The dam also threatens other endangered species that rely on the lake, activists say. Among them is the Yangtze finless porpoise, which lives exclusively in the Yangtze River and the two lakes connected to it, Poyang and Dongting.The rare porpoises have experienced a population decline of over 13 percent per year, and could become extinct in the next five to 10 years, the World Wildlife Fund said last year. Just 1,000 are left in the wild, according to the WWF.The WWF has opposed plans for the sluice gate, saying that it could “irreversibly and unpredictably” impact water quality and biodiversity. A “dam-free project” would be the “best option for Poyang Lake to sustain a healthy ecological system,” the group said in 2014.Instead of building the sluice gate, some scientists have proposed halting sand mining to save Poyang. The lake bottom is reportedly the world’s largest sand mine. A 2014 study by researchers from Chinese, American and French institutions estimated that 236 million cubic meters of sand is removed from the lake every year, largely to make concrete for construction projects. That’s about 30 times more than the amount of sand that flows in annually from tributary rivers. “I couldn’t believe it when we did the calculations,” the University of Alabama’s Shankman, who was one of the study’s authors, told the Pulitzer Center earlier this year of the findings.Lakepedia published a before and after image of Poyang lake on its blog to illustrate the extent of the water body’s decline. The “before” image was captured on October 9th, 2000, while the “after” image is from September 27th, 2016. Use the slider to compare the two images. The story continues below.Russia’s Lake Baikal, the world’s deepest lake, and America’s Great Lakes are also suffering from threats that include rising temperatures, low water levels and nearby forest fires.According to a 2015 study funded partly by NASA and the National Science Foundation, the world’s lakes are warming faster than the oceans and atmosphere. “The message we’re getting from our lakes is that they’re getting more and more stressed,” Catherine O’Reilly, the global study’s lead author, told The Associated Press. “With these rates of warming, the problems we’re seeing will become increasingly common.”"

A Dutch and a Japanese are also being held captive.Last month, Duterte sent his foreign and defense ministers to Moscow to explore arms deal after a U.S. senator said he will block the sale of 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines due to concerns with the rising death toll in a war on drugs.More than 6,000 have been killed in the drug crackdown since Duterte took office on June 30, roughly a third in operations when suspected drug peddlers and users resisted arrests.

And it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties.The requests were made in a Dec. 5 meeting between Trump’s transition team and Department of Homeland Security officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by Reuters. The document offers a glimpse into the president-elect’s strategy for securing the U.S. borders and reversing polices put in place by the Obama administration. Trump’s transition team did not comment in response to Reuters inquiries. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment. In response to the transition team request, U.S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, and about the same distance along the U.S.-Canada border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by Reuters.Reuters could not determine whether the Trump team is considering a northern border barrier. During the campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the U.S.-Mexico border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with Canada.One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1,200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration.The program once deployed 6,000 airmen under President George W. Bush but was downsized by Barack Obama, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security.POLICY SHIFTThe transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since Obama took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting.Trump has said he intends to undo Obama’s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work.The program, known as DACA, collected information including participants’ addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed. Another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason, including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns, according to the internal memo seen by Reuters.A Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect DACA recipients and other migrants from deportation.On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants, a promise that may have prompted the transition team’s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities.The internal memo summarizing the meeting between Trump’s transition team and U.S. Customs and Border protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers.The Department of Homeland Security official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the U.S.-Canada border.Reuters reviewed a copy of the report, which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be $3.3 billion and cover 452 miles along border of Canada and the states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11.37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing.Pedestrian fences require more staff and would cost $11.2 million per mile versus $4.1 million per mile to build to build, according to the report.In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which data is available, border patrol agents apprehended 2,626 illegal migrants on the U.S.-Canada border compared to 331,333 apprehended on the U.S.-Mexico border.(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley; Editing by Sue Horton and Brian Thevenot)"

We hereby declare it the (unauthorized and extremely unofficial) anthem of one Joseph Talbot, an upstate New York man whose attempts at hiding a drunk driving arrest have backfired spectacularly.New York State Police troopers arrested the 43-year-old bank executive for driving under the influence on Thursday. And, according to troopers, Talbot pitched a fit throughout the process: He called one trooper an “asshole” and accused the officer of trying to ruin his family. He also refused to be fingerprinted and photographed, police say, “because he did not wish to appear in the local paper.”As a result, officers tacked on a second-degree charge of obstructing governmental administration, then took him to the Wayne County Jail, where he was booked and photographed anyway. Talbot is scheduled to appear in the Town of Palmyra Court on Feb. 1.As Talbot feared, The Times of Wayne County published his booking photo Saturday, to which he reacted by purchasing every copy of the paper he could lay his hands on, apparently in an attempt to keep the news of his arrest quiet.Byrne Dairy store clerk Amber Streeter told Rochester ABC affiliate WHAM he bought 70 copies from her.“He told me he went to about four, five other stores before he got here,” Streeter said. “Also that he wasn’t going to stop until he bought every paper out.”The paper, which has a circulation of about 12,000, says Talbot succeeded in buying about 900 copies in the Newark, New York, area ― not enough to kill the story but just enough for the attempt itself to be newsworthy and gain additional attention.Isn’t it ironic?"

Bob Goodlatte's amendment will change the Office of Congressional Ethics, leaving it far less powerful than it was before.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586b13a71500002300916cfa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As one of their first actions in the new Congress, House Republicans are planning to significantly change the Office of Congressional Ethics, removing the entity’s independence, barring it from investigating anonymous complaints and even changing the group’s name.Less than 24 hours before the House convenes and votes on its rules for the 115th Congress, Republicans adopted an amendment Monday night, 119 to 74, from Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) that would fundamentally change the OCE. The independent ethics board investigates complaints against members and issues reports to the Ethics Committee.Specifically, the amendment would place the OCE under the “oversight” of the lenient Ethics Committee and rename it the Office of Congressional Complaint Review. The new group would no longer be able to release information to the public, employ anyone “for a position involving communications with the public,” or directly contact law enforcement without approval. It would also be prohibited from investigating anonymous complaints.Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the change would “functionally destroy” the office.“Republicans claim they want to ‘drain the swamp,’ but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions,” Pelosi said. “Evidently, ethics are the first casualty of the new Republican Congress.”Republicans themselves defended the changes as necessary adjustments to protect members from political witch hunts.“Now you can’t make a false accusation,” Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) told The Huffington Post Monday night. “Now you can answer back to the people that make accusations against you. This has been flawed from the very get-go.”Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) released a statement saying the OCE will still “operate independently.” It will continue to take complaints from the public, investigate them and decide whether to refer them to the House Ethics Committee.He continued:With the amendment adopted last night, the bipartisan, evenly-divided House Ethics Committee will now have oversight of the complaints office. But the Office is not controlled by the Committee, and I expect that oversight authority to be exercised solely to ensure the Office is properly following its rules and laws, just as any government entity should. I have made clear to the new Chair of the House Ethics Committee that it is not to interfere with the Office’s investigations or prevent it from doing its job.The vote took place in secret, by anonymous ballot and behind closed doors, so it’s not possible to know which representatives approved of the measure. But a number of Republicans take issue with OCE investigating anonymous tips and have been looking for a way to ensure that accusers of wrongdoing must attach their name to a complaint.“It needs to be aired in the public,” Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) said. Asked if that would deter people from making complaints, Rice agreed it was a “double-edged sword,” but said it was “too easy to put forth baseless claims with no responsibility.”The effect, of course, of eliminating OCE’s ability to issue reports is that ethics complaints won’t be aired in public. The Ethics Committee has generally slapped members on the wrist for violations of rules, or simply shrugged them off.The Office of Congressional Ethics, which was established in early 2008 after a number of scandals ― including the Jack Abramoff controversy of exchanging gifts and donations for votes ― issues public reports of potential wrongdoing with a recommendation to the Ethics Committee on whether to investigate further. This system has allowed the public a view into some investigations that the Ethics Committee later says are not worthy of reprimand ― a common conclusion from a panel that often operates on a partisan doctrine of mutually assured destruction.But the whole idea of the OCE was to remove politics from ethics investigations.However, for Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) ― Trump’s pick to be interior secretary ― one of the advantages of functionally handling ethics investigations inside the Ethics Committee is that Republicans and Democrats would be in the fold.“When ethics are involved, I think it’s always helpful to have both sides,” he said. “So it can’t be skewed one way or the other based on politics.”One of Trump’s major pledges is to “drain the swamp,” but ethics groups were having a hard time seeing how removing the independence of an ethics watchdog that has provided aggressive oversight and detailed reports of potential wrongdoing was in keeping with that pledge.“This is a shameful move by House Republicans that’ll weaken ethics oversight and make members less accountable for their actions,” said Adam Smith of the liberal advocacy group Every Voice.The leaders of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released a statement calling the OCE an “outstanding” accomplishment of the House.“It has played a critical role in seeing that the congressional ethics process is no longer viewed as merely a means to sweep problems under the rug,” said Norman Eisen and Richard Painter, the group’s chairman and vice chairman. “If the 115th Congress begins with rules amendments undermining OCE, it is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the House to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated.”Daniel Schuman, the policy director of the activist organization Demand Progress, also had stern words.“With today’s action — taken behind closed doors and with no opportunity for public debate — the House now rolls back the clock to an era of corruption and decay. We will all be the worse for it,” Schuman said.As Schuman points out, another puzzling aspect of the rules change is the short notice. Republicans are fundamentally changing an ethics agency just hours before a vote, while hardly anyone in the public is watching.The rules Republicans are adopting require legislation to be posted for three days so that members and the public have a chance to read the measures and voice their input.Asked if they felt these changes were in contravention to the very rules they were adopting, Republicans shrugged off those concerns. Gosar said the public would find out, and asked what was wrong with making the changes quickly. Reminded that it was a federal holiday ― and that it was nearly 8 p.m. ― Gosar saw no problem.“The thing about it is, is that it tells us we’re ready to do business and get it done,” he said.Rice seemed to concede the point ― “I guess technically you could say that” ― but didn’t seem to have a real problem with it. And GOP Policy Chairman Luke Messer (R-Ind.) said he didn’t have any comment on the short notice of the changes. “I just came out of a three-hour rules meeting,” he said.This post has been updated with statements from Speaker Paul Ryan and from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington."

Then, the outlet said Trump’s name would come after that of Mark Burnett, who created the show, but before Schwarzenegger. As of Tuesday morning, his name appears only after all other executive producers’ names have been shown.That said, CNBC social media editor Steve Kopack appeared to spot Trump’s name at another point in the show, although we couldn’t immediately find where.What role Trump would have with the show became something of a small controversy following his election last November.But Monday’s credits only confirm what MGM, the show’s production company, and Trump’s team had already said. MGM noted he would keep his executive producer credit, and Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump, said in December that Trump would remain financially connected to the show. Variety estimates he will earn at least $10,000 per episode this season, but noted that he will be paid by MGM, not NBC. Some questioned around that time whether the the show would divert the president-elect’s attention from his primary new job as leader of the free world. In a tweet, Trump said then he will have “NOTHING” to do with the show this season."

Other dancers previously expressed concern over backlash and social media abuse the company has received since their performance announcement. “Yeah, in a way, I guess we are doing that,” Dolan replied. “What other choices do we have? What else would you suggest?”Dolan reportedly focused on the idea of “tolerance” during the meeting, which took place Dec. 27, with the largely white group of dancers. He compared some Trump supporters’ hateful messages with those of dissenters writing in protest of the company’s decision to perform, labeling it all “ironic.”Dolan defended the decision in part by stating that he did not think it would hurt the brand, according to the transcript.“I would simply say, we’re celebrating a new president, not necessarily this president,” he said. The Marie Claire piece comes on the heels of continued reports that the Trump team is having trouble finding performers for his Jan. 20 Inauguration Day. British “X Factor” singer Rebecca Ferguson recently stated she will not agree to perform unless she can sing the anti-racism ballad “Strange Fruit.” So far, the Rockettes will be joined by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and “America’s Got Talent” singer Jackie Evancho.Madison Square Garden, which oversees the Rockettes, stated in response to the story that Dolan “stands behind everything he said during the meeting.” But the company disavowed the anonymous person who produced the recording by suggesting it was made by the same disgruntled dancer who previously spoke out against the inauguration performance. Read MSG’s full statement below: This is one person who continues to attempt to represent the entire team of Rockettes. This time it’s in a story that is the result of an unauthorized recording that violated the confidentiality of all of her sister Rockettes. While Mr. Dolan stands behind everything he said during the meeting, no one in that room believed they were speaking publicly. Everyone in the meeting had the chance to speak their mind in a safe setting, and many did. Her secret recording was deceitful and cowardly and has betrayed all of her fellow Rockettes.

He would kind of trawl around them.”Everyone in Hollywood seems to have a Trump anecdote. The reality-TV-star-turned-politician has appeared in handful of films over the years, including “Home Alone 2: Lost in New York” and “Zoolander,” as well as in television series like “Sex and the City” and, of course, the “Apprentice” franchise. “[Trump] was famous for only granting permission for films to shoot on his real estate locations if they put him in as a cameo,” Affleck continued. “The director Marty Brest told me he’d had to create a whole hand-shaking scene in ‘Scent of a Woman’ where Trump comes out of the door and goes, ‘Hey! Donald Trump, nice to meet you,’ as he bumps into Al Pacino. The ego was there a long time ago.”The “Batman v Superman” actor, who has stumped for progressive causes throughout his career, also expressed his displeasure over the anti-immigrant rhetoric the president-elect used in his campaign.“I spent five months in London [last year] and I have to say the Brexit vote smacked of the same kinds of things I heard here,” he said. “People whose overarching political agenda is that immigrants are ruining things for us or immigrants are getting one over on us somehow, taking advantage.

It was only after they saw the video that they realized what happened: Little Bodie came to his brother Brock’s rescue.The toddler assessed the situation, looking to see what had to be done, before attempting to lift it off of his brother, Brock. When that failed, he began to push the dresser off of him to almost immediate success.The boys’ mother believes the heroic act demonstrated a remarkable bond between her boys.“I really saw it come to play in just this act of love for a twin brother,” she told KUTV.Both mom and dad confessed that they were initially hesitant about posting the video online, with Kayli saying: “I felt like the worst mom in the world.”But they both agreed that by sharing the video they hope it will raise awareness about the dangers of unsecured dressers.Today, the Shoffs said the dresser is bolted to the wall and the knobs on the drawers have been removed to minimize the chance the boys will try climbing it again.Kayli said she realizes that she can’t make her home 100% toddler-proof, but every bit helps. “I can do this one thing to make my home a little more safer for my children,” she told KUTV.Earlier last year, furniture company IKEA urged parents to secure furniture to walls, to prevent them from tipping over ― a tip that could be applicable to furniture from other stores as well. This advisory followed the deaths of three children that were crushed, leading to the recall of MALM dressers and chests."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ford-mexico-plant_us_586bcf32e4b0d9a5945c8b7b,The automaker is investing $700 million and adding 700 jobs in Michigan.,2017-01-03,Ford's stock jumped more than 3 percent after the announcement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586be1f31500002f00e9e26a.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ford Motor Company scrapped plans on Tuesday to open a $1.6 billion factory in Mexico. Instead, the automaker said it will invest $700 million to expand a plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, adding 700 new jobs. The company plans to build a new stable of electric vehicles and self-driving cars at the factory, including a hybrid-electric Mustang and F-150 pickup truck. The plant will also roll out new technology, such as a station that wirelessly charges electric vehicles.While on the campaign trail last year, President-elect Donald Trump attacked Ford’s plans to move production of its Focus vehicle line to Mexico. He later falsely claimed he’d convinced the company to keep a plant open in Kentucky. In fact, Ford had never planned to close the plant.The company said that Trump was likewise not responsible for its latest decision.“We didn’t cut a deal with Trump. We did it for our business,” Ford CEO Mark Fields told CNN on Tuesday.Still, Fields praised the incoming administration at a press conference on Tuesday morning. “We’re encouraged by the pro-growth policies President-elect Trump and the new Congress have indicated they’ll pursue,” Fields said. “We believe these tax and regulatory reforms are critically important to boost U.S. competitiveness.” Like many automakers, Ford has over the last two decades moved some production of small vehicles to Mexico, where labor costs are cheaper. In most cases, though, U.S. jobs remained at Ford.When the company moved production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, workers who’d previously assembled the small car switched to making more popular SUVs and pickup trucks. “To cancel a plant in Mexico is huge,” Jeremy Acevedo, analyst at the auto site Edmunds, told The Huffington Post. “There’s no industry quite as embroiled with unions and driving down labor costs as the auto industry.” Ford’s plan to add more jobs in Michigan has strong union support. “This is equivalent to a new assembly plant,” Jimmy Settles, vice president of the United Automobile Workers union, said during the press conference. “We fought very, very hard to make certain we could make a commitment early on for them to put this autonomous vehicle in the United States.”“Too many times in the past we have produced quality vehicles and we have seen our jobs go overseas,” he added.The announcement came hours after Trump criticized General Motors, another Detroit auto giant, for assembling some Chevrolet Cruze hatchbacks sold in the U.S. at a plant in Mexico.The biggest threat to jobs, however, may not be outsourcing, but automation. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence, coupled with 3D-printing technology, are likely to eliminate a great many jobs in the manufacturing industry over the next decade. Last year, billionaire Elon Musk showed off an array of robots already working in his Tesla Gigafactory, the $5 billion manufacturing facility where Musk plans to build electric cars and lithium-ion batteries. In November, Trump struck a deal with the air conditioning giant Carrier to keep about 850 factory jobs in Indiana, in exchange for tax incentives and, potentially, lucrative federal contracts for Carrier’s parent company, United Technology Corp. Days later, United Technology CEO Greg Hayes said the company planned to invest $16 million at the Indiana factory “to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive.”“Now, is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower-cost labor? No,” Hayes said during an appearance on CNBC’s “Mad Money.” “But we will make that plant competitive just because we’ll make the capital investments there.”Arthur Delaney contributed to this report."

Through the centuries, one of the fundamental traditions of the brotherhood has remained constant: the secrets of the Abakuá must remain secret, at all costs. The weight of this secrecy is palpable in the works of the late master printmaker Belkis Ayón, who made the Abakuá her primary subject matter. Throughout her career, the Afro-Cuban artist used the technique of collography to create sharp and unnerving representations of Abakuá folklore imbued with a feminist, intellectual edge. A retrospective of the artist’s works is on view now for the first time at a U.S. museum.As part of her unique process, Ayón collaged a variety of textured materials ― from soft paper to sandpaper to vegetable peelings ― onto a cardboard matrix, which she’d then cover with ink and run through a printing press. By layering a wide range of surfaces with different feels and absorbencies, Ayón could precisely control her ink ― whether it came out thick and velvety or delicate and scaly, yielding prints that resembled meticulously sketched drawings. Ayón, who was born in Havana, Cuba, in 1967, became interested in the Abakuá and their mysterious traditions in 1985, when she was making art as a high school student. She was drawn, primarily, to the figure of Sikán, an African princess and the sole female character in Abakuá mythology. According to legend, it was Sikán who originally discovered the magic of Abakuá, by accidentally trapping a fish who subsequently spoke to her in the mystical “voice” of Abakuá. Since women were banned from knowing the organization’s deepest secrets, Sikán was sworn to secrecy. The princess, however, gave in to temptation and divulged her forbidden knowledge to her fiancée; her life was sacrificed as a result. In Abakuá lore, Sikán is killed for her transgressions. But in Ayón’s works, the figure is brought back to life, in part serving as a proxy for the artist herself. As Ayón put it: “I see myself as Sikán, in a certain way an observer, an intermediary and a revealer,” an exhibition statement from the Fowler Museum recounts her saying. “Sikán is a transgressor, and as such I see her, and I see myself.” Like the princess, Ayón tests the limits of secrecy enshrouding the Abakuá, saturating her prints with graphic symbols and visual riddles ― sacred fish, roosters, goats, medallions, and snakes. The foreboding presence of silence bleeds through Ayón’s artistic style, in which humans appear as flattened figures in greyscale hues, endowed with large, expressive eyes and no mouths. “These figures can look at you but cannot speak,” art historian Cristina Figueroa explained in an interview with NPR. “So you have to interpret what they’re trying to say through the expressions in their eyes.” Furthermore, Ayón injects the all-male narrative of the Abakuá with feminine presence in her prints, accomplishing in art what could never manifest in real life. In “La cena (The Supper),” she riffs off the familiar image of The Last Supper, with Sikán replacing Jesus at the center of the table, and an assembly of lattice-laden shadow figures, also women, at her sides. Together Sikán and Ayón challenged a realm of knowledge ordained solely for men, art serving as an alternative means of communication that rests on the power of the eyes, not the tongue. Another, more sinister connection between Sikán and Ayón emerged on Sept. 11, 1999, when the artist shot herself with her father’s gun at just 32 years old. At the time of her death, Ayón was already a famed figure in the Cuban art world, having shown at the Venice Biennale in ‘93 and sold works to both MOCA and MoMA. For her loved ones, Ayón’s death was a complete and utter surprise, a mystery oddly akin to the shadowy scenarios that served as her subject matter. Cuban police allegedly investigated the possibility that the Abakuá was behind Ayón’s death, perhaps for revealing some fraternal secret or disrespecting its boundaries, but later ruled that suspicion out. The artist’s death was deemed a suicide, a conclusion with which her family agrees. Still, a sense of uncertainty looms over the event; a riddle that will never be fully solved. Following her death, Ayón’s family has worked tirelessly to preserve her oeuvre and share it with the world. Her sister gave up her career as a doctor to conserve the works, a challenge outside of a museum in Cuba’s humid atmosphere. It has long been a dream of Ayón’s family to see her work exhibited and celebrated around the world, making her first U.S. retrospective a truly momentous event. “Nkame: A Retrospective of Cuban Printmaker Belkis Ayón” is organized by the Belkis Ayón Estate and Ayón Manso with the Fowler Museum in Los Angeles, guest-curated by Cristina Vives-Figueroa.

It was the weekend of his second inauguration. My family expressed concern over my public display of political party affiliation. They worried this could alienate friends, co-workers or even prevent me from future employment opportunities.I explained it was important for me to express my admiration for our first black president because it went deeper than public policy. For me, Barack Obama symbolizes hope, change and the power of your dreams. His ascent to the highest office of power in the United States showed me anything was possible, and not something people simply say.For the next four years, I carried the dream of meeting the President. I saved a clipping of my article and hoped to share it with him, shake his hand and thank him for giving me something real to believe in. As his time in office neared to a close, I decided to do something about that wish. I bought a cut-out of Barack Obama and for the next eight weeks, I carried it around with me whenever possible. Only stopping when the Chicago weather became too unpredictable. I reasoned that being around him would be good ‘practice’ and allow me to be comfortable in his presence if the opportunity to meet him ever did come up (I wanted to be prepared).The result was unexpected. Curiosity always got the best of people and someone would ask why I carried a cut-out of President Obama. The question inherently lead to conversations speckled together by laughter, their own Obama connection, advice on how to best get in touch with him and confessions of their own aspirations. It was a pattern that repeated itself regardless of the person’s gender, age and location in the city. Over the course of eight weeks we went to New York City (twice)The Chicago marathon to cheer on runners (where runners stopped for selfies).A charity gala (where crowds gathered to take photos with cardboard Barack).A Harry Potter themed dinner.A client’s tv segment on WGN.A luncheon at ABC7 Chicago.A Bob’s Burger pop-up on Halloween.A networking event for women.And countless other adventures. Every encounter was overwhelmingly positive. Each time I went out with my cut-out of the President, I was exposed to people who I otherwise would have never exchanged words with.Like David who saw me writing my wish to see a female president on this ‘Before I die’ board and then wrote my name in Arabic.Or this group of elderly activists in the suburbs who were heading into the city to take a bus to Springfield, and deliver a petition for clean air to Governor Rauner.Or this tuba player whose photo session I crashed and later found out appeared on FOX’s hit show Empire.My world was rapidly expanding with each encounter filled with laughter, high fives, encouragement and praise for a president that ushered in an eight year reign of diversity. Many expressed their disappointment that his time in office was coming to an end. It felt like I had opened a portal where only the pure of heart could enter and see its beauty. Nothing fundamentally changed, but suddenly, everything was different. Not everything went according to plan. The TODAY Show security kept me from going out on the plaza with my cut-out and my homemade sign (#BarackingAround all the Way from Chicago), per their ‘no political signs’ policy. Understandable, but I could have done without the men mocking me and telling me to head to FOX News. We packed up and went to Times Square where people were more welcoming.This was my world prior to November 9.It was a place that had me sharing smiles and words of encouragement with people whose first name I did not know. We were linked by a man who broke a 219 year homogenous running streak, and showed us that anything really is possible. We were one. The world felt united, sunny and full of life.It is these memories that I carry into the new year and beyond.In 2017, Americans will usher in a new president who, I admit, casts a dark shadow on my formerly bright and sunny world.His win briefly blew out the warmth brought on by the belief that we were moving forward and could all work together, regardless of our differences. But to believe that all is lost would mean giving up when things get tough. In the wake of the 2016 election results, I’ve since found solace in Obama’s display of dignity and words of refusal to succumb to fear.I started carrying a cut-out of President Obama with the hope of meeting him. Instead, the experience allowed me to connect with a wide array of humans who believe in Obama’s vision for the world that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with working together to create the best environment for all. It is a place where women are equals, immigrants are welcomed and hate has no place in the free world. If we spent more time talking about politics and listening to each other, we might see that we have more in common than we think.These memories sustain me as change approaches. They remind me that I am not alone. I must keep going and believe in a better tomorrow.I have hope and once again, it’s thanks to President Barack Obama.Thank you for #BarackingAround with me."

That’s why they’re called catchphrases. Morning in America. Bridge to the 21st Century. Compassionate Conservatism. Yes We Can. Make America Great Again. But slogans can be just as shallow as they are catchy - and sometimes even misleading.At a rally back in October, Donald Trump explained the genesis of his campaign’s closing catchphrase: Drain the Swamp: “I said that about a week ago, and I didn’t like it that much, didn’t sound that great. And the whole world picked it up. Funny how things like that happen…I didn’t like it. Now I love it, right?”Terrific, terrific. But what does this really mean? Like a lot of the word-mash that we hear from the Performer-elect, we don’t exactly know. At different points, he has associated “drain the swamp” with corruption, campaign finance, “pay-to-play,” and lobbyists. If Trump was referring to those lobbyists and rich folks who’ve supported his campaign, then his incoming executive branch will not be draining but rather sustaining the swamp. His choice for Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, was the campaign finance chair and gave more than $200,000 to the RNC. His selection for National Security Advisor, Retired Gen. Michael Flynn, ran a company that lobbied the U.S. government on behalf of foreign clients. Trump’s pick for Secy. of Education, Betsy DeVos, and her family have donated more than $200 million to Republican political campaigns and conservative causes. The list gets longer. But using Trump’s glib and broad label of “swamp” to describe the individuals (alligators) he’s selecting to serve in his administration is the easy criticism. It may be true, but it doesn’t get us very far if the goal is to actually purify or at the very least improve the effectiveness of our government. If there is such a thing as a swamp in D.C., the creatures populating it are more or less fungible in terms of corruption. The real problem goes beyond the parties or the people we elect. It’s the rules in our system that not only allow, but encourage a flood of money to course through the capital. It’s the billions of campaign dollars that muddy up the waters in Washington. To his credit, candidate Trump announced a “five-point plan for ethics reform” on October 16th. The proposed measures are largely focused on restricting foreign lobbying or lobbying done by former members of the U.S. government. These steps are fine, if actually taken. But his proposal completely ignores the way campaigns are currently funded in the U.S. Congress. Presidents come and go. The dysfunction on Capitol Hill just might last forever. The 2016 cycle set yet another record for total spending on congressional elections: $4,266,514,050. Plenty of those dollars are still in “dark money” contributions where the donors remain hidden. To raise these kinds of amounts, members of Congress can spend up to 50 hours a week dialing for dollars. U.S. Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) paints the picture: “It is a cult-like boiler room on Capitol Hill where sitting members of Congress, frankly, I believe, are compromising the dignity of the office they hold by sitting in these sweatshop phone booths calling people asking them for money.”And all of that begging is not for nothing. The flood of money buys access and influence. Former U.S. Senator and Representative Tim Wirth (D-CO), who left office 20 years ago, has described the current environment as “getting paid for political outcomes” and “legalized corruption.” And Wirth sad that was child’s play compared to today. The good news? At this very moment, there are legislative proposals waiting for passage in Congress that would change the way these races get funded. And with the 115th U.S. Congress being sworn in on January 3rd, these reform measures deserve renewed and serious attention. U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes’s (D-MD) Government By The People Act would begin to level the playing field by leveraging small donations up to $150 with public matching funds at a ratio of 6 to 1 - and 9 to 1 for candidates who choose not to accept contributions over $150. Candidates who don’t have easy pots of big money to target would actually have a chance when challenging well-heeled, safe incumbents. The DISCLOSE Act nearly became law in 2010 before it was killed by the Senate filibuster. The reform bill would force disclosure of the millions of dollars in dark money, and would replace the gridlocked FEC with a five-member agency possessing increased investigative and enforcement powers.And Congressman Jolly, a current member of the GOP House Majority, has taken it a step further by introducing the Stop Act. The bill would prohibit “direct solicitation of campaign contributions or funds for Federal election activity by Federal officeholders.” The current campaign finance system is a bad joke. The painful punchline is that American voters don’t matter the way that they should in our vaunted democracy. For folks who backed Trump based on his promises to “drain the swamp” and get rid of special interest influence in politics, you’ll know he’s actually serious when he stands up to champion even one of these proposed reforms in Congress. The President-elect should put his money where his mouth is - and begin to dilute the power of the money flood. "
62,HEALTHY LIVING,How To Pee From A Sling With Dignity,"Rachel Doboga, ContributorWriter at https://howilivewithals.com/, ALS Warrior",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-pee-from-a-sling-with-dignity_us_586b21b8e4b04d7df167d714,"Immediately upon being diagnosed with ALS, I heard from doctors, support groups, books, and websites that this disease will",2017-01-03,<p>I wasn’t always this comfortable in a sling.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586b22d41500002d00916d13.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Immediately upon being diagnosed with ALS, I heard from doctors, support groups, books, and websites that this disease will steal my dignity. I wanted to be on guard against this, but there was a problem: I didn’t have a clear understanding of what dignity means. It was always just a collage of images: Dame Judi Dench’s face, a smattering of red shame, and a slug trail across the canvas indicating where self-respect left the building. Only when I was in danger of losing my dignity did I feel it running through me. The night I learned about dignity started with horrible muscle spasms in my limbs. Fresh out of medical marijuana, I had to fall back on Vicodin, which is less effective and leaves me unable to move because my balance suffers so greatly. I was only a few hours into my deep narcotic sleep when I woke up with a serious problem: a painfully full bladder.“Evan,” I whimpered to my sleeping husband. “I have to pee really bad!” “I’ll get the walker,” he mumbled, easing out of bed. “I can’t stand up for the transfer to the commode. The Vicodin gave me noodle legs.” I tried to keep my voice steady, but I was afraid that if I didn’t get to the commode fast enough, I would have an accident. It had happened a few times at the beginning of ALS. This was before I started a medicine that silenced the fried nerves tricking my poor bladder into letting go. Evan paused, considering. “We have to use the Hoyer lift,” he concluded. “It’s our only option.” I wiggled to help Evan put the Hoyer lift sling underneath me. Normally, it would wrap around my legs as well and hold me in the fetal position while Evan used the lift to raise me off the bed and put me in the wheelchair. However, now that I needed to land on the commode, my pants had to come off.For the record, hanging pantsless in mid-air in one’s bedroom is not nearly as fun as it sounds, especially when abrasive canvas ropes curl a person so her legs are smashing a full bladder. “Hurry,” I squeaked from inside the sling.“I’m lowering you over the commode now.”Except when I landed on the commode, I was on my back. The commode is narrow and shallow. It does not tilt like my wheelchair to catch me as I descend. Evan immediately raised me up, promising, “I’ll try again. We’ll figure it out.” At this point, the Vicodin had me thinking I was becoming a chimpanzee baby in a swinging leaf-cradle. I was not really in a place to strategize, and I silently thanked god for Evan. However, one more try, and it was clear I would not be landing on the commode. I started crying. Between the way the sling irritated my bare legs and my burgeoning belief that I would never be able to pee again (courtesy of the Vicodin), I was losing it.“I think,” Evan began, then paused just long enough that I knew I wouldn’t like what he said next. He started again: “I’m going to hold the bucket from the commode under you; you’ll have to pee like that.” By then, I was sobbing. “I can’t,” I cried. “It’s too humiliating.”“It’ll be fine,” he soothed. “I swear this will work out just fine.”As he said these last words, I felt the bucket press against the back of my thighs. I cried harder, the pain in my bladder sharpening.“You can do this,” Evan encouraged me gently. “I’m right here.”Choking on the mucus and tears of my embarrassment, I finally let my bladder go, mostly because I could not control it anymore. My hair clung to my sticky face, tangling in my lashes. I looked for patterns in the textured ceiling to get my mind away from this horror. I couldn’t escape my feelings, though. Something vital around my heart fractured.“That’s my dignity,” I thought, imagining I could see it floating away in fragments.And then...“You’re doing so well, honey,” Evan said, full of warmth and pride, all because I was peeing into the bucket he held. The sound of his voice arrested the pieces in their ascent. “Everything’s going well. There are no spills. I’m so proud of you.” The pieces hovered and, in the unhurried way of feathers, drifted back down to me. My dignity had been salvaged.Then it was over. Evan removed the bucket and put it back in the commode. He put his face by mine, his hands brushing my hair and tears from my cheek, then kissed my forehead and said, “It’s all over, and you did so well. Do you feel better?” “Yeah,” I replied softly, my breathing evening out. Evan used the lift to settle me back in bed. He pulled up my pants and tucked me in. After the rough sling, my sheets felt luxurious. As I fell asleep, my thoughts returned to dignity, and I finally saw it clearly. Now I know how to use it.Here’s how to pee from a sling (or do any other wacky thing your heart desires) with dignity :Know the nature of dignity: Understand that dignity is a fine gold filament threaded through the spine and pulled taut so a person can stand straight.Surround yourself with people who value your dignity: Your sense of dignity can be delicate. It has to be nurtured.Have confidence: With the right attitude and a solid friend, you can get away with almost anything. Just hold your head up and think of running water.

It was a vote that was split by party lines. The Republicans in the House voted to gut the Office of Congressional Ethics. It was a rare moment of ethical behavior on the part of the Republicans. They suddenly wanted full disclosure that they were no longer going to behave ethically. The vote to do away with the OCE was an honest confession that corruption would not be a problem. That they were not interested in having a fair and honest government. Particularly with the president-elect having so many unethical issues surrounding him and his conflicted cabinet members.It is a moment to celebrate. For a brief moment the curtain was pulled back and we saw the real monsters in the swamp. The fact that even President-elect Trump could see that such a vote was a terrible public relations mistake and urged his fellow Republicans to reverse course demonstrated that the pretense of ethical behavior has to be maintained.But the deed had been done and the revelation cannot be put back in the dark. The Republican leadership is intent on doing what they want to enrich their supporters and the 1 percent and they are not going to let a little question of morality and ethics get in their way. I commend them for the one act of honesty in telling us plainly that they are not going to be bound by ethical standards.

As I travel around the country with my book, I’m still getting these questions so this information bears repeating. Let’s address four of the most common questions I’m seeing:1. Marriage EqualityWill my marriage remain valid? Should my partner and I hurry to get married?While the consensus is that marriage equality is here to stay, still lots of folks - gay and otherwise - are freaked out about what this new administration could mean to their relationships, and are racing to the altar. Legally married couples will continue to be married. If you are married legally anywhere, you are married here. If you are not married, you need not rush to get married. While in many ways, Inauguration Day was the beginning of major difficulties for us all, it has not meant the end of the freedom to marry. If you do decide to get married, please be informed about the legal consequences of marriage. Familiarize yourself with the points my book raises and look before you leap. Importantly, having in place a will and clear advance directives for your health care is important for everyone and continues to be important for LGBT people, even married couples.2. ImmigrationCan I get deported?Ok so this one has changed since last month, when I was less pessimistic about the willingness and ability of a president to change the law to launch bans, ignore valid green cards and effectuate mass deportations. Here are the basics. Agent Orange’s actions have already been found unconstitutional, but damage continues to be wrought while these issues sort themselves out. Immigration Equality suggests that if you are seeking asylum based on sexual orientation or gender identity, try not to travel outside the U.S. at the moment. DACA appears to be safe - for now - but if there is a “Dreamer” amongst you, seek competent counsel. Also do so if there is a complication like overstaying, a criminal history, or entry into the U.S. without inspection. See whether marriage would help adjust status. Know that having a prenuptial agreement does not compromise the integrity or legality of your marriage.3. Transgender issues Is there a reason to rush and complete my name and gender marker changed?A president cannot impact the process of getting name and gender marker changes with court orders in state courts. While changes in driver’s licenses and birth certificates are governed by state law, passports and social security cards are federal documents. If you were planning on making those changes, now is a good time to do so in the event that current streamlined policies President Obama put in place are eliminated. Surgery is not required. Here is the link to change a passport and here is that information from social security.4. ParentsCan the new administration impact my parental rights?Adoption is governed by state law, not federal law. So the federal government won’t erase protections your family has in place. If you are parents, however, it is now more important than ever need to obtain confirmatory adoptions, even if you are married. The right to marriage equality may be enshrined across the country, but how that marriage impacts parental rights is decidedly not universal. An adoption or parentage order which confirms your parental rights is strongly suggested, even if you are both already on the child’s birth certificate. Before I Do has a substantial section on what parents should do to protect themselves and their children.

Andrew Cuomo (D) vetoed a bill that would have required the state to fund legal services for the poor.Cuomo struck down the bipartisan reform in its final hour on New Year’s Eve, to the disappointment of defense attorneys and municipalities across the state. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi said the program, which would give the state seven years to take over complete funding of indigent legal services, was just too expensive.“Until the last possible moment, we attempted to reach an agreement with the Legislature that would have achieved the stated goal of this legislation, been fiscally responsible, and had additional safeguards to ensure accountability and transparency,” Azzopardi told the New York Daily News in a statement. “Unfortunately, an agreement was unable to be reached and the Legislature was committed to a flawed bill that placed an $800 million burden on taxpayers — $600 million of which was unnecessary — with no way to pay for it and no plan to make one.”States are required to provide competent lawyers to those who can’t afford them. New York currently lays that responsibility on counties, which advocates say has led to a confusing assortment of programs that are underfunded and unreliable.The bill passed unanimously in June, following a 2015 class-action suit brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union that accused the state of an unconstitutional, “poorly resourced and largely dysfunctional public defense system.” Poor New Yorkers often are forced into court dates without a lawyer, accept unfair plea deals and get slapped with harsher sentences for petty offenses, according to NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman. In vetoing the measure, Cuomo blocked new standards that would limit public defense attorneys’ caseloads and require counsel at a defendant’s first hearing, alongside more reform.“We are deeply disappointed that the governor has vetoed the most important criminal justice reform legislation in memory,” Lieberman said in a press statement. “He has rejected a groundbreaking and bipartisan fix to our deeply flawed public defense system and left in place the status quo, in which the state violates the rights of New Yorkers every day and delivers unequal justice.”Assembly bill sponsor Patricia Fahy (D-Albany) told the Daily News that she’ll fight again for what she calls a “constitutional mandate” in the upcoming session."

It was then that he felt something hit him in the back of his head.“It felt like a sledgehammer hit me over the head,” he told CBS 4 News from a hospital.Martinez said he and his wife didn’t immediately realize he’d been hit by a bullet.“I grabbed [my head] and she said, ‘What’s wrong?’ I said, ‘I was hit by something,’” he recalled to The Monitor.He was taken to a hospital, where surgeons found and removed a bullet from his skull after a 45-minute procedure.“Before, the [Rio Grande] Valley wasn’t as populated as it is now, and growing up you used to hear gunshots many times,” he told The Monitor, referring to celebratory gunfire. “But you can’t do that now because somebody’s going to end up getting hurt. Unfortunately, last night it was me who got hurt.”Celebratory gunfire, or any other type of reckless gunfire within a city’s limits, is a misdemeanor offense in Texas.A man in Houston was also struck by a bullet just after midnight Sunday. The bullet, which is believed to have fallen from the sky, narrowly missed his heart, the victim’s friend told ABC 13 News.According to a post on the Dallas Police Department’s Facebook page, a bullet fired into the sky can travel up to 2 miles in the air before falling back to the ground at a speed of 300 to 700 feet per second.“Stray bullets kill dozens of people annually,” it warned.A request for comment from the Hidalgo Sheriff’s Office, which is now investigating Martinez’s shooting, was not immediately returned Monday."

He also shot her mother before turning the gun on himself, authorities say.The boy survived a bullet wound to the head but is in critical condition in a Baltimore trauma hospital, according to police. His relationship to the victim, Charlotte Zaremba, 16, is not yet known, nor is his motive, investigators said. The suspect, whom police have not identified, lives in Ellicott City, the same town as Charlotte.Law enforcement officials said Charlotte’s mother, Suzanne Zaremba, was at home when she heard a scuffle in her daughter’s bedroom at 2 a.m. Sunday. When she went to investigate, the teenage boy opened fire. He shot Zaremba first, then Charlotte and then himself, according to a police statement. The mother’s injuries were not serious, and she was treated at a local hospital and released. Friend Taylor Carey described Charlotte, a high school sophomore, as “one of the nicest girls I’ve ever met.”“If you ever had a problem, she was open ears. She touched so many people’s hearts,” she told Fox News.Another friend, Kieran Davis, told the Baltimore Sun that Charlotte sent her a Snapchat message wishing her a happy new year just hours before the teen was shot. Kieran was stunned to wake up to news of her friend’s death.Charlotte was often “radiating with joy” and was very approachable, she said.“It’s crazy how many people feel close to her even if they didn’t know her that well,” Kieran told the newspaper. “She had this knack for being trustworthy.

The two unfurled the banner in the second quarter and were busted when they touched back down to earth at the end of the game, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.The football action continued without interruption, even as the two protesters — one wearing a Brett Favre Vikings jersey — dangled from the rafters. The banner, which included the U.S. Bank logo and “#NoDAPL,” hung over the crowd for the rest of the game.Fans, however, were cleared from eight rows of seats beneath the protesters as a precaution.As the protesters dangled in the air, organizers of the action sent a release to news outlets quoting one of the climbers as saying: “We are here in solidarity with water protectors from Standing Rock to urge U.S. Bank to divest from the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline’s route violates treaty rights of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and poses a significant threat to drinking water and the health of the Missouri River.”The organizers contend that U.S. Bank has tens of millions of dollars in credit lines active with the pipeline’s parent company.There was no immediate response from U.S. Bank.SMG, the operators of the stadium, issued a statement saying that the protesters had climbed over a guardrail to carry out the stunt. The Minneapolis Police Department identified the climbers as Karl Mayo, 32, and Sen Holiday, 26. They were charged with burglary and trespassing, and a third person was charged with obstructing the legal process, WCCO-TV reported.Pipeline protesters have targeted banks before. Last month, Minneapolis protesters blocked Wells Fargo Bank employees from going to work. On another occasion last month, protesters briefly padlocked doors to a Wells Fargo branch in the city.Construction of the pipeline is currently on hold. In the wake of a large-scale onsite protest by Native Americans and supporters, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in early December denied a permit for the section of the pipeline planned to run beneath the Missouri River in North Dakota. But pipeline protesters are worried about President-elect Donald Trump, who has said he supports the pipeline — and owns stock in companies involved in the project.The $3.7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline is planned to run almost 1,200 miles from North Dakota’s oil-rich Bakken Formation to Illinois, moving as many as 470,000 gallons of crude oil a day.The Vikings won 38-10."

Bush gave his own farewell address five days before leaving office in 2009, celebrating “America’s character” and giving his “best wishes to President-elect Obama, his wife Michelle, and their two beautiful girls.”On Sunday, Obama posted a series of tweets celebrating his administration’s achievements, much of which will be jeopardized under the incoming Trump administration.Democrats are already preparing for a battle over the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have repeatedly pledged to repeal. On Wednesday, Obama plans to meet with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill to discuss strategy.But next week’s speech will likely strike an optimistic and cordial tone. Obama has been fiercely committed to ensuring a peaceful transition of power, even as Trump has violated norms and set alarming precedents during the transition period. When asked about his concerns about Trump, Obama has mostly demurred.“Since 2009, we’ve faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger,” Obama wrote on Monday. “That’s because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding — our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better.”"

Authorities were still counting prisoners to determine how many had escaped, he added, with reports that up to 300 fled.Just as the riot began in one unit of the Anisio Jobim prison complex, dozens of prisoners in the second unit started a mass escape in what authorities said was a coordinated effort to distract guards.Overcrowding is extremely common in Brazil’s prisons, which suffer endemic violence and what rights groups call medieval conditions with food scarce and cells so packed that prisoners have no space to lie down.The Anisio Jobim prison complex currently houses 2,230 inmates despite having a capacity of only 590.Hours after the Anisio Jobim prison revolt ended, prisoners at in an adjoining detention center began a riot and attempted to escape. Authorities said the situation was quickly brought under control.Watchdog groups sharply criticize Brazil for its prisons where deadly riots routinely break out.“These massacres occur almost daily in Brazil,” said Father Valdir Silveira, director of Pastoral Carceraria, a Catholic center that monitors prison conditions in Brazil. “Our prisons were built to annihilate, torture and kill.”The violence was the latest clash between inmates aligned with the Sao Paulo-based First Capital Command (PCC) drug gang, Brazil’s most powerful, and a local Manaus criminal group known as the North Family.The Manaus-based gang is widely believed to be attacking PCC inmates at the behest of the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command (CV) drug gang, Brazil’s second largest.BROKEN TRUCESecurity analysts have said that a truce that held for years between the PCC and CV was broken last year, resulting in months of deadly prison battles between the gangs and sparking fears that chaos will spread to other prisons.In the latest riot, a group of inmates exchanged gunfire with police and held 12 prison guards hostage late on Sunday in the largest prison in Manaus, an industrial city on the banks of the Amazon River, Globo TV reported.Fontes said 74 prisoners were taken hostage during the riot, with some executed and some released.A video posted on the website of the Manaus-based newspaper Em Tempo showed dozens of bloodied and mutilated bodies piled on the prison floor as other inmates milled about.Sunday’s riot was the deadliest in years. A 1992 rebellion at the Carandiru prison in Sao Paulo state saw 111 inmates killed, nearly all of them by police retaking the jail.Maria Canineu, director of Human Rights Watch for Brazil, said the most recent violence was the result of “no government in 20 years giving much attention to the penitentiary system.”Canineu said that for years it has been difficult for states to receive any funding help from the federal government for prisons.President Michel Temer announced last week that the federal government would furnish states with 1.2 billion reais ($366 million), mostly to improve infrastructure and security in existing prisons and to build new ones.($1 = 3.2744 reais)"

It also mentioned other suspicions which had been checked but did not yield evidence to warrant enquiries.“The nature of the investigation precludes us at this stage from giving details of the ongoing investigation but we will consider releasing more information from time to time according to developments,” the statement said.Before the questioning began, Netanyahu told his ruling Likud faction in parliament that those anticipating his downfall should not expect his imminent departure.“Wait with the celebrations, don’t rush,” Netanyahu said. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it once again: there will be nothing because there is nothing.”Photographers were camped outside the heavily guarded residence, hoping to get pictures of investigators arriving. Black screens were erected inside the gates of the property to block the view.Haaretz and other newspapers said the probe related to gifts worth “hundreds of thousands of shekels” ($1=3.85 shekels) given to Netanyahu by Israeli and foreign businessmen.Channel 2, a commercial network, said the investigation was one of two cases now open against the prime minister, although it said details of the second remained unclear.Netanyahu, 67, has been in power on and off since 1996. He is currently in his fourth term as prime minister and will become Israel’s longest-serving leader if he stays in office until the end of next year.He and his wife, Sara, have weathered several scandals over the years, including investigations into the misuse of state funds and an audit of the family’s spending on everything from laundry to ice cream. They have denied any wrongdoing.Netanyahu is not the first prime minister to be questioned in a criminal case.Ehud Olmert, who held office from 2006 to 2009, is currently serving 18 months in prison after being convicted of breach of trust and bribery in 2014.Former prime minister Ariel Sharon was questioned while in office in 2003 and 2004 over allegations of bribery and corruption involving him and his two sons. In 2006, his son Omri was convicted of corruption and served time in prison.Netanyahu’s police appointment drew a barrage of commentary from the center-left opposition in parliament, with politicians calling for him to go. But Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said that for the good of the country, he hoped the prime minister would be cleared.“I wish for him and his family, and the State of Israel, that we uncover that there was no fault in his behavior. If two prime ministers in a row fall from office because of corruption, it will be very hard to rehabilitate the public’s trust in its leadership.”Israeli commentators pointed out that while Netanyahu may be questioned, that has happened many times in the past and prime ministers have gone on governing, sometimes for years."

Twenty-five of the dead were foreigners, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.All of those killed died from gunshot wounds, some of them shot at a very close distance or even point-blank range, according to a forensics report quoted by Milliyet newspaper.Police distributed a hazy black-and-white photo of the alleged gunman taken from security footage. State broadcaster TRT Haber said eight people had been detained in Istanbul.The authorities believe the attacker may be from a Central Asian nation and suspect he had links to Islamic State, the Hurriyet newspaper said.

Witnesses said he shouted “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greatest).Some at the exclusive club jumped into the Bosphorus after the attacker opened fire at random just over an hour into the new year.

Erdogan has said he wants them to continue to Raqqa, the jihadists’ Syrian stronghold.Turkey has also been cracking down on Islamic State networks at home. In counter-terrorism operations between Dec 26-Jan 2, Turkish police detained 147 people over links to the group and formally arrested 25 of them, the interior ministry said.The New Year’s Day attack came five months after a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power.More than 100,000 people, including soldiers and police officers, have been sacked or suspended in a subsequent crackdown ordered by Erdogan, raising concern both about civic rights and the effectiveness of Turkey’s security apparatus."

In the festival’s first three years, Marshall also served as the organization’s director. “He was a pioneer in the Canadian film industry and his vision of creating a public Festival that would bring the world to Toronto through the transformative power of cinema stands today as one of his most significant legacies,” TIFF director and CEO Piers Handling said in a statement. “Without his tenacity and dedication, the Toronto International Film Festival would not be among the most influential public cultural festivals today.”Throughout his career in the Canadian film industry, Marshall produced 13 feature films, and numerous documentaries and live theater productions. His family’s statement notes that Marshall played an important role in helping establish various film organizations in Canada, including the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television and The Toronto Film & Television Office. Aside from his work in film, Marshall was heavily involved in Toronto’s political scene, serving as campaign manager and chief of staff for three Toronto mayors, his family said. Former Toronto Mayor David Crombie sang Marshall’s praises to the London Free Press.“He carried the charm of life with him wherever he went and never allowed mere means to limit grand ends ― particularly if a good time was to be had in the process,” Crombie said. “He lived the life he dreamed of as a boy in the hard part of Glasgow and the one he wanted to enjoy in the celebrated salons of Toronto.”Crombie added, “He paid his way in the rare coin of talent, creativity and wit and those who knew him will always be cheerfully in his debt and will never forget him.” In their statement, Marshall’s family said he was a man “in the business of making dreams become reality,” noting that he still had several projects in development at the time of his death.“Now, as the house lights dim, friends and family will remember and honor Bill as a first-rate raconteur, famous for his honesty, keen mind, and wry humor,” the family said.

The impact and screams awakened Amurri and husband Kyle Martino. Major was rushed to the hospital with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain, she wrote.“To say these were the most traumatic and anxious two days of my life is an understatement. If you read my post about choosing Homebirth, you know that I have an (irrational) phobia of Hospitals. To be in one for two days under such circumstances was nearly unbearable for me, not to mention how scary and emotional those days were for the entirety of our family.”While she noted that “MAJOR IS FINE” and “healing well” with MRIs showing no brain damage, she said she has wrestled with guilt.Amurri Martino, who appeared in several episodes of the sitcom “Undateable,” said she delayed going public with the accident in part because she feared judgment.“I know that this news might reach many, and of those many there will always be the people who say that this accident was my fault. That if it had been me in there holding him instead of a Night Nurse, that this never would have happened. That I deserve this for allowing my child to be in the care of somebody other than me. Well, let me tell you ―the guilt I bore in the days and weeks after this accident was more intense and more damaging than anything I would wish upon my worst enemy. ... And even though I finally made peace with the fact that this freak accident could not have been avoided by me, it has continued to effect [sic] me to my core and in all aspects of my daily life.”She believes she has “some form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, possibly linked to some form of Postpartum Depression,” and is going to work with a therapist, she wrote.She delivered Major, her second child, in an Oct. 19 home birth that she shared on her “Happily Eva After” blog.For her complete blog entry about the accident, visit here.h/t People"

Sitting at a small burger joint about 15 minutes from Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, the announcement seemed to creep out of the television that the restaurant had mounted in one of its upper corners.I was elated.I had fixated on the Marathon Bombing for what seemed like every day since it had happened, scrolling through social media as I tried to figure out how to mourn. The BOSTON STRONG campaign, while well-meaning, felt ill-fitting to me, and I felt distant enough from the actual tragedy itself that purchasing something bearing that slogan seemed almost dishonest. Still, I love my city dearly, and I was tempted to take the attack carried out by the Tsarnaev brothers as personally as I could.So when I heard that the one surviving bomber was slated to die, I wept with joy. It was embarrassing and ugly, but in the moment I felt vindicated. Despite the fact that the family of the youngest victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard, had called for Tsarnaev not to face capital punishment, I felt comfortable saying that justice had been done. The best justice was the justice that empowered me.Now, more than a year following the delivery of that sentence, any vindication or joy I felt is gone. Whatever moral thrill came with the news that Dzokhar Tsarnaev would be put to death for his crimes has long evaporated. All that’s left is righteous anger’s bitter aftertaste and a pang of self-loathing.I’ve been thinking about Tsarnaev more and more recently as the trial of white supremacist and terrorist Dylann Roof draws to a close. On June 17, 2015, Roof attended an evening Bible study at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Founded in 1816, it is home to the oldest historically black congregation south of Baltimore. While at the Bible study, Roof proceeded to open fire on the others in attendance, killing nine and wounding one. He then fled the scene.Roof’s enthusiasm for white supremacist and white nationalist movements quickly came to light, and his crime renewed debate over South Carolina’s decision to fly the Confederate battle flag over its state legislature. While some tried to defend the state’s continued worship of an explicitly racist symbol, others vehemently condemned both the flag and its symbolism. On July 10, the battle flag was officially removed from the South Carolina State House.Five days following the shooting, United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that Roof had been indicted by a grand jury on 33 counts (nine counts of using a firearm to commit homicide, and 24 counts of hate crimes under various statutes), 18 of which carried the federal death penalty.Roof’s trial began on Dec. 7, 2016. Proceedings lasted eight days. On Dec. 15, after no more than two hours of deliberation, a jury found Roof guilty on all 33 counts. Less than two weeks following, Roof stated that he would proceed to sentencing without attorneys and present no further witnesses or evidence. He refuses to undergo psychological evaluation that might call into question his competency, and he writes in his journal that he is opposed to psychology in general, because “it is a Jewish invention, and does nothing but invent diseases and tell people they have problems when they don’t.”Roof has absolutely no interest; it seems, in attempting what The New York Times, on Sunday, called “his best opportunity to avoid execution.” When the penalty phase of Roof’s trial begins on Tuesday, an opening statement will be the extent of what he will present.I am not qualified to speak on Dylann Roof’s mental health. I think it is dangerous to ascribe racist violence to mental illness, because racism is not a form of insanity, no matter how irrationally grotesque. In my own opinion, Dylann Roof was completely aware of what he was doing. He was coldblooded, merciless, and calculating. He has shown absolutely no remorse.And for him to receive the death penalty would be a tremendous failure of justice.I do not want this to be taken as a call for some sort of leniency for Dylann Roof. He is a monster and, for his crimes, he deserves the harshest penalty that our justice system can reasonably hand down. But there is nothing reasonable or just about the death penalty. It’s an archaic penal tool that the United States justice system should no longer have at its disposal.Now, some might truly feel that Dylann Roof deserves to die for what he did. I don’t feel morally or spiritually qualified to weigh in on such a matter. However, I believe there is a fundamental difference between Dylann Roof deserving death and the United States government having the right to sentence him to it.Discussing the death penalty is difficult, because the debate will always come down to that last point: whether or not one feels in their gut that capital punishment is moral and just. Ultimately, the federal death penalty has survived nearly every solid logistical argument that can be leveled against it: it is more costly than life imprisonment; the means by which it is carried out are far too imperfect to ensure that death will come quickly and avoid being “cruel and unusual”; multiple death row inmates have been exonerated and, with our justice system as tainted by racial and socio-economic bias as it is, it is absurd to assume we can say with any certainty that all of those we doom to execution will be irrefutably guilty; and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that capital punishment functions as a meaningful deterrent to violent crime.What remains, then, is the seeking of that feeling of vindication that I experienced when I first heard that Dzokhar Tsarnaev would be killed for his role in the Boston Marathon bombings. That’s the thing that keeps capital punishment alive: the small kernel of Old Testament self-righteousness that exists in all of us, the certainty that we are capable of telling who and what is deserving of death.I cannot act as though I am above that impulse. I don’t believe anyone truly can. Whether or not the elements that compel us to feel satisfaction in the wake of violent merciless justice manifest in full in everyone, each and every person has at some point felt the beginning of that venomous surge. In this case, the task becomes minimizing how much sway that holds over us, mitigating how much of that we are willing to use to power institutional forces.Possibly more so than any other aspect of politics or of governance, the pursuit and practice of justice occupies a nexus between rationality and emotion; it requires both to function properly. For the same tenuous “irrational” humanity that spawns the glee we might feel at seeing harm come to those who have wronged also provides the material for compassion and for mercy. And just as our reliance on the rational and logistical machinery of law and order often blinds us to the human import of evidence and the way in which that evidence must be ethically applied in the pursuit of truth, it also allows us to surrender our personal impulses and to recognize that each of us—on our own, without the guidance of our peers and the state structures that they compose—is ultimately a deeply imperfect vessel for justice.At the end of November, The New York Times spoke with members of the congregation to which Dylann Roof laid siege. They are almost uniformly opposed to the execution of Dylann Roof, though their reasoning varies. Some believe that death is an easy way out for a man who committed such a heinous, hateful act. Others believe that the appeals process that will surely follow a death sentence will only serve to prolong the trauma suffered by the community. Still others express more traditional opposition to capital punishment in general, questioning its efficacy and ethicality. None seemed to find comfort in the idea of the execution.In making a case to spare Dylann Roof, it is far too easy to fall back on arguments that erase the unknowable agony of his victims and their families, reducing the pain of these men and women to a vague cliché of trauma that can be soothed with empty platitudes about proving that we’re better than Dylann Roof or how killing Dylann Roof won’t resurrect any of those who died.Those who mourn and ache for Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church are well aware of these things.This country’s soul is not in such a lofty place that we can distinguish ourselves from the violence committed by Roof—part of a historical continuum of violence that America has permitted throughout her lifespan—by virtue of sparing him from lethal injection. But in recognizing this, we must also recognize the urge among white Americans to use the execution of Dylann Roof as a sort of fix-all fig leaf, a way to demonstrate that the American state is, indeed, not a racist apparatus. Of course, if America was racist, why would it punish a racist?This sort of logic, this minuscule reparation by means of self-congratulatory state violence, is a far more insidious impulse than the emotional urge to take an eye for an eye. This is a far more dishonest and deceitful impulse, that fails both to reckon with the consequences of a state empowered to execute and the history that has carried us to the moment where we must consider this particular execution. To allow a white political establishment to treat the execution of Dylann Roof as a demonstration of a virtue we have neither possessed nor earned throughout our history is, certainly, the worst and ugliest of both worlds.In the days after I heard that Dzokhar Tsarnaev was sentenced to die, I felt a strange sort of gratitude, as though I and my city had been given, not just a conclusion, but a genuine gift. In my pain and my self-righteousness, I felt as though I had been empowered by my government, by my justice system. I felt richer.Now, I know that a death sentence is a gift to no one but the men and women empowered to hand it down. It’s not a balm for the anguish of those in mourning, but a malevolent little machine designed to convert that anguish into a power and an energy in which no victim will ever share. The only thing empowered was the system that got to do the killing. I was just as pained and impoverished as before.No matter who you are, there is no richness in blood spilled in your name."

I also sense a beating",2017-01-02,"<p>Gottesfeld (2015) married Dana in Pompano Beach, Florida </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586abe091500002901916c5a.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Imprisoned human rights activist, journalist, and author Martin Gottesfeld wrote this article on the 55th day of his prison hunger strike and submitted it from solitary confinement at Metropolitan Correctional Center New York. He is currently being held without bail on hacking charges brought by controversial Boston U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz and her cybercrime chief, Adam J. Bookbinder, whose office prosecuted Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, culminating in his suicide. Gottesfeld is accused of knocking Boston Children’s Hospital off the Internet in the defense of abused patient Justina Pelletier.On the 43rd day of my hunger strike I was told the U.S. Marshalls had ordered my transfer to a facility in New York that was better equipped to handle my medical condition. At that point I had gone about four days without any fluids whatsoever and to make my wishes and refusal to provide medical consent crystal clear, I had written “No IV DNR” on the inside of both my elbows. Hey, if the DOJ wanted to allow notorious federal prosecutor Carmen Ortiz and her lackeys, to keep holding me because I tried to protect innocent, learning disabled teenager Justina Pelletier from abuse, torture, and an agonizing death, then I wanted to make sure they were fully committed to backing Ortiz up as she makes a pet toy and total mockery of our justice system yet again. After all, when Justina was suffering, Ortiz’s office couldn’t be bothered to even make a phone call to inquire as to whether her civil and human rights were being upheld (and they weren’t). But I digress, I was not allowed to call my wife before the prison transfer, but I was promised I’d be able to call her upon my arrival.Dubious, but still hopeful the move was a sign of the increasing pressure of my very public hunger strike. I’m cuffed, shackled, and loaded into a van with an unusually heavy complement of three officers for one inmate. On the way, they refused to stop and get food for themselves even when I told them I wouldn’t mind and that I could no longer simply just return to eating normally when I wished. You see, word of the cause I’m fighting for had gotten around to some of the staff and I had actually discussed it with the sergeant in charge of my transport in detail before.“We’re not doing that to you,” he told me.Shortly into the trip, mystery set in. Everyone in the van had assumed that “facility in New York” meant MDC Brooklyn, which would have been the usual next stop in the federal prison system. However when the officers put the address into the GPS, it was on Manhattan Island. The sergeant made a phone call to confirm the location and told me that in all his years he’d never heard of The Federal Bureau of Prison’s “MCC New York,” our apparent destination.Hours later, we arrived.“Can you walk?” The sergeant asked me.My mouth was dry, my kidneys hurt constantly, and I was prone to muscle cramps from dehydration and low electrolyte levels. Standing made me dizzy and I fatigued easily. However, I had rested in the van, and felt up to the Wolfenstein-esque maze of halls and locked doors that are typical for the prison intake/discharge process.“I think so,” I replied.Once inside, the transporting officers explain the situation with the hunger strike and hand the receiving desk my considerable pile of casework. It’s the last time I’d see entire reams of legal papers and reference books before they go missing, directly afterwards.I’m brought to a supply room and “stripped out.” While I’m undressing, squatting, spreading my gluts, and coughing, the guard watching me notices the writing on my arms and asks about my strike. I give him the basic gist, loaded with the words “allegedly,” “supposedly,” etc., that our lawyers all tell us to use in here. I refer him to my Huffington Post articles as my throat is dry and I’ve tired of explaining this whole travesty over and over again: from the troubled teen industry, to Justina Pelletier, Carmen Ortiz, the CFAA, and Aaron Swartz. He’s upset though, it seems he wants a confession.Is he an FBI agent? Is he looking to earn his way there? I note the name embroidered on his shirt. It could easily be made up for all I know. I dub him “The Interregator.”After that awkward moment I’m put in a waiting room with an emaciated looking man from Africa. He was clutching his hand and wincing. We speak briefly and it turns out we’re both on hunger strikes, but he’s also on trial. His hand, had been, slammed in a door by a staff member, a supposed “accident.” However when I later heard them speak of how “he’ll learn,” and laugh, I had my doubts.Suddenly, the holding cell opened to reveal a large guard gratuitously eating pizza. It seemed he was intentionally being noisy and he definitely overplayed the role of savoring his meal. The pizza smelled good, but his attempt belied a fundamental misunderstanding of how long-term hunger strikes work.With a devious grin, he asked me, “Do you want to smell this pizza?”“I already can. No, thank you,” I reply.About two weeks into my hunger strike, and for the first time I can remember, my sinuses completely cleared and my sense of smell heightened beyond my wildest imagination, an apparent survival mechanism to help find sustenance when the body is facing starvation.The guard closes the door. My African companion and I exchang glances, shake our heads, and laugh. I lay down on the hardwood bench. Exertion is the enemy, and I’ll take all of the rest I can get before trudging wherever else they are going to shuffle me.Time passes quickly and quietly. About an hour and a half later, they summon me for the intake screening. I hadn’t been mistreated there yet, so I cooperate.They take my blood pressure sitting, standing, and laying down, as well as my blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and pulse. They do their customary TB test and then take my weight for the first time in three days without fluids. My last measure had been 171 pounds, down from where I had started my strike at 204. I weigh in at 158 pounds almost the entire recent 13 pound drop was due to dehydration.When I go back out to the receiving desk, the staff asks me to confirm how long I had been on the strike.“October 3rd” I tell them. They are surprised.“You haven’t eaten anything?” they ask.“I was taking some fluids until a few days ago: water, Gatorade, occasionally chicken broth, and “Jell-O.” (You may be surprised, as I was, to hear that medically speaking “Jell-O” is a clear fluid.) “No solid food.”“The Interrogator” calls me a “fraud” and says, “That’s not a hunger strike,” and tells them to be sure to turn off the water in my cell. I briefly think about responding that I’d like to see him do what I had and then I’d be happy to discuss what exactly does and does not constitute a hunger strike, but think better of it. I ask to call my wife, and am told I’ll have to speak to my unit staff about it, but that I should be able to make “some” calls with the lieutenant.From there, I am in handcuffs once more, and brought to the “Special Housing Unit,” or “SHU” (pronounced like “shoe,”) a modern euphemism for solitary confinement. I’m “stripped out” again. and changed from brown clothes to orange, before being re-cuffed. When in the SHU, you’re always cuffed outside your cell. You have to stand with your back to the door and place your hands through a slot before and after leaving so they can take the cuffs on and off. It’s dehumanizing. No matter what any prison official tries to tell you about other reasons, that’s exactly the point.On the walk to my new abode they ask me if I want writing paper and envelopes. I don’t know if mine have survived the trip and their processing so I say yes. When we arrive at my cell, my escort throws them all over the place before sarcastically saying, “Sorry.”I fall asleep quickly. It had been a long, busy day, and I was physically weak and exhausted.Early the next morning I’m brought to medical for the end of the intake process. I’m paraded through a conference room full of men in white coats looking at me like I’m a zoo exhibit. I’m still in orange clothes and cuffed behind my back.“I’ll see him in here,” one of them said as he stands up and leads my escorts to an exam room, with me in tow. His coat said “Dr. Anthony Bussunich.” He reminds me of the pointy-haired boss in Dilbert, and I’m soon to discover it’s a more fitting simile than I initially thought.He turns on a digital scale and tells me to hop-on.“I decline.”“Why?”I tell him that I will not consent to any medical procedures, as long as, I am handcuffed, being kept in the SHU, and being prevented from speaking to my wife. The conversation goes back and forth, going nowhere, with him citing Bureau of Prisons policy, that hunger strikers are kept in the SHU, and me vigorously asserting my right to decline all medical intervention.He tries to scare me. First, he goes over the dangers, of the hunger strike, and especially the stoppage of fluids. I’m familiar with all of that and un-phased.Then he tells me that once I pass out, they’ll be allowed to hydrate me to keep me alive. I inform him I have a DNR, health care proxy, and living will; that my wife has very specific instructions and that she knows whom she married. He asks to see those documents, which he has to know I can’t provide while I’m held incommunicado, before telling me they don’t matter, that the Bureau of Prisons has legal authority to keep me alive. Technically, he is right, but ethically it’s a much foggier area and I’m sure he knows this. It’s a tense conversation between us, we’re like oil and water.He asks if I would consent to blood work and I reiterate that I refuse all medical consent under the current conditions. He says he can get blood without consent. I tell him I look forward to writing about those events.He follows my escorts and I to psychiatry, probably hoping that they’ll deem me incompetent. Next, I meet a forensic mental health expert whom I refuse to speak too. She notices the writing on my arms and asks if I’m suicidal. I reiterate my refusal to speak. She threatens to place me on “suicide watch” in a paper gown before telling me that she “doesn’t want” to do that to me though. I tell her to do what she has to while thinking about how similar she seems to Simona Bujoreanu, the psychologist whose questionable decisions were behind the Wray and Pelletier cases at Boston Children’s Hospital.She leaves the room to check what to do with her superiors. Dr. Bussanich took the opportunity to tell me, “This is MCC New York. Inmates who come here are quickly forgotten.”The prison junior psychiatrist comes back and tells me I’ll be placed on suicide watch. I tell her I look forward to the headlines. There’s some quick banter back and forth. She goes and checks again. “No suicide watch” comes the ruling from up the totem pole. I thought so.Next, I quickly decline a dental exam. The dentist does not put up a fight like the Dilbert boss and mental health doctor.The prison guards with me were not amused. When we get back to the SHU, they put me in a different cell with frigid air blowing in constantly, and standing water pooled on the floor. For someone with a compromised immune system by more than a month of starvation, it is a massive infection waiting to happen. They tell me they will go get my legal work from my other cell “right now,” but then don’t give it to me. It sits outside my door and out of reach for more than two days.I bundle up as best I can and take to working on one of the mammoth engineering problems I specifically chose for the strike. These problems require no pen, no paper, no calculator, have never been solved, and are of such a size and scope that any competent professional engineer could occupy themselves for years pondering them.I’m tired, in pain, and fatigued just from walking around. I sleep most of the rest of the day, but am disturbed to decline lunch and dinner, the 128th and 129th consecutive meals that I’ve turned away. Each time I declined I asked to speak to my wife only to be denied.The next morning I awaken early to the sound of the meal cart being pushed along my tier. I overhear one of the guards find roaches in a food tray. He’s surprised and yells to his coworker, “I hate this f***ing jail!”I consider yelling back, “Us too!” but think better of it. On top of the obvious and sufficient reasons, my throat was so dry that speaking had become difficult, raspy, and painful. Mentally, I was grateful for their cockroach discovery, as even though I wasn’t exactly tempted to try the food in the first place, I now had a strong disincentive to do so. When they get to my cell and I decline my breakfast, they seemed less than surprised.Later in the day, the guy in the cell next to me starts asking the guards for commissary sheets so he can order things. Different prisons have different policies about what SHU inmates can order, if anything. At MCC New York, a limited selection is allowed for inmates like us who haven’t been officially sanctioned (yet). The guy across the hall and I both join in, albeit my vocal capacity is diminished, and after many hours of asking every time a staff member happened by, we finally badger one enough to go get us the order forms.As we receive them, both the guy across the hall and I ask for pens, to fill them out, and we’re told we’ll have to borrow one from the inmate next to me. Now, it turns out, the guy next to me had been in prison for a long time. He had been on death row, but as he later told us, “worked it down to life plus 25,” and was still appealing.He is a prison ninja. Not only is this guy super smooth with guards, medical staff, etc., and therefore in my opinion the most gifted psychologist in the joint, but he, on the first try, whizzes his pen under the door of his cell, on an angle, and directly under the door of the guy across the hall. It’s as impressive as any trick billiards shot I’ve ever seen. A few minutes later, after filling out his order, the pen’s recipient tries the still difficult, but straighter shot directly across to me. He misses, and the pen stayed in the hallway out of reach.“Make a line,” the guy next to me says.I imagine some kind of makeshift prison lasso, and start to try to (re)-invent one with the very limited supplies I have. Apparently, the guy across the hall has a clearer picture of what exactly this means, as I can see him nod and walk deeper into his cell to get to work.However, less than a minute later, I hear fluid start gushing. I look across the hall, and see arms flailing as green water continually splashes against the cell’s hall window. It starts coming out from under his door and flooding into the hallway. The guy next to me and I start pounding our doors. He’s screaming “C.O.,” but I can’t yell that loud.It takes a couple of minutes for guards to unlock the gate to the tier and see what is going on. One goes to shut the water off. At this point, my legal work is still sitting in a bag on the hallway floor outside my cell. The other guard grabs it and puts it atop a cart before telling me to cram a blanket in the crack under my door to stop the water from coming in. I do as he says and start picking up anything else on the floor in my cell, like my shoes.After a few minutes, the stale green water, that had been pent up for who knows how long, had all come out, and cleaner, clearer water is replacing it, pouring out from the cell across the hall. The blanket under my door is working, but there’s between a half-inch to an inch of water outside. My bag of legal work looks dry from my view, but I can’t really tell. With water still flowing, they make the guy across the hall “cuff up” in the usual way before putting him in the cell on the other side of me. He’s soaked from head to toe and looks demoralized.When they open his door, his cell is totally, messed up. Bedding, papers, family photos, commissary, everything is drenched and strewn about. I feel awful he was trying to help me out when it happened. After another couple of minutes, they shut the water off.There was no drain in the hall though, so the water stays until an inmate worker comes with a shop vac and starts dumping it out one load at a time. The tank fills quickly, so progress lowering the water line is slow. About an hour later, with the floor mostly dry, I ask the worker if he sees a pen on the ground. He finds it and slips it under my door.I fill out my commissary order. At this point, I don’t know if my wife had gone through the process to deposit money for me, but I have little to lose. I order probably the most important item you can have in jail, and especially solitary, a radio, as well as a deck of cards, bar of soap, shaving gel, batteries (I wasn’t taking any chances with “batteries not included”) and stamped envelopes.When I finish, I ask the worker to return the pen to the guy next to me, completing its odyssey. Both the guy next door and I thank the worker, who still had at least an hour of mopping ahead of him.In the evening, a nurse came to my cell with two prescriptions. I accepted the Prilosec. I’ve always had too much stomach acid, and when there is nothing for it to do, it wears ulcers into my stomach and small intestine. However, I decline the multivitamin they try to give me.The nurse wants to talk too, and take my blood pressure. I decline. She says, “You can’t.” I walk away from the door and go back to bed.

Eventually, I stop hearing the nurse complaining. The extraction team never comes.Finally, I get up, and go to my door. I ask my fellow inmates, “Didn’t she call for an extraction?”They nod and shrug.The next morning, after I decline breakfast, with cockroaches still on my mind, two guards come and tell me medical wants to see me.“Please tell them I decline,” I answer.They nod and leave, only to return about ten minutes later telling me that we have to go down, but I can refuse everything once we get there. Visibly annoyed, and with some effort, I get up, get “cuffed up,” and we make the schlep. I’m expecting to see the same Dilbert boss doctor, but instead I’m greeted by a different man.

He asks to take my blood pressure. Again, “no.” “Blood work?”“N-O.”He asks me why I’m on a hunger strike and I, politely, tell him to look me up at The Huffington Post and Newsweek (again, dry throat etc). He asks me, “Don’t you want to know your own vitals?” I tell him sure I do, but that I won’t consent to anything medically so long as I was kept in the SHU, unable to contact my wife, and cuffed everywhere I go. Like his predecessor, he tells me that it’s the Bureau of Prisons policy to house hunger strikers in the SHU, but that if I ate something, I could leave solitary. I tell him “that’s how you break hunger strikes.”He tries to tell me it’s so they could monitor me in case my condition worsened. I don’t even know where to start with this fallacy, so I just dive right in.I tell him that I’m not being monitored and if I were to lose consciousness it could be hours until I’m discovered. I ask if they want to monitor me, why they don’t put me in a hospital bed with an actual heart monitor hooked up to an actual alarm? I asked what part of monitoring me requires me to be blocked from calling my wife?I tell him that if they, were really, concerned about my condition, they wouldn’t place me in a frigid room with standing water on the floor while my immune system is compromised by over 40 days of starvation. If something does happen to me, it would probably be an infection from the cold and standing water in my cell. I tell him they can claim whatever they want about policy, but the true purpose, to break the hunger strike, was readily apparent and that my policy is to decline all medical procedures under these conditions. In my head, I think about what happened to Justina. How, her human rights were violated and she was made to suffer under the thin veil of such dubious medical claims.

With an earnest grimace, he tells me, “That’s unpleasant for you and unpleasant for us.”I chuckle a bit, and reply, “Tell that to Carmen Ortiz.”“Who’s that?” He asks.“Someone else you should look up at The Huffington Post before we get too much further down this road, Doc” I answer.“I will,” he says.I believe him.He offers me some Ensure, which I politely decline as well, and my escorts take me back to the SHU.“The Interrogator” is there when we get back.

He is currently being held without bail on hacking charges brought by controversial Boston U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz and her cybercrime chief, Adam J. Bookbinder, whose office prosecuted Internet innovator and activist Aaron Swartz, culminating in his suicide. Gottesfeld is accused of knocking Boston Children’s Hospital off the Internet in the defense of abused patient Justina Pelletier.On the 43rd day of my hunger strike I was told the U.S. Marshalls had ordered my transfer to a facility in New York that was better equipped to handle my medical condition. At that point I had gone about four days without any fluids whatsoever and to make my wishes and refusal to provide medical consent crystal clear, I had written “No IV DNR” on the inside of both my elbows. Hey, if the DOJ wanted to allow notorious federal prosecutor Carmen Ortiz and her lackeys, to keep holding me because I tried to protect innocent, learning disabled teenager Justina Pelletier from abuse, torture, and an agonizing death, then I wanted to make sure they were fully committed to backing Ortiz up as she makes a pet toy and total mockery of our justice system yet again. After all, when Justina was suffering, Ortiz’s office couldn’t be bothered to even make a phone call to inquire as to whether her civil and human rights were being upheld (and they weren’t). But I digress, I was not allowed to call my wife before the prison transfer, but I was promised I’d be able to call her upon my arrival.Dubious, but still hopeful the move was a sign of the increasing pressure of my very public hunger strike. I’m cuffed, shackled, and loaded into a van with an unusually heavy complement of three officers for one inmate. On the way, they refused to stop and get food for themselves even when I told them I wouldn’t mind and that I could no longer simply just return to eating normally when I wished. You see, word of the cause I’m fighting for had gotten around to some of the staff and I had actually discussed it with the sergeant in charge of my transport in detail before.“We’re not doing that to you,” he told me.Shortly into the trip, mystery set in. Everyone in the van had assumed that “facility in New York” meant MDC Brooklyn, which would have been the usual next stop in the federal prison system. However when the officers put the address into the GPS, it was on Manhattan Island. The sergeant made a phone call to confirm the location and told me that in all his years he’d never heard of The Federal Bureau of Prison’s “MCC New York,” our apparent destination.Hours later, we arrived.“Can you walk?” The sergeant asked me.My mouth was dry, my kidneys hurt constantly, and I was prone to muscle cramps from dehydration and low electrolyte levels. Standing made me dizzy and I fatigued easily. However, I had rested in the van, and felt up to the Wolfenstein-esque maze of halls and locked doors that are typical for the prison intake/discharge process.“I think so,” I replied.Once inside, the transporting officers explain the situation with the hunger strike and hand the receiving desk my considerable pile of casework. It’s the last time I’d see entire reams of legal papers and reference books before they go missing, directly afterwards.I’m brought to a supply room and “stripped out.” While I’m undressing, squatting, spreading my gluts, and coughing, the guard watching me notices the writing on my arms and asks about my strike. I give him the basic gist, loaded with the words “allegedly,” “supposedly,” etc., that our lawyers all tell us to use in here. I refer him to my Huffington Post articles as my throat is dry and I’ve tired of explaining this whole travesty over and over again: from the troubled teen industry, to Justina Pelletier, Carmen Ortiz, the CFAA, and Aaron Swartz. He’s upset though, it seems he wants a confession.Is he an FBI agent? Is he looking to earn his way there? I note the name embroidered on his shirt. It could easily be made up for all I know. I dub him “The Interregator.”After that awkward moment I’m put in a waiting room with an emaciated looking man from Africa. He was clutching his hand and wincing. We speak briefly and it turns out we’re both on hunger strikes, but he’s also on trial. His hand, had been, slammed in a door by a staff member, a supposed “accident.” However when I later heard them speak of how “he’ll learn,” and laugh, I had my doubts.Suddenly, the holding cell opened to reveal a large guard gratuitously eating pizza. It seemed he was intentionally being noisy and he definitely overplayed the role of savoring his meal. The pizza smelled good, but his attempt belied a fundamental misunderstanding of how long-term hunger strikes work.With a devious grin, he asked me, “Do you want to smell this pizza?”“I already can. No, thank you,” I reply.About two weeks into my hunger strike, and for the first time I can remember, my sinuses completely cleared and my sense of smell heightened beyond my wildest imagination, an apparent survival mechanism to help find sustenance when the body is facing starvation.The guard closes the door. My African companion and I exchang glances, shake our heads, and laugh. I lay down on the hardwood bench. Exertion is the enemy, and I’ll take all of the rest I can get before trudging wherever else they are going to shuffle me.Time passes quickly and quietly. About an hour and a half later, they summon me for the intake screening. I hadn’t been mistreated there yet, so I cooperate.They take my blood pressure sitting, standing, and laying down, as well as my blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and pulse. They do their customary TB test and then take my weight for the first time in three days without fluids. My last measure had been 171 pounds, down from where I had started my strike at 204. I weigh in at 158 pounds almost the entire recent 13 pound drop was due to dehydration.When I go back out to the receiving desk, the staff asks me to confirm how long I had been on the strike.“October 3rd” I tell them. They are surprised.“You haven’t eaten anything?” they ask.“I was taking some fluids until a few days ago: water, Gatorade, occasionally chicken broth, and “Jell-O.” (You may be surprised, as I was, to hear that medically speaking “Jell-O” is a clear fluid.) “No solid food.”“The Interrogator” calls me a “fraud” and says, “That’s not a hunger strike,” and tells them to be sure to turn off the water in my cell. I briefly think about responding that I’d like to see him do what I had and then I’d be happy to discuss what exactly does and does not constitute a hunger strike, but think better of it. I ask to call my wife, and am told I’ll have to speak to my unit staff about it, but that I should be able to make “some” calls with the lieutenant.From there, I am in handcuffs once more, and brought to the “Special Housing Unit,” or “SHU” (pronounced like “shoe,”) a modern euphemism for solitary confinement. I’m “stripped out” again. and changed from brown clothes to orange, before being re-cuffed. When in the SHU, you’re always cuffed outside your cell. You have to stand with your back to the door and place your hands through a slot before and after leaving so they can take the cuffs on and off. It’s dehumanizing. No matter what any prison official tries to tell you about other reasons, that’s exactly the point.On the walk to my new abode they ask me if I want writing paper and envelopes. I don’t know if mine have survived the trip and their processing so I say yes. When we arrive at my cell, my escort throws them all over the place before sarcastically saying, “Sorry.”I fall asleep quickly. It had been a long, busy day, and I was physically weak and exhausted.Early the next morning I’m brought to medical for the end of the intake process. I’m paraded through a conference room full of men in white coats looking at me like I’m a zoo exhibit. I’m still in orange clothes and cuffed behind my back.“I’ll see him in here,” one of them said as he stands up and leads my escorts to an exam room, with me in tow. His coat said “Dr. Anthony Bussunich.” He reminds me of the pointy-haired boss in Dilbert, and I’m soon to discover it’s a more fitting simile than I initially thought.He turns on a digital scale and tells me to hop-on.“I decline.”“Why?”I tell him that I will not consent to any medical procedures, as long as, I am handcuffed, being kept in the SHU, and being prevented from speaking to my wife. The conversation goes back and forth, going nowhere, with him citing Bureau of Prisons policy, that hunger strikers are kept in the SHU, and me vigorously asserting my right to decline all medical intervention.He tries to scare me. First, he goes over the dangers, of the hunger strike, and especially the stoppage of fluids. I’m familiar with all of that and un-phased.Then he tells me that once I pass out, they’ll be allowed to hydrate me to keep me alive. I inform him I have a DNR, health care proxy, and living will; that my wife has very specific instructions and that she knows whom she married. He asks to see those documents, which he has to know I can’t provide while I’m held incommunicado, before telling me they don’t matter, that the Bureau of Prisons has legal authority to keep me alive. Technically, he is right, but ethically it’s a much foggier area and I’m sure he knows this. It’s a tense conversation between us, we’re like oil and water.He asks if I would consent to blood work and I reiterate that I refuse all medical consent under the current conditions. He says he can get blood without consent. I tell him I look forward to writing about those events.He follows my escorts and I to psychiatry, probably hoping that they’ll deem me incompetent. Next, I meet a forensic mental health expert whom I refuse to speak too. She notices the writing on my arms and asks if I’m suicidal. I reiterate my refusal to speak. She threatens to place me on “suicide watch” in a paper gown before telling me that she “doesn’t want” to do that to me though. I tell her to do what she has to while thinking about how similar she seems to Simona Bujoreanu, the psychologist whose questionable decisions were behind the Wray and Pelletier cases at Boston Children’s Hospital.She leaves the room to check what to do with her superiors. Dr. Bussanich took the opportunity to tell me, “This is MCC New York. Inmates who come here are quickly forgotten.”The prison junior psychiatrist comes back and tells me I’ll be placed on suicide watch. I tell her I look forward to the headlines. There’s some quick banter back and forth. She goes and checks again. “No suicide watch” comes the ruling from up the totem pole. I thought so.Next, I quickly decline a dental exam. The dentist does not put up a fight like the Dilbert boss and mental health doctor.The prison guards with me were not amused. When we get back to the SHU, they put me in a different cell with frigid air blowing in constantly, and standing water pooled on the floor. For someone with a compromised immune system by more than a month of starvation, it is a massive infection waiting to happen. They tell me they will go get my legal work from my other cell “right now,” but then don’t give it to me. It sits outside my door and out of reach for more than two days.I bundle up as best I can and take to working on one of the mammoth engineering problems I specifically chose for the strike. These problems require no pen, no paper, no calculator, have never been solved, and are of such a size and scope that any competent professional engineer could occupy themselves for years pondering them.I’m tired, in pain, and fatigued just from walking around. I sleep most of the rest of the day, but am disturbed to decline lunch and dinner, the 128th and 129th consecutive meals that I’ve turned away. Each time I declined I asked to speak to my wife only to be denied.The next morning I awaken early to the sound of the meal cart being pushed along my tier. I overhear one of the guards find roaches in a food tray. He’s surprised and yells to his coworker, “I hate this f***ing jail!”I consider yelling back, “Us too!” but think better of it. On top of the obvious and sufficient reasons, my throat was so dry that speaking had become difficult, raspy, and painful. Mentally, I was grateful for their cockroach discovery, as even though I wasn’t exactly tempted to try the food in the first place, I now had a strong disincentive to do so. When they get to my cell and I decline my breakfast, they seemed less than surprised.Later in the day, the guy in the cell next to me starts asking the guards for commissary sheets so he can order things. Different prisons have different policies about what SHU inmates can order, if anything. At MCC New York, a limited selection is allowed for inmates like us who haven’t been officially sanctioned (yet). The guy across the hall and I both join in, albeit my vocal capacity is diminished, and after many hours of asking every time a staff member happened by, we finally badger one enough to go get us the order forms.As we receive them, both the guy across the hall and I ask for pens, to fill them out, and we’re told we’ll have to borrow one from the inmate next to me. Now, it turns out, the guy next to me had been in prison for a long time. He had been on death row, but as he later told us, “worked it down to life plus 25,” and was still appealing.He is a prison ninja. Not only is this guy super smooth with guards, medical staff, etc., and therefore in my opinion the most gifted psychologist in the joint, but he, on the first try, whizzes his pen under the door of his cell, on an angle, and directly under the door of the guy across the hall. It’s as impressive as any trick billiards shot I’ve ever seen. A few minutes later, after filling out his order, the pen’s recipient tries the still difficult, but straighter shot directly across to me. He misses, and the pen stayed in the hallway out of reach.“Make a line,” the guy next to me says.I imagine some kind of makeshift prison lasso, and start to try to (re)-invent one with the very limited supplies I have. Apparently, the guy across the hall has a clearer picture of what exactly this means, as I can see him nod and walk deeper into his cell to get to work.However, less than a minute later, I hear fluid start gushing. I look across the hall, and see arms flailing as green water continually splashes against the cell’s hall window. It starts coming out from under his door and flooding into the hallway. The guy next to me and I start pounding our doors. He’s screaming “C.O.,” but I can’t yell that loud.It takes a couple of minutes for guards to unlock the gate to the tier and see what is going on. One goes to shut the water off. At this point, my legal work is still sitting in a bag on the hallway floor outside my cell. The other guard grabs it and puts it atop a cart before telling me to cram a blanket in the crack under my door to stop the water from coming in. I do as he says and start picking up anything else on the floor in my cell, like my shoes.After a few minutes, the stale green water, that had been pent up for who knows how long, had all come out, and cleaner, clearer water is replacing it, pouring out from the cell across the hall. The blanket under my door is working, but there’s between a half-inch to an inch of water outside. My bag of legal work looks dry from my view, but I can’t really tell. With water still flowing, they make the guy across the hall “cuff up” in the usual way before putting him in the cell on the other side of me. He’s soaked from head to toe and looks demoralized.When they open his door, his cell is totally, messed up. Bedding, papers, family photos, commissary, everything is drenched and strewn about. I feel awful he was trying to help me out when it happened. After another couple of minutes, they shut the water off.There was no drain in the hall though, so the water stays until an inmate worker comes with a shop vac and starts dumping it out one load at a time. The tank fills quickly, so progress lowering the water line is slow. About an hour later, with the floor mostly dry, I ask the worker if he sees a pen on the ground. He finds it and slips it under my door.I fill out my commissary order. At this point, I don’t know if my wife had gone through the process to deposit money for me, but I have little to lose. I order probably the most important item you can have in jail, and especially solitary, a radio, as well as a deck of cards, bar of soap, shaving gel, batteries (I wasn’t taking any chances with “batteries not included”) and stamped envelopes.When I finish, I ask the worker to return the pen to the guy next to me, completing its odyssey. Both the guy next door and I thank the worker, who still had at least an hour of mopping ahead of him.In the evening, a nurse came to my cell with two prescriptions. I accepted the Prilosec. I’ve always had too much stomach acid, and when there is nothing for it to do, it wears ulcers into my stomach and small intestine. However, I decline the multivitamin they try to give me.The nurse wants to talk too, and take my blood pressure. I decline. She says, “You can’t.” I walk away from the door and go back to bed. I know my rights.Livid, she calls for an extraction team. This would mean a half dozen or so guards in full riot gear, with shields, pepper spray, the whole nine. I find this a bit extreme, but start preparing myself nonetheless. I clear my mind, and focus my senses, preparing to remember as much as possible so I can document it later. They usually video tape extractions, but those tapes have the unsurprising tendency to get lost, overwritten, or otherwise destroyed when their contents are unfavorable to prison authorities.My plan is to offer only non-violent resistance, and let come what may. If they want me to have medical discussions or consent to tests, I decline. If they want me out of the cell, I will make my body dead weight, not actively fighting, but making them carry me. I begin meditating. Minutes go by, I can hear phones and radios squawking outside. The nurse is yelling, “He’s refusing to come to the door!” However, over time things get quieter. Eventually, I stop hearing the nurse complaining. The extraction team never comes.Finally, I get up, and go to my door. I ask my fellow inmates, “Didn’t she call for an extraction?”They nod and shrug.The next morning, after I decline breakfast, with cockroaches still on my mind, two guards come and tell me medical wants to see me.“Please tell them I decline,” I answer.They nod and leave, only to return about ten minutes later telling me that we have to go down, but I can refuse everything once we get there. Visibly annoyed, and with some effort, I get up, get “cuffed up,” and we make the schlep. I’m expecting to see the same Dilbert boss doctor, but instead I’m greeted by a different man.

Gavi’s CEO, Seth Berkley, received £220,000 base compensation in 2014, not £623,370, as was originally stated. The article has been updated to reflect this.The Mail on Sunday published an article over New Years weekend condemning Seth Berkley, the CEO of a major global health organization, as “the fattest charity fat cat of them all.” Ian Birrell, the author of the article, argues that Berkley’s pay package is irreconcilable with the mission of helping the global poor.This criticism, frequently launched by aid critics, unfortunately fails to grapple with or even acknowledge the possibility that higher salaries in the aid industry could improve CEO performance and attract better talent. Although the evidence of the effect of higher salary on improving productivity and finding better talent claims is certainly more mixed than one would hope, Birrell’s article doesn’t attempt to broach this complexity at all.Birrell’s criticism also reveals a common mistake when we talk about the “do-gooder” sector: misguided attention to inputs, rather than outputs. Instead of allowing organizations to determine how they can most effectively spend their money themselves and judging their performance based on results, critics like Birrell would rather focus on the narrowest examples of what they consider waste and fraud. This spending ― rarely put into financial proportion or given proper context ― often amounts to a small fraction of what we spend improving the lives of the poor. However, these examples are then often generalized to an entire sector in order to justify slashing donor funds that support life-saving aid.Of course, corruption, mismanagement, and waste are all problems deserving of attention. However, minimizing these problems should not weaken our ability to alleviate poverty and improve health, as it does in Birrell’s example. When we apply the correct standard of focusing on results, Birrell’s criticism looks even more misplaced. Just one month ago, Seth Berkley’s organization, Gavi, received the highest possible rating in the United Kingdom’s annual Multilateral Development Review. Gavi is frequently complimented by the UK’s own assessment of global development organizations for demonstrating “strong value for money and a high degree of transparency.” Why, then, does Birrell’s article focus so strongly on Berkley’s salary, which makes up less than 1% (0.0002%, to be precise) of pledged donations to the organization in 2010-2015?I can’t pretend to know Birrell’s inner monologue, but his past writing displays a longstanding interest in cutting foreign aid budgets. Birrell was, in fact, quite pleased when the UK government moved £12 billion in foreign aid to military spending as a direct result of conservative complaints. Of course, military spending in the UK is subject to the exact same criticism Birrell applies to foreign aid, probably even to a worse degree. What’s so frustrating about Birrell’s argument is that it’s often premised on taking the most egregious examples of expenditures out of context and concluding that they resemble the vast majority of the aid industry. But they do not: since 2000, Gavi has vaccinated over 450 million children, preventing 8 million deaths in the process.I won’t deny that overpaid consultants are a problem in the development community ― Birrell’s instinct is correct here. However, it’s important to maintain a sense of proportionality ― overpaid consultants simply aren’t the primary reason that global poverty and disease still plague us. Moreover, when global health organizations offer high salaries for their CEOs, this reflects a desire to invest in talent. This is fundamentally different from when rent-seeking development organizations fight between themselves to win contracts without caring about how much they improve the lives of the poor. Whether higher salaries pays off in better CEO performance is a worthwhile pursuit for any journalist ― and indeed, one that I hope Birrell takes up ― but we should not shame “do-gooder” organizations for making investments that can improve the quality of their work.If we are to eliminate poverty and reduce the burden of disease in the global south, journalists, implementers, and multilateral organizations must remain focused on results. Importantly, we must give organizations themselves the ability to make decisions about how best to allocate their resources. While the development sector has a multitude of problems worth highlighting, high CEO pay simply should not rank very highly as a concern, if it is one at all.Correction: Ian Birrell’s original article was published in the Mail on Sunday, not the Daily Mail. The author regrets the error."
85,RELIGION,Being Jewish In the Age of Trump: Jews Must Honor Our History Of Oppression By Resisting White Supremacy,"Julia Sharpe-Levine, ContributorArtist, activist and intersectional feminist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/being-jewish-in-the-age-of-trump-why-we-must-honor_us_58619059e4b014e7c72eddc6,"I believe that Jews can overcome fear and use this moment to condemn racism, sexism and xenophobia in all its forms.",2017-01-02,<p>#BlackLivesMatter protest by Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ)</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586aa37e1500001500916c19.jpg?ops=crop_0_31_800_380%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Growing up on Long Island in the 1990s, I was rarely singled out for my Judaism. My awareness of anti-Semitism in the world came not from first-hand experience, but from history lessons and family stories. Unlike many human rights atrocities, including those committed by the U.S., the Holocaust received a full unit in history class. This knowledge was supplemented by stories passed down from family members. My maternal grandparents told me of aunts, uncles and grandparents murdered in the Holocaust. My father’s accounts of anti-Semitism, which were geographically and historically nearer, focused on exclusion - exclusion from Greek Life at the University of Pennsylvania; exclusion from social spaces; exclusion from certain neighborhoods. My mother shared that she was once called a ‘dirty Jew’ by her fifth grade boyfriend. Though I listened attentively to all of these stories, I did not understand.I did not understand because I had grown up white in America. After millennia of genocide, displacement, persecution, and exclusion throughout the world, and decades of discrimination and rampant anti-Semitism in the United States, Jews had been accepted by White Christian America. By the time I was growing up in the 1990s, Jewish Americans had been thoroughly assimilated into dominant society and, as a result, had procured the myriad benefits that Whiteness carries with it.This transition, which took place throughout the latter half of the 20th century, brought tremendous benefits to Jewish Americans. Though many Jews had been given formal citizenship prior to the 20th century, they were still largely considered non-white by the American majority through the 1940s and were targeted by racist housing and education laws alongside Black Americans and other people of color.Being seen as white and fully Americanized meant that Jews could unreservedly participate in America’s political, economic and social institutions for the first time. It meant that they could purchase homes in the suburbs and take advantage of educational opportunities such as the G.I. bill, which was closed off to Black and Brown veterans. It meant that Jewish children could have the same opportunities for upward mobility that other white children did. While they were once marked as separate from America’s dominant culture, they were now a part of it.Others were not so fortunate. Immigrant groups who had come to America from non-European countries, African Americans who had forcefully been brought to America against their will, and indigenous Americans whose land had been stolen by European colonizers were never offered an opportunity to assimilate into Whiteness. This is not because America’s definition of ‘white’ has ever been based on objective criteria, but because the institution of Whiteness depends on exclusion and hierarchy; without non-whites, Whiteness could not exist. Whiteness is not a scientific category but rather a socially constructed and politically motivated system that has instilled in us the ideology of White Supremacy.Though American Jews have benefitted from being considered white for the past several decades, history has taught us that the borders of Whiteness can contract as easily as they expand. Emboldened by the election of Donald Trump, members of the “alt-right”, a movement that promotes white nationalism and the superiority of the white race, have made it clear that their vision of a purist, white ethnic state does not include Jews. At a recent alt-right gathering held to celebrate Trump’s victory, the president of the National Policy Institute, Richard Spencer, proclaimed “Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!” to thunderous applause and Nazi salutes. Further, Steve Bannon, Trump’s Presidential campaign CEO and newly appointed Chief Strategist, was exposed by his ex-wife in 2007 as having said that he disliked Jews and didn’t want his children going to school with them.The great majority of Jews are still undeniably considered white in the U.S.; for such Jews to claim otherwise is disingenuous. But the words of those like Spencer and Bannon should remind Jews of their history of violent oppression and their obligation to protect those today who face the concrete threat that they once did.Unfortunately, not everyone in the Jewish American community has responded to the current political moment in this manner, choosing instead to cling to Whiteness and their place within it. In November, Carl Reiner, the famed Jewish American actor, director and writer, responded to Bannon’s appointment by tweeting, “I, a Jew, was willing to give Trump a chance til I heard his cheif [sic] of staff say he’d not allow his kids to go to a school if Jews attended.”Though it’s undeniably scary to be reminded of how fragile one’s acceptance within American society is, Reiner’s words sadden me. I want to ask him why he felt Trump had earned the benefit of the doubt, despite all of the racist, sexist, ableist, xenophobic and otherwise hateful and abhorrent things he had said and actions he had promised to take.Further, I wonder what this middle-of-the-road perspective, which is shared by many, says about the Jewish community’s awareness of its own intersections. Most Jews are not straight, cisgendered men, as Reiner is, and are personally threatened by many of the sexist, homophobic and transphobic policies that Trump has sworn to enact as president.Further, the Jewish American community, though largely white, includes a multitude of racial identities. The Center for Jewish & Community Research estimates that 20 percent of the American Jewish community consists of African, African American, Latinx, Asian American, Native American, Sephardic, Mizrahi, biracial, and multiracial Jews. The Jewish American community is not a monolith; on the contrary, it contains as many diverse identities as America itself, and therefore its freedom can never be disentangled from the freedom of every other marginalized group.I believe that Jews can overcome fear and use this moment to condemn racism, sexism and xenophobia in all its forms. As we witness this political and cultural shift toward White Nationalism, we have an opportunity to draw upon our history of religious persecution and oppression to defend the rights of all people, not just ourselves. We can use this moment to join together with other communities against the interconnected forces of hate and oppression that plague our country, as many Jewish Americans did during the Civil Rights movement. We can, and must, also condemn and intervene in human rights atrocities occurring globally, such as the crimes being committed against the Palestinian people by the Israeli government.Our history of religious persecution does not excuse us from speaking out against acts of violence and genocide that don’t directly involve us. In fact, it makes us even more obligated to do so. Whiteness has served us very well here in America, and it’s made us forget where we come from. It’s made us forget what happens when people stay silent in the face of injustice because it doesn’t directly affect them. It’s time for us to divest from White Supremacy, and the first step is acknowledging our complicity and investment in it."

Gender non-conforming, gender diverse, gender variant people. From cisgender men wearing ""man buns"" to cisgender women dressing ""dapper,"" gender ambiguity seems to be the hipster thing now - especially among the Hollywood elite. Hipster culture via gender expression may have been living outwardly on the fringe for quite some time, but it wasn't until about 2013 or so when gorgeous cis, hetero men my age like Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix became one with the love-it-or-hate-it ""man bun"" hairdo. In 2015 Will Smith's son Jaden first stepped out publicly in a dress. Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt's daughter Shiloh prefers a more masculine look, and has been rumored to question her gender identity. And that's totally cool, but these kids are in a pretty safe liberal environment, living within a bubble of protection. Their parents can defend their choices and the accepting echo chamber of fandom devotees will be heard around the world. These people are mega stars. While that does open the flood gates for criticism of all sorts, it also gives them the pretty sure confidence in knowing that however they defend against the criticism, it will at least be heard - and maybe even tolerated - by the masses.But what about gender creative people not living within that safe bubble? Like, for instance, my son and all the gender creative kids he has met through a playgroup that we founded and run. Like, for instance, those of us living in North Carolina right now - you know, the state that is notorious for its controversial ""Bathroom Bill,"" a.k.a. HB2, the most sweeping, anti-LGBTQ+ law in recent U.S. History; the law that says transgender people are only allowed to legally use the public bathroom/locker room/shower/changing facility that matches the biological sex they were assigned at birth. This bill also had the audacity to define biological sex as ""the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate."" (Oops, too bad if you were born intersex. You aren't even included because our former governor didn't know you exist. I mean, there's .7% of you out there. If we base that on the 2014 census numbers, that means we have roughly 27,904 people that are born intersex per year. But hey, who's counting?)I'm talking about trying to live an authentic life amidst the social climate in North Carolina, the state that was recently touted as not being a democracy anymore. In fact, in an article that has since gone viral, one writer pointed out that based on an electoral integrity report, our democracy was ranked on par with Cuba. But beyond the gerrymandering and the oppressive super majority Republican-led house, we have recently had discrimination legalized in our state.To our good fortune and the diligent hard work of the people, we recently gained a new Governor in Roy Cooper, former state attorney general and democrat who opposed HB2 from day one. With Cooper's win, McCrory's loss marked the first lost bid for reelection of any sitting North Carolina Governor since Charles Manly in 1850 when the Whig party began dissolving. But before we were allowed to rejoice in Cooper's election, the NCGOP called special sessions at a cost of $42,000 per day to enact every possible mandate and bill they could push through that would strip Roy Cooper of his ability to effectively govern the state. So, with this precarious social and political climate, one could easily argue that it's pretty difficult to find the more avant-garde appreciation of atypical gender expression in somewhere like Charlotte, North Carolina, than somewhere that's laced with Hollywood royalty like Beverly Hills, California. At a party over the holidays, I met up with a friend from the west coast. He was praising mine and my husband's efforts in raising a gender creative boy here in the south - particularly, that we were ""so brave"" and ""so cool"" for allowing our child to live this life, to express his gender without censorship, and how every child should be so ""lucky."" He talked about how it was great we gave our child a ""choice to live this free lifestyle."" Though it was a misplaced compliment, I appreciated the gesture. But I also realized that my friend thinks my son is somehow lucky (he's not. He has very few friends because he is so non-typical, and doesn't really fit in anywhere in a red state, even with politics aside.) When I was making future plans for my unborn children, I never would've wished - let alone imagined - that I'd be raising someone on the LGBTQ+ spectrum. Secondly, and more troublesome, he called this a ""lifestyle."" (It's not. It's who my son is through and through, not the way he chooses to live). To be an affirming family to this type of child is a very complex part of parenting, to say the least. No parent would willingly choose this path that is scattered with vines and thorns. Now, I understand that my friend meant ""he's lucky to have accepting parents."" I get that. And for that, I appreciated the compliment. But believe me when I say no parent wants to have to defend their child's choice in play toys or clothing year after year. No parent wants to absorb the nasty, disapproving looks you get in public when your male child is wearing his favorite pink leggings. No parent wants to worry that her child will get beaten up in the bathroom because of the clothing he's wearing.There's nothing inherently ""lucky"" about this situation at all. We're parents, we love our children, we've done the research on best practices, and we know from hard, non-disputed evidence that attempts to ""stifle"" a child who expresses opposite or different gender will only result in long term catastrophe. Because we actually do care about safety, we figured it was safest to let our child just be who he is, and deal with the unfair but common harassment, rather than deal with the utter tragedy of a child who commits suicide because he's sent the message that he is not loved unconditionally by his family.The suicide statistics in the LGBTQ+ community do not lie - they speak for themselves. For anyone who has doubts, they can freely check out The Trevor Project, The CDC, PFLAG, The Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal, The Family Equality Council, GLAAD, GLSEN, and The National Center for LGBT Health, just to name a few. The bigger misunderstanding of my friend, and of society as a whole, is that this is a lifestyle or a choice, much like the soup du jour in a trendy restaurant. Like raising this type of child is on par with baking your own granola, shopping exclusively at Trader Joe's, or smoking Parliament cigarettes. It's the implication that my husband and I had any say in putting together all the pieces of our child's brain - all the pieces that form connections and predispose one to be ""feminine"" or ""masculine,"" some combination of both, or neither. Just as a parent does not choose to have a child born with a handicap, or disease, a parent cannot choose their child's gender expression or later in life, sexual orientation. A parent can verbally forbid these things, but we all know how that goes. After having two cisgender children, one male and one female, of course we wondered why our third child, born male, at age three was making intricate bird houses and fancy glass slippers out of the Legos, instead of building cars and robots. Of course we did our due diligence for years in buying him firetrucks and matchbox cars and action figures - all of which barely made it out of the box, let alone, ever got played with. The only things in this child's room that stayed out the corner collecting dust were the battered Barbie dolls and the tattered tutus his older sister graciously handed down. This is just who our son is. It took us a while to all get on the same page and embrace it, and further, advocate for him. But the point is, we have fought many, many battles just to get where we are, and he hasn't even started middle school yet. That my friend was talking so casually and upbeat about how ""cool"" he thought our life was in raising this type of child showed the complete absence of understanding that this is not some passing hipster phase. We are not living in a commune, growing an organic vegetable garden. This is who my son is. He is effeminate expressing from the inside-out. There is no confusion. He’s very clear in stating he does not want to change his anatomy or live as a girl - he just prefers all the things stereo-typically marketed to girls, and prefers the company of girls over boys any day. That’s the definition of gender creative. He is a textbook case, and has been ever since age two when he was able to communicate his wants and needs. While self-professed hipsters get to embrace the atypical look and attitude for a while as they see fit, they can also shed that image like a snake should they choose to do so. I mean just the word ""hipster"" implies more of a lifestyle, attitude, or clothing choice than how someone was born and continues to develop for the rest of their life.People like the Hollywood elite get to play with gender while the world watches and continues looking up to them. Some of them were already born into a fortune so they'll never have to worry about needing government assistance for unemployment. But people like the gender creative and transgender people living in predominantly conservative states have to worry about things like legalized workplace discrimination. They have to worry about the very real possibility of not getting hired in the first place simply because of who they are. Don't get me wrong. It is a wonderful thing to see people from all over the country embracing some gender-bending tendencies and styles. It is awesomely freeing to see more gender blurring, and less gender stereotyping. It's especially nice when it comes from celebrities who help set trends and fashion. But is it because they're testing the boundaries? Is it their little way of rebelling? Sticking it to the man? Or are they pushing a more liberal feminist agenda? Fighting for equal rights? Pushing back against stereotypical gender norms that are in dire need of a makeover? Who knows. The trend may die out in the next week. Unlike some effeminate boys who can't overcome their lifelong lisps no matter how much vocal therapy they endure, hipsters have the option to abandon ship and cast aside when the cultural winds shift. One thing seems for sure, though: whether Jared Leto and the hipsters are sporting the man bun or not, they are still most likely either cisgender or heterosexual, or both. Not all of them, of course. But no doubt plenty of them. Enough of them who, when the choice comes around to adopt a different brand, will do it. And that's the difference between gender creative people and hipsters. It is indeed a luxury and a privilege to have that choice. originally published at: www.gendercreativelife.com "

Taking stock of my personal and business goals, accomplishments, and progress, it is also a time to reflect on what I have been most inspired by to spur on into 2017. The previous 12 months were not easy and certainly filled with their share of heartache or disbelief, or both. It only takes a moment to recount the parts of the last year marked by the increasing visibility of unarmed black men and women dying at the hands of law enforcement, tragedies driven by hate and guns sold to people who should not have access, and the confirmation of a President-elect I still have not quite come to terms with. Yet through the heaviness and uncertainty about the future of our country, 2016 gave us a bright spot to hold high and carry into this new year, the on-going reign of #BlackGirlMagic.More than a #hashtag trending across social media platforms, the essence of #BlackGirlMagic continues to inspire hope and give many the will to push forward in pursuit of their visions to make the world a better place...myself included. Whether CaShawn Thompson could have foreseen at the outset of “Black Girls are Magic”, just how much black women of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life needed to be uplifted, needed encouragement, needed a movement with which we could come together and celebrate one another, the power behind #BlackGirlMagic is not slowing down. Its effect is only gaining momentum in a time when black women and their incredible contributions are still too often overlooked, not acknowledged and seen as improbable. #BlackGirlMagic is a light at the end of an otherwise disenfranchised tunnel where the odds are stacked against us, we face the realities of racism and sexism, and for many of us the resulting feelings of self-doubt can teeter just below the surface. Each time I see one of my fellow black women knock it out of the park I feel invigorated, confident, a determination birthed from our ancestors, and able to push a bit harder and farther than my comfort zone may otherwise want me to. #BlackGirlMagic inspires me to push through on days I feel like giving up or that my best is never going to be good enough. Over the last year it has been my magical Black women who remind me that it takes more than talent to turn visions into dreams realized, and to sustain our impact in the world. With each post celebrating the beauty, achievements, and victories of my fellow black women, I found myself sharpening my values around leadership, dedication, work ethic, and striving for excellence. We do have what it takes, glowing black skin, coiled hair and all.In 2016 the reign of #BlackGirlMagic unequivocally continued to not disappoint, in fact it’s everywhere, in every black woman owning just how awesome she is in her way. A few of my favorite #BlackGirlMagic moments over the last year came from the grace of Michelle Obama, the greatest First Lady of our time, the unapologetic creativity of Beyoncé and her Grammy-nom history-making Lemonade, the fierceness of Serena Williams period, and all our black women athletes from Gabby Douglas to Simone Biles who dominated the Olympic stage. But the #BlackGirlMagic that shook me most was a moment while attending the 2016 WEEN Awards in New York City that highlighted the perseverance, service, and hope of Geneva Reed-Veal, and our Mothers of the Movement at the forefront of #BlackLivesMatter. I see in them black women who have lost their children far too soon to racism and unnecessary violence, yet they have not been discouraged from using their voices to seek justice and change not only for their families but for all of us. For me, there is no greater inspiration and source of determination, and what more is to know the ability to make a positive impact in the lives of others is inside each of us.So how do we keep building on the reign of #BlackGirlMagic? My challenge to myself and others in the coming year is to not only own my #BlackGirlMagic, but to uplift my fellow black women and the next generation of black girls on scales large and small, on and offline. To be fearless in supporting not only our wins, but encouraging one another in the journey, through the challenges, missteps, and blocks. To not be afraid to lift as we climb. Let go of the idea that we are in competition, and to trust that each of us has been designed for success and there is room for each of us to make a difference. To do this there is no requirement to be anyone other than yourself. Be the best you. This and more is what #BlackGirlMagic means to me. I am grateful for my #BlackGirlMagic and all the magical black women who surround me. The reign of #BlackGirlMagic will only continue building right on into 2017 and I believe the best is yet to come."
