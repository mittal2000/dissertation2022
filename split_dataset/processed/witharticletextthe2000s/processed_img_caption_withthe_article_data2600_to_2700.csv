0,ENTERTAINMENT,Barry Jenkins Quietly Makes History With Oscar Nomination Trifecta,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barry-jenkins-oscar-nominations_us_58875de7e4b0e3a7356bb123,"No other black writer-director has been nominated for Best Director, Picture and Screenplay.",2017-01-24,Barry Jenkins could become the first black man to win best director at the Oscars next month. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588761011200003e0aad96a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Barry Jenkins, the writer and director behind “Moonlight,” could become the biggest story of awards season should he nab Best Director at the 89th Academy Awards next month. His win would mark the first time a black man had ever done so.But when the nominations were announced on Tuesday, Jenkins quietly made a little history along the way as well, becoming the first black writer-director to get individually nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay for his work on a film that received a Best Picture nomination, too. All in all, “Moonlight” nabbed eight nominations, tying “Arrival” for second most among all films after “La La Land.”Jenkins, who is currently in Amsterdam, responded to the news over Twitter a few hours after the nominations were released.No black man has ever won Best Director at the Oscars, and Jenkins is just the fourth to ever get nominated.John Singleton famously did it first in 1992 with “Boyz n the Hood,” while also scoring a nomination for a best screenplay award. Then Lee Daniels was nominated in 2010 with “Precious,” the film for which Geoffrey Fletcher won Best Adapted Screenplay. Most recently, Steve McQueen was nominated for Best Director in 2014 for “12 Years a Slave,” for which John Ridley won Best Adapted Screenplay.But Jenkins is alone in receiving nominations for the writing and directing of a film up for Best Picture. (”Moonlight” is based on the play “In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.”) Notably, no black woman has ever been nominated for Best Director. “Moonlight,” which has grossed more than $15 million worldwide, follows the life of a boy named Chiron, who grows up in impoverished 1980s Miami with a drug-addicted mother while struggling to come to terms with his own sexuality.Clarification: The language in this post has been amended to reflect that Jenkins is not personally nominated in the Best Picture category, because he does not have a producer credit."
1,HEALTHY LIVING,Whale Study Suggests Menopause May Exist So Grandmas Can Babysit,Ann Brenoff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whale-study-menopause_us_5886668fe4b070d8cad4a014,A new evolutionary biology study throws mother-daughter conflicts into the mix.,2017-01-24,Is it evolutionary biology that grandmothers babysit?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588779352900002800dd166f.jpeg?cache=WndeTYsBC1&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What do menopausal women have in common with killer whales? Tread lightly there, friend.An international research team from the universities of Exeter, Cambridge and York (U.K.), the Center for Whale Research (U.S.) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada is tackling one of evolutionary biology’s biggest puzzles: Why is it that in only three species do females live past their reproductive age ― humans, killer whales and pilot whales?The prevailing theory has been that grandmothers ― both human and whale ― are needed to help care for the offspring of their adult children. But Darren Croft, co-author of a study recently published in “Current Biology,” told The Huffington Post that there may be something else at play: Mother-daughter conflict.To produce the strongest gene pool possible, older females have to stop competing with their daughters. When grandmothers help raise their grandchildren, at least for whales, those offspring do better than the calves raised by just a mother alone, according to the study. Hence, it’s in a whale population’s best genetic interest for older females to stop producing more offspring, since their genetic line is more likely to survive if they just help out with the grand-calves. There could be a similar explanation for why human females lose the ability to reproduce long before their death, according to Croft. But there’s more.Reproductive conflict between generations is the newest piece of the puzzle. Older female whales may stop reproducing because their calves don’t fare as well in the competition for resources ― food. The calves with younger mothers do better and have higher survival rates.In the new study Croft and his colleagues used a long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales of the Pacific Northwest. The authors found that when older and younger females breed at the same time, selection will favor younger females. Likewise, it’s better for older females ― those younger females’ mothers and grandmothers ― to compete less and cooperate more.When mothers and daughters breed at the same time, the calves of the older females are 1.7 times more likely to die than the calves of younger females, the study found.The bottom line, Croft says, is that menopause is no accident. Rather, it’s an evolved trait driven by both cooperation and conflict in family groups.Killer whales start reproducing around age 15 and enter menopause around age 30 to 40. But they live well into their 90s. “In our previous work,” Croft said in an email to HuffPost, “we have shown that these old females boost the survival of their adult offspring by helping them to find food.” He added, “This however did not explain why they stop reproducing. Our new work shows that a key mechanism proposed to explain menopause in ancestral humans is also at play in killer whales.”“In humans, we know that grandmothers provide important benefits to their grand offspring ― which can explain the benefits of the long female lifespan seen in humans,” he added. “[But] what has been difficult to explain is why females don’t keep reproducing until the end of life.”If an old female killer whale reproduces, her late-life offspring suffer from being out-competed by her grandchildren. This, together with her investment in helping her grandchildren, can explain the evolution of menopause, said the study. Humans too? Could be. Earlier studies show that women with a long post-reproductive lifespan have more grandchildren, and subsequent greater well-being. "
2,POLITICS,"Donald Trump Never Gave Business Documents To Ethics Office, Democrat Says",Dana Liebelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-documents-ethics-office_us_58878143e4b070d8cad57e92,Where did these folders go?,2017-01-24,Not even the Office of Government Ethics has seen what's in these folders.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588786001200003e0aad974c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Before he was sworn in, President Donald Trump disappointed ethics experts by refusing to sell his business empire. Instead, he presented stacks of manila folders that supposedly contained “some of the many documents” he’d signed to give control of his companies to his adult sons.Reporters weren’t allowed to see those documents. And according to Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the Office of Government Ethics hasn’t seen them, either.Cummings met on Monday with Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, along with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the Utah Republican who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, and other committee Democrats to discuss OGE operations and other issues.Reports suggest that the meeting was amicable. But Shaub also told committee members that the OGE “never received copies of the documents that then-President-Elect Trump brought to his press conference … regarding his conflicts of interest,” according to a Monday press release from Cummings’ office. “The Office of Government Ethics has received no new information since this press conference.” Shaub nonetheless remained “willing and ready” to help Trump address his business conflicts, Cummings’ office noted. The OGE chief did not respond to a request for comment.Norman Eisen, who served as the chief White House ethics lawyer under former President Barack Obama, told The Huffington Post that the president is subject to disclosure rules under federal law that are within OGE’s jurisdiction. According to Eisen, ethics lawyers for president-elects and presidents have always worked closely with OGE on their finances during transitions and after assuming the presidency ― which includes sharing documents. “That does not seem to have happened here,” he said. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Trump is the first president in the modern era to refuse to divest or separate himself from business holdings that may pose conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization released a letter on Monday — dated the day before inauguration — that said he’d resigned from hundreds of corporate entities. But ethics experts say Trump’s move to stop managing his companies fails to alleviate problems that may stem from his continued ownership of his business empire. For months, Shaub sought to connect with the Trump transition team. OGE even resorted to getting Trump’s attention over Twitter: “Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, good for America!” the office wrote in a series of seemingly sarcastic tweets.After Trump failed to divest, Shaub went public with his concerns. “This is not a blind trust, it’s not even close,” he said at the Brookings Institution on Jan. 11. His comments, as well as his office’s tweets, prompted Republicans to go after OGE. Chaffetz accused Shaub of refusing to come in and meet with his staff, going so far as to threaten a subpoena. But it was Chaffetz who missed a previously discussed meeting in early December, according to Office of Government Ethics emails The Huffington Post obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. Cummings said that based on the HuffPost report, it seemed that Chaffetz owed Shaub “an apology for these inaccurate public attacks against him.” Although lawmakers reportedly scolded Shaub on Monday about his office’s tweets, the meeting — which was closed to the public — appears to have eased some of the tension. Chaffetz indicated that it went well. “I think we understand each other better,” he told reporters. His office did not respond to a request for comment.Still, Cummings said the meeting left him “more concerned than ever about President Trump’s refusal to follow the advice of Republican and Democratic ethics experts.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

7,STYLE,I Let My Nana Dress Me And I've Never Gotten So Many Compliments,Jamie Feldman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grandma-dresses-me_us_588103bce4b0e3a735679f7a,A lesson in self-love and faux leather.,2017-01-24,"Aritzia sleeveless sweater, faux leather Ann Taylor pants, Aldo booties, hand-me-down top. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58862e891200002d00ad93a9.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“I don’t understand why you’d want me to do this.”My nana, tiny in stature but massive in presence, is standing perplexed in the middle of my closet in my studio apartment in Brooklyn. For the first time ever, I have tasked her with choosing all of my outfits for a full week.One look at my nana, and you’ll understand why I ― or anyone else, for that matter ― might ask her to do this. What she calls a two-bedroom apartment in New Jersey, I call a sacred temple of style, where entire dressers are devoted to belts and perfectly pristine racks of clothing hang from every hook. That notion naively led me to believe that this experiment, to have her pick out my outfits for a full week, would go off without a hitch. Our 28 consecutive years of spending Saturdays at the mall together surely would give her a sense of how to navigate my closet for a measly five days.But standing there in my closet, it became clear to me that what I imagined all these years as carefully calculated genius is even more mind-blowing than I thought ― it just comes to her naturally. “When I get dressed, I just put things on and see if they work. I don’t know how to do that for you.”After a bit of coaxing and a coloring book break (yes, really), she started to ease in. “Pair that sleeveless dress with a neutral top,” she said. “Where is that dress I gave you a few years ago?” The wheels were turning. An hour later, I had 7 complete outfits picked out, plus alternative pieces that she “just likes.” Most of the pieces she picked were either hand-me-downs from her own closet (yes, really) or pieces bought on a shopping trip together. Some of her selections were pieces that I had either never or rarely worn, and I dreaded putting them on. She had barely gotten out the door when I got a call from her. “You know, I was thinking about a floral dress you have that I gave you. That would look good, too.” She was in, and I was obligated to follow through. Behold, four days of our experiment.DAY ONEI decided to go way out of my comfort zone right off the bat. Both the pants and the pink shirt were once nana’s, and I had never worn either of them before this day. The first (of many) compliments I got came from a male co-worker, which would thrill my nana, who believes the only accessory I’m missing in life is a boyfriend.DAY TWOAnother nana original. This dress and the shrug both came from her closet, and have both sat in my closet since they got there. I also wore a ton of eyeshadow on this day, because nana likes to wear it. This look is way more conservative than I would ever normally dress, and way more put together. One thing I learned in this experiment? I’m kind of a mess ― ”but in a really put together way!” my co-workers said. Thanks, co-workers.DAY THREENana saw someone wearing a hat in a commercial and said, “Don’t you have a hat like that? Wear it.” I took that to mean I could wear it any time I wanted. It came in handy for this outfit, a sweater gifted to me by my mom a few years back. This one was a big hit in the office. “You would never wear that to work. Is that how you dress on the weekends?” “No,” I said. “But maybe I should.” It was on this day that I also went on a first date, who told me that I looked “really nice.” So there’s that. DAY FOURI asked nana to pick one “going out outfit” and this is what I got. My ripped jeans-loving heart said no, but my ripped jeans-hating nana said yes. I got a load of compliments on this very infrequently worn skirt, despite the fact that I felt entirely too dressed up and my feet, more accustomed to flat boots, were screaming bloody murder the entire time.I was completely and utterly uncomfortable the whole time, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. My insecurities about how certain clothing looks on my body had no choice but to hit the road, and in turn gave way to outfits I had either forgotten about or never considered.Seeing myself through her eyes made me realize that when it comes to getting dressed, most of the time I’m too busy getting in my own head to even consider many of the great pieces I’ve accumulated over the years. As someone who preaches the importance of self-acceptance in others, it was an eye-opening experience to have to put that notion into practice myself, despite my overall level of discomfort in doing so.Plus, I didn’t have to think about what to wear for a full week. It was a lesson in self-love, a test of self-expression and an even greater test of trust. I’d say we passed all three, together. "

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), President Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general, during a press briefing on Tuesday. “Senator Sessions’ record on voting and civil rights is exemplary,” Spicer said in response to April Ryan, a White House correspondent for the American Urban Radio Networks. “He has fought very hard as both an attorney general in Alabama and as a U.S. attorney, and then as a senator, for voting rights, for civil rights, on areas of minority rights.” “When the Voting Rights Act came up for renewal, he was a huge champion of it. So it’s not just his record as an attorney but as a United States senator, he has been a very forceful advocate of the continuation of the Voting Rights Act,” Spicer added, pointing to Sessions’ overseeing the prosecution of two Klansmen when he was a U.S. attorney. But in 2013, Sessions supported gutting key provisions from the Voting Rights Act. A Senate Judiciary Committee blocked Sessions from being a federal judge in 1986 due to concerns that he was too racist to do the job fairly. When Sessions was a U.S. attorney, he prosecuted three black activists over the charge of disputed absentee ballots. A black assistant U.S. attorney claimed that Sessions had called him “boy,” joked about the Ku Klux Klan and called the NAACP “anti-American.” Trump’s lack of meetings with civil rights leaders was also discussed. The president of the NAACP, according to Ryan, said Trump’s administration is “stereotyping by omission” by sitting down with athletes and celebrities instead of civil rights leaders. Kanye West, Steve Harvey and NFL legends Ray Lewis and Jim Brown have met with Trump to discuss issues facing black Americans. They have also spent time trying to convince people that Trump isn’t racist. Spicer’s response was similar to a star football player fumbling on the last play of a close game. “Just the other day he sat down with Martin Luther King Jr.,” he said. “I would call him a civil rights leader.” Spicer was referring to a sit-down between Trump and King’s son, Martin Luther King III. After several reporters corrected Spicer’s slip, the press secretary said Trump has “done a lot for that” and “has met with a lot of individuals on that issue throughout the campaign.” “I don’t think it’s something that he takes lightly. He has talked about it tremendously because it’s important to him ― both in terms of where this country moves forward and some of the issues that face some of the minority communities,” Spicer said. When Ryan asked about rolling out a plan and the promises Trump has made to “fix” communities of color, Spicer once again fumbled. “We’re on day two and look what he is doing. I think when you look at the jobs programs, the Dakota pipeline, the Keystone pipeline ― the things that are going to bring jobs back, and good paying jobs with benefits ― those benefit every American regardless of the color of your skin,” Spicer said.

The 46-year-old is being held at the county jail on bonds totaling over $1 million.“His actions are a disgrace, not only to our agency but to law enforcement professionals everywhere,” Sarasota County Sheriff Thomas Knight said at a Monday press conference.According to the sheriff’s office, the investigation into Bybee began last month, when a 79-year-old woman complained that he was harassing her.The woman told police she met Bybee in October 2016, when he responded to a call for assistance at her residence and helped transport her to a local hospital. Bybee then allegedly began visiting the woman while on and off duty, and introduced her to several members of his family, authorities said.A friendship quickly developed and Bybee allegedly agreed to temporarily care for the woman’s dog, a 2-year-old Yorkshire terrier named J.J. The woman told authorities she wrote Bybee a check for $1,000 that was intended to cover grooming and veterinarian fees.When the woman was released from the hospital, Bybee allegedly refused to return her dog.Interviewed by detectives, Bybee acknowledged taking possession of the dog and said he’d placed an ad on Craigslist and “rehomed” it, according to authorities.On Jan. 9, investigators allegedly discovered four checks in the woman’s name made out to Bybee and his three children, totaling $65,000. The woman denied writing the checks, and a forensic analysis of the documents allegedly revealed the presence of Bybee’s fingerprints.The deputy was placed on administrative leave as authorities continued their investigation.Three days later, on Jan. 12, the woman contacted the sheriff’s office, claiming that Bybee had entered her home wearing dark clothing and blue latex gloves and tried to kill her.“Bybee mounted the victim and, while holding her down, forced prescription medication in her mouth,” Knight said.The woman said she lost consciousness during the attack and when she awoke, she discovered the inside door to her garage was open and her vehicle was running, filling her home with carbon monoxide fumes.Knight said investigators believe Bybee left the vehicle running in an attempt to “kill the victim and make it appear to be a suicide.”The woman sustained lacerations and abrasions to her face and bruising to her body, according the sheriff’s office.“She said the man tried to kill her,” the woman’s neighbor, Chalyce Sullivan, told Tampa’s WTSP News. “She’s a nice person [and] doesn’t deserve that.”Authorities say they’ve since located the woman’s dog and reunited her with it.Bybee denied the allegations during a Monday court appearance and claimed to have an alibi for the time of the alleged assault. He is expected to make another court appearance in the coming weeks.Knight said he was disappointed to learn that a deputy had been charged.“It is beyond unacceptable that an individual who works in a position of trust and guardianship to their community is capable of such heinous crimes,” the chief said Monday.According to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Bybee has been investigated by the sheriff’s office five times since he was hired in 1998. Prior to this latest case, the most recent instance was in 2015, when Bybee was accused of making a false statement to his supervisors. He was found guilty of that charge and demoted from the detective bureau to the patrol division.Because Bybee has been employed at the sheriff’s office for nearly 20 years, authorities are asking anyone who may have been victimized by Bybee to contact the Criminal Investigations Section at 941-861-4932."

At 16 years old, I was also one of those people.I spent 11 consecutive months in a cell that was the size of a parking space, and though I consider myself one of the lucky ones for making it out, the cost of solitary confinement still weighs heavily on me. For many years after my release, I couldn’t adjust to life on the outside. My relationships suffered greatly because the moment someone got too close to me, I would push them away. I was living in a crowded solitude, even though I was now ostensibly free. It took me many years to overcome the deep scars caused by my time in confinement. I am not alone in this, and I know that there are men and women with long-lasting or permanent damage to their mental health after solitary confinement. In recent years, research has shown what common sense tells us ― and I’ve seen first-hand ― solitary confinement does not make penal institutions or the public any safer. In fact, it’s quite the contrary. People become more aggressive or develop behaviors that put themselves and other people at risk. As a result, there is increasing public pressure for change and governments at the federal, state, and local levels have taken steps in the right direction in trying to reform this cruel and unusual practice.For example, last year President Obama announced a federal ban on putting kids in solitary confinement, and the Department of Justice issued guidelines for reforming and limiting the practice, including directives to the federal Bureau of Prisons to reduce its use of solitary confinement. This was a good start, but so much remains to be done.But I am not hopeful that the new Trump administration will continue the progress that we as a society have made on this issue or the criminal justice system in general. While it’s unclear if the new administration will roll back reforms on solitary, it’s hard to imagine that there will be any commitment to continued reform on this issue.I spent 11 consecutive months in a cell that was the size of a parking space.And it’s not only policy that is concerning on these issues ― it’s the effect that Trump has on the American psyche. I feel as if it is more important now than it ever has been for us to keep fighting for progress and reform in the criminal justice system before cruel and unusual punishment once again becomes confused with “law and order,” the watchwords of Trump and his likely attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions.If we don’t come together now then when will we? We have a great opportunity to stand together in these uncertain and difficult times, and I will continue to beat the drum of doing away with solitary and all other forms of draconian punishment as long as I’m alive.

Another $18.5 million would go toward paying attorneys’ fees.Under the settlement, which must be approved by U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet, any amount not claimed will revert back to the city, meaning the total payout could be significantly less. The city also continues to deny the existence of a quota system.The deal came on top of other reforms enacted under Mayor Bill de Blasio, who in June signed a law that would give the NYPD the ability to issue civil rather than criminal summonses for certain quality-of-life offenses.“This settlement reflects the remarkable progress the NYPD has made to ensure that summonses are properly drafted and include sufficient details to document probable cause,” New York City Corporation Counsel Zachary Carter said in a statement.Filed in 2010, the lawsuit alleged that the NYPD officers engaged in a pattern and practice in which they stop, searched, arrested and issued summonses to individuals regardless of whether a crime or violation occurred.According to court papers, of the more than 3.86 million summonses issued by the NYPD from May 2007 to December 2015, 899,719 were dismissed on the grounds of being facially insufficient.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Leslie Adler)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5885f9fa1c00002e00d93a87.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was 5 years old, my mother piled me and my two older brothers into her Honda Accord and drove us from Farmington, Ut., 20 minutes north to the city of Ogden. She left her parents’ home with very little emotional and financial support. She chose to leave the Mormon faith and raise her children on her own while she obtained a Bachelor’s degree from Weber State University. She was barely 28 years old, with no husband and no college degree, just a few semesters into her B.A. in English and History. I’m now almost the same age as she was when she made that drive, her three clueless children arguing over who got the front seat, not a single person aware of the audacity that it took for her to make that decision.On Saturday I marched with that woman and about 500,000 other people in Washington D.C. in support of women’s rights and in support of the institutions that, with her, raised me: a welfare program that allowed my mother to buy groceries, student loans so she could get an education and give us a better life without the constraints of an oppressive religion that had betrayed her, a public school system that taught me to read and gave me a field to play on and fed me lunch, access to contraception so that my mother never had to worry about bringing in a fourth mouth. I marched for my rights, too of course ― same-sex marriage and and an administration that protects the LGTBQ community, abortion access and protections for survivors of gender-based violence. But mostly, I was marching for my mother, and every woman like her. On that life-changing 20-minute drive, and in our life proceeding it, we had three cassette tapes that replaced Mormonism as our religion: Bruce Springsteen’s “Born To Run,” Queen’s “Greatest Hits Vol. 1,” and Madonna’s “Immaculate Collection.” “The Immaculate Collection” was our favorite. “The Immaculate Collection” meant a two-person dance party: me and my mother. Alone time with the mother who was either working or going to school. We snuck in those two-person dance parties on car rides to Albertson’s and carried them on in the parking lot, or in the living room of our small apartment on weekends. “Like a Prayer” was the anthem, “Express Yourself” my mother’s constant advice. “Express what you’ve got, baby,” she’d sing to the daughter who grew up to be writer. “Ready or not!” I’d respond.As we marched in Washington D.C. on Saturday, Amy Schumer introduced Madonna out of nowhere.I turned to my mother and watched her almost faint. I watched her eyes grow huge and water. I know that Madonna isn’t always a perfect icon, and Tina Fey can say what she will about her “Gollum arms,” but when you’re a broke mother of three under the age of 30 without a college degree who’d just ditched her faith and carried a burden of guilt so strong it could have crumpled us, Madonna’s music was sacred. Life-saving, life-giving.Growing up poor can be humiliating. You begin to think that you don’t deserve nice things. That there’s a certain quality of life you’ll not only never achieve, but also never feel that you deserve. We were at least afforded the privilege of our whiteness and our able bodies ― one that many poor Americans are not ― but the residual effects of growing up poor in a nation that treats its poor citizens like a vermin infestation are real and painful. But we had Madonna. We had “The Immaculate Collection.”Our life was fucking fabulous.So on Saturday, to the sound of Madonna singing and yelling and swearing, I marched with, and for, my mother.The mother who looked at her young daughter and knew that raising her in an oppressive, patriarchal faith would break her.The mother who was sexually assaulted when she was a teenager and now has to watch a man who’s bragged about similar behavior lead the country for four years.The mother who graduated with a 4.0 even though she spent her college years raising three children and working however many jobs. The mother who helped start a Gay-Straight Alliance on the conservative high school campus on which she taught. The mother who smiled and nodded and shrugged when I came out to her as bisexual.I was marching for my mother, the survivor.My mother, the fighter.My mother, the teacher.My mother, immaculate. "

Victoria Kaplan, organizing director for MoveOn, estimates several thousand participated nationwide in the protests Tuesday.Seven protesters were arrested in Chicago during a rally targeting Illinois’ Democratic senators, Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, said Kathy Mulady, press secretary for People’s Action. The protesters were arrested for shutting down traffic and blocking streets, and had not been released as of late Tuesday.Several hundred people braved the rain and bitter cold to protest outside the New York offices of Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) in an effort to pressure them to delay or stop the Cabinet confirmations.Nelini Stamp, an organizer for the Working Families Party, said the turnout at the New York demonstration significantly exceeded expectations.“People decided to really throw down,” Stamp said. “I think this is the largest crowd we’ve had outside of Schumer’s office since the new Congress has been in session.”Representatives of Schumer and Gillibrand greeted participants and collected letters from the crowd to deliver to fellow senators before heading back inside the building.The protesters continued to chant “Drain the swamp!” and “Serve the people!” long after the staff members sought refuge from the driving rain.“I think it demonstrates both the commitment and the urgency that many, many people are feeling,” Kaplan said about the protests. “And that we’re not going to accept what Trump is trying to do to this country.”Previously:After the success of the worldwide Women’s Marches this weekend, activists are planning another wave of demonstrations against President Donald Trump. Protesters across the country are expected to gather at the state offices of their members of Congress on Tuesday in an effort to stop the Senate from confirming several of Trump’s Cabinet picks.More than 100 “Stop Trump’s #SwampCabinet” demonstrations are planned in at least 35 states and will target dozens of senators and representatives, both Democratic and Republican. (The complete list of events can be found here.)The nationwide protest is being led by liberal activist organization MoveOn.org, progressive grass-roots advocacy group People’s Action and the Working Families Party.“People’s lives are on the line,” said Victoria Kaplan, organizing director for MoveOn. “It’s our responsibility as participants in our democracy to make sure that our senators understand their constituents expect them to do everything in their power to stop this swamp Cabinet that Trump has put forward.”Kaplan expects several thousand people to participate in Tuesday’s events, and encouraged activists to lead rallies in cities that don’t yet have any scheduled.The rallies aim to undermine the “most egregious and dangerous” Cabinet appointments, Kaplan said ― such as billionaire philanthropist Betsy DeVos as secretary of education, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) as secretary of health and human services and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general ― by pressuring lawmakers to delay or stop their confirmations.“You can’t play footsie with the KKK and expect to be attorney general of the United States,” Kaplan said about Sessions, whose former assistant once accused him of describing the white supremacist group as “OK until he learned that they smoked marijuana.”Many of Trump’s Cabinet picks have come under intense scrutiny from Democrats and even some Republicans.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) renewed his calls on the Office of Congressional Ethics to launch an investigation into Price’s potentially illegal stock purchases. A spokesman for Trump’s former transition team said last week that Price, a staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act, “had no knowledge” of the investments.DeVos, who would lead U.S. public schools if confirmed, has been called “the most anti-public education nominee in the history of the department” by the president of the American Federation of Teachers. Her lack of experience was the subject of sharp criticism from members of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions during her confirmation hearing last week. “Democrats in the Senate have the power to slow, delay, stop these Cabinet picks,” Kaplan said. “And we expect them to use every tool in their toolbox to do so.”At some of Tuesday’s events, speakers will address the crowd before groups of demonstrators attempt to speak directly with members of Congress or their office staff to voice their opposition to Trump’s nominees, Kaplan said. The actual schedule of events may vary from rally to rally.Organizers hope to build on momentum created from Saturday’s Women’s March protests.“If every person who marched [in the Women’s March] were to visit their Congress member’s office one time this week ― on their way to work or after school ― we would be unstoppable,” Kaplan said, noting that those who can’t attend the Tuesday protests in person can reach out to their members of Congress at any time.Several confirmation votes and hearings are scheduled for this week, including a decision Monday on former Exxon Mobil Corp. CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, and decisions Tuesday on former neurosurgeon Ben Carson as secretary of housing and urban development and Sessions as attorney general.Secretary of Defense Gen. James Mattis and Secretary of Homeland Security Gen. John Kelly became the first two of Trump’s Cabinet members to be confirmed following the Senate’s vote on Friday.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

The point is the attacks and the attempt to delegitimize this president in one day. And we’re not going to sit around and take it,” Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on “Fox News Sunday.”The sparring with the media has dominated Trump’s first weekend in office, eclipsing debate over policy and Cabinet appointments.It was the main theme at the Republican president’s first visit to the CIA, at the press secretary’s first media briefing and in senior officials’ first appearances on the Sunday talk shows.Together, they made clear the administration will continue to take an aggressive stance with news organizations covering Trump.“We’re going to fight back tooth and nail every day and twice on Sunday,” Priebus said.He repeated White House press secretary Sean Spicer’s assertions on Saturday that the media manipulated photographs of the National Mall to make the crowds on Friday look smaller than they really were.Aerial photographs showed the crowds were significantly smaller than when Barack Obama took over as president in 2009.The Washington subway system said it had 193,000 riders by 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) on Friday, compared with 513,000 at that time during the 2009 inauguration.Spicer’s categorical assertion that “this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration - period” was widely challenged in media reports citing crowd count experts and was lampooned on social media as well.Asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” why the press secretary was uttering provable falsehoods, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway fired back.“If we are going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms I think that we are going to rethink our relationship here,” she said.Conway responded to criticism that the new administration was focusing on crowds rather than on significant domestic and foreign policy issues by saying: “We feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts out there.”Priebus and Conway focused on a press pool report that said the bust of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office after Trump took office. The report on Friday night was quickly corrected, but Trump called out the reporter by name during a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency on Saturday. Spicer also berated the reporter later in the day.RUSSIAN SHADOWSWith the Nov. 8 election results shadowed by U.S. intelligence reports of Russian meddling on his behalf, Trump has bristled at reports suggesting his popular support is soft and that the election was not legitimate.Trump, who lost the popular vote to Democrat Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes, made no mention of Russia in his first visit to the CIA on Saturday. He praised his nominee to head the agency, Mike Pompeo, and ranted against the “dishonest” media, a favorite target during his presidential campaign.The president accused the media of fabricating his tensions with the U.S. intelligence community, despite his frequent posts on Twitter that derided the agencies.Trump drew criticism from Democrats as well as former CIA Director John Brennan for his remarks at the agency, where he spoke before a memorial wall with stars representing personnel killed in action.“President Trump ought to realize he’s not campaigning anymore. He’s president,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on ABC’s “This Week.”“Instead of talking about how many people showed up at his inauguration, he ought to be talking about how many people are going to stay in the middle class and move into the middle class.”(Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Paul Simao)"

27,POLITICS,One Of The Easiest Questions Sean Spicer Got In His First Press Briefing Was Also The Smartest,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-spicer-trump-unemployment-rate_us_58866473e4b096b4a233d4a4,"Because accountability and, you know, science matter.",2017-01-23,White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer dodged a basic factual question.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588679a02900002800dd147f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It should be an easy, empirical question: What is the current unemployment rate? But White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s answer ― or his refusal to answer ― is indicative of the Trump White House’s unwillingness to play by the same facts as everyone else.Donald Trump made clear throughout the presidential campaign that he didn’t accept the official unemployment rate as The Official Unemployment Rate, suggesting that it might be as high as 42 percent ― a number at odds with not only the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but just about every credible economist.So at Monday’s press conference, when NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson asked Spicer what the unemployment rate is right now, she was really asking whether Trump finally agrees with the government’s assessment and trying to find out by what measurement the American people could hold Trump accountable.Trump’s press secretary started off promisingly. “I mean, the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts it out,” Spicer said, seeming to indicate that the Trump White House would accept the current 4.7 percent as the true unemployment rate. But he quickly caught himself. When Liasson asked whether Trump and the White House now accept that the bureau’s numbers are accurate, Spicer began deflecting.“It’s not a question of what I accept,” he said. “I mean, there are ways that you can put out full unemployment.”By that, Spicer seemed to mean there are different ways of looking at unemployment data. You can accept the unemployment rate as it’s currently defined as the unemployment rate, or you can consider other metrics, such as the labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of the population that is either employed or unemployed but looking for work. (Some economists suggest that the unemployment rate is artificially low because it doesn’t count “discouraged workers” — people who have given up on looking for a job. But FiveThirtyEight’s analysis of the unemployment rate last year, which counted discouraged workers, found the “true” rate to be close to the official statistic.)Trump’s estimates varied wildly during the campaign, but he seems to think the labor force participation rate is a better metric.Spicer suggested the Trump White House would measure itself less against actual statistics and more against anecdotal evidence and the feeling among the American people that they could find work.“It’s not just a number to him,” Spicer said of the president. “It’s about ― it’s someone getting by. Are their wages going up? Can they get a better job?”He added that Trump was “not focused on statistics as much as he is whether or not the American people are doing better as a whole.”This was the same press briefing where Spicer said he thought people could “disagree with the facts” and doubled down on his insistence that Trump’s inauguration was the most watched of all time, despite the TV ratings and clear photographic evidence of the crowd size. The question isn’t just whether Trump’s White House will accept government statistics, however. It’s also about trying to hold the administration accountable over time, especially if the unemployment rate does rise. Had Spicer given a full endorsement of the 4.7 percent unemployment rate, it would be difficult for the administration to argue that Americans shouldn’t use that statistic.But although Spicer came close to accepting the official rate, he wiggled out of a real answer. Perhaps it’s a question worth asking again.Nick Baumann contributed to this report."

The conference, slated to take place in Atlanta from Feb. 14 to Feb. 16, was planned to explore the “translation of science to practice” in dealing with the health effects of global warming, according to a flier posted by the National Indian Health Board, a CDC partner for the event. The cancellation was first reported by E&E News, a news organization focusing on environment and energy. “It is canceled on those dates,” an employee at the nonprofit, which advocates for tribal health care, told HuffPost by phone on Monday. Another worker, who requested anonymity because she wasn’t authorized to speak to the press, said the CDC informed the group “the first or second week of January” that the event would be postponed indefinitely. She said the conference had been planned “for months and months.” The climate conference agenda may be folded into a second summit hosted by the American Public Health Association, another CDC partner on the canceled event, in November, the second employee added. An American Public Health Association spokesman did not return a call requesting comment. Other partners on the event included: Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the National Association of County and City Health Officials.Climate change became a core public health issue under former President Barack Obama. Increasing global temperatures are melting polar ice caps and raising sea levels, causing more drought, severe weather, flooding and vector-borne diseases. During Obama’s eight years in office, the CDC launched initiatives related to climate change in 16 states and two cities.“We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017, including the current continuing resolution, and potential overlap with an APHA conference on the same topic also being held later in 2017,” Bernadette Burden, a CDC spokeswoman, said in a statement emailed to HuffPost.The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment on the canceled conference.The cancellation came as little surprise to former CDC directors, who told E&E News the government health agency has a history of shying away from contentious political issues.“Sometimes the agency is subject to external political pressure; sometimes the agency self-censors or pre-emptively stays away from certain issues,” Howard Frumkin, former director of the CDC Center for Environmental Health and a professor at environmental health at the University of Washington’s School of Public Health, told E&E News. “Climate change has been that issue historically.”Study after study shows the planet has been rapidly warming as the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere skyrocketed from humans burning coal, oil and gas on an industrial scale. Separate analyses from two federal agencies released on Wednesday show that 2016 was the hottest year on record.“I’m concerned this is an act of self-sabotage on the part of the CDC,” Ed Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication, told E&E News. “The larger specter is that it will set the tone for self-silencing from the people at the top.”This article has been updated to include the CDC statement.

President Donald Trump has nominated Perdue to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58826954170000fa01fdfd21.jpeg?cache=qHhWTA2hhd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It appears to be a recurring theme among President Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees: climate skepticism. Former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue (R), whom Trump named Thursday as his nominee to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has continued that trend.Perdue, 70, is well known for leading a prayer for rain to end a drought in Georgia in 2007, but his record of adherence to questionable environmental science doesn’t stop there.In 2014, Perdue wrote an op-ed for the conservative-leaning National Review arguing that “some on the left or in the mainstream media explain every deviation in weather as a consequence of climate change.”“Climate change, we’re told, is responsible for heavy rains and drought alike,” Perdue wrote. “Whether temperatures are unseasonably low or high, global warming is the culprit. Snowstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes have been around since the beginning of time, but now they want us to accept that all of it is a result of climate change.”“It’s become a running joke among the public,” Perdue continued, “and liberals have lost all credibility when it comes to climate science because their arguments have become so ridiculous and so obviously disconnected from reality.”Perdue’s stance on climate change — which appears to be in line with Trump’s nominees to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Interior Department and Department of Energy — is important because the agriculture industry both contributes to the problem and bears the brunt of its consequences.About 9 percent of the nation’s total emissions can be directly linked to agriculture, according to the latest EPA figures. These emissions come from livestock, which produce methane, and soil management practices, such as the use of fertilizer and tillage, that emit nitrous oxide.Looking at the problem through an international lens, the problem is more significant. The World Resources Institute estimates that 13 percent of global emissions can be linked to farming, and that appears to be on the rise.Climate change is also presenting major challenges to farmers because of extreme weather events ― including increasing droughts, severe floods and heat waves ― that could cut crop and livestock yields.Under former President Barack Obama, outgoing Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack led the USDA to step up its efforts to fight climate change, building on department research that dates back to the 1990s, according to a Government Accountability Office report.In 2010, the department released a climate change science plan that called on all USDA agencies to create reports on climate-related risks, vulnerabilities and possible solutions. That work informed a 2014 climate change adaptation plan which detailed those strategies for climate resilience.It’s unclear whether that progress will continue under a USDA led by Perdue. His record as governor might indicate otherwise.In 2010, Perdue joined 19 other governors in signing a letter pushing back against the EPA’s efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.Perdue also pursued the expansion of industrial chicken farms during his time in office. By the time Perdue left office in 2011, the Peach State was home to more broiler chickens than any other state.Farm groups praised Perdue this week, perhaps none more enthusiastically than the American Farm Bureau Federation, agriculture’s most prominent industry organization. The Farm Bureau has expressed skepticism about climate science in the past while admitting that climate change is occurring.Environmentalists, who view Perdue as a predictably industry-friendly choice on the part of Trump, aren’t as excited.“Everything we know about Sonny Perdue shows he’s going to put the interests of big commercial farmers, farm lobbyists and farm chemical companies ahead of the interests of small farmers and public health,” Scott Faber, senior vice president of the Environmental Working Group, said Friday by phone.“There’s nothing in his record to suggest he will stand up for small family farmers and the environment when Big Ag is asking for the USDA to intervene on their behalf,” Faber added.Perdue, who is not related to the family that owns poultry producer Perdue Farms, grew up on a farm and was once a veterinarian. He entered politics in the 1980s, becoming governor in 2003.In more recent years, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes, he has run trucking, agriculture and logistics firms.“He has lots of government experience, lots of business experience and he knows something about agriculture,” Jaydee Hanson, senior policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, told The Huffington Post. “He’s just the kind of guy I figured Mr. Trump would appoint.”――Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Holliday, a 20-year-old junior at North Carolina State University, was leaving a friend’s house early on Sunday morning when he found his car in disarray. “There was a chocolate milk bottle by the right rear wheel,” Holliday told The Huffington Post. “There was an open bag of Cinnamon Toast Crunch on my rear windshield, there was an Afro pick on my rear windshield and on the roof of my car there was a box of Popeyes chicken with chicken still in it.”The incident occurred barely two days after President Donald Trump took the oath of office. That’s probably not a coincidence, Holliday said. Trump “campaigned on race and bigotry,” Holliday argued. “I don’t want to believe that this was racially motivated. I really hope that this is some stupid college kid making ignorant decisions. However, I really can’t ignore the fact that there was a box of chicken and an Afro pick placed on my car in a vandalizing manner … I hope this isn’t racist, but I don’t want to ignore the fact that it could be.”  Holliday filed an official report with the university’s police department. Holliday’s report is considered a “university information report,” said Maj. David Kelly, since there is no indication that a crime was committed (such as damaged property or assault). This allows NCSU to further investigate the incident and determine if it should be filed as a criminal report. The university’s Bias Incident and Response Team, which reviews incidents of bias and works with the reporting person to find a resolution, is also investigating. “There’s nothing that was left at the scene ― such as a note or any type of hate speech, any vandalism, any property damage … to indicate a nexus between the food left at the vehicle and any implications to Trump’s election or any other issues on campus,” Kelly said. “There’s nothing that leads us to believe anything at this time.” There have been no other complaints of this nature since the election, he said There were over 1,000 incidents of hate between Nov. 9 and Dec. 12, according to estimates from The Southern Poverty Law Center. At least 28 occurred in North Carolina and 34 percent of the crimes targeted African-Americans (The SPLC aggregates reports of hate ― many of which are anecdotal ― from news articles, social media and submissions via their #ReportHate intake page). Trump told his supporters to “stop it” with the racist attacks during his first post-election interview in November. Hate crimes often spike after elections ― domestic or international ― and the surge of Trump-related attacks that followed the election have tapered off. But, overall, hate crimes rose by 6 percent between 2014 and 2015, according to FBI statistics. Attacks against Muslims jumped by 67 percent, while African-Americans continued to be the most frequent victims of race-based hate crimes.If you or anyone you know have been the victim of a similar incident, please send an email to julia.craven@huffingtonpost.com and share your story.

32,POLITICS,WikiLeaks Issues Call For Trump's Secret Tax Returns,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-issues-call-for-trumps-secret-tax-returns_us_58853d3ae4b096b4a232a3b6,The controversial site is now apparently on the attack against the president.,2017-01-23,Donald Trump has walked back his pledge to release his tax returns.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58854bbf1c00002d00d9395d.jpeg?ops=crop_68_84_2608_1668%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"After leaking information only damaging to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats during the presidential campaign, WikiLeaks may finally be attempting to balance the scales with a Twitter plea asking for Donald Trump’s tax returns so they can be published on the site.But the request, apparently to hackers or any whistleblowers with access to the documents, unleashed a stream of criticism against the internet leak site, which was so inexplicably silent on Trump during his race to the presidency.The call to potential leakers was made after White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on TV Sunday that the president will not release his tax returns after all, despite Trump’s campaign pledge that he would do so. (She later walked back her statement.) Every president since Richard Nixon has routinely revealed his tax returns (or a summary, in Gerald Ford’s case). Tax information on Trump, who retains ownership of businesses around the world as president, is particularly critical to establish or settle conflict of interest concerns.“Trump Counselor Kellyanne Conway stated today that Trump will not release his tax returns. Send them to: https://wikileaks.org/#submit  so we can,” said the WikiLeaks tweet Sunday. WikiLeaks also said that Trump’s refusal to release the returns is even more “gratuitous” than “Clinton not releasing transcripts of a meeting with Goldman Sachs,” referring to paid speeches she made to executives of the powerful financial firm.A poll earlier this month by The Washington Post/ABC found that 74 percent of Americans — including 53 percent of Republicans — want to see Trump’s tax returns. Suddenly, so does WikiLeaks. But the request from the come-lately outlet triggered criticism over its apparent past bias. American intelligence has concluded that hackers working at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin to help get Trump elected provided the damaging leaks against the Democrats.New York Times editor Patrick LaForge quickly added his own tweet to the WikiLeaks request with a “better idea,” noting that the Times provides “ways to get in touch and share materials with our journalists confidentially.” Another journalist also suggested “any other news sites” that “aren’t playing for given outcomes.” Another reader responded to the WikiLeaks tweet: “You built this s*** bed, now lie in it.” Another said: “Wait, what? Is WikiLeaks beings unbiased? Tell me I’m not dreaming.”The WikiLeaks tweet, apparently urging a hack or leak, was similar to Trump’s controversial suggestion to Russia during his campaign, when he said he “hoped” that the country had “hacked” Clinton’s emails while she was secretary of state. “If they hacked, they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do,” Trump said at a July press conference. The comments drew a firestorm of criticism for the apparent encouragement of a foreign nation to commit a crime against an American citizen, and hack emails that likely included classified information. Trump later said he was being “sarcastic.”WikiLeaks posted thousands of hacked emails last year from the Democratic National Committee and from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied the emails were provided by Russian hackers under Putin’s thumb. Trump has supported Assange’s denials over findings by U.S. intelligence leaders, even though he called Assange’s previous publication of classified information from Chelsea Manning “disgraceful” and suggested there “should be like the death penalty or something” for the breach of information. Trump promised during his campaign that he would release his returns after an IRS audit was completed — though nothing about an audit prohibits him from making the information public.Conway said flatly in her interview on ABC’s “This Week” Sunday: “He’s not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn’t care.” Trump also said during his news conference earlier this month that Americans “don’t care at all” about the returns, and that only reporters do. Conway was responding to a question about a petition posted on the White House website ― signed by 228,000 people as of Sunday evening ― demanding that Trump immediately release his tax returns. The petition was posted shortly after the inauguration.Another leak site that has declared war on Trump is the hacker activist collective Anonymous, which has vowed to make the president “regret the next four years.”This article has been updated to reflect that Conway walked back her comments."
33,TASTE,Trump’s Inauguration Cake Was The Spitting Image Of Obama’s,Carly Ledbetter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-copied-inauguration-cake_us_58861df4e4b0e3a7356a4766,But the proceeds went to a great cause.,2017-01-23,"From the size of the layers and the colors of the frosting all the way down to the tiny little presidential seal decoration, every part of this cake was copied.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588624d61200002d00ad9376.jpeg?cache=JSE6EqX5JG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well if this just isn’t the icing on the cake. The cake presented at one of Donald Trump’s inaugural balls on Friday was an exact replica of Obama’s inauguration cake from four years ago, according to well-known pastry chef Duff Goldman. Goldman should know, as he’s the one who made Obama’s cake for the Commander in Chief’s Ball in 2013.Trump’s cake, presented at the Salute To Our Armed Services Ball, was made by another baker. Tiffany MacIsaac, owner of Washington’s Buttercream Bakeshop, told the Washington Post over the weekend that she was the one who made the cake for Trump’s ball. “They came to us a couple of weeks ago, which is pretty last minute, and said, ‘We have a photo that we would like to replicate,’ she said, without naming who specifically placed the order. Though she wanted to use the photo of the cake just for inspiration, MacIsaac told The Post her client disagreed. “They said, ‘Nope, they want this exact cake. It’s perfect.’ And we said, ‘Great.’” Funnily enough, MacIsaac also revealed that only the first layer of the “cake” is real, while the rest of it is made of Styrofoam. Duff’s cake, on the other hand, was nine layers of edible goodness.Buttercream Bakeshop also addressed the copycat controversy in a post on Instagram over the weekend. “Excited to share the cake we got to make for one of last night’s inaugural balls. While we most love creating original designs, when we are asked to replicate someone else’s work we are thrilled when it is a masterpiece like this one,” the post read. “@duff_goldman originally created this for Obama’s inauguration 4 years ago and this years committee commissioned us to re-create it.”The shop added that it is donating all of the profits from the cake to the Human Rights Campaign, writing, “Because basic human rights are something every man, woman and child~ straight, gay or the rainbow in between~ deserve!” It seems Goldman, the original master behind the cake, isn’t too upset about someone ripping off his creation. He even confirmed that cake decorators borrow from each other and it isn’t always that big of a deal in the pastry world:Oh well, at least it’s better than this horrifying cake of Trump’s face: "

Asked to contend with Spicer’s factually inaccurate claim, Conway wiggled her way out with an Orwellian turn of phrase.“You’re saying it’s a falsehood. And they’re giving ― Sean Spicer, our press secretary ― gave alternative facts,” she said.Conway’s startling claim, which flies in the face of what a fact is, as Merriam-Webster pointed out later that day, left many mouths agape due to its shamelessness. But its very concept is not new. George Orwell, author of the anti-authoritarian dystopian novel “1984,” wrote in his 1946 essay “Politics and the English Language” about the misuse of words by the powerful to distract citizens from objective truth: Political language — and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists — is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.But there is actually another, more recent quote that more accurately describes the underlying issue at hand with Conway’s “alternative facts” phrasing. And of all places, it appeared on the British sci-fi show “Doctor Who” exactly 40 years to the day before Conway’s appearance on “Meet the Press.”In “The Face of Evil: Part Four,” which premiered on Jan. 22, 1977, the Doctor tries to make peace between the Saveteem and Tesh tribes. In the middle of the episode, the Doctor tells his future companion Leela: You know, the very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common. They don’t alter their views to fit the facts. They alter the facts to fit the views.Of course, whether or not you think the quote summarizes the current political climate is a matter of opinion. That’s how opinions work. But the the facts are and will remain the facts. And here’s one fact for which there is no alternative: The audience on Friday was not the largest one to ever witness an inauguration, period.H/T Gizmodo"

(Here is more on the substance of Trump’s inaugural address.)The Trump administration has also been furious about a Time magazine reporter’s pool report that said the president had removed a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office and replaced it with one of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The reporter, however, repeatedly apologized for the error. Trump, Priebus’ new boss, spent years trying to convince the country that Obama wasn’t a legitimate president because he wasn’t born in the United States. It wasn’t until late in his campaign, in September, that Trump finally acknowledged Obama was indeed born in Hawaii. Last week, in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” Priebus tried to brush over Trump’s past when attacking Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) for saying he didn’t think Trump was the legitimate president because of Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.“You didn’t have Republicans questioning whether or not Obama legitimately beat John McCain in 2008,” Priebus claimed, adding, “I think it’s incredibly disappointing and I think it’s irresponsible for people like himself to question the legitimacy of the next United States president. I think putting the United States down across the world is not something that a responsible person does.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

They had never been to a political march before. But they felt a responsibility to go to this one.“I’m the oldest of three girls,” Ekram told The Huffington Post, standing along the National Mall in a sea of people waving signs advocating social justice issues and opposing President Donald Trump. “So I just came here because I have to lead by example for them that it’s important that we speak on the issues that matter to us. And sometimes we have to take action.”Yasmin said she wanted to go because “I wanted to hear what people had to say and I’m a feminist, so it means a lot to me.”For all the diversity of the crowds, Ekram and Yasmin stood out. Both are tiny, standing well under five feet tall. Both wore hijabs. And both are teenagers. Ekram, 18, is even shorter than her younger sister and has braces. Yasmin, 13, stood quietly by her big sister. But when they spoke, they were far beyond their years. They were clear about what is at stake for Muslim women and other minorities if they don’t engage in politics and stand up for their rights.“Donald Trump doesn’t scare me,” said Ekram, who starts college on Monday. “It’s that it’s 2017, and there are people with this very provisional mindset, that kind of scares me and worries me. But I’m not scared for me. I’m scared for my sisters. I feel like I can handle anything.”Yasmin, who is in eighth grade, said she’s not scared of Trump either and described what being a feminist means to her: “Women’s empowerment and the belief that women can do anything men can do. And can do it better.” Ekram chimed in, “I think everyone should be a feminist because women give life. If you’re not a feminist, you’re not supporting your mother. You’re not supporting yourself.”It was just the two of them together for the day, navigating the masses with their neon green posters that read “Girls Just Want To Have Fun-Damental Human Rights!” and “Women Can Do It All.” They’ve lived in D.C. since 2007, when their family moved from Ethiopia. Yasmin said she wished she was born in the United States so she could run for president.“Maybe Congress will change the law back, that you don’t have to be born here,” she said. “If Congress changes the law, then I’m going to run for president.”When HuffPost suggested she could run for Congress, Yasmin replied, “Yeah, but I want to be president.”“You know, a lot of presidents have a background in politics,” Ekram interjected.“Yeah...” said Yasmin, uninterested and trailing off. “I want to go to medical school and law school. Women can do it all.”Throughout Trump’s rise over the past year, and the ugly anti-Muslim rhetoric that’s come along with him, Ekram and Yasmin said they’ve gotten used to strangers coming up to them and offering words of support.“I guess there’s not a lot of Muslim people in the McDonalds’ community,” said Yasmin. “When I go to McDonalds, people are like, ‘Oh, keep doing what you’re doing! Don’t listen to Donald Trump!’ Or something.”There have been instances, though, of people treating them differently because of the way they look. When their family was at the airport recently getting ready to board a plane, Yasmin overheard one of their bag checkers say to another that they needed to thoroughly go through their family’s bags because “we don’t want any problems on the plane.”“I felt hurt,” she said. “I had my hijab on, and my mother doesn’t speak full English and didn’t understand what he was talking about.”But Yasmin ― who is, again, 13 ― decided this was one of those moments where speaking out mattered.“I went up to the lady [behind the desk] and I was like, ‘You guys need to stop discriminating against us as Muslims because that’s not fair. You wouldn’t do that to anybody else,’” she said. “I just left it at that.”Ekram shook her head and laughed with pride.“Yeah,” she said. “That’s my sister.”"

Women can do it all.”Throughout Trump’s rise over the past year, and the ugly anti-Muslim rhetoric that’s come along with him, Ekram and Yasmin said they’ve gotten used to strangers coming up to them and offering words of support.“I guess there’s not a lot of Muslim people in the McDonalds’ community,” said Yasmin. “When I go to McDonalds, people are like, ‘Oh, keep doing what you’re doing! Don’t listen to Donald Trump!’ Or something.”There have been instances, though, of people treating them differently because of the way they look. When their family was at the airport recently getting ready to board a plane, Yasmin overheard one of their bag checkers say to another that they needed to thoroughly go through their family’s bags because “we don’t want any problems on the plane.”“I felt hurt,” she said. “I had my hijab on, and my mother doesn’t speak full English and didn’t understand what he was talking about.”But Yasmin ― who is, again, 13 ― decided this was one of those moments where speaking out mattered.“I went up to the lady [behind the desk] and I was like, ‘You guys need to stop discriminating against us as Muslims because that’s not fair. You wouldn’t do that to anybody else,’” she said. “I just left it at that.”Ekram shook her head and laughed with pride.“Yeah,” she said. “That’s my sister.”"

How many millions is an open question.Two professors are hoping to answer it, and you can help by sending in verifiable evidence of crowd sizes in your town or city.Erica Chenoweth of the University of Denver and Jeremy Pressman of the University of Connecticut are overseeing the collection.

Chenoweth is @EricaChenoweth and Pressman is @djpressman on Twitter. You can also submit this Google Form. As of Sunday morning, they’ve counted at least 3 million people, but the number is surely to grow, because marches and rallies were held in an extraordinary number of small towns around the country, even in the deepest red territories. For instance, in Palmer, Alaska, a town of fewer than 6,000, more than 1,000 people marched, according to witnesses.

Mishra, the chief public relations officer at East Coast Railway, which has jurisdiction over the area where the derailment occurred.“Our first priority is to take care of the injured passengers and provide proper treatment by shifting them to hospitals. We are also searching all the coaches to ensure that nobody remains stranded in them.”The reason for the derailment has not been ascertained, Mishra said, adding that they were not ruling out the possibility of foul play and investigations will be conducted. The area in which the incident occurred is one where Maoist rebels typically operate.Video footage from the scene showed members of the disaster management team and locals trying to rescue trapped passengers from windows and debris using phones to provide light.“We will take strict action against whoever is behind this act,” said Indian railways minister Suresh Prabhu. “We won’t spare anyone responsible for this accident.”Nine bogies were derailed of which three fell off the track, said local Superintendent of Police L.K.V. Ranga Rao, adding that most of the casualties and deaths were from the three sleeper-class compartments.The track repair operations will go on through the night, East Coast Railway’s Mishra said, adding that he expects train service to be normalised by early Monday morning.India’s state railways, built during British colonial rule, have an appalling safety record after decades of underinvestment and a priority on keeping fares low for the 23 million passengers who use the network every day.In the last serious accident, 150 people died when a train derailed late last year in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. India recorded 27,581 railway deaths in 2014, the most recent year for which figures are available, with most victims falling from, or being struck by, moving trains.

They advised them to embrace with renewed vigor the movements for social democracy, peace and sustainability that existed long before Trump took power.“It’s not enough to simply say ‘No’ to these attacks,” best-selling author Naomi Klein told the crowd, referring to Trump’s hard-line policies. “It’s not enough because we know that where we are now, before the attacks come, is entirely unacceptable. The levels of inequality, the levels of racism ― and the planet chaos that we have unleashed. We need radical system change.”The event’s sponsors ― Jacobin magazine, Haymarket Books and Verso Books ― branded the event the “Anti-Inauguration.” In both substance and style, it stood in stark contrast to recent Democratic Party vehicles for self-assessment.The attendees, many of whom were in town to protest the inauguration, were in a raucous mood, applauding zingers, booing the names of Trump Cabinet members and calling out reactions to injustices, free-association style. It had the vibe of a call-and-response church revival or a sold-out rock concert, rather than a political theory lecture.Jeremy Scahill, founding editor of The Intercept, began his remarks with a stand-up-comedy-style anecdote about a chance encounter with conservative actor Jon Voight that slayed with the crowd.Noting that Trump’s election is part of a wave of far-right populism sweeping the developed world, British activist and author Owen Jones nailed a joke about Nigel Farage, the Brexit exponent, who is reportedly planning a move to the U.S.“I must apologize for the first major British export of the Trump era: Nigel Farage,” he deadpanned, drawing laughs and jeers. By contrast, a Wednesday night debate among contenders to chair the Democratic National Committee was a milquetoast affair in which hard truths took a backseat to platitudes and party-insider pandering. At a meeting of Democratic power-brokers in Aventura, Florida, the most contentious arguments were between those who think the party did nothing wrong in 2016 and those who think its crime was embracing populism. Those at the Anti-Inauguration more than made up for the lack of self-criticism at the Democratic-centered events this week. They were unsparing in their indictment of Democrats, with whom they have only ever fitfully gotten along to begin with. Trump “won within a very rigged system. And even within that very rigged system, he didn’t actually win it, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party lost it,” Klein said.Members of the radical left enter the post-election debate in a position of strategic superiority. Their favored candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lost in the primary to the more pro-business Hillary Clinton. That Clinton ― weighed down by focus-tested policy positions and deep ties to Wall Street ― went on to lose to the most openly sexist and racist presidential candidate in recent U.S. history has only vindicated their conviction that Democrats should be taking cues from them, not the other way around.Spurn hard-core progressives again and you’ll lose them for good, Klein warned.“The Democratic Party needs to either be decisively wrestled from pro-corporate neoliberals or it needs to be abandoned,” she said, drawing sustained cheers and applause. But the evening’s speakers went beyond the “Bernie would have won” arguments raging on social media.They made clear that they were not interested in staying within the bounds of the debate, as Sanders ― or any other figure in the two-party system ― defined them.In fact, author Anand Gopal and Scahill used their respective speaking slots to critique the United States’ foreign interventionism and civil liberties policies in terms that made Sanders sound downright hawkish by comparison.And while Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an assistant professor of African-American studies at Princeton, praised Sanders for a campaign that “asked for more,” she argued that the Vermont senator’s “commitment to remaining in the Democratic Party ... threatens to neuter his political revolution.” Taylor called for the creation of multiracial, democratic political organizations outside the two-party system.Scahill suggested that antiwar protesters’ incessant disruption of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s public appearances, which many credit for his decision not to run for re-election, are an appropriate model for Trump-era resistance.Mainstream liberals uncomfortable with the ideas discussed at the Anti-Inauguration event might have appreciated the blunt humor and communal joy in the room that night.Some of their Jacobin-reading peers’ statements may have even resonated with them, including a rejection of the idea that fighting for racial justice and economic equality are somehow at odds with one another. Klein made clear that there is no time for those internecine disputes.“Our task is to find … the common thread that connects our movements. That means, first and foremost, dropping this nonsense of pitting class against so-called identity politics and economic justice” or other progressive priorities, Klein said.“This ‘my issue trumps your issue’ helps one thing ― and that is Trump,” she concluded.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

It had the vibe of a call-and-response church revival or a sold-out rock concert, rather than a political theory lecture.Jeremy Scahill, founding editor of The Intercept, began his remarks with a stand-up-comedy-style anecdote about a chance encounter with conservative actor Jon Voight that slayed with the crowd.Noting that Trump’s election is part of a wave of far-right populism sweeping the developed world, British activist and author Owen Jones nailed a joke about Nigel Farage, the Brexit exponent, who is reportedly planning a move to the U.S.“I must apologize for the first major British export of the Trump era: Nigel Farage,” he deadpanned, drawing laughs and jeers. By contrast, a Wednesday night debate among contenders to chair the Democratic National Committee was a milquetoast affair in which hard truths took a backseat to platitudes and party-insider pandering. At a meeting of Democratic power-brokers in Aventura, Florida, the most contentious arguments were between those who think the party did nothing wrong in 2016 and those who think its crime was embracing populism. Those at the Anti-Inauguration more than made up for the lack of self-criticism at the Democratic-centered events this week. They were unsparing in their indictment of Democrats, with whom they have only ever fitfully gotten along to begin with. Trump “won within a very rigged system. And even within that very rigged system, he didn’t actually win it, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party lost it,” Klein said.Members of the radical left enter the post-election debate in a position of strategic superiority. Their favored candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) lost in the primary to the more pro-business Hillary Clinton. That Clinton ― weighed down by focus-tested policy positions and deep ties to Wall Street ― went on to lose to the most openly sexist and racist presidential candidate in recent U.S. history has only vindicated their conviction that Democrats should be taking cues from them, not the other way around.Spurn hard-core progressives again and you’ll lose them for good, Klein warned.“The Democratic Party needs to either be decisively wrestled from pro-corporate neoliberals or it needs to be abandoned,” she said, drawing sustained cheers and applause. But the evening’s speakers went beyond the “Bernie would have won” arguments raging on social media.They made clear that they were not interested in staying within the bounds of the debate, as Sanders ― or any other figure in the two-party system ― defined them.In fact, author Anand Gopal and Scahill used their respective speaking slots to critique the United States’ foreign interventionism and civil liberties policies in terms that made Sanders sound downright hawkish by comparison.And while Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an assistant professor of African-American studies at Princeton, praised Sanders for a campaign that “asked for more,” she argued that the Vermont senator’s “commitment to remaining in the Democratic Party ... threatens to neuter his political revolution.” Taylor called for the creation of multiracial, democratic political organizations outside the two-party system.Scahill suggested that antiwar protesters’ incessant disruption of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s public appearances, which many credit for his decision not to run for re-election, are an appropriate model for Trump-era resistance.Mainstream liberals uncomfortable with the ideas discussed at the Anti-Inauguration event might have appreciated the blunt humor and communal joy in the room that night.Some of their Jacobin-reading peers’ statements may have even resonated with them, including a rejection of the idea that fighting for racial justice and economic equality are somehow at odds with one another. Klein made clear that there is no time for those internecine disputes.“Our task is to find … the common thread that connects our movements. That means, first and foremost, dropping this nonsense of pitting class against so-called identity politics and economic justice” or other progressive priorities, Klein said.“This ‘my issue trumps your issue’ helps one thing ― and that is Trump,” she concluded.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Sunday he found one part of Donald Trump’s inauguration speech to be at least unintentionally funny ― Trump’s criticism of Washington’s elite. On “Face the Nation,” host John Dickerson suggested that maybe Sanders could find some common ground with Trump’s anti-establishment rhetoric. The senator quickly put that notion to rest. “Well, I found it somewhat amusing that Mr. Trump, President Trump, was punching the establishment, but right behind him, John, sitting in the VIP section, were billionaire after billionaire after billionaire, some of the most powerful people in this country, who over the last 10, 20 years have become much, much richer while the middle class has shrunk,” Sanders said. Trump’s potential Cabinet is filled with billionaires, as he has nominated several Wall Street, Washington and oil industry insiders. CBS News reported that his Cabinet has a combined net worth of more than $14 billion. The Intercept noted that at least a dozen seats at the inauguration had been given to elite donors. “I find it somewhat amusing that you’re attacking the establishment when the establishment is sitting right behind you and when billionaires and large corporations are funding many of your inaugural events,” Sanders said Sunday.“Now if Mr. Trump is serious about standing up for working families,” he continued, “then he’s not going to throw 20 million working people off of health insurance, he’s not going to cut Medicare and Medicaid.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

50,BLACK VOICES,An Open Letter On Behalf Of Undocumented Immigrants,"Stephen Balkaran , ContributorInstructor of Political Science",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/an-open-letter-on-behalf-of-undocumented-immigrants_us_5885210de4b08f5134b6222e,Why comprehensive immigration reform matters to us all.,2017-01-22,A U.S. flag hangs in the grand hall of the Ellis Island immigration museum building in New York.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58862aef1c00002d00d93b65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While on a recent trip to the Ellis Island museum, I had an opportunity to reflect on the 12 million immigrants that shaped and continue to define this great nation we call America. I am always disappointed when critics pose the dueling question why comprehensive immigration reform matters? Seldom do I argue with such critics, but given the inter-relatedness of immigration and our nation, I do feel compelled to inform the masses about the sad history with regard to the treatment of immigrants. The national dilemma of securing our borders has been one of our fundamental policies during the last 20 years, not only for our national security interest, the war on terror, but also reducing the inflow of immigrants who we often deem “illegals” or “undocumented.” The conclusion of the 44th and the commencement of the 45th presidency have again left a nation of immigrants scrambling to come to terms with comprehensive immigration reform and its ramifications. The American values and rich tradition in welcoming immigrants has been tested as our democracy now seeks to come to common ground on this ever important, but controversial public policy. Yet, this debate has taken away the best of who we are and what we can become as a society.Comprehensive immigration reform has implications for America’s future that most of us cannot foresee—socially, culturally, and economically. The status of some 12 million undocumented immigrants, who have already shaped and defined a new American landscape, remains in limbo as our politicians try to reach a compromise on how we address immigration reform. The question remains: how do we address this issue without accumulating the backlash from human rights activists, American citizens, politicians and more so can congress passing legislation in a constitutional and humane manner? There hasn’t been a time in our country’s great history that a debate on immigration divided the nation as it has recently done, leaving us searching for an American identity as to who we are and what we stand for as a nation of immigrants. This debate has left the United States of America divided along racial, ethnic, political lines never seen before and has touched the conscious of a healing and battered nation. Not only has the debate gone beyond the boundaries of our socio-economic-political spectrum but the lack of humanism becomes pertinent and indicative of our reform immigration policy. The debate has become such a divisive issue that policy-making and our political process went hand in hand in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections.As history reminds us, undocumented immigrants have become the most convenient scapegoat for America’s social problems, thus anti-immigrant rhetoric has become prevalent and a norm throughout our political spectrum. Center to the immigration debate revolves around amnesty that serves as a pathway to citizenship for the 12 million human beings, who are often referred to as “illegals” or “undocumented immigrants.” Yet, despite this abrasive terminology, no human being is illegal. The issue of comprehensive immigration reform has become the focal point of all immigrants and Americans alike, but none more important than America’s flourishing Hispanic population and their socio-economic-political importance. The “Browning of America” and the continuing reshaping of America by Hispanics continue to define who we are and enhance the best of what we can become as a nation of immigrants.The comprehensive immigration reform debate goes far beyond the typical immigration debates on the loss of jobs, drain on our social system, criminals etc., it has now vested in “Building a Wall.” The economic, political, and social clout of current immigrants is far more beneficial to the nation than our media, immigration critics, and politicians point them out to be. Whatever the debates are, our American values, tradition of welcoming immigrants, and our Americanism will be tested on how we approach and legislate the new comprehensive immigration reform laws. This complicated but imperative public policy must be achieved by the new presidential administration for a number of reasons. It is imperative that this legislation must be also done in a humanistic, sensitive, and compelling way that make us American with our true values of embracing diversity and inclusion of all. Embodied in this reform legislation, one must be cautious, compassionate, and not forget the watchwords of our immigrant history and our nation; “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”First and foremost, comprehensive immigration reform must be done in a humanistic way that makes us a nation that still champions human rights and diversity. As the leader democratic free world, history reminds us of our vast atrocities of human rights violations; Slavery, Trail of Tears, Mexican Repatriation Act, and last but definitely not least, Japanese Internment. Hence, can we conclude, is American history doomed to repeat itself? Human rights becomes the center of the debates, how do we address families who have lived here undocumented for decades, their children who grew up in American communities, who have established friends, loyalty, and community relationships? This legislation must be done in a humanistic way that takes precedent over our recent abrasive political rhetoric emanating mostly from frustrated Americans. We must be cautious and vigilant on how we plan to address America’s greatest resource―immigrants; it must be done with an approach filled with love and compassion. The breaking up and removal of families who have solidified their roots here is un-American, un-constitutional, and it is not what we stand for as a country that professes tolerance, diversity and acceptance.As we delve into the deep waters of American patriotism, the cultural backlash that takes credence is founded on the philosophy that many of the undocumented immigrants are un-patriotic towards America’s culture and refused to be American. Hence, one would question what is or not to be American, is there a threshold to gauge our Americanism? This debate has not only generated dialogue about the continued role that Americanism plays in our society, but has also posed the question of whether undocumented immigrants are truly committed to the “Land of the free and the home of the brave.”  The issue should NOT be whether undocumented immigrants are loyal to America, that question was answered when undocumented men and women signed up and served in America’s military. Fighting to protect and promote democracy throughout the world for a country that has remained uncommitted to them. It must be noted that some 38,000 military officials serving in both Iraq and Afghanistan wars were not American citizens. In fact, history has forgotten that Lance. Cpl. Jose Gutierrez became one of the first casualties in Iraq; yes, he did come to America illegally and died serving America’s cause. Hence, the question is not whether undocumented immigrants are loyal to America, but whether America has lived up to its rich tradition of welcoming immigrants in a fair and impartial way.Secondly, the debate has turned to the economic impact of these undocumented immigrants on American society. These economic arguments have been debunked by many economic pundits on the grounds that undocumented immigrants do not undercut wages, nor are they a drain on social services, and the fact they don’t take jobs that would otherwise go to Americans. The majority of undocumented immigrants are unskilled and thus never pose any economic threat for skilled jobs that are secured by legal residents or American citizens. In fact, economists have stated that undocumented workers actually compliment the economy and it’s the driving force behind our nation’s economic growth and prosperity.An interesting report released by the Social Security Administration in 2013, Stephen Goss, Chief Actuary for the Office, claimed that undocumented workers contribute about $15 billion a year to Social Security through payroll taxes. On the flip side, Goss also commented that these undocumented immigrants only receive about $1 billion since many of them are not eligible to receive benefits that they paid into. What is more astonishing, Goss noted in an interview for the New York Times, articulated that undocumented immigrants have contributed up to $300 billion, or nearly 10 percent, of the $2.7 trillion of the nation’s Social Security Trust Fund. In other words, their economic contribution and benefits to society far outreach many of the criticism undocumented immigrants face. The need to reach a humane solution on this immigration nightmare will ultimately benefit all, Americans alike. Hence, there is a need to create a legal path to 12 million residents enabling them to come out of the shadows of despair and allow them to continue contributing to the American economic pie in a fair and just way that’s benefits all.Thirdly, the Immigration debate has now generated so many divisions in our society that it has become the “Civil rights debate of 21st century”; never in American history has immigration become such a decisive issue where policymaking and the electoral process goes hand in hand. Whatever the arguments are, many Americans have suffered from amnesia; they have forgotten their commitment to the watch words of this great nation “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” All immigrants who graced our country have played and will continue to play an important role in our country’s rich diverse culture; they make us who we are and the sole reason why America is America. Yet we still forget about this contribution many immigrant groups to this great country, despite this success many other immigrant groups some listed below, many of them have failed to step up to support our Hispanic brothers and sisters with the recent immigration debate. What differentiates Hispanics from other previous immigrant groups is their economic, social and political power.Last and by no means least, center to argument is the breaking and outright disregard of American laws by undocumented immigrants, after all we are a nation of laws. I do concur with all Americans that our laws are to be respected, acknowledged, and obeyed by all. As American patriot, Reverend, and Civil Rights Activist Dr. Martin L. King, Jr. noted that there are two types of laws: just laws and unjust laws. Dr. King further elaborated one has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws, “but conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.” I must remind the American masses that slavery, racism, removal of Native Americans from their land, and Jim Crow segregation in American society was LEGAL, and Dr. King, his non-violence movement for Civil Rights, the Abolitionist movement in Southern states were considered ILLEGAL in the eyes of the law. Seldom do I ever pause and critique our legal process, but Americans openly voiced their disgust on undocumented immigrants’ willingness to break our laws. Yet we refused to critique unjust laws and customs that haunt our national history. It becomes paradoxical in our society when many of our laws that has perpetuated many of our ignorance and hatred towards others are obeyed and respected throughout our history. When we openly advocate obeying and dis-obeying laws that are there to maintain law, order, and stability but at the same time fail to question the validity of those laws, we ultimately become immune to the hatred we create.As long as we have double standards in our society, as long as our President Donald J. Trump and other billionaires insisted that they avoided paying taxes by merely exploiting tax loopholes-legally, our legal integrity and our laws must be examined. As long as there is criticism on undocumented immigrants for not paying their fair share of taxes but at the same time Americans remain silent as our President and other billionaires’ failure to pay federal taxes, hence, we have the right to question the integrity of our laws.America is only as great as the doors and opportunities we open to others, comprehensive immigration reform matters because America matters, our nation’s trajectory is at stake. Immigration and America go hand in hand and without each other, there can be no true immigrant nation. Success in America is not determined by our ethnic background or our native language but our commitment and dedication that is so much part of our past and present immigrants. American history will remind us that oppression takes away the best of who we are and what we can become as a nation. America’s passion of including all that choose to come here has been to cornerstone of our history, democracy, and constitutionalism. Without this inclusiveness of all ethnic groups, the American Dream would not be possible.Stephen Balkaran is an Instructor in the Department of Philosophy at Central CT State University."

That was amazing, wasn’t it? I have not felt so full and fired up in a while. And judging from the internet, that’s true for so many of us white women. We got some joy, and we needed it! (Of course: many people who are not white women marched, and organized, and contributed from home; who I am addressing here is white women who marched, like me, all over this country.)Here’s some more truth:The first time I saw this it was captioned by Gabrielle Perry as, “I have NEVER seen Black feminism and White feminism so effortlessly displayed in one photograph.”Our joyful march experience lives in a context: one in which we are a demographic which voted for Trump at 53%. One in which what we have called “feminism” has been experienced as exclusionary by women of color since the beginning. Not just “not deliberately inclusive.” Exclusionary, silencing, dismissive, refusing to recognize that our collective liberation is inseparable. As Flavia Dzodan writes, and everyone steals, “My feminism will be intersectional, or it will be bullshit.”We have been asked to stop this bullshit since the beginning, also. Harriet Jacobs starts her 1861 “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl” with this exhortation to Northern white women (Jacobs was from North Carolina but had no use for North Carolinian white women by this point): “Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech. Isaiah xxxii. 9.”So right now, when we are at a new point of possibility for doing better, and being worthy partners of the women of color who have done this work forever, here’s one way to think about how.1. Start Where We AreOne perfect tweet from Eve Ewing during yesterday’s March: “If you identify as a feminist but have never read Audre Lorde, bell hooks, Patricia Hill Collins or Kimberlé Crenshaw, make it a 2017 goal.” You don’t have to feel guilty about not having read the work of these women. It actually doesn’t matter how you feel at all! Just get started. In my experience, knowing a bit about them doesn’t count. We are taught such terrible lies by our culture of white supremacy that we can’t unlearn them passively. We need to get the voices of these women in our heads, so we can learn to discern what patriarchal, white-supremacist bullshit lives in us, and fight it. Melissa Harris-Perry has given the world the gift of “The Black Feminism Syllabus.”2. Don’t Stop ThereThe writers Ewing mentions and on MHP’s syllabus wrote at varying times; these are largely “get yourself grounded in the history of this struggle” resources. After that or simultaneously, give yourself the gift of learning what intersectional feminist genius is happening now. Once you start you won’t be able to stop, and you’ll find your own sources, but here are a few thinkers and writers you might check out (I freely admit these just happen to be people whose work I love): Roxane Gay, Luvvie, Saeed Jones, Linda Sarsour. Get Everyday Feminism’s weekly digest emailed to you. If Twitter unnerves you, you could keep it to just the four people listed (and @nowhitenonsense) and your life will still change for the better.3. Get Out Of Your HouseTotally the hardest one, but we gotta. Here’s a thing about white supremacy: it teaches us that we better not do things unless we can be perfect at them. It also teaches us that “self-made” men and women are a thing — that we are responsible to and for only ourselves and maybe our families. This is like a comforting blanket we can snuggle up in and be reassured that we don’t have to go somewhere we don’t know anyone, where people might wonder what the white lady is up to, where we won’t know what to do or if we are welcome. But we are also a culture that likes DOING things, so we are all asking each other “What can I DO?” This is a start to leaving the house/the internet, but the problem there is the “I.” White supremacy teaches us that proper self-made people fix it all ourselves—lead a march! start a new non-profit!—or honestly, why bother. So, the good news is: that’s more bullshit! What if we asked instead “What are we doing?” and by “we” we meant the people where we live? If you can find a place to go out to eat on Yelp, you can find the people doing the things where you live. Good places to start looking: local SURJ group (you may not want to join, but you will inevitably discover what else is happening in town, and they will be in accountable relationship to organizations led by people of color); give the Movement for Black Lives your phone number to get texted updates, including about what’s near you; and obviously you know better than me where to look where you live. Sometimes the Unitarians are a good bet! And the Women’s March people are as on top of this as they can be, for a national-level thing: they’ve got 10 actions for you to do in the first 100 days.But really, remember what it felt like to be with people at the march, rather than at home reading another list about what to do, and just go to something somewhere, calmly knowing it won’t be the exact perfect thing and you won’t be the perfect contributor, because neither exist.And of course, remember this joy we feel now! We will need it in the time to come! Let it lead us into deeper solidarity, rather than back to wherever we started, before our first marched step on Saturday morning."
52,POLITICS,A Handy Dandy Guide To The Ethics And Etiquette Of Nazi-Punching,"Michael Darer, ContributorStudent, Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-handy-dandy-guide-to-the-ethics-and-ettiquette-of_us_58854238e4b0111ea60b97c1,"On Friday, during protests against Donald Trump’s inauguration, “alt-right” founder and actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer",2017-01-22,<p>Nazi-punching is deeply embedded in the American fabric. It’s also just a great thing to do.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/588542911c00002500d9394c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday, during protests against Donald Trump’s inauguration, “alt-right” founder and actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer was punched in the face. At the time, a reporter had stopped him on the sidewalk for an impromptu interview about the ins and outs of turning a frog racist and exactly what stripe of monstrousness he most identifies with, so we now have the moment on camera. It’s pretty glorious: a balletic and visceral symphony comprised of the timeless duo of fist and face.But, as the New York Times pointed out, not everyone is thrilled by the idea of an actual-literal-Nazi being fed an all-American knuckle sandwich. Apparently, Nazi-punching has become controversial now (damn all that PC-ness, am I right, you guys?), and so we must wade into the moral thicket of whether or not you can ― in good conscience ― beat up someone, who identifies with one of the most thoroughly despised political ideologies in human history.It’s going to be a weird year.Now for those few of you who are morally opposed to bad stuff happening to bad people, I can assure you that actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer is alright. He posted a video via Periscope saying as much. He also made sure to note that he was broadcasting from a “safe space,” which is—frankly—delicious.If we are to seriously address the ethics of Nazi-punching, we must address and understand the reasons why one might say that Nazi-punching is wrong or bad. For many this might be confusing, especially since so much of the outrage has come from the movement that begged for the opportunity to make America great again, and Hollywood, historians, and video game developers all seem to agree that America reached peak greatness about 70 years ago, when this nation threw itself full-throttle into the business of absolutely wrecking Nazis. It’s perhaps even more confusing to hear someone describe Nazi-punching as un-American when the literal personification of America was introduced to the world socking it to Hitler, who scholars agree is probably the Naziest Nazi that ever Nazi’d.Still, there are numerous reasons why one might decide that actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer getting punched is the hill they want to die on this weekend. Perhaps this person has never read a book or seen a movie or played a video game, and is, thus, completely unaware of what a Nazi is; and they decided to enter this debate without educating themselves on the matter at all. Perhaps they are a Nazi themselves, or are worried that once it becomes a-OK to punch white people who hold historically problematic views responsible for inflicting tangible harm on vulnerable Americans over the course of centuries they might find themselves on the punching-block (or whatever it would be called). There’s also a chance that this person is a self-righteous asshole who likes to talk about violence having no place in political discourse despite never having spoken this aggressively against the state-sanctioned and perpetrated violence against people of color, enabled and encouraged by white supremacy, since this before this nation’s founding.These are all of the reasons I can think of.Regardless of which of these things motivates you to speak in defense of the physical safety of people who identify with a political ideology that was most famously led by a man who nearly everyone agrees is the personification of pure evil, I would like to convince you that sometimes it’s actually okay to throw hands with actual-literal-Nazis.“How could this be?” you ask, dropping your binder full of quotes about non-violence from Martin Luther King Jr and Mahatma Gandhi (all completely free of historical or biographical context, of course). Well, I will tell you how this can be!First off, there are unfortunately some political ideologies that do not respond to discourse, especially when the people who are discoursing are people that this ideology wants to murder en masse. One of the handy things about being part of a political movement that is responsible for the most famous genocide in history is that, you develop a sort of thick skin when it comes to people saying your views are bad. You know what they say: once you systematically murder nearly eight million people, you tend to ignore people saying that your ideas are problematic. In the case of actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer, I am well aware he did not help out with the Holocaust. Nor am I saying that he is actually-literally Hitler. I am simply saying that actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer and actual-literal-führer-Adolf-Hitler would probably have been kinda tight. And I’m saying that’s a really really bad thing. That ideologies like Spencer’s are often insulated from “rational” debate is only emphasized by the fact that he was punched by a member of Black Bloc, an antifa operation that specializes in aggressively confronting the sort of political ideologies that don’t respond to more conventional modes of protest.Secondly, I would submit that if you see a video of an actual-literal-Nazi calmly trying to spread his Nazi ideology and your first thought is “wow I really hope no one punches that Nazi in the face because ooh-boy would I have some choice tweets for them” as opposed to “holy shit why is there a literal fucking Nazi normalizing his Nazi-ness to a reporter; it is motherfucking 2017” then your thoughts are stupid and you should not share them. The fact that the conversation about Nazi-punching is currently about when it’s okay and not why there are still any famous Nazis left to punch is kind of troubling, if not downright disturbing. So, as much as you might think this is the time to be holier-than-thou about your thoughts on the intersection of politics and violence, it’s unlikely that the people who actual-literal-Nazi-Richard-Spencer’s views most affect really care what you think.Thirdly, both Indiana Jones and Captain America seem pretty alright with Nazi-punching. Both are actually quite good at it. The fact that movies and video games seem to unilaterally agree that Nazis are pretty swell villains probably gives you a hint as to what kind of people Nazis are. Plus, all the best Nazi-punchers tend to be quite attractive! Would you like to be movie-star-attractive too? I thought so.So, in summary, if you are faced with the opportunity to punch a Nazi (or even someone Nazi-adjacent), I would suggest the following. First, observe the Nazi (or Nazi-adjacent person) and figure out whether they are a Nazi (or are Nazi-adjacent). In the past this was slightly more difficult because following that whole Holocaust thing the world came to something of a consensus on Nazis and decided they were bad. So, for a while, a lot of Nazis had to Nazi in secret. Now, however, Nazis are really having a coming out of sorts. In the wake of Trump’s election you can now spot them on the sidewalk, being politely asked what their favorite type of ethnic cleansing is and who exactly it is that they’re wearing to the rally tonight. Once you have ascertained that this Nazi is indeed a Nazi (or Nazi-adjacent), ask yourself how you feel about Nazis. Hopefully you will realize that you’re not okay with Nazis, in which case feed that motherfucker his teeth. If you realize that you’re actually kind of okay with Nazis, then your approach is going to have to be slightly different.In this case, approach the strongest-looking person you can find, and say, “hello!

Today women, men, and children gathered in cities around the world by the hundreds of thousands to stand up for the rights of women, immigrants, Muslims, workers, and LGBT Americans. They did so in a constitutionally supported manner that has been enacted throughout history regardless of political affiliation (remember the Tea Party Protests of 2009.)For my fellow women who feel the need to stand up in opposition to this march because you have never felt as though you don’t have control over your own body or because you have not been disrespected or undermined because you are a woman, please remember that just because you have not had these experiences, it does not exclude others from having had these experiences. Perhaps you feel as though you can make your own choices, be heard, vote, work if you want, control your own body, defend your own body, and that no one is stopping you. In truth, I share that privilege. But, I also recognize that this is not the case for all people. And, I recognize how our laws affect our citizens.So today, women marched for women in states that have slashed their women’s health care budgets leading to a rise in pregnancy related deaths. They marched for low-income women who have been especially hard hit by this due to a loss of affordable birth control. They marched to stand up for equal healthcare rights including guaranteed access to preventive care and protection from gender discrimination in healthcare currently protected under the Affordable Care Act that is very near repeal.They marched for the women who fall victim to voter suppression efforts such as Voter ID laws that our current administration supports that disproportionately exclude minorities, young people, low-income voters, seniors, and women.They marched for the 1 in 5 women that have been victims of campus sexual assault so that college campuses follow their obligation under Title IX to investigate and respond to allegations of sexual assault regardless of whether a police report has been made because less than 10 percent of cases reported to police result in criminal charges against the perpetrator. They marched for the victims of sexual assault that are now told to give their self-proclaimed pussy-grabbing president a chance.And, those are just a few examples.Today was not about throwing tantrums, whining, avoiding responsibility, shouting profanities or bashing men. And, before you speak to me about the injustices of women around the world, know that women marched for them as well. They marched for their entrance into this country as they flee the countries where they have unequal rights, while our current America First administration stands in their way. They marched for the women who are under the threat of deportation under our current administration and would be subsequently ripped from their children.Today was not about not getting our way, shirking responsibility, or throwing a tantrum. Today was not about being sore losers because these should not be partisan issues and these issues didn’t just stop being issues after November 8th. Today was about solidarity, justice, and freedom. Today was about holding our government accountable for its promise to serve and protect all of its people. Today was not a tantrum."
54,POLITICS,A New Year's Resolution For The Republic: Make Average Citizens' Opinions Matter Again,"Talmon Joseph Smith, ContributorNYU Arthur L.

And while not as sexy as espionage, or as sensational as interagency intrigue, post-mortem analysis of the presidential election could be more focused on the question of how the American political landscape reached a point where Trump even had a chance; how more than 60 million people could have chosen a candidate so overtly offensive, and hostile to values once held to be mainstream; how the 115th Congress could have policy priorities that run so counter to those of the general public.Many of us, as is tradition, have made New Year’s resolutions of self-improvement. The occasion also presents a chance to pursue a full-scale reappraisal of American civics. This election cycle illustrated a hollowed-out politics; a profound failure of our political system to engage people as citizens. Driving that failure is the corrosive impact of money on politics. Trump did not win because he outspent Clinton — the reverse may have been true — but he flourished, no matter how speciously, in a system that runs on dollars, not citizenship.In September 2015, Gallup found historic majorities agreed most members of Congress are “out of touch with average Americans” (79 percent), “focused on the needs of special interests” (69 percent) and “corrupt” (52 percent).Their suspicions are given some credence by a 2014 Princeton-Northwestern study, which revealed a lack of statistically significant, independent correlation between public opinion and enacted law.It concludes “when a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the U.S. political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it.”In 2014, a Princeton-Northwestern study was published which revealed a lack of statistically significant, independent correlation between public opinion and enacted law. “Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens” concludes “when a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose. Moreover, because of the strong status quo bias built into the U.S. political system, even when fairly large majorities of Americans favor policy change, they generally do not get it.”The dynamic isn’t new. The study’s sample data range was 1981 to 2002. And while there’s a spirited discourse about the authors’ methodology and how much weight should be given to their findings, the evidence of a dissonance between the agenda of Washington and the preferences of the electorate are not hard to find.Look no further than the tax cut fervor of GOP officials versus the majority of Republican voters, who favor hiking tax rates on incomes above $250,000. Or the cuts to the social safety net embedded in the ill-fated 2011 Grand Bargain crafted by the Obama administration and House Republican leadership versus overwhelming support at the time for fully maintaining those benefits.Gun safety, oil subsidies, corporate tax loopholes, the imbalance between bank bailouts and mortgage relief for homeowners, and so on — the distance between the desires of the people and the actions of their government abound.The way a political system is funded and the concentration of such funding seems to affect the way that system operates and to whom it is most responsive. In 2014, 0.12 percent of the population gave over $200 to political campaigns. These donors’ views are substantially divergent from those of the public.But at least as important is the way the money is spent. It buys a form of politics dominated by data-driven PR and messaging instead of ordinary people and their passions.People support democracies when they belong to organizations that give them voice, that offer them (or people like them) opportunities for leadership, that hold themselves accountable to the members. One traditional form of such organization was the political party when it depended on grassroots volunteers and local leaders.Although the parties of old tended toward corruption and bias, they also gave millions of local activists a stake, and they brought diverse people together at the national level. It was, for instance, at the national party convention that Montana ranchers and Brooklyn union leaders had to meet and talk.The parties now do very little of this. Politics is a competition among entrepreneurial candidates who raise money from wealthy donors and spend it on data and messaging. The Koch brothers’ political network, for instance, employs 3.5 times as many people as the Republican National Committee does. And small donor-based Sanders-like campaigns, while notable in their broader reach, are aberrations — the exception, not the rule.Parties and volunteer-driven campaigns used to contact people. They always sought to get votes, but in doing so they initiated front-porch conversations that gave citizens a genuine chance to speak back. Now big data, fueled by money, allows candidates to target finely honed persuasive messages to a very small proportion of voters. As of October 2016, 70 percent of Millennials (ages 18-34) did not recall being contacted by any party or campaign about the election.Yahoo’s Matt Bai reflected after the election that “Clinton’s campaign was effectively nothing but a giant turnout operation, crunching data on reliable Democratic voters while simultaneously keeping the candidate herself from saying anything remotely interesting.” For its part, The Obama administration, part of the top-down, nationally focused Democratic Party system, was unable to operationalize his electoral coalition into a year-round political movement.This and other features of hollowed-out politics delivered, at most, lukewarm results. Unresponsive systems that privilege elites are an annoyance when things are generally going well. They cause outrage — as Clinton learned — when things have been going badly.Many were aghast at last summer’s RNC, accusing the convention of straying from American values. Headlines hissed at Trump’s “dark” portrayal of American society. And through the lens of multicultural progressivism, it was undoubtedly dark. However, the Democratic National Convention, and its all-star lineup of speakers, projected a glimmering optimism and celebration of progress that was dissonant, even misaligned, with a reality in much of America — particularly the electorally crucial Rust Belt — that was much more dim.The U.S. GDP in 2007, around $14 trillion, was more than twice that of 1980; however, wealth gains went mostly to the rich, as real median wages remained nearly flat and Americans relied evermore on debt to keep up with the Joneses. According to the Fed, both the middle and working class have seen their household wealth decrease since 1998, while the top 10 and 1 percent of households have enjoyed economic gains.And according to a sober report of consumer finances, also conducted by the Federal Reserve, 47 percent of Americans would have to cover the expenses of an $400 emergency by borrowing or selling something, or would not be able to come up with the $400 at all.In a recent bit of good news pertaining to the Great Recession recovery, the White House announced that the poverty rate dropped to 13.5 percent. Progress, but still far from the 11.1 percent record low — in 1973.The Pell Grant, created in 1972, now only covers about 30 percent of the cost of college for the limited slice of the population who are eligible, compared to almost the entire cost when it began. Taxes on salaried wages have increased as a percentage of total federal tax revenues as the portion of revenue from corporate taxes has experienced a marked declined, from 33 percent in 1952 to 10 percent in 2013.Surely, it would be a surprise in view of his campaign rhetoric if Trump meaningfully pushed for anything that would increase corporations’ share of the tax burden, make college more affordable, or alleviate poverty. Those were pledges Hillary Clinton made.But after decades of promises from reasonable-sounding, carefully calculated candidates, political insiders lacked believability to casual observers, who looked up from their smartphones after another unengaged four years to cast a plague on both houses — the Republican establishment in the primaries and the Democratic establishment in the general election.Each party, in its own way, lacked credibility as earnest vehicles of the electorate’s desires. So much so that Trump — a man who embodies incredibility in the most negative sense of the word — was able to capitalize on their insincerity with a sensational, superlative form of his own.If only a populist in his rhetoric, he won favor with primary voters by bashing not just immigrants and Muslims but also “bought” politicians — tapping into the underreported anger over perceived political inequality between the donor class and the average citizen.Trump embarrassed his primary competitors and soared in the polls after he asserted in a debate, “When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do. . . . I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them, and they are there for me.” He added, “And that’s a broken system.”That “broken system” created a dynamic in which a disconnected Democratic party was unable to operationalize its “Obama coalition” into a political movement; and in which a Republican party (funded with the explicit purpose of stopping as much of the Obama agenda as it could) brought government to a standstill, then effectively convinced its gerrymandered, older, whiter, base in midterms to place the blame on Democrats.The result was a shared government that rarely produced visibly fruitful policies representative of popular will, amidst a tepid economic recovery for most Americans, as the “1 percent” and stocks easily rebounded. Then, ironically, the American people’s growing disgust for such a dynamic produced historic demand for a change agent — something that only the Republican primary produced.Stunningly, nearly a fifth of Trump voters thought he was unqualified for the job. A critical mass of Americans were ready for someone who, as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich put it, was “gonna kick over the table.”No matter the irony, if Trump has done us a service, it is in unequivocally revealing the cavernous depth of disillusionment and consequent disengagement with institutions that includes not only Trump voters but many of those 90 million-plus who didn’t vote, many of whom may have succumbed to what Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig calls the politics of resignation — throwing up one’s hands.A party of which 62 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view; a party that has wholly embraced vetoing legislation of which a majority of Americans approve when deep-pocketed industries disapprove; a party that spuriously proved their theory that government doesn’t work by throwing a wrench into its gears, will now have near-complete control of the federal government. Their victory is not one that refutes the power of money in politics. It confirms it.The continual suppression of the connection between public will and public policy for years on end created an outcome that while not predictable, was always a possibility: the irrational election of a demagogue that opportunistically took advantage of — yes, racism lying in wait, but also — frustration with a dysfunctional, unresponsive system of civics.Notwithstanding the positions of the Supreme Court and Congress, several states and cities have adopted creative campaign reforms that make progress on these fronts. Seattle is a good example. Residents there voted to instate a public financing program in which voters will get $100 worth of election vouchers — candidates who opt out must follow strict rules on private fundraising. Seattle’s program, the first of its type, introduces the prospect of every voter being a donor too.If political fundraising, like voting itself, was a democratic process, then the increasing nominal cost of elections need not change the ratio of influence between rich and poor. Restructuring funding, while crucial, is only one among a legion of solutions that academics, activists, and citizens considerThe republic also needs stronger organizations other than parties. There is much to be done to improve civic education, local news media and other aspects of our democratic culture.Young people — burdened by financial debts of all sorts and the threat of climate change — would do well to place themselves at the heart of these efforts. They cannot afford for politics to remain uncool. Civic engagement cannot continue to be seen as geeky, ceded to the wonks, reserved for the nerds.In this way, the nation can elevate itself to an achievable standard for all actors involved: step into the arena of discourse, argue your case, form consensus — not by building a coalition of fear, but through persuasion based on the validity of ideas and the popularity of principles.Through a reformist spirit, the nation can elevate itself to an achievable standard for all actors involved: step into the arena of discourse, argue your case, form consensus — not by building a coalition of fear, but through persuasion, based on the validity of ideas and the popularity of principles.The inauguration of a dauntingly new political era is closely coinciding with the start of the new year. For ourselves and for posterity, let us extend our personal resolutions to include a collective commitment to squarely face unresolved problems, and in the midst of this dark winter strive toward a dawn of civic renewal.***Another version of this essay can be found at Salon."
55,POLITICS,The Women’s March Inaugurates the Resistance: Defeating the GOP War on Women’s Economic Security,"Nancy Altman, ContributorPresident, Social Security Works",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-womens-march-inaugurates-the-resistance-defeating_us_5884f070e4b08f5134b621f9,"On Saturday, more than four million people participated in the Women’s March on Washington and its sister marches across",2017-01-22,"<p>At least 500,000 people marched in DC yesterday, and over four million around the world.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5884fdb71c00001b00d938a1.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Saturday, more than four million people participated in the Women’s March on Washington and its sister marches across the nation and around the globe. Marches were held in every state and on every continent. The mass mobilization was the opening salvo against a misogynistic, racist, xenophobic, dangerous new president and Republican Congress.Women conceived and led the march, the biggest organized protest of President Donald Trump’s presidency so far. That was for a good and obvious reason. Our new President is a sexual predator. He is the most prominent face of the longstanding GOP war on women. This war has many battlefields. Some involve issues long associated with women’s rights – but are, or at least should be, important to everyone. These include reproductive freedom and choice, equal pay for equal work, freedom from sexual harassment and assault, paid family leave, and safe, affordable, quality day care. Other battlefields in this war involve issues that are not generally associated with women, but should be. These include civil and human rights, environmental protection, and economic justice. As the Values and Principles statement of the Women’s March succinctly states, Women’s Rights are Human Rights and Human Rights are Women’s Rights. Gender Justice is Racial Justice is Economic Justice. Economic security in old age is a key battlefield in the Republican war on women. Women, on average, live longer than men. Women are more likely to work in jobs that pay less in both current compensation and in retirement and health benefits. And women take more time out of the paid workforce to care for children and aged relatives. As a result, women, on average, spend more years in old age with fewer resources. Even women who are financially secure at younger ages as a result of marriage can find themselves widowed and destitute in old age. Women who are married to other women are especially vulnerable to insecurity in old age. Women aged 65 or older are eighty percent more likely to be impoverished in retirement than their male counterparts. The primary – and often, only – financial protections women have in old age are Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Women constitute fifty-four percent of Social Security beneficiaries, fifty-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries, and fifty-eight percent of Medicaid beneficiaries. Indeed, women constitute nearly two-thirds of Social Security beneficiaries over age 85. More than seventy percent of nursing home residents are women. And Medicaid pays nearly two thirds of long-term care costs.And, for women who are not yet age 65, the Affordable Care Act can mean the difference between obtaining health care and not, which can mean the difference between life-saving treatment and death. Women are more dependent than their male counterparts on the Act’s health exchanges because women, as a group, have less access to employer-sponsored health care. Moreover, prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, private insurers could charge women much more than men for the same health care coverage – and they generally did. The Affordable Care Act put quality, affordable health care within reach for many more women.Consequently, Republican attacks on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are attacks on women. Republicans are wasting no time in advancing on this front in the war on women. The new Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have already taken steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provides subsidies and limits insurance companies charging women whatever they choose. Even before the new government completes its repeal, the Trump administration can – and likely will – cut back or even eliminate the requirement that insurance plans provide contraception without co-pays, deductibles, or other out-of-pocket costs. That right was provided through regulation, and so can be taken away without Congressional action.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has announced his plan to dismantle Medicare this year. He also has made clear that he plans to gut Medicaid. The Republicans have learned to be quieter about their plan of attack against Social Security, having been burned in 2005 in their effort to privatize and end Social Security as we know it. Like today, the Republicans, in 2005, controlled the White House and Congress, but, unlike today, President Bush toured the nation in an effort to sell his proposal. This time, Trump himself is not calling attention to the destructive goal. But don’t be fooled by his silence.During the campaign, Trump criticized Ryan and other Republican leaders for their plans to cut Social Security, as well as Medicare and Medicaid. This break from Republican orthodoxy likely played a large role in Trump’s victories in both the primary and general elections. However, now that Trump has assumed the Presidency, he appears poised to break his promise to the American people. The powerful Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee has introduced legislation that would end Social Security as we know it. The formidable Chairman of the House Budget Committee has proposed budget procedures which would essentially require the future gutting of Social Security, as well as Medicare and Medicaid. On the very first day of this new Congress, the Republican House adopted a rule signaling its intent to pursue those budget changes. And, if that isn’t enough, some are proposing a fast-track commission to force the dismantling of Social Security while shielding Republicans from political accountability.Tweet-happy as he is, Trump knows how to criticize and make those criticisms newsworthy and known. If he disagreed with Republicans in Congress, we would know about it. He hasn’t said a word about Republican plans to destroy Social Security and Medicare. (He has spoken approvingly, though in coded language, of dismantling Medicaid, as part of his replacement for Obamacare but those comments have gone largely unreported.) Trump’s complete silence on Social Security and Medicare, and his near silence on Medicaid, is deafening. Moreover, Trump’s actions since the election reinforce the view that his campaign promises were mere rhetoric. That powerful Chairman of the House Budget Committee, who wants to dismantle Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act? He may be about to become even more powerful and even more central in the crusade to destroy these programs. That Chairman is Representative Tom Price (R-GA). Trump has nominated Price to be his Secretary of Health and Human Services,. In that key position, Price will have control over Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. On top of that, he will be a trustee of Social Security. Talk about a fox in charge of the hen house! If Trump and his Republican Congress succeed in destroying Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, all of us will be more economically insecure, but women will be hurt disproportionately. Those who participated in the Women’s March on Washington and its sister marches, those who supported the march, and those who didn’t but do support Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, must remain vigilant and informed to ensure that Trump and his Republican elites do not succeed.But we should do more. The Women’s March was about much more than resistance. It was a call to positive action. The march, and the movement it represents, was in support of the rights and wellbeing of women, men, and those who don’t identify with that binary classification.Social Security and Medicare are overwhelmingly popular, enormously successful government programs that are crucial to virtually everyone’s economic security. As long as you and your family are dependent on wages, you need insurance against the loss of those wages in the event of disability, old age, or premature death, leaving dependent children. And no one can be economically secure if they are one accident or illness away from bankruptcy. It is time to build on their success, expand Social Security, and extend Medicare to everyone.If a galvanized American public succeeds in expanding Social Security and Medicare, we will have done so much more than halting the war on women’s economic security. Together, we will have improved the economic security of all of us. That is a battle worth fighting and winning.Nancy J. Altman is founding co-director of Social Security Works. Join SSW in telling Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell to keep their hands off the American people’s earned Social Security and Medicare benefits. "

The atmosphere was elated, festive, and I felt optimistic for the first time since the election.Amtrak was sold out and MARC was not running when I got off the airport bus at the BWI train station, so I shared an Uber with a woman from Chicago and her son. We said goodbye and the New Carollton Metro station as people in red hats and military uniforms came off the train, going home from the inauguration. Then as now, we were in the majority.Failing to find my way, I asked for directions. I was swept up in a posse of very capable young women in pink, Peruvian-style hats, who carried me along with them to the right Metro line for my D.C. destination. At my friends’ house, we scanned the news channels for reporting on the inauguration. It was clear that the turnout was low. When we watched the live feed of the inauguration on MSNBC and C-SPAN, you could see the empty bleachers and thin crowds. When we watched it on Fox News, the reporter talked about the members of the crowd, saying how they had really hung in there for the duration of the event. However, the camera never showed the audience but focused instead on the parade itself—beautiful horses and shiny motorcycles--a great spectacle. Fox seemed to be carefully avoiding showing that there were not many watching.After an evening of making signs to hold up on the march, my posse was ready to go. ON the big day, the subway was full of pink hats. Couples, pairs of friends, gangs of chums, a women with a trumpet!Probably almost every reader of this blog took part in this march or a sister march in another city. Turnouts exceeded estimations everywhere. The atmosphere in D.C. was celebratory, as though we were to be heard at last, despite the election results. It was enthusiastic, supportive, humorous, but not trivial. It was a gathering-in of the tribes. There were feminists, LGBT activists, members of Planned Parenthood, the ACLU, or Moms Rising. There were men. There were young women (I talked to high schoolers from Kentucky), old women (okay—that was mostly my lot). Moms with strollers, moms with grown kids, women with “dogs for democracy.” There were Latino, Black and Anglo women; Christian women, Muslim women, Buddhist women, and proud atheists. All the issues: Women’s rights, human rights, the wall on the border with Mexico, global warming—all marching together. There were mom’s with kids, dad’s with babies in slings, people with face paint. One brave young woman was essentially naked from the waist up with what looked like electrical tape over her nipples. The message painted on her chest said, “No, still not asking for it.” As one sign read, “So many issues, only one sign.”But really, the hats were the biggest indicator of what was going on. Yes, the Trump supporters had those red hats and I am sure that a lot were sold all over this country, but...that’s just it: his supporters had to buy them and they were all the same.The pussy hats were all different and mostly homemade. Not everyone knitted their own but a friend made them, or their aunt did--or their niece. People bought them on Etsy, or got patterns off the Internet. There were dozens of styles, many different shades of pink. Some women of color wore brownish hats, some other women had knitted them in purple. Most hats were made as a longish rectangle of wool, folded over and sewn on the sides, the square shape making for little “ears” when worn. Some had bigger ears than others; some had tall ears, suggesting labia; some ears featured pompoms at the end of knitted strings, made to look like ovaries on the end of Fallopian tubes. Different colors of yarn, stripes in various shades of pink, different weights of wool--what this all said was that these people had a high level of personal commitment; that they were ready to do something, and that they were already doing it. The hats are a powerful symbol. They resemble the liberty caps of the French Revolution. It was fascinating, after the march, that President Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, seemed very angry about the disparity in the reports of the numbers of attendees at the march versus the inauguration. It would have been smarter to ignore the whole thing because anyone paying attention knew the truth, but that’s not the Trump way. It was Spicer’s first meeting with the press and he was furious, but was it with the press corps or was it with what he had been directed to say? He was over an hour late to the podium, which suggests a great deal of dissension about the message.No matter, Sean, nothing you can say will change the fact that women (and men) are on the march, and we are in the Majority. Or perhaps just advise Trump’s kakistocracy to hear us sooner rather than later."

All the issues: Women’s rights, human rights, the wall on the border with Mexico, global warming—all marching together. There were mom’s with kids, dad’s with babies in slings, people with face paint. One brave young woman was essentially naked from the waist up with what looked like electrical tape over her nipples. The message painted on her chest said, “No, still not asking for it.” As one sign read, “So many issues, only one sign.”But really, the hats were the biggest indicator of what was going on. Yes, the Trump supporters had those red hats and I am sure that a lot were sold all over this country, but...that’s just it: his supporters had to buy them and they were all the same.The pussy hats were all different and mostly homemade. Not everyone knitted their own but a friend made them, or their aunt did--or their niece. People bought them on Etsy, or got patterns off the Internet. There were dozens of styles, many different shades of pink. Some women of color wore brownish hats, some other women had knitted them in purple. Most hats were made as a longish rectangle of wool, folded over and sewn on the sides, the square shape making for little “ears” when worn. Some had bigger ears than others; some had tall ears, suggesting labia; some ears featured pompoms at the end of knitted strings, made to look like ovaries on the end of Fallopian tubes. Different colors of yarn, stripes in various shades of pink, different weights of wool--what this all said was that these people had a high level of personal commitment; that they were ready to do something, and that they were already doing it. The hats are a powerful symbol. They resemble the liberty caps of the French Revolution. It was fascinating, after the march, that President Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, seemed very angry about the disparity in the reports of the numbers of attendees at the march versus the inauguration. It would have been smarter to ignore the whole thing because anyone paying attention knew the truth, but that’s not the Trump way. It was Spicer’s first meeting with the press and he was furious, but was it with the press corps or was it with what he had been directed to say? He was over an hour late to the podium, which suggests a great deal of dissension about the message.No matter, Sean, nothing you can say will change the fact that women (and men) are on the march, and we are in the Majority. Or perhaps just advise Trump’s kakistocracy to hear us sooner rather than later."
58,WOMEN,Protests In Small-Town America Are The Backbone Of The Movement,"Christopher White, ContributorAssistant Professor of Music Theory at UMass, Amherst; gin lover",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-la-and-dc-were-beautiful-but-small-cities_us_58840b20e4b0d96b98c1dcc2,America is inundated with people who love this country.,2017-01-22,<p>A crowded street in Manhattan’s Sister Women’s March </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58840b972900001a00dd0f5f.jpg?ops=crop_15_204_696_455%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"This weekend, I went to the women’s march in Greenfield, Massachusetts, a small post-industrial town with a population less than 20,000. I came to the rally thinking that I would join a handful of other protesters on this small city’s green. I imagined I might harass pedestrians and encourage passing cars to honk in defiance of a potentially regressive executive and legislative administration. However, today, I was surprised to take my place alongside more than a thousand others to show our solidarity and our commitment to basic human rights, rights the current administration has and will call into question.With tears welling up in my eyes, I pulled out my phone to browse through pictures of friends on social media – of pink pussy hats, of children bundled up for their first demonstration, of clever signs, and people cheerfully and willingly walking with a confident defiance to demonstrate their commitment toward basic human rights, rights the current administration has and will call into question.I was shocked and delighted to see how many of my friends and family were amongst the truly enormous throngs of protesters in Washington D.C., Chicago, and New York. My cousin who is barely old enough to drive marched on D.C.’s mall today; I read that a disabled woman who often can’t move out of her apartment walked at the sister march in New York City. These marches, along with similar ones in LA, Boston, and Chicago did not number in the thousands, but in the tens and even hundreds of thousands. In these cities, people took to the streets to show their commitment to basic human rights, rights the current administration has and will call into question. I, along with many progressives in America, found last November to be a complete shock. I had assumed that most Americans shared similar values to me – if not on each specific issue, at least on some kind of basic plane. After all, I’m a gay man, and I got married in the state of North Carolina, a state which until recently had an explicit legislative ban on homosexual marriages. I believed that the world I lived in was committed to moving forward with LGBTQ rights, with women’s rights, with respect for the diversity of humanity. I had assumed that America would obviously reject a presidential bid associated with xenophobia and women’s degradation. I had assumed the world around me was too committed to basic human rights to back a candidate who called those rights into question.Of course, the many frustrations of the American electorate superseded these concerns. For better or worse, we elected an administration that calls into question the rights of many minorities— those of women, the LGBTQ population, immigrants, along with many, many others. But today, I got to see that I was not the only person who was thrown into an ideological vertigo. I also saw that these people had not only gotten their political balance back, but were marching in groups of tens of thousands towards the centers of the United State’s largest cities. My assumptions about my fellow Americans were not wrong. Even if our numbers were not enough to win the last election, we were enough to mobilize in terrifying numbers to peacefully demonstrate for basic human rights, rights the current administration has and will call into question.But, I believe, these enormous marches in America’s urban centers do not constitute the core of this movement’s strength.Dotted throughout my social media feeds, I saw this movement’s backbone: marches in small urban and rural hubs, similar to the thousand-person march in Greenfield. In towns across America – towns that I would have erroneously assumed had no marches – I saw thousands of people massed. Even though the capital of North Carolina, Raleigh, had a huge turnout, Greensboro NC – only 75 miles away – drew a crowd of hundreds, filling their downtown. Norfolk, Virginia’s downtown was swamped with protesters. Hartford, Connecticut pushed 10,000 people. Lexington, Kentucky. Santa Rosa, California. Urbana, Illinois. Topeka, Kansas. All of these places drew huge crowds of people, all to show their commitment to basic human rights, rights the current administration has and will call into question. There’s a google doc circulating with high and low crowd estimates for each of the some 650 odd Women’s Marches that occurred around the world. If you count just the 538 marches that had less than 10,000 attendees, you get between 700,000 and a million people (depending on the estimates used). A million people gathered in small cities and towns around the globe to show solidarity for these basic human rights. Obviously, enormous crowds are important. We need to raise groups of people whose numbers supersede those who may mass to support bigoted, xenophobic, and exclusionary policies. We need to show the current administration that they do not have the support of the majority of Americans. We need people to mass in city centers – to take the train into D.C., to fly into LAX. However, as our resistance moves forward, our backbone will be – our foundation will be – the people who come into the streets of Greensboro, Greenfield, Topeka, Norfolk, and Santa Rosa. It is here that we will be working to elect local, state, and national representation to reflect our values and to change the direction of our country. These demonstrations show that America is made of people – is inundated with people – who love this country, who will work for its future, and are committed to basic human rights. And these are rights the current administration has and will call into question."

Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cia-visit_us_5883f6b0e4b070d8cad312f2,Trump previously denounced the agency for finding that Russia was supporting his candidacy with emails hacks.,2017-01-22,"President Donald Trump speaks at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Saturday. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5883f7411200003e0aad8f7b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LANGLEY, Virginia ― President Donald Trump used his first full day in office to visit the spy agency he has spent months disparaging ― and spent 15 minutes offering rambling, politically oriented remarks that sounded like a campaign speech.“The reason you’re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media,” Trump told some 400 CIA employees gathered Saturday afternoon in the iconic lobby of the building featured in numerous films and television shows. “They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth,” the president added. “And they made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.” Trump and his choice for CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), spent about an hour meeting with top agency officials and touring the building before Trump returned to the lobby with the famous logo designed into the floor.But then Trump ― standing in front of a wall inset with 117 chiseled-out stars, each representing an agent who died in the line of duty ― delivered a series of grievances and boasts:He falsely claimed the media had reported that his inaugural crowd was smaller than it was: “It looked like a million, a million and a half people,” he said.Trump told the group of nonpolitical staff ― the agency is rare in that it has only a handful of political appointees ― that he was certain they had supported him.“Probably almost everybody in this room voted for me,” he said.Trump also repeated a frequent campaign falsehood ― that he opposed the 2003 Iraq invasion before it happened ― while advocating for taking oil from Iraq. He also repeated a common campaign idea that the U.S. military has not been able to win wars of late.“We were always winning things in this country. We’d win with trade. We’d win with wars,” Trump said. “At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors the United States has never lost a war. And then, after that, it’s like we haven’t won anything. We don’t win anymore.”Now-former CIA director John Brennan delivered a statement through a spokesman, saying he was “deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump’s despicable display of self-aggrandizement” in front of the Memorial Wall. “Trump should be ashamed of himself,” the statement read.Republicans in Congress have also complained that Democrats did not allow a vote on Friday to confirm Pompeo. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of endangering the country by allowing the agency to go without a leader through the weekend.However, on Friday the Senate on did confirm the appointments of retired Marine Corps Gens. James Mattis and John Kelly to run the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security, respectively ― with overwhelming votes that included most Democrats.Trump attacked the intelligence community earlier this month, saying it didn’t have any proof that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had directed the effort to hurt his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and help Trump. He attacked Brennan on Twitter the same evening the then-CIA director appeared on Fox News and asked Trump not to attack the intelligence community.On Jan. 6, the FBI and the DHS released a declassified version of the consensus intelligence community analysis that Russian spy agencies had tried to help Trump. That was the same day Trump met with the top officials of U.S. intelligence agencies who personally briefed him on the detailed classified version of that report.Five days later, at his first news conference since his election, Trump conceded for the first time that he believed Russia had been behind the hacking. However, he said later that it also could have been other countries.Trump had for months claimed it was impossible to know who had stolen emails from Democratic Party officials and Clinton’s campaign chairman, even though the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on Oct. 7 naming Russia and WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks, which many in the intelligence world consider a mouthpiece for Russian spy agencies, released the stolen emails almost daily for the final month of the campaign. Trump, for his part, made the embarrassing details from those emails a central theme of his campaign, often exclaiming that he loved WikiLeaks during his rallies.Trump did not mention Russia or the hacks during his remarks on Saturday, but did promise CIA employees he would return, preferably at a larger venue so more people could attend.“I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you, there’s nobody I respect more, you’re going to do a fantastic job and we’re going to start winning again, and you’re going to be leading the charge,” he said.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

I have no criminal record. I’ve never done anything illegal in Canada or in any other country,” Decunha told CBC News.He said he suspects that his political leanings determined his right to enter.“We were forthcoming and explained we were quite vehemently anti-[Trump],” he told Reuters.Sasha Dyck, also of Montreal, said he was also refused entry Thursday after telling border guards that he was heading to the women’s march. She was in a group of eight that included six Canadians and two French citizens.All were denied entry, he told The Guardian, and the French citizens were told that going forward they would need a visa to enter. As for Dyck, he said he was warned that if he and the other Canadians he was with attempted to cross again that weekend, they would be arrested.Dyck, who is a nurse, shared that this was in stark contrast to when he traveled south for President Barack Obama’s inauguration and U.S. border officials high-fived him.“It seems to me that they just weren’t interested in having us in the country for the inauguration,” the 34-year-old told Reuters. “I hope it doesn’t represent a closing down or a firming up of the border, or of mentalities south of the border.”British citizen Joe Kroese, who studies in Montreal, received similar icy treatment.Kroese, 23, said he and a Canadian he was with were fingerprinted and photographed before being denied entry while traveling with two Americans to attend the women’s march.“They took my phone and started going through my texts. There was another group of Canadians there that were also going to the march and were being refused entry,” he told The Independent.“They searched the car and then they asked the driver if he practiced Islam and if he spoke Arabic,” he said. “They wanted to spook us a bit. It felt like a kind of intimidation.”Kroese said the guards told him that the march was a “potentially violent rally” and that going forward he’d need a visa to enter the U.S.Citizens of Canada, France and the United Kingdom are not required to obtain a visa to enter the U.S. for tourism or business reasons. The full list of countries whose citizens are waived by the Visa Waiver Program can be found here.There are exceptions to these rules. Canadians who have a criminal record, for example, including for driving under the influence, must follow a separate set of procedures to enter.Aaron Bowker, a public affairs officer for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Buffalo field office in New York, said he can’t comment on individual cases, but that people are only denied entry if there is a valid reason.“If they’re not truthful or upfront,” he told The Huffington Post on Sunday of one possible scenario. “If we can’t verify what exactly they are doing, it could be a reason for refusal.”In most cases, he said, individuals who are denied entry must then acquire a visa going forward, which would explain why some people said they were told they’d need a visa in the future. In a statement, CBP agreed that entering the U.S. to participate in a march “is not a prohibited act.”“We recognize that there is an important balance to strike between securing our borders while facilitating the high volume of legitimate trade and travel that crosses our borders every day, and we strive to achieve that balance and show the world that the United States is a welcoming nation,” the statement read.On a daily basis, more than 1 million individuals are admitted into the U.S. Of those people, an average of 600 are denied entry, according to the statement.The Buffalo field office saw a 14 percent increase in vehicular traffic on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Bowker said, with many travelers stating that they were heading to events in D.C.Approximately 41,000 vehicles were processed over that three-day period and more than 100,000 passengers were inspected. Just over 95 people were denied entry ― or less than 1 percent of travelers who were processed. Not all of those travelers denied entry were heading to D.C., Bowker said.This story has been updated to include additional traffic figures."

What was supposed to be a four-hour drive became more like nine, but the heavy traffic could not have even pinched a more well-worth moment in our lives. As citizens of the United States, as strong women who believe in freedom and civil rights for all, as humans who strongly feel that all people on Earth should be respected, cared for, appreciated, and loved, we were and are eternally proud to participate in a worldwide movement in which unity and compassion are the driving force. Over a million people around the world in cities across the United States, Europe, Africa and Asia took to the streets, yesterday, to share this vision and to peacefully unite against Donald Trump, tyranny, patriarchy and greed, and to promote freedom, women’s rights, civil rights, mother Earth and the welfare of mankind.We didn’t know what to expect. In the car on the way to D.C., we discussed writing our names and phone numbers of our mothers on our arms, should something happen to us and our belongings lost. We talked about the pepper spray we had brought and the goggles we forgot that would have been useful should the police fire teargas. We worried about getting arrested or getting in the middle of a conflict between protesters and pro-Trumpers. As I look back at how peaceful and loving the Washington march was, I am ashamed at the fear that was at one point present and overwhelmed by the capacity of mankind to spiritually prevail in such time of trial. I am thankful that we, as humans, were able to express ourselves lovingly and not encounter violent opposition.As for millions and millions of others, this election has been hard for me to accept. I’ve gone through pretty extreme emotions that first began with comedy, and then disbelief, frustration, sadness, anger. It has been truly difficult as a rational and compassionate human being to understand how any of this could be possibly happening, again, however I have been making it my mission to fully embrace this as a spiritual moment in time—as a major step in the evolution of mankind. It is through struggle that a greater love can emerge, which is what we witnessed yesterday all around the world, defying borders, age, religion, race, gender and sexual orientation: the world united in grace.So, when will we finally get it? When will we finally come together as one and see beyond our borders of flesh, and rather as collective, connected vibrating atoms in a Universe in which there is no such thing as empty space, no such thing as a division between you and I? When will we finally understand that love is the answer? Not fear, not money, not power.This weekend was perhaps the beginning of a bigger challenge ahead for us all, but I see it, not as something to fear or deny, but rather as an opportunity for mankind to take giant steps towards a great spiritual evolution that will ultimately connect us more than we’ve ever been before.One love, hippies."

Donald Trump promised to deport millions of immigrants — splitting up from their families if necessary—to remove health care, to ban 1 billion from the U.S., to extend torture beyond waterboarding, and to kill the innocent wives and children of terrorists. To mention just a handful of his Constitutionally dubious policies. But Trump fans worry about trash pickup.Similarly, I protested with some 150,000+ fellow New Yorkers yesterday (estimates of up to 400,000) and there were no smashed windows or burning cars or fights to my knowledge. Many critics of the protestors use this tactic of pointing out the minuscule number of people (far less than 1 percent) who do something stupid or violent simply as a way of changing the subject from the legitimate issues those protestors are highlighting. It’s a basic, time-worn propaganda technique. It’s deflection. And I’m sure the new government thanks them for their service in using it.After all, they’re employing the same rhetorical tricks.Of course, I have no problem with people highlighting stupid stuff: Those who protest do the same. But let’s also recognize that people who consistently try to reduce the protests to those stupid actions do so as a way of ignoring what is being protested. As happened with Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street, that’s happening all over the place right now.We can continue to stress that we’re against these acts of stupidity until we’re blue in the face. The real intent is to avoid the actually important issues. Maybe we should just get in the habit of saying, “Yes, I condemn the stupidity. Now, can we return to the actual issues the 99.99 percent of us were focused on?”The same deflection applies with criticism of profanity. I’m not about to criticize protestors’ use of naughty words because their use of the language often simply highlights or alludes to language used by Trump himself. And Trump supporters don’t get to ignore the issues of towering importance millions of protestors highlight just because some of them use naughty words.And some are offended by pussycat ear hats? Pink pussycat ear hats. Those knit hats are a charming response to our new president’s scabrous vulgarity. If their presence offends, please remember they’re coyly referencing his remarks. Specifically, his bragging about sexual assault. And as passionate students of language and free speech, I’m sure we all understand that words themselves are not immoral; it’s the motivation they’re used with which can be crass, callous or demeaning.These complaints about language and pink knit hats, however, are also examples of deflection. And they’re often simply examples of the oppressors taking pleasure in telling the oppressed how they can protest their oppression.***This piece first also appears on Medium.com.Follow Robert Stribley on Twitter."

It was written by Li Cohen, a She's Fit to Lead contributor.On Jan. 21, the Women's March on Washington served as the point of trade between the hands of the previous generation and the voices of the current. In the sea of millions of individuals who challenged the nation's current standpoint in democracy, it was the blood-lined generations who truly flooded the world. On the corner of Independence, mothers joined hands with their mothers and daughters to join as a single voice of solidarity with their multi-generational peers. Baby boomers and millennials were suddenly one entity of impact, stirring a wave of everlasting change to reinstate the democratic ideals born from morality and not politics.Within the sea of activism walked 48-year-old Valerie Griffiths and her 16-year-old daughter Caroline. The two say they joined this march to be a part of herstory -- a term women around the world coined as the new era of history. Caroline, a sophomore at Nova High School in South Florida, said that after the presidential election, she no longer feared speaking her mind about politics. In fact, her beliefs grew stronger.  ""People started voting for what they want and what they think will be good in their lives, but what about the rest of the United States?"" she explained. ""You have to focus on everybody, not just one gender, one race or one sexuality."" Valerie feels like the disparity in equality is something women, minorities, and the LGBT community historically and presently face. Despite the unfairness of the inequality, however, Valerie and other marchers are confident that the vast disparity represented at the Women's March will cause a wave of change.  ""I feel like it's my duty as a parent to expose my daughter because she should understand what she's up against in the world,"" Valerie said. ""I feel like her generation has the opportunity to understand it and change it. They're a very inclusive generation, and you can see how they treat people differently than my generation did [from a social perspective].""This inclusiveness positively charged the marchers. Men and women of all races, sexual orientations, and backgrounds were together -- uniting as the entity of change. Caroline and Valerie explained this wasn't because of Donald Trump becoming President, but because of what his actions represent. ""We're not going to sit still and look pretty and let this stuff happen to us. We're going to fight back against what's wrong,"" Caroline explained. ""People say to me, 'Oh, you're white. Why do you care about the election?' and I just say, 'Muslim rights are human rights and I'm a human.' People think that if they're not experiencing the issue, they shouldn't empathize. I want people to know that no matter who you are or what you look like, these are human rights that everyone should have.""Those who rallied, marched, and voiced their concerns acted as catalysts to an endless reaction. For them, Jan. 21 was more than a day of protest, but a day of emotional therapy, as many of the issues expressed were based on emotional experiences of inequality. For some, this battle is with rape culture -- something Caroline sees far too often. Most recently, a trending hashtag stating #ItAintRape. ""Men were saying, '#ItAintRape if I don't feel bad afterwards,' #ItAintRape if she's unconscious and can't say no,' #ItAintRape and no isn't her language,'"" Caroline explained. ""When you turn on the news and see someone like Brock Turner gets only six months in jail, and then someone like Trump -- who openly sexually assaults women -- is elected president, it makes it seem like it's OK, when it's not."" Caroline, her mother, and numerous other women at the march are strong advocates for the justice of sexual assault victims. They walked to demonstrate that violence does not equal love and that all people need to show affected women that they are worth more than how they are treated. Part of this representation is the support of the controversial Planned Parenthood. One woman, Debbie Brookes, marched in memory of an occurrence from more than 20 years ago. She explained how, while working in Pennsylvania, she met two women who served as board members for the state's Planned Parenthood. Those two women were sisters, and recounted their life story to Brookes, explaining how their mother found out she was pregnant with her fourth child the day their father lost his job. This happened during the Great depression, and because of the overwhelming circumstances, their father committed suicide. The widowed mother was left without a job, no income, and was the sole caregiver to three children with one on the way. Being pregnant, she was not able to find work or to properly care for her other children, so she attempted to give herself an abortion. She died in the process, leaving the children to be put in foster care.  With tears in her eyes, Brookes said she doesn't want to see the country force people back to those ways. ""Kids and women nowadays don't realize how hard it was and what it means to have your choice and have nobody else tell you what to do with your body,"" she said. ""We take Planned Parenthood for granted. And they do more than anybody else in this country to prevent abortions. They're the ones out there educating, giving birth control, and helping women."" Ronni Lynn, a 72-year-old exuberant child of the '60s, marched in Miami, sported her Pussy Hat--a pink knitted cap with cat ears -- in support of the march. She explained that the march was a beautiful example of female empowerment that provides hope for future generations ""Women getting together and united shows that respect matters; respect for all people, not just Americans,"" she said. ""I'm very happy to see all of these young people. We need you. We need you to carry on for us."" And while the fight for rights continued, marchers spread throughout the world. Individuals and families of all backgrounds gathered in London, Switzerland, South Africa, New Zealand, and Germany, just to name a few, adding fuel to the fire of freedom. Helena Redman, a Swedish-born professional singer, artist, and mother of three, attended the march in D.C. with her best friend, a native Trinidadian, to stand up for human values. ""There are a lot of things going on right now that are unacceptable to me on so many levels,"" she said. ""Even on a foundational level -- not political -- I just feel like human decency has gotten lost in the shuffle.""Although her children couldn't accompany her for financial reasons, Redman said her children -- aged 18, 16, and 7 -- adopted her liberal views on racism, sexism, and other equality issues, but not in the political sense. ""Liberal, to me, means progress and forward movement, and I think that's a very positive thing,"" she explained. ""There was a taboo before that's been removed, and it's definitely turning everything upside down, but there's a gift in that. You can't address the issues until you see them.""John Weaver, a disabled father, husband, and activist, explained that the issues people are protesting are a problem for the younger generations. ""All these policy changes...[the older generations] are past that; we'll be fine,"" he said. ""But they will be a problem for you -- our children and our grandkids. You're supposed to care about other people, and that's the part that's missing somewhere."" Attempting to share this message with younger generations, Honey Shine Inc., an organization for girls and women between 8 and 18, took approximately 80 girls to the march in Miami. Members said the group focuses on teaching the girls how to balance their minds, bodies, and souls to empower them. Asia, 20, got involved when she was in third grade and remains involved, even after she graduated high school. She attended the rally to feel inspired. ""I've never been a part of a rally before -- something that's about women trying to better ourselves. I want to be a part of that,"" she said. ""We should know what politicians stand for. As the new generation, we should know what we want and strive to be better. We need to be groundbreaking and make our own paths.""Agatha Caravallo, a parent volunteer at Honey Shine, said her daughter is in her third year in the program. While she wants her daughter to gain self-confidence and understand her worth, she also wants her to understand what factors could prevent that from happening. After the election, Caravalla spoke to her daughter that it's discouraging the most qualified woman can still lose to the most unqualified man, but women must keep their heads up. ""We shouldn't be in 2017 still making this pace, but we are, and we need to help the girls realize they're worth so much more than what's put out there,"" she said. ""I still believe, despite the election, that every vote counts and every voice counts. I want her to feel empowered to use it."" As the day ended, marchers proclaimed one final message to the world -- hope. The global unification of over 1 million women was the result not of an election, but, as the people stated, the ignorance of respect. The older generations who marched with their sisters and brothers, daughters and sons, and granddaughters and grandsons, created a masterpiece of iconic history. Jan. 20, 2017 is the day people felt stripped of all rights, but Jan. 21 is the day the spirit of democracy created a new life. The sea of change bore a new era where justice prevails. The law of the land is the voice of the people, and the new generation has spoken."

69,POLITICS,Anti-Abortion Group Bumped From Women's March Stakes Out A Place Anyway,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womens-march-abortion_us_5883d51be4b096b4a23245f8,"""I want to hold him accountable for how he treats women,"" said one demonstrator.",2017-01-21,"Lisa Twigg of Spotsylvania, Virginia, said she wants to hold President Trump accountable for how he treats women.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5883d84b170000fa01fdff82.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Women who describe themselves as both feminists and against abortion gathered along the route of the Women’s March on Washington Saturday, staking out a visible spot on the corner of 15th Street and Constitution Avenue with an “Abortion Betrays Women” sign so big it took five people to hold it up.The anti-abortion groups came to the march despite being bumped as partners after a kerfuffle last week. The event’s most prominent partners included Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-choice America, and its unity principles included “open access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control.” So the formal inclusion of groups that oppose abortion was not going to go over well.Still, the women against abortion said they wanted their voices heard during the historic event. Their signs included the slogans “Real feminists reject abortion” and “Life empowers women.”This provoked a fair amount of back and forth with other marchers, which seemed to be what the group was aiming for.Marchers responded with choruses of “My body, my choice” and expletives. “I had an abortion!” one woman shouted at them.The anti-abortion contingent said they weren’t there to protest the protest. “We’re not protesting the march,” said Catherine Glenn Foster, general council for Stanton Healthcare, one of the organizations that applied to be a partner. “We wanted to be part of it.”Foster estimated there were somewhere between 50 and 100 people in their group, between Stanton’s supporters, members of the group New Wave Feminists and Students for Life.“We’re all in favor of women’s rights,” Foster said. “We just think they start earlier than some other people do.”“I consider myself a pro-life feminist, and I didn’t think we were being represented in this march,” said Mary Grace Coltharp, a 17-year-old from Virginia active in Students for Life. “I as a woman deserve to be represented, and because unborn female fetuses can’t represent themselves obviously.”Coltharp was too young to vote this year, and seemed undecided about the new president. “There’s a lot of problems with his character and policies,” she said. But at the same time, she continued, “he’s made a lot of promises about pro-life issues.”Lisa Twigg, 28, of Spotsylvania, Pennsylvania, said she would have come to the march anyway, even though anti-abortion groups weren’t formally included. She was wearing a knit hat that looked like a fox and a hoodie that read: “This is what a pro-life feminist looks like.”Twigg said she’s also against the death penalty, torture and unjust wars ― not just abortion ― and felt like she needed to be at the march.“I still wanted to come because I do believe in the spirit of the march. I did not vote for [Trump]. I want to hold him accountable for how he treats women,” she said. “I didn’t want to crash anybody’s party or anything like that. I truly believed that I wanted to be here as a woman, and make my voice heard.” The anti-abortion attendees said they think there is a place for them, given that polling finds about half of Americans believe there should be at least some restrictions on abortion. “This is not a monolithic march. It’s a march of so many diverse people and diverse viewpoints,” Foster said. “Yes, there have been some who have been against our message, but there have been a lot in favor as well.”The majority of marchers passing the anti-abortion group’s outpost would certainly fall into the former category. But there were some kind words as well. “Thank you for being here today,” said one middle-aged marcher. “You’re very brave.”"

Other speakers included America Ferrera, Scarlett Johansson, LGBTQ activist Janet Mock, Michael Moore and civil rights activist Angela Davis.In her speech, Steinem hailed the Obamas, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton for their service, noting that Clinton “is alive and definitely not in jail.”Then she went after Trump.“Trump and his handlers have found a fox for every chicken coop in Washington. A twitter finger must not become a trigger finger,” she said, adding that Trump’s “grandiosity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality ... was on full display in his inaugural address yesterday.”Steinem declared the modern age to be one of the most dangerous times for American women’s rights, and lashed out at violence, hate speech and a male-dominated society.“No more asking daddy. We are linked; we are not ranked, and this is a day that will change us forever because we are together.” The mere announcement of Steinem’s participation breathed even more life into a day of activism, which was expected to draw hundreds of thousands of people to Washington.She said on Instagram in December:I am proud to be one of thousands who will come to Washington to make clear that we will keep working for a democracy in which we are linked as human beings, not ranked by race or gender or class or any other label.Steinem has been a longtime advocate for civil rights and helped set up the National Women’s Political Caucus in 1971. She protested against South African apartheid in 1984 and co-founded Choice USA, a nonprofit that acts as a fierce proponent of reproductive choice."

The program shields more than 750,000 undocumented young people who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation so they can work or attend college. Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) joined fellow caucus members Friday afternoon at a press conference, railing against the new president’s immigration policies. “We are here today on the day of inauguration to send a very clear message to our president: The CHC is going to stand up and fight for the rights of the Hispanic community,” Sanchez said. “The president of the United States has made it abundantly clear, including in his speech today, that he is openly hostile to immigrants particularly immigrants of Mexican ancestry.”Sanchez, a daughter of two immigrants, shared her story and defended her parents’ contribution to the U.S.“Mr. President: I’m American, and I’m not going anywhere,” Sanchez said, visibly agitated. “Get used to seeing our faces. Our Hispanic community will be there at every turn during your administration to show you that we’re going to keep fighting for what’s best for our community and ultimately what is a blessing for our country.”The lawmakers displayed a picture of the Berlin Wall coming down, with then-President Ronald Reagan’s quote, “Tear down this wall,” scrawled across it. Rep.

It recently gained more Republican co-sponsors. “This is the first president in recent history who has been anti-immigration,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said as stood alongside the Hispanic lawmakers. “This is a departure from bipartisan support for the role of immigration into our country historically and recently,” Pelosi continued. “And we just have to keep speaking out about it ... and public sentiment will prevail and the president will know the harm that he is doing to our country by going forward with something that might have some popular appeal in the campaign, but has no place in the White House.”"

He was accompanied by Guinean President Alpha Conde, who mediated the terms of his departure with Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz and others.The departure of Jammeh, who took power in a 1994 coup, ends weeks of stalemate and paves the way for the transfer of power to Barrow, who was sworn in as leader at the Gambian embassy in Senegal on Thursday and is now expected to return home.The events will likely be viewed as a triumph for African diplomacy, in part because there was no fighting between the 7,000 troops from Senegal and Nigeria who entered Gambia on Thursday and the authoritarian leader’s forces.“The rule of fear has been banished from Gambia for good,” Barrow told a crowd at a Dakar hotel on Friday, once it became clear a deal had been struck for Jammeh to relinquish power.“To all of you forced by political circumstances to flee our country, you now have the liberty to return home,” said Barrow, 51, who worked as a property developer and led an opposition coalition few thought would win the Dec. 1 vote.As a price for leaving, Jammeh demanded amnesty, the right to go to and from Gambia and recognition for his political party, said Marcel de Souza, head of the commission of West African regional bloc ECOWAS.“(An amnesty deal) is not finalized. The heads of state would have to give it and the AU (African Union) and the U.N. (United Nations), and it would surprise me if that is given,” he told Reuters in Dakar.The deal over Jammeh’s departure focused on where he would go into exile and the issue of amnesty, mediators said.RELIEVES TENSIONJammeh’s departure will relieve tension in Gambia after a day in which many people said they feared the veteran leader might change his mind. He initially conceded defeat to Barrow in the Dec. 1 election but backtracked a week later.Some in Banjul said they were angry he was able to negotiate at all and had been allowed to delay his departure.“He’s a stubborn man. It should be surrender, handcuffs or death,” said Patience Williams, 50, a dental nurse.In a last bid to cling to power, Jammeh declared a state of emergency this week and dissolved the cabinet while the National Assembly extended his term for three months. More than half the government then resigned and 45,000 people fled to Senegal.The crisis was a test for ECOWAS, not least because Jammeh had held office longer than any other current president in the grouping of states. The African Union and U.N. Security Council supported the military intervention.Gambia’s Atlantic Ocean beaches make it a holiday destination for Europeans. Tourism, peanut production and overseas remittances are crucial to the economy of the country of 1.8 million.The country’s economy is expected to grow 4.5 percent in 2017 after a projected contraction of 4.0 percent last year, World Bank figures showed."

I am sure 2017 will be the year the people of continental Europe wake up,” she said to loud applause on Saturday.Le Pen, head of the anti-EU, anti-immigrant National Front (FN) and seen by pollsters as highly likely to make a two-person runoff vote for the French presidency in May, has marked out Europe as a major plank in her programme.The far-right leaders met under the slogan “Freedom for Europe” with the aim of strengthening ties between their parties, whose nationalist tendencies have hampered close collaboration in the past.“The key factor that is going to set in course all the dominos of Europe is Brexit. A sovereign people chose ... to decide its destiny itself,” Le Pen said.“The second coup did not come long after: the election of Mr Trump to the presidency of the United States ... his position on Europe is clear: he does not support a system of oppression of peoples,” she added.In a joint interview with the Times of London and the German newspaper Bild published on Monday, Trump said the EU had become “a vehicle for Germany” and predicted that more EU member states would vote to leave the bloc as Britain did last June.Populist anti-immigration parties are on the rise across Europe as high unemployment and austerity, the arrival of record numbers of refugees and militant attacks in France, Belgium and Germany feed voter disillusionment with traditional parties.The mood is mirrored in the United States, where Trump was inaugurated as U.S. president on Friday.Several leading German media have been barred from the Koblenz meeting, which is being organised by the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), the smallest group in the European Parliament, in a year when the parties are hoping for electoral breakthroughs.Also at the meeting were Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch far-right Freedom Party (PVV) who was last month convicted of discrimination against Moroccans, and Matteo Salvini of the NorthernLeague who wants to take Italy out of the euro.In the Netherlands, Wilders is leading in all major polls before national parliamentary elections on March 15. Again hailing Trump’s election, Wilders told the meeting: “Yesterday a free America, today Koblenz, and tomorrow a new Europe.”Protesters demonstrated outside the venue, with Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of Germany’s Social Democrats, junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, due to join the protest."

The local highway police chief said it was carrying mostly teenage students, teachers and parents.“Many children among the victims of the accident in Verona, a bus catches fire on impact with a pillar,” national police said on Twitter, adding they had come to Italy from France.Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference that the teenagers were from a Budapest secondary school, returning from their annual ski camp in France.He added that there was uncertainty over the exact number of passengers in the bus, but it was higher than the director of the school had known about.Szijjarto said that one of the victims, whose life was at risk, was being kept in coma, and that all of the injured were in hospital. The minister added that twelve passengers were “well” and were staying in a hotel in the southern part of Verona.Local highway police chief Girolamo Lacquaniti told SkyTG24 television some people had minor injuries, but others were more serious. Lacquaniti said the cause of the crash would be investigated. “We are not aware of other vehicles being involved, it seems to have gone off the road of its own accord.”Police released photographs and television footage of the burned-out hulk near a road bridge.

In the tape he was heard saying: “Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” In New Zealand, there were marches in four cities, involving around 2,000 people, Wellington’s march organizer Bette Flagler told Reuters by phone.Elsewhere in Asia, hundreds of people joined protestsin Tokyo, including many American expatriates.“Trump presidency gets my blood boiling ... Everything we value could be gone. It’s time to speak your mind and concerns and to do our best to salvage the values we cherish in America,” said Bill Scholer, an art teacher.And in Manila on Friday about 200 demonstrators from a Philippine nationalist group rallied for about an hour against Trump outside the U.S. embassy in Manila.Some held up signs demanding U.S. troops leave the Philippines while others set fire to a paper U.S. flag bearing a picture of Trump’s face..Worldwide some 673 “sister marches” are planned for Saturday, in addition to a protest in Washington D.C., according to the organizers’ website which says more than two million marchers are expected.In Washington D.C., at Trump’s inauguration back-clad activists, who were not related to the womens’ marches, threw rocks and bottles at police in Washington as Trump was sworn in as President.Although protests in the United States are common at inaugurations, in living memory only the inauguration of Richard Nixon in 1968 - as the United States fought an unpopular war in Vietnam - has drawn such a strong reaction worldwide.In Sydney, many were worried about that Trump’s politics and his attitude towards women and minorities could spread.“As a mature 56-year-old lesbian I feel for the first time what is global is local,” Vicki Skehan, 56, told Reuters.“We’ve come so far with inclusiveness and I don’t want to see that go away.”(Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook; Writing by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"

But that would only be possible if he released his tax returns. In a break with four decades of precedent, Trump refused to do so during his campaign.Former President Barack Obama created the webpage for citizen petitions on the White House web site in 2011 as part of a promise to make government more open to the people. If a petition garnered 100,000 signatures within 30 days, it would elicit an official White House response within 60 days.Although the Trump administration immediately removed the White House web site’s page on climate change, it kept the petition system Obama created intact.Of the four petitions submitted since Trump’s inauguration on Friday, just the one about the president’s tax returns has received the necessary number of signatures.How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

Everyone laughed. It was all wonderful and breezy and almost enough to make you forget that you were in hell. When the elevator reached the 14th floor, it opened up into DeploraBall, the inaugural fete thrown by Mike Cernovich and other allies of the white nationalist “alt-right” movement. Indeed, DeploraBall was not a scene one typically associates with harmless conversational jousting among the comfortably married. Yet, like the alt-right itself, the evening was defined by extremism and ― to put it diplomatically ― an elastic relationship with reality. There was Cernovich revving up the crowd by calling Hillary Clinton a “bigoted Nazi” who “wanted to put us in camps”; there was Jeff Giesea, one of DeploraBall’s co-organizers, urging the crowd to “preserve our civilization”; there was conservative activist Lucian Wintrich dismissing accusations that the alt-right is extremist by denouncing the “fascist left” and calling liberals Nazis. Then Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a far-right activist who let a prisoner die of dehydration in one of his prison cells, got up to speak. Informing the crowd that “the real fighting starts today,” Clarke assured the audience that the only time he would “reach across the aisle would be to grab [Democrats’] throats.” Though there were a lot of puzzling things about DeploraBall ― among them a performance of Bob Dylan’s protest anthem, “The Times They Are A Changin’” ― none was more head-scratching than a denunciation of fascism followed by a sitting law enforcement official threatening to choke his political opponents. The so-called alt-right encompasses a range of nationalistic outlooks, ranging from segregationists to authoritarians to angry Redditors in need of a platform to vent their anger. Though their aims vary, almost all are united in their distaste for, and often outright hatred of, pluralism. Other attendees included Martin Shkreli, the so-called “Pharma Bro” who is under indictment for securities fraud and who rose to prominence for raising the price of a live-saving drug; Roger Stone, the lifelong Republican activist known for his underhanded tactics; entrepreneur Peter Thiel, a member of Donald Trump’s transition team and secret funder of Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit that ultimately bankrupted Gawker; Michael Flynn Jr., son of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and a online propagator of fake news stories; James O’Keefe, the conservative activist criticized for selectively editing his undercover videos of progressives; Pamela Geller, a leading Islamophobic activist; and, of course, Cernovich, a near-bottomless well of controversial statements who has made a name for himself promoting an uber-macho brand of personal improvement.There were other moments of unreality. As partygoers waited to pass through security, a man held up a sign that warned of “the MEXICAN NIGHTMARE.” Another attendee carried a sign reading, “HILLARY IS A DISHONEST UNTRUSTWORTHY, HATEFUL, ESTABLISHMENT WHORE AND A ?ITCH!” Chants of “Trump! Trump!” and “Lock her up!” soon erupted, and the sight of a man in a tuxedo barking, “Trump that bitch!” does not fade from memory quickly.Inside, in the wood-panel-lined, boys-club-like environs of the Press Club, revelers snapped photos of themselves beside a Donald Trump impersonator and a painting of George Washington wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. They surveyed the offerings at the buffet and bar, which somewhat counterintuitively offered a foreign beer, Heineken. Partygoers, predominantly white, ranged in age and dress, some opting for classic evening wear and military dress uniforms while others sported their finest #MAGA T-shirts. This was the Met Gala for white people who feel under siege ― the Capote Ball for anyone who wants their kids to grow up and be like Fox News’ Jesse Watters. However, the evening was defined as much by what was going on within as by what was going on without. Fourteen stories below, on F Street NW, a large protest had gathered well before the festivities began, with hundreds of people holding signs denouncing extremism and espousing action (”SMASH FASCISM” and “Take to the Streets,” to name a couple). On one end, someone had inflated a giant elephant with the word “RACISM” stamped across it, while several hundred feet away, a woman carrying a “Free Palestine” sign argued with a man sporting an “American Bikers United Against Jihad” hoodie. Protesters had trained two spotlights on the Press Club Building, one of which read, “Impeach the Predator President” and the other ― in what was truly history’s strangest bat signal ― “Bragging About Grabbing A Woman’s Genitals.” A human shield of police formed alongside the entrance to the party, dividing the partygoers from the more aggressive protesters, many of whom yelled invectives at the attendees. At one point, as the crush of protesters heaved forward, several officers fell over, forming a temporary gap. Suddenly exposed, a handful of attendees (and one Huffington Post reporter) scampered into the lobby, their flight set to a soundtrack of clacking heels and cries of “fascist!” The protests were met with a mixture of amusement and anger by the self-proclaimed “deplorables” inside. Some snapped photos of the demonstrators as they snaked through the security line in the lobby, offering defiant waves and other, less friendly gestures through the windows. “I had a sign with ‘peace’ written on it thrown at my face!” one attendee in the security line recalled. “You just can’t dress well in these parts,” his companion replied consolingly.Others were significantly less good-humored. “Was there tear gas?” one partygoer loitering by a bar upstairs in the Press Club asked about the protest.“Yeah. Fuckin’ gas ‘em!” another replied. “Fuckin’ billy-club them!” the first guest added.“I’ll go out and help!” added the second. One attendee was quite certain that the country was squarely on the side of her and her fellow deplorables. “The media gives them a platform!” she insisted. “That’s what it is!” “We love America here,” another guest injected. “That’s what this is!”―-Huffington Post reporter Eliot Nelson’s book, The Beltway Bible: A Totally Serious A-Z Guide to Our No-Good, Corrupt, Incompetent, Terrible, Depressing and Sometimes Hilarious Government, is out now.

The ceremony attracted fewer viewers than President Barack Obama’s first inauguration, but more than the first swearing-in for President George W. Bush, according to the ratings agency.Nielsen’s estimate includes live coverage on 12 networks from approximately 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.Nearly 38 million people watched Obama’s inauguration in 2009, the highest inauguration rating since 42 million viewers tuned in when President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981.Viewership for Obama’s 2013 inauguration declined by more than one-third, though the drop-off is typical for second terms.“From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land,” Trump said in his inaugural address. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first.”Trump predicted record-setting attendance for his inauguration, but huge crowds didn’t materialize. Aerial photos showed a relatively empty National Mall, compared to an estimated 1.8 million people who attended Obama’s 2009 inauguration, which is still the attendance record. Turnout for other presidents’ inaugurations was much lower. Many people also gathered in Washington on Friday to rally against the 45th president. Protesters clashed with police, injuring two officers, shortly before Trump took the presidential oath of office. More than 200 people were arrested. In a of couple cases, people vandalized nearby businesses.On Saturday, people around the world demonstrated in solidarity with the Women’s March on Washington, demanding that the Trump administration respect human rights and equality.Trump’s team faced a number of obstacles planning the inauguration festivities. While Obama’s inaugural events featured celebrity guests and performances from the likes of Beyoncé, Trump reportedly struggle struggled to attract top entertainers.Some musicians, including singer Charlotte Church, said they declined invitations to perform. Broadway singer Jennifer Holliday canceled her scheduled performance, and a Bruce Springsteen cover band backed out of playing a gala earlier in the week in deference to Springsteen. One member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir resigned in protest rather than sing for Trump.Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old “America’s Got Talent” runner-up, sang the national anthem. On Thursday, 3 Doors Down, Toby Keith, Sam Moore and others performed in front of the Lincoln Memorial for the “Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration.”Inauguration planner Tom Barrack defended the lack of A-listers as a conscious choice to instead “surround [Trump] with the soft sensuality of the place” for a “much more poetic cadence than having a circus-like celebration.”During a press conference earlier this month, Trump said the inauguration would feature “tremendous talent.”“We’re going to have a very, very elegant day,” he said. “I think we’re going to have massive crowds because we have a movement.”How will Trump’s first 100 days impact you?

By a 10-point margin, 42 percent to 32 percent, they think the economy has gotten better rather than worse. By a 20-point margin, 42 to percent to 22 percent, they think the nation’s position internationally has grown weaker rather than stronger. Democrats, however, overwhelmingly say they’ve seen improvements in their own lives, the American economy and the country’s strengths abroad. Republicans disagree on all counts. Practically the only thing both sides agree on is that partisanship has gotten worse. A survey taken last year, as Obama delivered his final State of the Union address, found the partisan divide over his legacy outstripping the divide along racial, class or generational lines. In the intervening months, while his personal popularity has rebounded, that rift has remained vividly intact.“For too many of us, it’s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions,” Obama acknowledged in his farewell speech last week, calling the trend a “threat to our democracy.”Sixty percent of Democrats say that things have gotten better for them personally since Obama was elected, with 54 percent sayings that things have gotten better for most others in the country as well. About three-quarters think that the economy has improved, and 46 percent say that the country has improved its standing internationally.In contrast, 58 percent of Republicans say things have personally gotten worse for them since Obama was elected, and 51 percent say that very few others have seen improvements. Sixty-three percent say the economy has declined, and nearly 80 percent say that the U.S. has become weaker in comparison to other countries.Theoretically, independents are in the middle: 24 percent, for instance, say things have gotten better for them, 32 percent that things have gotten worse and 36 percent that things have stayed about the same. Independents are also split on the economy, with 38 percent saying it has improved, 34 percent that it has declined and 20 percent that it hasn’t much changed.But even independents are politically polarized. Those who lean toward the Democratic Party are 48 points likelier than those who lean toward the GOP to say that their lives improved and 69 points likelier to think the economy got better over the course of Obama’s presidency.Use the widget below to further explore the results of HuffPost/YouGov’s survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups: A majority across partisan lines ― 59 percent of Democrats and just over three-quarters of Republicans ― as well as two-thirds of independents, say the relationship between the two parties has gotten worse since Obama was elected. Those fissures seems unlikely to heal anytime soon. While Obama first took office on a broadly based tide of goodwill, views of President Donald Trump are already deeply polarized, as are views of the state of affairs he inherits. Democrats, who were far more likely than Republicans to believe the country was heading in the right direction during Obama’s presidency, are now adamant that it’s on the wrong track.“The importance of party and presidential loyalty in basic views of the country could be even stronger under Trump, whose own support has stayed sharply partisan through the typical ‘honeymoon’ period after the election,” pollsters at The Washington Post wrote Friday, noting that as recently as the 1990s, partisanship played far less of a role. Political parties also play a crucial role in Americans’ image of themselves. According to a November HuffPost/YouGov poll, people are more likely to say they share common interests and concerns with others in their political party than they are to feel connected to those of the same gender, race, class, religion, geographical region or age group.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 13-17 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

With the entrance of the United States into the first World War, President Woodrow Wilson shattered this standard with a single signature. In December 1917, he signed into action the Federal Possession and Control Act, effectively nationalizing the railroad industry in an attempt to meet the rising delivery demands of war. However, his policy was short-lived and ended in two short years after facing utter failure.At this point, Wilson established a precedent for encroaching federal power on traditionally privatized industry, an act long advocated for by Progressives throughout the early 1900s. Shortly after Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed the New Deal, a set of programs specifically designed to employ impoverished Americans suffering from the catastrophic Great Depression, a program made possible by the rising support of Populists, a group that emerged from Wilson’s supporters of railroad privatization. These programs most notedly included the Civil Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. These programs, though successful in developing infrastructure in the United States, did not lift America out of the Great Depression ― the very thing they were designed to do. While they did temporarily employ 8 million people, the great cost of the program could not be maintained indefinitely. Rather, it took another World War to finally end the Great Depression.The most recent and highly controversial example of nationalization of industry is President Barack Obama’s universal health care program. Having run on a platform of “hope” and “change” much like Roosevelt’s promise for a “new deal with the American people,” Obama’s election greatly relied upon his promise to implement a policy of universal health care.In 2010, Obama’s dream of universal health care coverage passed in the form of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly referred to as Obamacare. However, from its inception, Obamacare was riddled with controversy. No one seemed to be pleased with it. Conservatives feared that Obamacare would be a “job-killer” for businesses; Senator Ted Cruz stated, “What is problematic about Obamacare is that it is killing millions of jobs in this country.” Meanwhile, prominent liberals, such as Bernie Sanders, argue that though the president attempted to ensure health care affordability for even the lowest income workers, Obamacare “does not go far enough.”Following the 2015 Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell finding Obamacare constitutional, proponents of the act hoped that the controversy would finally end. Conservatives lashed out against the court, particularly against Chief Justice Roberts, a traditionally conservative justice who had sided with more liberal justices in the court’s decision, but the controversy eventually died down. Obamacare survived.Recently, the debate over the ACA has been renewed with the release of a statement from the White House announcing that as of 2017, premiums “will rise sharply.” According to a report released by the Department of Health and Human Services, “the average cost for the benchmark silver plan will experience a 22 percent hike” and “will cost an average of $296 more per month next year.” Additionally, the Obama administration reports that some states will now only have one insurance option available to citizens.As Obamacare’s architect, Jonathan Gruber, likes to point out, the ACA is “working as designed.” Nonetheless, while the Obama administration continues to argue that Obamacare is alive and well, there is a disconnect between their words and reality, most notably demonstrated by the need for premium hikes.Outside of the United States, many other developed nations have implemented universal health care. The nationalization of health care in many of these developed states has been met with great success ― countries such as Sweden and Canada are just two examples of highly regarded universal health coverage policies. When evaluated based on the quality of their health care systems (based on efficiency, equity, and overall citizen health), Sweden is ranked number three and Canada is ranked number ten in the world. So why has universal health care failed as a system in the United States while other countries with similar policies succeed?One possible answer can be found by examining the United States’ history of nationalization. In an attempt to improve national efficiency of the railroad systems after America’s entrance in World War I, Woodrow Wilson nationalized the railroad industry. Despite Wilson’s intentions, railroads were unable to keep up with demand. They were marked with greater inefficiency and higher costs, partially driven by Wilson’s campaign to increase wages for unskilled railroad workers.A main cause of the failure of railroad industrialization was that the federal government was not concerned with profit, unlike railroad companies. Quite simply, the federal government did not attempt to reduce costs in order to maximize profits, resulting in their newly acquired nationalized railroad industry burdening the federal budget. The final nail in the coffin for nationalization in this case, however, came about as a result of public opinion. The public had to wait longer than ever for deliveries of basic goods, an indication of government inefficiency. From the public perspective, railroad nationalization did not help, but rather hindered their lives.However, the nationalization of the railroad industry is not America’s only example of the failed execution of increased nationalization. America’s social security program likewise exemplifies the difficulties associated with nationalization. While benefiting some individuals, the social security program is often controversial in its effectiveness; it is disadvantageous for veterans and a burden to the national budget. On average social security costs $725 billion annually, comprising of 20 percent of the federal budget, which exceeds national income by 1 trillion dollars annually.Examining even more attempts at nationalization such as the New Deal, Medicare, and Medicaid reveals that similar issues plague them all. Quite simply, America has a problem with nationalization.Nationalization in America does not work because conformity costs are too high. In the case of the railroads, it was too difficult for the federal government to meet the demands of various states while also meeting military demands. In the case of social security, differing states have differing population sizes and differing numbers of retirees, complicating the allocation of spending between states.In the case of Obamacare, the same issue applies. States are allocated money by the federal government, but the needs of people in different states differ, as does efficiency of state allocation of funds. Hawaii, for example, outspent all other states in terms of its federal Obamacare funds allocation by nearly 70 million dollars. With the fewest number of enrollees, at 5,744, the amount of money spent per enrollee was on average, $35,749, nearly 10,000 dollars more than the next highest average spending state and 20,000 dollars more than the third highest. A chief reason for this discrepancy is that each state differs in demographic and institutional structure. Each state differs in income, industry, and its ability to implement such a system. That is why “Romneycare,” a similar policy as Obamacare implemented at the state level (in Massachusetts) was successful, while the ACA has failed. America is too diverse a nation to attempt to blanket any one large scale policy across all states.While nationalization in some other countries such as France or the United Kingdom may work, the difference in the United States is the inherent emphasis on the power of states rather than the federal government. States in America have a long-held tradition of greater political power in comparison to other provinces and regions of different countries, a fact made explicitly clear in the United States Constitution.The design of Obamacare is not inherently flawed ― at least, that is not the reason for its inability to function properly. Republican Governors who have refused to comply with Obamacare are not at fault either. Rather, the overarching trend in American history has been that nationalization in America simply does not work.Historically, attempts to nationalize have often been futile in the United States. The nationalization of the railroad industry lasted two years. After the Great Depression was over, the New Deal dissolved. Most recently, it appears as if Obamacare is threatened as well. With the election of Donald Trump as President, a man who repeatedly has stated that “Obamacare is a disaster” that “has to be repealed,” and Republican control of the House and Senate, it is speculated that Obamacare will soon be repealed. If this feat is accomplished, a feat that Republicans have been attempting to achieve since the first day the ACA passed, it would make Obamacare the next in a line of failed attempts at U.S. nationalization for the history books.This article was originally published in print in the Berkeley Political Review: Fall 2016 Issue."

Madonna was among a host of celebrities who joined the Women’s March on Washington Saturday, in solidarity with the hundreds of thousands of women marching in the capital and around the country the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration.The singer, who has been vocal about her distaste for the former reality TV star since the beginning of his campaign, took the stage in D.C. to deliver an impassioned and profanity-laced speech about the importance of a political moment that forces everyone to “wake the fuck up.” “Welcome to the revolution of love, to the rebellion, to our refusal as women to accept this new age of tyranny, where not just women are in danger, but all marginalized people,” she said. “It took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the fuck up. It seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort that justice would prevail and that good would win in the end. Well, good did not win this election, but good will win in the end.”Madonna went on to issue a simple message to those who believe the Women’s March will amount to little political action: “Fuck you.”“Yes, I’m angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this won’t change anything,” she continued. “We cannot fall into despair.”The speech was broadcast live on a variety of different television networks. According to The Hollywood Reporter, CNN and MSNBC cut away from Madonna after the singer dropped her third F-bomb, with CNN’s Brooke Baldwin later apologizing to the audience. C-SPAN, however, continued to cover her remarks uninterrupted. “I just need to apologize for the multiple f-bombs by Madonna,” Baldwin said. “That happens, and we apologize here at CNN for that.”After closing her speech with a powerful quote from poet W. H. Auden, the pop star performed “Express Yourself” and “Human Nature.” But it wouldn’t be a Madonna show without one last dig, so she dedicated her final song to “DT.”“The new DT in the White House,” she said. “’D’ could stand for dick. I don’t know.”But later in the song, she made things abundantly clear by changing the lyrics to “Donald Trump, suck a dick.”Watch her full speech below: "

Numerous people pointed out on social media that Trump’s tie was abnormally long.Stephen Colbert also made fun of Trump’s tie length, saying, “You can use it for all sorts of things, for hiding an erection for instance, which I will not have for four years now.”"

Women wore “pussyhats” and “pussy protectors,” items referencing that Trump has bragged about groping women. But for at least five of these women, the march was personal. The man they claim sexually assaulted them is now president. “It’s not right for anyone, let alone the president, to speak about nor treat women in the way that he has,” said Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah USA who says Trump kissed her on the lips without consent when she was 21. She told reporters that she was anxious about leaving her three children to fly to D.C., and that she’s afraid of large crowds and facing political backlash. But, she said, “I want my children to see that I am willing to face my fears.”She also tearfully cited her brother with disabilities — who died by suicide last month — as another reason she decided to march. She said she couldn’t help but think of how Trump publicly mocked a reporter with disabilities.More than a dozen women have accused the president of sexual assault, including groping or kissing without consent. Many of them came forward during the presidential campaign, after video surfaced of Trump boasting that he could grab women “by the pussy.” Trump denied their claims and promised to sue all of his accusers, a threat that has not yet materialized.Summer Zervos, who says Trump sexually assaulted her in a hotel room in 2007, sued him this week for defamation. She noted that she would be willing to drop the lawsuit if the president retracts his statements about her and acknowledges she’s telling the truth. She said on Saturday that she was protesting “to show others who have been bullied that you can have the courage to stand up to bullies and to people who are in power.” She was joined by Jessica Drake, an adult film star who says Trump kissed her without permission and offered her money to spend the night, and Rachel Crooks, who claims Trump kissed her inappropriately when she was 22. Crooks, a late addition to the group, said she took a seven-hour bus ride from Ohio to show solidarity with the other accusers and “all women.”“Like many, I am horrified by the potential upcoming administration and fear the consequences it will have,” Drake said. The four women marched down a D.C. street with attorney Gloria Allred, holding a banner that read: “Women Seeking Justice Against Trump.”Cathy Heller, another Trump accuser, reserved an Amtrak car to bring supporters from New York City to D.C. for the protest. She had more than 40 commitments in little over the week and called the group “Cathy’s Train.”She carried a sign on Saturday that read, “The Noisy Majority.” She told The Huffington Post that she never made it to the actual march route. But she noted that she did have the opportunity to walk past the Trump Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, and she was pleased to hear the crowd shouting: “Shame! Shame!”"

92,POLITICS,Hundreds Of Thousands Of Protesters Welcome Donald Trump To Washington,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womens-march-dc_us_58837044e4b096b4a231ee7e,Pussy power!,2017-01-21,Pink pussyhats have become a symbol of the movement.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5883b80a170000880192b73b.jpeg?ops=crop_0_178_3600_2214%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The nation’s capital was a sea of pink Saturday as women ― and many men ― from all over the country streamed into the city to speak out as an opposition force the day after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president.Hundreds of thousands of people ― many wearing pink “pussyhats” ― turned out for the Women’s March on Washington, with more joining hundreds of sister demonstrations around the world. Organizers said Saturday morning that they expected half a million people to attend the D.C. march, double their initial estimate. “I’ve heard a lot of people say they think, ‘Oh, this is useless. It’s just a big party and a big show.’ But I think it can create forward momentum and people will keep resisting. I don’t think it’s a big party,” said Sally Madsen, 65, a Washington, D.C., resident whose sister from Minnesota was joining her at the march. “I think we have to show that we’re still here, and we’re not going to be silent and we’re not going to be railroaded.”People have been preparing for this event since the day after the election, when word began to spread on social media that there would be a march for women following the inauguration. “How do you not hear about this march?” said Rob Neff, 46, who came from Baltimore with friends for the march.As of Saturday morning, the Women’s March seemed on pace to perhaps draw more people than Trump’s inauguration. There were widespread accounts on social media that the metro system was jam-packed, with people unable to get on trains or smushed together with their fellow marchers when they were lucky enough to squeeze in.The D.C. metro reported that ridership at 11:00 a.m. was at 275,000, which is eight times what it is on a normal Saturday and even busier than on most weekdays. The transit system said inauguration ridership was the lowest in years ― basically the same as a normal Friday. By 11 a.m. on Inauguration Day, metro ridership was at 193,000.The Women’s March also drew far more starpower than Trump’s inauguration, which wasn’t able to attract big-name performers. Even the acts it did get ― the Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, for example ― were mired in controversy as performers were unhappy that they were being asked to dance or sing for a man they disliked. The Women’s March boasted a lineup of speakers, performers and attendees that included feminist icon Gloria Steinem, actress Scarlett Johansson, singers Janelle Monáe and Madonna, and filmmaker Michael Moore. “This is the upside of the downside. This is an outpouring of energy and true democracy like I have never seen in my very long life,” Steinem said to the cheering crowd. “It is wide in age, it is deep in diversity, and remember, the Constitution does not begin with ‘I the president,’ it begins with, ‘We the people.’ So don’t try to divide us!”Women who have been personally hurt by Trump came to the city as well. Cathy Heller, one of more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual harassment or assault, also came to the march in an Amtrak car full of supporters to protest his inauguration. There weren’t many Trump fans at the march Saturday. But not everyone cited opposition to the new president as the reason they were marching, although his election and what he campaigned on laid beneath the entire day.Helen Brock was among a group of Flint, Michigan, residents who came in a bus to urge Trump to address the city’s water problems. She ended up moving 15 miles outside Flint because her hair was starting to fall out.She said she’s not a Trump supporter, but “I’m going to give him the benefit of the doubt, because I really don’t have a choice.” Nellis Kennedy-Howard, who is Navajo, came to the march with her wife and colleagues from the Sierra Club, where she works. Pointing to the statistic on her sign, she said, “We don’t want to promote rape culture any further than the problem that we already have, and this president is not doing a very good job of modeling that type of behavior.” There were still a few Trump supporters wandering around downtown D.C. Saturday. One man who was in town for the inauguration with his family from Ohio ― and was conspicuously sporting a “Make America Great Again” hat ― said they just really wanted to see the White House, even though they knew the march would be happening.“They have their day, we had ours. ... We’re all still one America,” he said.Two vendors selling Trump gear said that while they had great business Friday, they weren’t so successful Saturday.Dana Liebelson contributed reporting.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

Carrying signs with slogans like “a woman’s place is in the White House” and singing anti-Trump songs, the crowd represented part of the outraged international reaction to the new U.S. president and his administration. Some participants waited more than an hour in the cold to begin marching, but passed the time with chants and excited discussion about why the protest mattered to them.Cara Spelman, 22, said she saw similarities between Trump and some far-right movements across Europe.“Everyone’s just kinda out here because it’s the last straw, I think, with Brexit and this, and France and hyper-nationalism. Everyone’s just sick of it. That’s why I’m here,” she said. “People are kind of sick of this wave of bigotry.”Spelman, a graduate student in gender studies at University College London, said she also joined the rally to push for abortion rights in her native Ireland, where the practice is currently illegal.Some marchers brought their children, including Kate O’Sullivan, who said she wanted the world to see that protesters “are not just troublemakers.”“It’s important that she knows” what’s going on the world, O’Sullivan said of her 4-year-old daughter, Lilly. “I hope she doesn’t have to remember this day but if she does I hope it’s for this.”Millie Colwey, 27, came with her husband and 7-year-old daughter.“You gotta start them young, before they even come out,” said Colwey, who is pregnant. Although women made up the visible majority of demonstrators, the march was open to all. Ryan Cattle, 22, said he thought it was important for men to show up too.“It’s so important that men are getting involved,” he said. “There’s gonna be no substantial progress in the near future unless everyone gets behind this.”London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has repeatedly spoken out against Trump’s policies, was also present at the demonstration.“As a feminist in City Hall, I fully support the fight for gender equality,” Khan said before the march. “It’s wrong that in 2017 someone’s life chances and fundamental rights are still dependent on their gender.”Nearly 700 sister marches in over 60 countries were scheduled for Saturday in solidarity with the Women’s March on Washington, according to organizers. Australia and New Zealand held some of the first marches planned for the day. Thousands of people rallied in Sydney and Melbourne, many of whom wore pink “pussy hats” in reference to a widely viewed video of Trump boasting about being able to grab women’s genitals without consent. In France, where the far-right National Front party is running an election campaign similar to that of Trump’s, demonstrators marched in a number of cities. A rally in Paris gathered a large crowd brandishing signs against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower.Demonstrators also marched in Kenya, where Barack Obama’s father was born, walking through Karura forest in the capital of Nairobi.Thousands of people in Canada also marched, including in the cities of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. Demonstrators in Toronto closed down major roads by marching from Queen’s Park to City Hall. Brennan Kirby was at the Toronto event with his mother, and said he felt that the rally was necessary to show support for people who are afraid of Trump’s administration.“As part of a global society, I think it’s important to come out and show solidarity with progressives, women, LGBT and minority communities,” Kirby said. “We’re not turning our back because of a choice that some Americans made.”A few of the signs at the Toronto march took aim at Canadian politician Kellie Leitch, who is running to lead the Conservative Party and has a populist, anti-immigration platform with rhetoric similar to Trump’s. A number of the marches featured signs that reflected both opposition to Trump and to local politicians they see as supportive of his policies. One protester in Tel Aviv a held a placard featuring Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shaking hands with Trump and the caption “existential threat.”Demonstrators at rallies around the world ― in major cities like Oslo and Barcelona, as well as from smaller gatherings on the Virgin Islands and in Puerto Rico ― flooded social media with videos and images from their respective marches as they joined together to advocate for women’s rights and show solidarity with the Washington march.This article has been updated with more details about marches around the world.
