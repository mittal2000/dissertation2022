John Faso (R-N.Y.) voted for the GOP health care bill. Some of his constituents are pretty mad about it.,2017-05-09,"Andrea Mitchell, left, and Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) address a town hall meeting on health care reform Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5912128d1e00003a00622175.jpeg?ops=crop_90_158_1820_766%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"KINGSTON, N.Y. — The residents of New York’s 19th Congressional District have some questions about the health care bill that House Republicans passed last week. Unfortunately for them, Rep. John Faso, the local Republican who voted for the legislation, isn’t around to answer them right now.Congress is on recess this week, but most House Republicans aren’t holding open town hall meetings in their districts. Seeing an opportunity to make hay over the unpopular bill, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat from New York’s neighboring 18th District, paid a visit to Faso’s home territory Monday evening for an event organized by Maloney’s re-election campaign and local progressive groups.“Hey, listen. I have a question for you. I’m Representative Sean Patrick Maloney. Where the heck is your congressman?” he said. “As of tonight, I have now done more open, no-holds-barred public town hall meetings in New York 19 than John Faso has.”Billed as a town hall, Monday’s gathering was more akin to a rally. Maloney stoked the friendly audience into applause, whoops and hollers as he took questions and speechified over the course of more than 90 minutes.Maloney hatched this “Adopt a District” plan during an appearance on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” last week, and it might catch on. In Arizona, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D) is expected to travel to the district of Rep. Martha McSally (R) for a public event Tuesday.The crowd seemed happy to hear Maloney’s criticism of the American Health Care Act ― and his jabs at Faso, who the Democrat said was attending a fundraiser in Albany that night. “You may have noticed we have two stools here,” Maloney said at one point. “One is for me. This one is for John Faso, in case he shows up.”“I’m here tonight because I’m pissed off that John Faso won’t have a town hall,” Catherine Joyner, a resident of Faso’s district, told HuffPost before the event. “I think he’s not here because he’s a big, old, fat coward, that’s why. He’s refusing to talk to the general public. It’s ridiculous.”Just 17 of 238 House Republicans have town hall meetings scheduled during the lower chamber’s two-week break from Washington, according to a list compiled by the Town Hall Project.It’s not hard to see why: President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hurried the health care bill through the House, making significant changes to the legislation just before the vote, and asking GOP lawmakers to go along without an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and amid widespread criticism of the plan.Earlier on Monday, Faso appeared at a meeting of the New York Statewide Senior Action Council elsewhere in his district. According to Ulster County Executive Mike Hein (D), who spoke at Maloney’s event, questions for Faso at that meeting were pre-screened.At the evening event in Kingston, Faso took a beating in absentia ― the audience chanted “No-show Faso!” ― but he did avoid the attacks other House Republicans have endured over health care, like Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa), who had a rough day Monday.Anxiety over the health care bill’s gigantic cuts to Medicaid and its weakening of the Affordable Care Act’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions has stoked political activism among people in Faso’s district who haven’t been much involved before, Joyner said.“I’ve been out canvassing in New Paltz, New York, twice now,” said Joyner, who’s volunteering with a local chapter of the grassroots movement known as Indivisible. “I have not had anyone tell us they they were a Faso fan.”“Everybody’s very, very concerned about the way John Faso voted for health care, and everybody seems to be as scared as I am,” she went on.Renee Woodward, who also lives in Faso’s district, agreed.“I haven’t been politically active, like, really since college. But things have gotten so out of whack, and I was feeling very angry and depressed,” she said. “I was very upset when the bill passed the House, and I also think it’s going to be a disaster for millions of Americans.”One of those people could be Andrea Mitchell, a woman who made news in February when she spoke to Faso during a rally outside his home in Kinderhook, New York. Mitchell told Faso she had a brain tumor and other serious medical issues, and that she’d lost her insurance due to her health before the Affordable Care Act made that illegal.Faso hugged Mitchell that day and promised to protect her health care. He would ultimately vote for the American Health Care Act.At Maloney’s event Monday, Mitchell rose to tell her story again.“The burden of the bill to keep someone that you love alive is not something that any family in America ― or anywhere in the world, but especially in America ― should ever have to deal with,” she said.“John Faso,” she said, pausing for a moment, “was less than sincere in that promise.”Maloney urged the audience members to get active, and to think about running for office. “The good news is, there are a lot of people who can be in Congress, ladies and gentlemen,” he said. “Next year, we’re going to have an opportunity to change the whole course of this thing.”Maloney said Faso would pay a “big price” for his health care vote, and Democrats have their eyes on this seat in 2018, but it will almost certainly be a challenge. Faso defeated progressive Democrat Zephyr Teachout last year by more than 9 percentage points, and Trump beat Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton by nearly 7 percentage points in this district.Outside the meeting hall after Monday’s event, Gareth Rhodes, a Kingston native and former aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), told HuffPost he planned to take a run at Faso’s seat anyway. Rhodes said he’d filed the necessary paperwork earlier that day. “Last Thursday was the last straw for me,” he said, referring to the House passing the GOP bill. “I’m going to stand up. I’m going to fight back.”Gemma Sapwell contributed reporting."
1,POLITICS,Paul Ryan Visits A NYC Classroom That Would Lose If His Health Care Bill Wins,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-school-visit-harlem-success-academy-protests_us_59123326e4b05e1ca202cc78,Protesters greet the House speaker as he arrives at a controversial charter school.,2017-05-09,Protesters gather in front of a Harlem charter school before the expected visit of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591233611e00002800622207.jpeg?cache=f2TJxzcO6K&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Speaker Paul Ryan was greeted by a swarm of protesters during a visit Tuesday to Success Academy Harlem 1, a member of New York City’s largest charter school network. Demonstrators chanted “Shame! Shame!” as the Wisconsin Republican entered the school, and they held up signs, most of which criticized his position on health care. Ryan’s is the latest in a series of visits by high-profile Republicans invited to the controversial public school, including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and presidential daughter Ivanka Trump. His visit comes less than a week after the House passed his health care bill, which would strip insurance coverage from 24 million Americans.There’s another layer to Ryan’s visit. Success, which focuses on high achievement and top test scores, shares a building with P.S. 811, a District 75 public school that predominantly serves underprivileged children with special needs. Some parents attending the protest told Gothamist that specific programming for the special needs students had been cut, which made Ryan’s visit, which focused on Success Academy, disappointing.Ryan did visit a classroom at P.S. 811 before his visit to Success Academy. Mindy Rosier, a special education teacher at the public school, told HuffPost that it was a high-functioning autism class that “wouldn’t have given him too many problems.” Students at P.S. 811 are predominantly low income, in foster care or homeless in addition to having special needs, Rosier said. (School administrators did not return a request for comment.) “They all get money from the state to help serve their needs,” she said. “If this health care bill goes through, that money would be slashed, so that could affect every single one of my students ― and that’s just health care, not even looking at school funding.” School districts rely on Medicaid to provide services to special needs students. The health care law proposed by Ryan would slash Medicaid funding by $880 billion over 10 years while capping the funding given to certain demographics (like children or the elderly). And, if the funding goes, districts would still be required under law to provide services to special needs students.Another controversial aspect of Ryan’s visit is Success CEO Eva Moskowitz, who was briefly floated as a nominee to serve as President Donald Trump’s secretary of education. She’s also been an avid supporter of current Secretary of Education Betsey DeVos and often defends Trump’s positions, which are widely unpopular among her teaching staff. “Eva Moskowitz tries to paint herself as a champion for New York’s children. But today she has shown her true colors by standing with Paul Ryan, fresh off House passage of his healthcare law, that would eliminate coverage for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers,” Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party, said in a statement. Ryan released a statement following his visit. “Touring Success Academy, listening to these great kids and their committed teachers, hearing their stories. The quality of teacher training and preparedness was extraordinary. They have a lot to be proud of, and these remarkable kids are getting a great education. That’s what matters — giving every kid a fair shot at the American Dream.”"
2,POLITICS,Census Director Quits Just As The Census Ramps Up,Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/census-director-quits_us_5911d4afe4b05e1ca201e583,"Facing a major budget crunch, the man who was counting the U.S. population for Trump is resigning.",2017-05-09,"Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas) speaks during a news conference in Washington, D.C., Feb. 12, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5911eaab17000020005a596b.jpeg?cache=k8ZUysqjAT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The director of the U.S. Census Bureau is resigning, the Commerce Department announced Tuesday, leaving the government’s lead statistical agency without a clear leader as the bureau ramps up for the massive decennial task of counting the entire U.S. population in 2020.Census Bureau Director John Thompson’s announcement that he is leaving at the end of June comes less than a week after he testified on Capitol Hill, telling House appropriators that his agency would be able to carry out the Census effectively, despite a number of cost overruns and a lower budget than normal for this point in the 10-year planning cycle.Normally as Census planning shifts from the seventh year of the decade to the eighth, the budget jumps dramatically. But Congress did not pass the Obama administration’s budget for 2017, leaving the bureau about $160 million short of its $1.61 billion request. The Trump administration’s request for 2018 is essentially flatlined, at a time when the government is usually adding hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out one of the most challenging statistical counts in the world.On May 3, Thompson told Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas), the appropriations subcommittee chairman overseeing the Census budget, that the bureau would be able to meet the challenges of carrying out the Census in new and cheaper ways.“We’re glad we’re a priority,” Thompson said of Trump’s budget proposal. “We’re very, very happy about that, and we’re looking forward to that process.”Thompson’s term expired last December, but he had been expected to stay for the rest of this year, as called for under law when a successor has not been chosen.In a brief statement confirming Thompson’s resignation, the Commerce Department said he was retiring and would pursue opportunities in the private sector.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross thanked Thompson for his service but offered no explanation for his abrupt departure. No successor was announced, and the deputy director’s position is currently vacant.Ross did highlight the importance of the succeeding at the decennial Census, even as the Bureau is losing its director and lacks a deputy.“A complete and accurate Census is an important and monumental task, and your experience will be greatly missed,” Ross said of Thompson.In an email obtained by HuffPost, Thompson told staffers that he was leaving now to give the Trump team time to select its own leader.“I feel now is the right time for me to announce that I plan to retire on June 30,” the message said. It went on to express confidence that the Bureau will carry out what amounts to groundbreaking work in enumerating the national population.“This will allow Secretary Ross and the current administration sufficient time to put in the proper leadership to guide the Census Bureau through the 2017 Economic Census, the 2020 Census and beyond,” Thompson said, referring also to the survey of some 4 million American businesses that goes into determining the nation’s economic health.“A highly capable career management team is in place, and the next few years are critical for the agency,” Thompson said.While the Commerce Department did not specify a reason for Thompson’s quitting, one source familiar with the matter said Ross had been unhappy with Thompson’s testimony last Wednesday.Another source said an acting head would be chosen in the “coming days,” with a permanent selection made “in due course.”A spokesman did not immediately answer questions about a meeting that Thompson and Ross had after the May 3 hearing. Thompson sent his resignation later Monday, the source said.Census data is the key component in drawing congressional districts and in distributing hundreds of billions of federal dollars to states and localities. Businesses also depend heavily on the data for strategic planning.The choice of who will lead the most important count of Americans now falls to the Trump administration.

3,BLACK VOICES,Burying The Bodies After Politically Charged Killings,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/burying-violent-crime-victims_us_59121228e4b0a58297e0152a,"For decades, the Hughes Family Tribute Center has celebrated the lives of victims of violent crime.",2017-05-09,Stephanie and DeWayne Hughes run a funeral home that specializes in services for victims of violent crime. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591213a31700001f005a5a52.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DALLAS, Texas ― Stephanie Hughes hadn’t planned to become a funeral home director. But her light-heartedness and intuitive sense of empathy made for a natural fit when she married into the business six years ago, casting aside a career as an attorney. Now, alongside her husband DeWayne, she comes face to face with the politically charged violence that has become a fixture of the national news cycle. Teens shot by police, victims of drunk drivers, fallen gang members and officers killed in the line of duty have all come to rest at the Hughes Family Tribute Center, which has carved out a niche serving the families of violent crime victims. “We love all our families,” Hughes said. “It doesn’t matter how they get here.” Dallas is not a particularly violent city. Its homicide rate of 10.7 per 100,000 in 2015 was the city’s fourth-lowest since local police first started tracking the figure, according to the Dallas Morning News.But Dallas has also experienced a number of high-profile and at times racially charged homicides. Most recently, Officer Roy Oliver used a rifle to shoot Jordan Edwards, a black teenager, as Edwards and a group of friends drove away from a party. Oliver, who is white, was fired and now faces a murder charge. Edwards was buried in a private service in the town of Mesquite, outside Dallas, on Saturday. Last year, Micah Xavier Johnson fatally shot five Dallas police officers downtown, reportedly driven by a desire to kill white cops.The impact of fatal violent crime is firmly on display at a victim’s funeral, where everyone comes together to say goodbye to someone lost too soon. HuffPost visited the Hughes Family Tribute Center to find out how the center orchestrates such events and provides comfort to distraught family members.DeWayne Hughes’ grandfather, a devotee of the Assemblies of God, founded the family’s funeral home company in 1946. The Hugheses aim to make services affordable for people of any faith. They’re assisted by the state of Texas, which runs a Crime Victims Fund that pays $6,500 to cover funeral costs for people who die as the result of violence.The Hughes family likely takes on more than its share of violent crime victims. But state payments are notoriously slow to get disbursed, routinely taking between six months to a year to pay out. “Sometimes funeral homes won’t mention [the fund],” Stephanie Hughes said. “Or they refuse to do it.” And they have the added challenge of helping families navigate grief after a loved one has been all over the news. When HuffPost visited the center last week, Hughes was meeting with the family of Janeera Gonzalez, who was killed on May 3 in a murder-suicide at North Lake College in a Dallas suburb by a man who was allegedly stalking her. In March of last year, they hosted the funeral of 16-year-old José Cruz, who was shot to death by off-duty police officer Ken Johnson.The widely publicized violence weighs on the Hugheses, who aim to offer a neutral place for people to commemorate someone who has died. When politicized violence is involved ― as it was in Cruz’s death ― their job is complicated by the fact that families are often understandably consumed by anger, which robs them of time and energy for grieving. “Murder’s a tough one,” Stephanie Hughes told HuffPost from the waiting room of the home, which was decorated with floral wallpaper and dark wood furniture. “And when it’s murder by someone you’re supposed to trust, it’s even harder.” Cruz’s service exemplified how difficult it is for families when their relative’s death becomes a public event. It became a flashpoint over police accountability, and reporters flocked to the service. Hughes said she found the journalists respectful, but their presence was also intrusive at times. She insisted they use just one camera and share the tape, since every reporter inside the chapel meant one less space for a family member or friend.“The service was all about justice and not about healing,” Stephanie told HuffPost. “I was balancing between helping the family heal while letting them get the publicity they needed, without it becoming a circus.” One year later, after the news story faded from the front pages, the family held a second service to remember Cruz.Serving crime victims has also given the Hughes family other unique capabilities, including the ability to prepare the deceased for an open casket service regardless of how he or she died. Most embalmers can mask a bullet wound in the face by suturing the torn skin and covering the blemish with wax and makeup. But if a bullet ricochets through the cranium, it can leave a shattered skull behind. To all but the most skilled embalmers, that means draping the skin of the face over a collapsed pile of bone with nothing to hold it in place. Unable to make the face recognizable, many embalmers will consider displaying the body a lost cause.DeWayne Hughes, however, belongs to a small subset of embalmers who operate more like plastic surgeons. He became a licensed embalmer in 1983, and likens his work to that of an archeologist who assembles shattered pieces of pottery back to their original form. Hughes says he learned those skills out of a sense of obligation to the families. A closed-casket funeral can leave people in denial that their loved one is dead, he explained.“We always felt it’s important for families to see the body,” he said. “Your mind will give you a lot of different things. And if someone tells you [the deceased] can’t be seen, you think the worst. And you spend the rest of your life with the image your mind created. And most of the time, it’s nowhere nearly that bad.” Sometimes the damage is too extensive for even Hughes to mend. This month, a young man who died in a car accident couldn’t avoid a closed-casket service. Instead, Hughes left his hands exposed so the family could at least see some part of him. The family business has been part of Hughes’ life from the time he was old enough to pick up a vase of flowers or help unpack a van. In the decades since, he says he can’t tell whether violent crime has gone up or down ― only that he sees it in spurts. Like his wife, he feels a strong connection to local police, whom the Hughes Family Tribute Center has served in the past. But when the wrongful deaths of people like José Cruz happen, he believes it’s important for the courts to punish the guilty swiftly so the families can begin to heal. “It’s like this young man in Mesquite,” DeWayne said, referring to Jordan Edwards. “The family need their time. Hopefully, they’ll get it and justice will be served quickly, so they can move on.”  "

Waters also shared a news segment about her viral breastfeeding moment on Facebook, where she noted, “We need more family-friendly and flexible workplaces, and affordable childcare, for everyone.”Waters is the latest in a slew of women politicians who have nursed their babies in parliaments throughout the world. In October, Icelandic Member of Parliament Unnur Brá Konráðsdóttir breastfed her infant daughter while defending a bill.In January 2016, Spanish parliamentarian Carolina Bescansa nursed her 5-month-old son, Diego, at work in an effort to reportedly highlight the struggles working mothers face. And in July 2015, Argentinian legislator and human rights activist Victoria Donda Pérez attracted a lot of attention for breastfeeding her 8-month-old daughter, Trilce, during a parliamentary session. While the politicians received some backlash, they stood by their decisions to feed their babies."

7,POLITICS,California Is Being Sued For Making Voter Registration Too Complicated,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-voting-rights-lawsuit_us_59121bd1e4b05e1ca20286f8,Voting access isn't just a red state issue.,2017-05-09,A new lawsuit alleges that California doesn't make it easy enough to address voter registration when people renew their driver's licenses by mail.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59121e901600002000c5a4a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"California voting rights groups announced Tuesday they had filed a lawsuit against the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Transportation for failing for comply with a federal law that makes it easier for people to register to vote. The National Voter Registration Act requires that driver’s license applications and renewal forms also serve as a federal voter registration form. The lawsuit ― filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by the ACLU of Northern California, Demos, Project Vote and others ― alleges the state is not letting residents adequately register to vote when they renew their driver’s license by mail. When Californians renew their licenses, the complaint says, they have to fill out a separate form to register to vote or stay registered. On that form, they must repeat much of the same information they provide to the DMV, including their name, driver’s license number, social security number, date of birth and address.“The goal of the NVRA was to make voter registration easier and more seamless by integrating the information already collected by the DMV to get people registered,” Kathay Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, said in a statement. “It’s an embarrassment that in 2017, more than 20 years after the law was enacted, California DMV is still violating the law by making millions of people jump through hoops to become voters.”People who renew their license in person can address their voter registration on their renewal form. In Fiscal Year 2015-2016, about 1 million people applied for renewals by mail, while 3 million applied in person, according to data from the California DMV. “It is simply unacceptable for the DMV to deny seamless voter registration to millions of Californians who renew their licenses by mail,” Helen Hutchison, president of the League of Women Voters of California, said in the statement. “While we appreciate the work the DMV did to create an integrated voter registration process for people who go to their offices or renew their licenses and IDs online, others should be given the same opportunity.”In October of 2015, following a year of very low voter turnout in the state, California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a law that will automatically register people to vote when they go to the DMV. Oregon, which was the first state to adopt automatic voter registration, has already seen increases in the number of people registered since implementing the law.A 2015 report by Demos found that California had one of the country’s the lowest ratios of DMV voter registration applications to DMV transactions, between 0.01 and 0.1. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of the League of Women Voters of California, ACCE Institute, California Common Cause, and the National Council of La Raza. Activists have been threatening to bring such litigation in the state for the last two years, and the lawsuit notes the plaintiffs have been working with state officials to bring them into compliance with NVRA for in-person and online registration during that period.“California has been in compliance with the National Voter Registration Act for decades,” DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez said in a statement. “Today’s lawsuit serves as an unfortunate distraction from ongoing joint efforts by the Secretary of State’s office and the DMV to further improve the voter registration process in California, which already exceeds the voter registration obligations set forth in the National Voter Registration Act.”“The Secretary of State’s office and the DMV remain committed to meet the needs of all Californians and to enhance voter registration opportunities for the millions of eligible Californians who do business with the DMV,” Gonzalez added.Sam Mahood, a spokesman for California Secretary of State Alex Padilla (D), said Padilla would continue to make voting easier.“I remain committed to strengthening voting rights, and ensuring all eligible California citizens can participate in our elections,” Padilla said. “The Secretary of State’s office will continue working diligently with stakeholders and the DMV to expand voter registration opportunities.”"

That’s when all hell appears to break loose. “Oh my god!” Martin exclaims as Buddy turns into a white blur that bolts around his home as his owner gives chase.Those concerned over Buddy’s plight should fear not. The video concludes with his owner carefully removing the bag from the now calmed cat, securing his freedom. A second video uploaded a day later showed Buddy snoozing on the couch with a feline companion giving him a snuggle (which he no doubt needed).“He was totally fine after.

That’s when all hell appears to break loose. “Oh my god!” Martin exclaims as Buddy turns into a white blur that bolts around his home as his owner gives chase.Those concerned over Buddy’s plight should fear not.

But like a lot of women, I too struggled with postpartum depression after my first baby was born.”Gellar and her husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., have two children ― 7-year-old Charlotte and 4-year-old Rocky. In her Instagram caption, the actress said she sought help for her mental health struggles and “made it through.”“[E]very day since has been the best gift I could ever have asked for. To those of you going through this, know that you’re not alone and that it really does get better,” she wrote. “And if you believe that postpartum depression should be covered by healthcare, please take a moment and go to callmecongress.com today, find your rep’s numbers and let them know.” She added the hashtag #NotAPreExistingCondition.Gellar’s conclusion is, of course, a reference to the American Health Care Act and more specifically the MacArthur-Meadows amendment, which would allow states to request a waiver opting out of federal regulations meant to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions.Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act under President Obama, insurance companies could deny coverage or charge higher premiums due to people with preexisting conditions, which include mental health issues like postpartum depression.

No team recorded a better offensive efficiency rating, scored more points or dominated the fast-break more than the Warriors all year. When you have a quartet like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, it certainly makes sense.Meanwhile, Golden State’s defensive excellence has been well-documented, but is perhaps not fully understood. How the team goes about it is just as impressive. The Warriors don’t simply guard teams ― they overwhelm them; suffocate them, even. To hamstring an NBA opponent is a tall task. It requires all five players’ commitment. It also requires versatility, and that’s where the Dubs separate themselves. How many guys can switch ball screens? How many wing players can guard the low post? How many can protect the rim? Interchangeable pieces and versatility are crucial.In the Warriors’ first-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, we saw Head Coach Steve Kerr employ a hybrid lineup. Remember the so-called “death lineup” last year? With Durant’s rare 1-through-5 defensive ability, this is a modified version of that, only even more effective.Green, Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Ian Clark and David West blitzed Portland, coaxing the Blazers into a 1-12 stretch with four turnovers to start the fourth quarter. What had been a close, hard-fought battle turned into a double-digit victory.This happened once again in Golden State’s Game 1 victory over the Utah Jazz. The quintet started the fourth and blitzed the Jazz with a 10-0 run that essentially sealed the game ― a game in which the Dubs connected on just 24 percent of their threes. Through their eight games this postseason ― all wins ― the Warriors have amassed a postseason best 96.9 defensive rating that’s nearly four points better than any other team’s. They have also outscored opponents by 16.5 points per game, one of the best marks ever compiled.Interim Head Coach Mike Brown, who is filling in for the injured Kerr, keeps a simple approach: “Defensively, let’s be locked in and try to limit the mistakes,” he said after his club’s 121-95 victory in Game 4 to close out the Jazz.Green is the linchpin of it all. The 27-year-old ― who will soon earn his third straight First-Team All-NBA Defense selection ― isn’t so much a stopper as he is a finely tuned Swiss army knife. He blocks shots, drives point guards insane, and as always, sets the tone as only he can.“Draymond was amazing,” Kerr said after a 121-109 Game 1 win over the Blazers. “He made some tremendous defensive plays. He made threes. He rebounded the ball. He had nine assists. He played a game that I’m not sure anyone else in the league is capable [of], honestly. He’s so unique, and so important to us. He’s phenomenal.”Green’s unique ability was once again on display during Game 1 of a second-round series versus the Jazz. Not only did he check All-Star wing Gordon Hayward; he also guarded the red-hot Joe Johnson and even 7-foot-1-inch center Rudy Gobert. Hayward and Johnson ― the team’s top two offensive threats in the playoffs ― combined for a measly 23 points on 8-25 shooting in the loss.With Green as dominant defensively as he’s ever been, the real boon to the Warriors has been Durant. He’s not only one of the truly great scorers in league history, but also one of today’s most versatile defensive weapons. At 7 feet tall, he's a legitimate rim protector even though he’s often guarding wings. His length and dexterity allow him to cover different types of players.This year, he averaged a career-best 1.6 blocks per game while holding opponents to 44.8 percent shooting, per NBA.com. Additionally, he ranked sixth in the league in defensive win shares (Green was first), ahead of known lockdown defenders like Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Andre Roberson.“Very unusual defensive player,” Ron Adams ― the Warriors’ defensive guru ― told The Mercury News in February. “He’s a great helper, very good at making passes difficult. ...

Police suspect suicide but have provided no details.“There was evidence that our detectives were able to locate that suggested this was a suicide,” Fayetteville police Lt. Todd Joyce told The Portland Press Herald in Maine.Rollins, 23, and her active-duty boyfriend, Jarren Heng, 26, were charged last month with animal cruelty and conspiracy. Police investigators said that Rollins had videotaped herself and her boyfriend tying her frightened dog to a tree, then shooting it in the head several times with a rifle, and laughing. The dog can be heard groaning on the video after the first shot as he falls to the ground, but the dog is still moving several shots later. Rollins later posted the video on Facebook.Rollins had previously posted on Facebook that she was looking for a new home for the dog and had finally found a place for him. “Sad he has to go, but he will be much happier where he is heading off to,” she wrote.“They can be heard on the tape laughing and giggling as the dog was being killed,” Cumberland County Assistant District Attorney Clark Reaves said at the couple’s first court appearance in April, The Fayetteville Observer reported.A man claiming to be Rollins’ estranged husband told Popular Military that he needed someone to take care of the black-and-white pit bull mix, which he called Huey and Rollins apparently renamed Cam, when he was stationed overseas. He said he also hoped the dog might help Rollins deal with the post-traumatic stress she suffered after her time in the Army in South Korea. Rollins later registered the dog as an emotional support animal.A Justice for Cam Facebook page, which includes the very disturbing video, and Justice for Huey page were launched after Rollins’ arrest.Rollins, a former Army illustrator from Windham, Maine, who joined the service in 2014, was discharged early in January with medical issues, The Fayetteville Observer reported, citing to court documents.Rollins and her boyfriend were out on $25,000 bail and due back in court May 16.If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

As an American living in France, I wanted to get up-close to what is making Europe’s populist movements tick. On Labour Day, a week before the election, I joined two very different political demonstrations on the streets of Paris. The first was a rally by Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France’s far-right National Front party and father of this year’s run off candidate. The second was the polar opposite, an anti-National Front march that began at the iconic Place de la République.As in previous years, Jean-Marie Le Pen gave his speech in front of a golden statue of Joan of Arc, France’s patron saint who was appropriated by the far-right movement in the 20th century. Perhaps oddly for observers unfamiliar with the scathing campaign rhetoric of the National Front, he opened his speech with references to France’s 15th-century territorial dispute with the English. He recounted that, after Joan of Arc’s capture, she was asked whether she believed God would love their enemy, the English. Yes, she retorted, but at home (“chez eux”)! It later became obvious that an historical English adversary was being replaced with an abstract Muslim one.The immigrant-bashing then morphed into to contempt for the urban elite, perfectly incarnated by France’s new 39-year-old president. Jean-Marie Le Pen railed against Macron, referring to him as a bourgeois-bohème and a pantouflard (literally “wearer of slippers”), an allusion to members of France’s political class who move swiftly from the public sector into well-paid positions in French companies. At the end of his speech, jeers at journalists recalled a trend that was, for me, all too familiar from watching Trump rallies in the United States.I walked away feeling shaken by the palpable anger in the air. Arriving at Place de la République, activist groups were staging their response to the National Front. To the backdrop of Bob Dylan and Robin Schulz, demonstrators were holding white lily flowers and a slow-moving van of the French Communist Party was selling tropical cocktails. Yet this crowd, too, displayed visible anxiety. Plenty of protesters were less than thrilled to throw support behind an ascendant investment banker-cum-socialist candidate. Cardboard signs read “vote for a crook, not a facist” and “beat Le Pen, resist Macron.”Perhaps what was most interesting about this day, which included rubbing shoulders with both the far-right and the far-left, was thinking about how it is that we, participants in the political process, choose our preferred candidates. As Hasan Minhaj astutely noted during last month’s White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington D.C., it appears as if we are living in this strange time where trust is more important than truth.For today’s centrist candidates, outsmarting the populists will require understanding some key lessons from the recent elections in France and the United States. First, brand yourself as an “outsider.” While Hillary Clinton was reproached for her close ties to the Democratic establishment, Macron launched a new political party, “En Marche!”. Just as the relative political inexperience of both Obama and Trump helped to boost their popularity, the young Macron manoeuvred as a candidate from outside the system.Second, show strength on the economy. Opinion polls before the American election showed that a majority of voters believed Hillary Clinton was the weaker candidate on economic issues. Macron capitalized on an opportunity here by displaying little shame about his past career as an investment banker. A key moment of the French debate came when Macron insisted that pulling France out of the common currency would sink the pensions of French retirees. Marine Le Pen wavered, losing key votes from undecided elderly voters.Third, address the concerns of the working-class while staying consistent. A fatal mistake by Hillary Clinton was neglecting the importance of historically left-leaning, blue-collar states (read Michigan and Wisconsin). Macron made a concerted effort to avoid this oversight. Shortly before the second round of voting, he visited a tumble-dryer factory in France’s deindustrializing North, yet he stuck to his position that globalization would be good for France in the long-run.

As an American living in France, I wanted to get up-close to what is making Europe’s populist movements tick. On Labour Day, a week before the election, I joined two very different political demonstrations on the streets of Paris. The first was a rally by Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France’s far-right National Front party and father of this year’s run off candidate. The second was the polar opposite, an anti-National Front march that began at the iconic Place de la République.As in previous years, Jean-Marie Le Pen gave his speech in front of a golden statue of Joan of Arc, France’s patron saint who was appropriated by the far-right movement in the 20th century. Perhaps oddly for observers unfamiliar with the scathing campaign rhetoric of the National Front, he opened his speech with references to France’s 15th-century territorial dispute with the English. He recounted that, after Joan of Arc’s capture, she was asked whether she believed God would love their enemy, the English. Yes, she retorted, but at home (“chez eux”)! It later became obvious that an historical English adversary was being replaced with an abstract Muslim one.The immigrant-bashing then morphed into to contempt for the urban elite, perfectly incarnated by France’s new 39-year-old president. Jean-Marie Le Pen railed against Macron, referring to him as a bourgeois-bohème and a pantouflard (literally “wearer of slippers”), an allusion to members of France’s political class who move swiftly from the public sector into well-paid positions in French companies. At the end of his speech, jeers at journalists recalled a trend that was, for me, all too familiar from watching Trump rallies in the United States.I walked away feeling shaken by the palpable anger in the air. Arriving at Place de la République, activist groups were staging their response to the National Front. To the backdrop of Bob Dylan and Robin Schulz, demonstrators were holding white lily flowers and a slow-moving van of the French Communist Party was selling tropical cocktails. Yet this crowd, too, displayed visible anxiety. Plenty of protesters were less than thrilled to throw support behind an ascendant investment banker-cum-socialist candidate. Cardboard signs read “vote for a crook, not a facist” and “beat Le Pen, resist Macron.”Perhaps what was most interesting about this day, which included rubbing shoulders with both the far-right and the far-left, was thinking about how it is that we, participants in the political process, choose our preferred candidates. As Hasan Minhaj astutely noted during last month’s White House Correspondents Dinner in Washington D.C., it appears as if we are living in this strange time where trust is more important than truth.For today’s centrist candidates, outsmarting the populists will require understanding some key lessons from the recent elections in France and the United States. First, brand yourself as an “outsider.” While Hillary Clinton was reproached for her close ties to the Democratic establishment, Macron launched a new political party, “En Marche!”. Just as the relative political inexperience of both Obama and Trump helped to boost their popularity, the young Macron manoeuvred as a candidate from outside the system.Second, show strength on the economy. Opinion polls before the American election showed that a majority of voters believed Hillary Clinton was the weaker candidate on economic issues. Macron capitalized on an opportunity here by displaying little shame about his past career as an investment banker. A key moment of the French debate came when Macron insisted that pulling France out of the common currency would sink the pensions of French retirees. Marine Le Pen wavered, losing key votes from undecided elderly voters.Third, address the concerns of the working-class while staying consistent. A fatal mistake by Hillary Clinton was neglecting the importance of historically left-leaning, blue-collar states (read Michigan and Wisconsin). Macron made a concerted effort to avoid this oversight. Shortly before the second round of voting, he visited a tumble-dryer factory in France’s deindustrializing North, yet he stuck to his position that globalization would be good for France in the long-run. His visit was controversial but it showed that he was listening.Now that the dust has settled after France’s election, we might feel some comfort that a populist campaign has been thwarted. But the populist insurgency will not be dormant for long. To beat the populists, centrist politicians will need to get smart when it comes to projecting novelty, attentiveness and prowess. Then, perhaps, we will be able to focus on the structural reforms – from education to the labour market – that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century."

EU leaders Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker will seek a meeting with Erdoğan at the May 25 NATO summit in what could be the European Union’s last effort to find common ground with Turkey. But EU-Turkey tensions are high, and it would not be surprising if talks were suspended in the near future.There were widespread allegations of electoral misconduct, irregularities and state coercion of “no” supporters in the referendum.Following unofficial results, several heads of state called Erdoğan to congratulate him, including the leaders of Djibouti, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. But the only Western president who did so was Donald Trump.Just hours after Trump’s call, the European Commission called for an investigation into Turkey’s referendum and refused to congratulate Erdoğan. And the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has decided to impose a renewed monitoring procedure on Turkey “until serious concerns about respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law are addressed in a satisfactory manner.”The Turkish president’s recent remarks supporting the death penalty have also strained relations with Europe (though they were met with support from his followers), as did his May 2 declarations about constitutional reforms and amendments.But the greatest blow to European-Turkish relations came directly out of Erdoğan’s mouth. In a May 3 speech in Ankara, the president openly threatened to stop the EU accession process if European countries don’t “open up” right away.It may be that the president has better alliances in his sights. And if Erdoğan’s latest trips are any indication, Turkey’s foreign policy may well just bypass Europe.Turkey’s open hand to IndiaOn May 1, Erdoğan paid a visit to India, his first international trip since “winning” the disputed constitutional referendum. The main aim of the visit was to develop economic and strategic collaborations on counter terrorism.It appears that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomed him with open arms. But Erdoğan made a controversial comment on Kashmir, the northwestern state disputed by India and Pakistan, that marred the visit.In suggesting a “multilateral dialogue” on the Kashmir issue and offering to mediate between India and Pakistan, Erdoğan irked Indian officials, who “firmly rule out third party mediation on Kashmir”.Erdoğan also mentioned that joint trade between India and Turkey should be balanced, and that his country could assist India with rapid infrastructure development.That comment raised some eyebrows. Given that Turkey’s relations with the EU have been deteriorating for some time now, is Erdoğan planning to start implementing an active foreign policy focussed on the East rather than the West?His May 8 trip to Kuwait may be another example of just such an inclination.Looking eastwardTurkey’s foreign policy agenda has for years been determined by domestic priorities, and it has sometimes become a significant issue in electoral campaigns.This is what happened following problems with some European countries during the recent referendum process. Erdoğan and prominent figures from his AKP party used populist rhetoric to send the message that Europe does not want Turkey to be powerful, suggesting that European nations fear the resurgence of a strong, Ottoman-style Turkey.Even as he antagonises the West, Erdoğan has been trying hard to ease tensions with Russia. A year and a half have passed since the downing of a Russian jet near the Turkish-Syria border. President Erdoğan apologised to his Russian counterpart, stating “Ankara never had the desire or deliberate intention of shooting down the Russian federation’s plane”.The May 4 meeting between Putin and Erdoğan, which took place in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, suggests rapprochement.It also reflected possible growing cooperation between the two nations on Syria, on which they were once at odds. Russia and Turkey agreed to support the formation of “de-escalation zones” in Syria, saying they both wanted to bolster the fragile truce in the war-ravaged country.Suspicion in the BalkansIn the Balkans, which were once part of the Ottoman empire, Erdogan is looked at with increasing suspicion after years of Turkey having a balanced, if delicate, relationship with the region.Since 2013, Erdoğan’s pro-Islamist language and policies have been discomfiting policymakers and political elites on the peninsula, with its multi-religious and multi-ethnic structure.Between 2007 and 2013, Ankara was actually making inroads through friendlier means. Turkish investments had expanded across the Balkans, even in Croatia and in Serbia, where Christian residents still remember the sultans from Istanbul as occupiers, not liberators.Turkey had also helped broker talks between formerly bitter enemies in the Balkans. But, post-referendum, new apprehension has arisen among the region’s political elites. Many now fear that Turkey could export authoritarianism to the peninsula and trigger instability.Even though most of the Balkan countries will continue to cultivate or feign friendship with Erdoğan, they are also likely to lean on European powers to seek protection.Can Turkey thrive without Europe?Despite Erdoğan’s ultimatum to Europe and his new friends in the East, the economic picture for Turkey remains weak without backing from the West. All of Turkey’s trade with its Middle East, Asian and African partners combined doesn’t compare to its commerce with the Western world.Turkey is the EU’s fourth-largest export market and fifth-highest provider of imports, selling well over US$50 billion of goods to Europe each year. The EU is by far Turkey’s number one import and export partner.In contrast, Turkey and Africa trade at a volume of around US$4 billion.The global political power of Turkey’s potential new partners is nothing compared to that of the Western world. Ultimately, Turkey needs democracy, human rights, peace and stability at home and in its neighbourhood.In the end, other regions may be helpful to Erdoğan for a short time, but they cannot substitute the economic and political contributions Turkey requires of Europe.Ahmet Erdi Öztürk, Research Asistant, Université de Strasbourg and Salih Dogan, Researcher and PhD Candidate, Keele UniversityThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Yet, for the invitation-only crowd gathered at the Carter Center in Atlanta Monday night, this meeting between former POTUS Jimmy Carter and current U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders went beyond laughter to gravitas. There were a few jokes, yes, but also a vital discussion about the state of human rights and the direction in which America should be headed next. Watching this pair of political crusaders gab and ideate for nearly an hour felt like the only colorful, hopeful page ripped from the dark, comic-book saga led by the current administration.Each year, the Carter Center's annual Human Rights Defenders Forum brings together more than 70 activists, scholars, and community leaders from around the globe to navigate the challenges of protecting human rights. In an era of rising authoritarianism and at a time when many governments are curtailing public debate and activism, 2017’s gathering, “Freedom from Fear: Securing Rights in Challenging Times,” convenes a diverse group of voices – from the Black Lives Matter movement and members of Standing Rock to Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission, Russia’s Freedom Files, Nigeria’s Kudirat Initiative for Democracy and others. During the May 8 evening forum (smartly moderated by Carter Center Senior Policy Adviser on Human Rights and Special Representative on Women and Girls, Karin Ryan), Carter said “We’ve slipped backwards all over the world” in regard to basic human rights such as freedom of expression and freedom from arbitrary detention– a gradual sliding process he says began before the 2016 election. He added that, given today’s swell of nationalism in America, people in other countries “can no longer see [the U.S.A.] as a beacon of light for the future.”Both Carter and Sanders agreed that the increasing disparity between rich and poor people worldwide contributes to human rights violations and problems with healthcare, education and equal opportunity. Sanders, 75, warned about “the growth of oligarchy in America;” Carter, 92, lamented the loss of faith “in truth, in fellow citizens, and in public officials.” The Georgia native then affirmed to the defenders in the room the importance of the link between peace and human rights, noting that his four years in the White House were primarily war-free, and that as a Christian, he “worships the Prince of Peace, not the Prince of War.” Making light of President Trump’s proposed military spending budget, Sanders followed Carter’s statement with a reference to President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s 1961 speech, which warned of the dangers of the Military Industrial Complex.Watching Carter and Sanders interact was a rare treat. Carter told the audience he’d voted for Sanders in the 2016 primaries and was “glad” Sanders agreed with him on so many issues. The evening ended on an optimistic note, as Sanders rallied for a “progressive agenda that will include all Americans,” not just the wealthy and powerful. Perhaps as enjoyable as the discussion forum itself was my glimpse of Sanders’ and Carters’ arrivals at the Carter Center. Up a long staircase from the lobby to Carter’s office, each bound handily (Carter’s agility and stamina never ceases to amaze) toward a room full of Andy Warhol portraits of the former President. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere. They may not be headed for roles in a summer blockbuster, but this duo of public servants cares about humanity when everything feels upside down, human rights are imperiled, and the arts and sciences are disdained. Somebody, please sew them a set of matching superhero capes.Visit the Carter Center’s Facebook page to watch the whole video."
21,POLITICS,EPA Removes Scientists From Science Review Board,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-board-of-scientific-counselors_us_591015c2e4b0d5d9049d9e2b,They may be replaced with members from industries the agency is meant to police.,2017-05-08,"The Environmental Protection Agency, led by Scott Pruitt, has removed several members from an internal review board.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591016761400000d17f8bba2.jpeg?cache=IMfSf1Hsto&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Environmental Protection Agency has removed several members from an internal review board meant to provide scientific advice to the agency, a move some say could impair future research into climate change and provide sweeping benefits to polluting industries.The news, quietly announced on Friday, affects the EPA’s 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, which reviews the agency’s own research in an effort to “sustain and enhance the quality of science.” The New York Times reports at least five members have been dismissed from their roles after serving a three-year term, and E&E News said up to a dozen could eventually be let go.A spokesman for EPA head Scott Pruitt told the Times the positions, which have mostly been filled with university-affiliated researchers, could likely be given to representatives from polluting industries the EPA is meant to monitor, in an effort “to take as inclusive an approach to regulation as possible.”“The administrator believes we should have people on this board who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community,” said the spokesman, J.P. Freire.Freire told E&E News the dismissals weren’t firings, but that researchers completing their terms hadn’t been asked to participate in another. “They’re not guaranteed a second three-year term,” he said. Now-former members of the board say their dismissal amounts to a continued war on science under Pruitt, a man who sued the EPA 13 times and has remained an avowed climate change denier.“Anecdotally, based on what we know about the administrator, I think it will be science that will appear to be friendlier to industry, the fossil fuel industry, the chemical industry, and I think it will be science that marginalizes climate change science,” Robert Richardson, an ecological economist at Michigan State University who was dismissed from his board position, told E&E News. In a statement Monday, John O’Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, a union representing more than 9,000 EPA employees, said “any degradation of the quality of science will have far-reaching, and lasting impacts” on human and environmental health.“One of the gravest concerns we have is whether the US EPA’s SAB will be repopulated with scientists who operate within the realm of opinion, rather than fact,” O’Grady said. “We are already aware of the opinion of this Administration and Mr. Pruitt with respect to climate change. However, opinions are neither fact nor theory and do not belong to the realm of science. Without independence and sound peer review of the science conducted by the Agency, it will be impossible to distinguish between good science and bad science at the US EPA.” The Board of Scientific Counselors ― composed of members drawn from academia, environmental groups, industry and local government ― provides expert advice to the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, the prime research arm of the agency. The office supports a barrage of research programs that include efforts to understand climate change, monitor water quality and promote chemical safety.Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the White House has instructed the EPA to roll back several Obama-era pieces of legislation, including rules on methane emissions and fuel efficiency standards, and taken steps to dramatically rein in the agency’s power.In March, Trump proposed slashing the EPA’s budget by 31 percent in 2018, as well as gutting climate change programs across federal agencies. At the time, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, said the White House considered such spending “to be a waste of your money.”The EPA’s other research review panel, the 47-member Science Advisory Board, would face an 84 percent cut in funding under the plan. The group is tasked with providing scientific advice to the agency’s administrator and its recommendations can help set its research agenda.“The SAB provides a mechanism for the agency to receive peer review and other advice designed to make a positive difference in the production and use of science at EPA,” the board’s website reads.In February, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, proposed two bills meant to make it harder for the EPA to use scientific research to do its job. One of the bills, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act, would take away incentives for academics to sit on the panel and instead encourage industry representatives to join.The House passed both pieces of legislation in March.“This is one of several attempts by Congress to meddle with and ultimately undermine the process of science informing policy decisions,” Genna Reed, a policy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote at the time. “These measures are attacks on public health, safety and environmental safeguards, plain and simple.”This story has been updated to include a statement from AFGE Council 238.

That amounts to about $680,000 back in his own pocket, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman said. As it stands, the Republican health care bill would roll back taxes on the wealthy that were created to help pay for aspects of Obamacare. Over the next decade, taxes would be cut by an estimated $765 billion, NPR reported.Buffett shared some similar thoughts on the bill at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting on Saturday.“It is a huge tax cut for guys like me,” he told the audience.Buffett also called rising medical costs the “tapeworm of American economic competitiveness,” claiming it has been health care expenses, as opposed to high corporate taxes, that are holding companies back."

She said neither DOJ leaders nor subject matter experts were consulted about the executive order.“We weren’t even told about it,” Yates said. “I learned about this from media reports.”Yates was fired 10 days into the Trump administration for stating the Justice Department would not defend Trump’s first executive order, which restricted travel and immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries. Yates said she analyzed the executive order in the context of Trump’s comments during the campaign on a Muslim ban, and concluded that the executive order was unlawful even if the text had been cleared by DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel.Yates also revealed Monday that OLC had specifically been advised not to tell her about the forthcoming executive order. (While Yates was still acting attorney general, DOJ said the OLC decision had been made “without the involvement of Department of Justice leadership.”)Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had asked Yates whether she was aware of a situation where the attorney general overruled a decision of the Office of Legal Counsel days after it issued an order.“I’m not, but I’m also not aware of a situation where the Office of Legal Counsel was advised not to tell the attorney general about it until after it was over,” Yates said in response.OLC, Yates said, “has a narrow function” in the case of an executive order and did not take into account statements that might reveal the motivation for the executive order. A deeper analysis was required in this case because it dealt with a “fundamental issue of religious freedom,” Yates said.“All arguments have to be based on truth, because we’re the Department of Justice. We’re not just a law firm, we’re the Department of Justice,” Yates testified on Monday. “In this instance, in looking at what the intent was of the executive order, which was derived from an analysis of facts outside the face of the order, that is part of what led to our conclusion that it was not lawful.”Federal judges have subsequently cited Trump’s rhetoric about Muslims in court decisions, with one judge saying his words provide “significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus.” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) had questioned Yates about her decision during an unrelated hearing on Monday, saying he voted for her because of her “distinguished” career as a federal prosecutor but found it “enormously disappointing” that she “vetoed” the Office of Legal Counsel.But Yates said she wanted to make clear she didn’t disagree with the executive order just “purely as a policy matter” and that her analysis went much further. She recounted being asked during her confirmation as deputy attorney general what she would do if the president asked her to do something unlawful or unconstitutional. “I looked at this, I made a determination that I believed that it was unlawful. I also thought it was inconsistent with the principles of the Department of Justice. And I said no,” Yates said. “That’s what I promised you I would do, and that’s what I did.”"

He has published more than a dozen books on wide-ranging subjects and was the top adviser to the late François Mitterrand, who was president of France from 1981 to 1995. Attali was subsequently appointed by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy to chair a commission on how to reform the French economy. In that capacity, Attali hired Emmanuel Macron as his assistant and later recommended him to President François Hollande as economy minister.The WorldPost spoke to Attali by phone on Sunday.How do you read the vote in Sunday’s election: the victory of a new political center in France, or only a consensus against the extreme right? Perhaps it is the beginning of post-ideological politics in France?It is, first of all, a vote by a clear majority who believe the future can be better than the past. As in the United States and Great Britain, the main political debate is precisely this: is going back to the past better than going forward? We have answered differently than others in the Brexit and Donald Trump votes. France has sided decisively with the future. Emmanuel Macron has defined that forward path as liberal progressivism.Of course, even those who didn’t embrace this vision but voted mainly to stop the far-right from advancing, are also a sign of optimism for the future.What does this defeat mean for Le Pen and other populists in Europe? Does it show the limitation of their appeal and thus their distance from ever gaining power?Yes and no. As we speak, the far-right garnered around 35 percent of the vote (later down to closer to 34 percent) ― higher than ever before. And then there were those who abstained from voting entirely. So we can’t dismiss the anger and frustration. That won’t go away by itself. There are real issues. But it demonstrates that the notion that all of the Western democracies would follow the road of Brexit and Trump is bullshit.You headed a commission appointed by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy for which you hired Emmanuel Macron as your assistant to make recommendations on how to remove the wall of regulations and restrictions impeding economic growth in France. Those recommendations included relaxed working hours for retail and services, more flexibility in hiring and firing and deregulating some protected cartels, like taxi drivers. Will such policies, as Macron endorsed in his campaign, answer the anger and frustration?Yes, those were some of the recommendations. But we also prioritized early childhood education and training for unemployed youth. So we aimed both at promoting growth, but also building a trampoline to boost the equality of opportunity ― policies aimed directly at the kind of frustration that has been building in France. Does it worry you that in the first round more than 50 percent of youth voted for Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate in the first round?Yes. It is obviously related that 25 percent of French youth are unemployed. That is the key challenge, and it is why a priority must be placed on training programs linked to employment as we recommended in the commission.Will Macron be able to gather a parliamentary majority to see through such reforms now, as he has embraced? I’m not a member of his incipient party, so I speak only as an independent observer. In the past, an elected president has always been able to obtain a majority in parliamentary elections. I expect the same this time.Do you expect a closer relationship now, especially with Germany — and thus a strong core for a multi-speed Europe?The most important point of Macron’s program is his pro-European stance. He wants a closer relationship with Germany precisely in order to make a quantum leap in European integration. A better French future depends on a stronger Europe.This interview has been edited for clarity and updated with results from France’s presidential election."

Emmanuel Macron has defined that forward path as liberal progressivism.Of course, even those who didn’t embrace this vision but voted mainly to stop the far-right from advancing, are also a sign of optimism for the future.What does this defeat mean for Le Pen and other populists in Europe? Does it show the limitation of their appeal and thus their distance from ever gaining power?Yes and no. As we speak, the far-right garnered around 35 percent of the vote (later down to closer to 34 percent) ― higher than ever before. And then there were those who abstained from voting entirely. So we can’t dismiss the anger and frustration. That won’t go away by itself. There are real issues. But it demonstrates that the notion that all of the Western democracies would follow the road of Brexit and Trump is bullshit.You headed a commission appointed by then-President Nicolas Sarkozy for which you hired Emmanuel Macron as your assistant to make recommendations on how to remove the wall of regulations and restrictions impeding economic growth in France. Those recommendations included relaxed working hours for retail and services, more flexibility in hiring and firing and deregulating some protected cartels, like taxi drivers. Will such policies, as Macron endorsed in his campaign, answer the anger and frustration?Yes, those were some of the recommendations. But we also prioritized early childhood education and training for unemployed youth. So we aimed both at promoting growth, but also building a trampoline to boost the equality of opportunity ― policies aimed directly at the kind of frustration that has been building in France. Does it worry you that in the first round more than 50 percent of youth voted for Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate in the first round?Yes. It is obviously related that 25 percent of French youth are unemployed. That is the key challenge, and it is why a priority must be placed on training programs linked to employment as we recommended in the commission.Will Macron be able to gather a parliamentary majority to see through such reforms now, as he has embraced? I’m not a member of his incipient party, so I speak only as an independent observer. In the past, an elected president has always been able to obtain a majority in parliamentary elections. I expect the same this time.Do you expect a closer relationship now, especially with Germany — and thus a strong core for a multi-speed Europe?The most important point of Macron’s program is his pro-European stance. He wants a closer relationship with Germany precisely in order to make a quantum leap in European integration. A better French future depends on a stronger Europe.This interview has been edited for clarity and updated with results from France’s presidential election."

And in the end, the final ruling may depend on whether a majority buys the Trump administration’s defense that the president’s own anti-Muslim rhetoric during the campaign and after being sworn in shouldn’t determine the order’s legality.“We don’t get to consider what was said here?” asked U.S. Circuit Judge James Wynn, referring to Trump and his associates’ several statements pre- and post-election about the purpose of the travel ban.“The president has never repudiated the statements he made on a Muslim ban,” said U.S. Circuit Judge Robert King, who pointed to Trump’s own campaign website, which once called for a “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the United States, as an indication of the intent behind the travel ban.(Strangely, that campaign page appears to have been deleted just as the 4th Circuit was hearing oral arguments in the case.)Jeffrey Wall, the Trump administration’s lawyer, said courts shouldn’t second-guess the president’s “broad authority” to issue the travel ban, which he said was “on its face legitimate” and allowed under immigration law. “At bottom, that’s a policy judgment for the administration to make,” Wall said of the travel ban, which he defended as a “temporary pause” in the refugee resettlement program and the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen into the U.S.“Candidates talk about things on the campaign trail all the time,” Wall added, urging the 4th Circuit not to consider anything Trump may have said prior to taking the oath of office.The showdown in the 4th Circuit is the latest chapter for one of the administration’s most embarrassing policy rollouts just yet, as federal judges in both Hawaii and Maryland prevented Trump from moving forward with what the ACLU and other immigrants’ rights groups are calling his “Muslim ban” — a naked attempt to stigmatize refugees and travelers identifying with a specific religious faith.U.S. Circuit Judges Barbara Keenan and Pamela Harris, both appointed by Obama, questioned the federal government’s charge that courts should just limit themselves to the text of the order as written — and not focus on the subjective intentions of a country’s chief executive.“Do you really mean that we can’t view all the statements” the president made, Keenan asked.Since the original travel ban was announced in late January, judges across the country have halted its implementation, forcing the administration to go back to the drawing board and issue a new and improved ban in early March.But even the watered-down version of Trump’s executive order encountered resistance in the courts, and the 4th Circuit — which covers the states of Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia — is likely to also find problems with the anti-Muslim statements and sentiments Trump and his associates have exhibited since the ban was first proposed.Perhaps the strongest voice on the 4th Circuit bench for the administration was U.S. Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer. The longtime conservative repeatedly questioned the premise that judges should take on the role of “supervising and assessing” how the political branches — Congress and the president — look out for national security.“Don’t we have some respect for the first branch and the second branch?” Niemeyer asked. He suggested that if the 4th Circuit were to rule broadly against Trump, there’d be no stopping point for how courts might call into question future political judgments.“How long does the taint last for this administration?” asked U.S. Circuit Judge Albert Diaz, one of the 4th Circuit’s newer members. He and other judges seemed interested in knowing how Trump could ever issue a national security order targeting Muslim-majority countries, given his already checkered record on statements about Islam.“What if he said he’s sorry for a year?” U.S. Circuit Judge Dennis Shedd, another conservative, asked toward the end of Monday’s hearing, drawing laughter from the courtroom. Omar Jadwat, the ACLU lawyer who argued against the government, couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge that Trump could one day issue a lawful travel order, free of the issues that have plagued the first two.Wall, the Department of Justice attorney, said in his closing remarks that the 4th Circuit shouldn’t let the emotional controversy surrounding the travel ban inform its decision-making. If it does, he suggested, future administrations may pay the price.“The order before this court has been the subject of a heated and passionate political debate,” Wall said. “But the precedent set by this case for this court’s role in reviewing the president’s power at the borders will long transcend this debate and this order and this constitutional moment.”As timing would have it, just as Wall was making his case for the federal government in court, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates appeared to go against it during a Senate committee hearing in Washington. Without mincing words, she explained why she wasn’t willing to instruct DOJ lawyers to defend the travel ban — a decision that ultimately got her fired.“I believed that any argument that we would have to make in its defense would not be grounded in the truth, because, to make an argument in its defense, we would have to argue that the executive order had nothing to do with religion, that it was not done with an intent to discriminate against Muslims,” Yates said on Monday. The 4th Circuit chose C-SPAN to carry live audio of oral arguments of Monday’s hearing. Next week, the cable network will also broadcast a separate hearing from Seattle involving the Hawaii challenge to Trump’s travel order.This story has been updated to include details from the hearing."

His lasagna recipe called for cheddar cheese, and he was fresh out. Finding none in his fridge, the unidentified man called the Edina Police Department’s emergency line.The department eventually tweeted about the incident ― which it described as “not a good use of 911” ― while questioning why anyone would use cheddar in lasagna.According to a transcript of the call provided to HuffPost, the man asks the dispatcher, “If I was cooking lasagna and didn’t have any cheddar cheese, what would I use as a substitute?”“Sir, this is not an appropriate use of 911,” the dispatcher replies.Undeterred, he tries (and fails) to explain why cheese-less lasagna constitutes a life-threatening emergency, then ends with a doozy before hanging up on the dispatcher. “When I die,” he says, “then it’s on you.”Here’s a copy of the transcript:To get a sense of how big a blunder it is to make lasagna with cheddar cheese, HuffPost asked the Food Network’s senior vice president of culinary, Katherine Alford.“I have never come across a lasagna recipe that uses cheddar,” Alford wrote in an email, explaining that cheddar edges the dish toward casserole territory.Yet individual preference also plays an important role, she wrote:Lasagna, like any dish, should be about personal preferences. Within Italy, variations tend to be regional in nature with a traditional lasagna made from alternating layers of pasta sheets, ragu, along with béchamel and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Outside Italy, variations might also be made with ricotta and/or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce (vs. ragu) and include meats or vegetables, in common though, all Lasagna’s are baked. A different Food Network representative told HuffPost she was “unsure that cheddar cheese substitutions or lasagna warrant a law enforcement/911-call.”"

Sessions' Justice Department has cited a ruling in a swimming pool closure case in its defense of the travel ban.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5910da7e1e00003a00621e74.jpeg?cache=shA5fqq80t&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In a brief defending its ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department approvingly cited a segregation-era Supreme Court decision that allowed Jackson, Mississippi, to close public pools rather than integrate them.In the early 1960s, courts ordered Jackson to desegregate its public parks, which included five swimming pools. Instead, the city decided to close the pools. Black residents of Jackson sued. But in 1971, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, decided that closing the pools rather than integrating them was just fine.The dissents, even at the time, were furious. “May a State in order to avoid integration of the races abolish all of its public schools?” Justice William O. Douglas asked in his dissent. “I had thought official policies forbidding or discouraging joint use of public facilities by Negroes and whites were at war with the Equal Protection Clause” of the Fourteenth Amendment, Justice Byron White wrote in another dissent. “Our cases make it unquestionably clear, as all of us agree, that a city or State may not enforce such a policy by maintaining officially separate facilities for the two races. It is also my view, but apparently not that of the majority, that a State may not have an official stance against desegregating public facilities and implement it by closing those facilities in response to a desegregation order.” The ruling in Palmer v. Thompson didn’t explicitly uphold segregation. But it did call for courts to avoid investigating the constitutionality of officials’ motivations.“It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the ‘sole’ or ‘dominant’ motivation behind the choices of a group of legislators,” the majority opinion said. “Furthermore, there is an element of futility in a judicial attempt to invalidate a law because of the bad motives of its supporters.” The Trump administration emphasizes this in its citation of the case, arguing that looking into “governmental purpose outside the operative terms of governmental action and official pronouncements” is “fraught with practical ‘pitfalls’ and ‘hazards’ that would make courts’ task ‘extremely difficult.’”But in some cases, such as the closure of the Jackson pools, officials’ motivations are clear, said Paul Brest, the director of Stanford University’s Law and Policy Lab. “When it is absolutely clear that an official acted for unconstitutional purposes … [the courts] should be willing to strike down that decision because, even though the decision might have been reached legitimately, a public official violates the constitution when he or she acts for unconstitutional reasons,” Brest said. “It’s as simple as that. … Race discrimination is the best example of where courts are quite willing to take people’s motivations into account — or religious discrimination.”Palmer is one of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever handed down in regards to race, said Michele Goodwin, the chancellor’s professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. “Citing Palmer is like citing Buck v. Bell for a premise of equal protection,” Goodwin says. (Buck v. Bell legalized eugenics.) She added that a case like Palmer also doesn’t hold up over time.“[Palmer] doesn’t represent our view of how law, how people, how society [and] how equality has evolved in the United States,” she said. “To cite a case that, in and of itself, coheres ideas about inequality and explicit racism in spaces where racism could mean the end of someone’s life, then one would really have to question why a president would cite such a case — given how much it’s been refuted.”John Paul Schnapper-Casteras, a special counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, wrote in a Sunday blog post that it’s “stunning” to see the Department of Justice approvingly cite a case that “at best allowed pretextual measures for avoiding racial integration ― and, more realistically, facilitated segregation by turning a blind eye to what was clearly going on in the City of Jackson.” Justice Department lawyers know exactly what they’re doing ― citing different doctrines in an attempt to thwart any reason to examine what Trump on the campaign trail “said, very unambiguously, was to ban Muslims from coming into the country,” he told HuffPost. “This is less about national security and more about them trying to find any way to insulate the motivation behind this order. Sometimes they invoke national security cases,” Schnapper-Casteras said. “In this case, they invoked a case about segregation.”A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.But there’s a clear reason why the Trump administration doesn’t want the courts to consider potential motivations for Trump’s revised travel ban: The idea that the president’s intent was to discriminate against Muslims has come up in prior rulings against his executive order. As a candidate, Trump called for a “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the U.S. and has spoken disparagingly of refugees. He and the White House say the travel executive orders are not the same as a Muslim ban, but opponents say his past statements show they likely had the same motivation. The executive order blocks certain foreign nationals of six Muslim-majority nations ― Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from the U.S. for 90 days.

33,POLITICS,Trump Administration Cites Segregation-Era Ruling To Defend Its Travel Ban,Nick Baumann and Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-travel-ban-cites-segregation-ruling_us_5910da0ee4b0e7021e9a5cda,"In 1971, the Supreme Court decided that courts shouldn't investigate the motivations of officials who closed public pools rather than integrate them.",2017-05-08,"President Donald Trump's executive order on travel from Muslim-majority nations draws protests at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Jan. 29. On the campaign trail, Trump often spoke of a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5910dd4e1600002000c5a1aa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In a brief defending its ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority countries, President Donald Trump’s Justice Department approvingly cited a segregation-era Supreme Court decision that allowed Jackson, Mississippi, to close public pools rather than integrate them.In the early 1960s, courts ordered Jackson to desegregate its public parks, which included five swimming pools. Instead, the city decided to close the pools. Black residents of Jackson sued. But in 1971, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, decided that closing the pools rather than integrating them was just fine.The dissents, even at the time, were furious. “May a State in order to avoid integration of the races abolish all of its public schools?” Justice William O. Douglas asked in his dissent. “I had thought official policies forbidding or discouraging joint use of public facilities by Negroes and whites were at war with the Equal Protection Clause” of the Fourteenth Amendment, Justice Byron White wrote in another dissent. “Our cases make it unquestionably clear, as all of us agree, that a city or State may not enforce such a policy by maintaining officially separate facilities for the two races. It is also my view, but apparently not that of the majority, that a State may not have an official stance against desegregating public facilities and implement it by closing those facilities in response to a desegregation order.” The ruling in Palmer v. Thompson didn’t explicitly uphold segregation. But it did call for courts to avoid investigating the constitutionality of officials’ motivations.“It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the ‘sole’ or ‘dominant’ motivation behind the choices of a group of legislators,” the majority opinion said. “Furthermore, there is an element of futility in a judicial attempt to invalidate a law because of the bad motives of its supporters.” The Trump administration emphasizes this in its citation of the case, arguing that looking into “governmental purpose outside the operative terms of governmental action and official pronouncements” is “fraught with practical ‘pitfalls’ and ‘hazards’ that would make courts’ task ‘extremely difficult.’”But in some cases, such as the closure of the Jackson pools, officials’ motivations are clear, said Paul Brest, the director of Stanford University’s Law and Policy Lab. “When it is absolutely clear that an official acted for unconstitutional purposes … [the courts] should be willing to strike down that decision because, even though the decision might have been reached legitimately, a public official violates the constitution when he or she acts for unconstitutional reasons,” Brest said. “It’s as simple as that. … Race discrimination is the best example of where courts are quite willing to take people’s motivations into account — or religious discrimination.”Palmer is one of the worst Supreme Court decisions ever handed down in regards to race, said Michele Goodwin, the chancellor’s professor of law at the University of California, Irvine. “Citing Palmer is like citing Buck v. Bell for a premise of equal protection,” Goodwin says. (Buck v. Bell legalized eugenics.) She added that a case like Palmer also doesn’t hold up over time.“[Palmer] doesn’t represent our view of how law, how people, how society [and] how equality has evolved in the United States,” she said. “To cite a case that, in and of itself, coheres ideas about inequality and explicit racism in spaces where racism could mean the end of someone’s life, then one would really have to question why a president would cite such a case — given how much it’s been refuted.”John Paul Schnapper-Casteras, a special counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, wrote in a Sunday blog post that it’s “stunning” to see the Department of Justice approvingly cite a case that “at best allowed pretextual measures for avoiding racial integration ― and, more realistically, facilitated segregation by turning a blind eye to what was clearly going on in the City of Jackson.” Justice Department lawyers know exactly what they’re doing ― citing different doctrines in an attempt to thwart any reason to examine what Trump on the campaign trail “said, very unambiguously, was to ban Muslims from coming into the country,” he told HuffPost. “This is less about national security and more about them trying to find any way to insulate the motivation behind this order. Sometimes they invoke national security cases,” Schnapper-Casteras said. “In this case, they invoked a case about segregation.”A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.But there’s a clear reason why the Trump administration doesn’t want the courts to consider potential motivations for Trump’s revised travel ban: The idea that the president’s intent was to discriminate against Muslims has come up in prior rulings against his executive order. As a candidate, Trump called for a “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the U.S. and has spoken disparagingly of refugees. He and the White House say the travel executive orders are not the same as a Muslim ban, but opponents say his past statements show they likely had the same motivation. The executive order blocks certain foreign nationals of six Muslim-majority nations ― Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen ― from the U.S. for 90 days. (An earlier executive order had included Iraq.) It also bans all refugees for 120 days and cuts total refugee resettlement numbers for the year by more than half of the previous cap. The order was blocked in the courts before implementation. Pools have a history as a racial flashpoint. In the 1960s, “so unacceptable through almost all of the South was the idea of blacks and whites swimming together that even the Gulf of Mexico was off-limits to blacks in some areas,” The New York Times reported in 2006.White racial anxiety about swimming was common in the North, too. “Water fueled white racism,” Marta Gutman, a professor at the City College of New York, wrote in a 2008 paper.“The practice of bathing had expanded to include swimming for exercise, but water retained the longstanding symbolic link with purity,” Gutman wrote. “Swimming pools became places where those seen as impure or polluted would be excluded (even though water had to be sanitized in order to be pure).

Mrs. Obama paired the look with a loose half-updo, matching blue earrings and that award-winning smile, which she flashed repeatedly as her husband sang her praises from the stage and we sobbed into our Cheerios. Blue has become somewhat of a theme for the former FLOTUS. The whole family matched in navy during Obama’s farewell speech in January 2017. Hey, when something works, it works. Go on, Michelle.

With its traffic and $6.99 hummus, this city that was our home for 10 years suddenly became a completely untenable pressure cooker for my husband “M” and me. In the suburbs, M noted the lack of sidewalks with dismay. “They make it so clear that they don’t even want human beings here!”Grandma Bea’s house, though, is a haven for all living creatures. Grandma still lives alone, does her laundry in the basement, and spontaneously awakes from her naps just in time to rescue the banana cake in the oven. She calls everyone “Love” and produces a special gift, main dish, or dessert for each of us. One year, she cooked a separate Thanksgiving turkey for her six “grand-dogs” that attended.She has spent a week in the kitchen to prepare for our visit. The chocolate chip cookies are for me—a reminder of the time we baked together, and the mixer splattered cookie dough across the kitchen walls. The eggplant parmesan is for M. Our son, who is not quite two years old, receives six ceramic horses from the Smithsonian Museum catalog; Grandma knows he admired similar ones at my mother’s house, but was not allowed to touch them. This time, however, “They’re his. Let him break them if he wants.”At the end of the week, it was Grandma’s 98th birthday. We celebrated with a seafood dinner at 3:00 pm, to accommodate Grandma and her toddler great-grandson, who are on rather similar eating and sleeping schedules.During her seafood birthday meal, Grandma asks when we are moving back to New York. Tears sting my eyes, as I remember telling her that we were moving back to Germany. She had looked me right in the eye and said, “How could you? They made lampshades out of our skin. I will never forget reading that in the New York Times.” Some questions have no answers; others should not be answered. I mumble, “I don’t know,” and hope that will be the end of it. It’s not. I look at the boats out the picture windows of the City Island restaurant, and grapple for a response.All other meals that week were at Grandma’s dining room table—a gorgeous antique that contracts and expands as needed, following her order in a thick Bronx accent, “Get the leaf out of the closet.” We obligingly trudge upstairs to retrieve the heavy slab of wood from the molding closet that smells so tritely of mothballs. No matter the chosen length for the day, it always feels appropriately snug, with our family’s chairs squeezed in tightly around that table. There is magic at that table. Amid decades of Passover sedars, Thanksgivings, and Sunday bagel brunches, it is where I learned to love, and to value family above all else.Reduced to a childlike fear of disappointing Grandma, my mind slips into childhood completely. One of my most vivid memories is helping Grandma search the house for a piece of jewelry that she had lost. I have no recollection of the actual piece itself, only a vague sense that it was expensive. As Grandma tucked me into bed that night, I asked if she was upset. “No, Love. Never. These are only things. Things do not matter. The only thing in life that matters is family. We are here, and we have each other, and that’s all that matters.”I sip some water, and return to the present, where Grandma Bea is delighting in her fried oysters but waiting on my response. “Our visas are for three years, Grandma,” I tell her.“Oh. I was hoping you’d be back next year.” My son provides the needed distraction for Grandma. He is named after Grandma Bea’s husband. Grandpa was a spy in World War II, stationed at the Panama Canal. He was a man’s man, the father of three boys. However, as the first girl born into the family in decades, I was allowed to put barrettes in his comb-over, and climb onto his lap and kiss his cheeks.Grandpa’s last words to me before we moved for my fellowship year in Germany were, “Just go, live your life, and be well. We love you.” Two months later, I rushed from Germany to his hospital bedside, and then helped Grandma select his casket and plan the funeral. I mistook my early pregnancy symptoms for grief, and was nearly in my second trimester before realizing that it was new life, not death, causing my nausea.Back in Germany now, my husband’s first act is to check the mail. We carry the stack into our apartment, and comment how good it is to be home. I already have a letter from Grandma, in her steady, familiar cursive; the envelope is full. “These articles fell out of my bookshelf, and I thought they could be useful,” she wrote. They are three pieces of my own writing from high school, describing my childhood in rural Ohio. Estrangement fills the space in my soul that had just been humming with warmth. I smile at M and say, “We should get a better dining room table.”Previously published as ‘Coming Home’ in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor more great Wild Word essays see:The Love Lessons I’ve Learned as a Stepfather by James PrenattWhy Jesus Broke The ‘Billy Graham Rule’ by Reverend Rachel KesslerIs Trump Crazy Like Fox? by Maria BehanWhen Parenting Feels Like Drowning by Jami Ingledue"

I was an undergraduate at the New School for Social Research, on hunger strike for nineteen days with a battalion of peers known as The Mobilization, demanding much-needed change from the school’s administration: fair pay for campus security guards, equal pay for female faculty, hiring more professors of color, and making sure that one particular professor of color, Jacqui Alexander, could continue teaching the strongly feminist, trans-nationalist, postcolonial framework that had made her controversial and beloved.As a young, straight, cisgendered white male, I felt it was important for people who looked like me to stand in solidarity with our friends who didn’t. I knew it wasn’t my place to take over, but I also knew that, unfortunately, America’s white supremacist society would take the movement more seriously if straight white men were starving too. “People of color in this institution are at risk,” I told the New York Daily News. “We have a vision of a world that is liberatory and just.”Today, the internet has given students and other activists a louder megaphone, a greater sociopolitical and cultural reach. Where protests like the one I took part in then were of modest local interest, today’s demonstrators have national and international platforms. And while some critics are outraged at these “snowflakes” who act against systems of injustice, many of us are encouraged to see ideas, principles, and policies for which we’ve long advocated being aired in the public square.****Laura Poitras’ Graduate Thesis Documentary on the Mobilization (check out a younger me at 15:30, but worth watching Part I and II)Twenty years after going on hunger strike and seeing the movement I was part of successfully move an institution, I do have a few thoughts for the movements that are rising today. I realize I may seem very old — I am, after all, over forty — but experience does occasionally breed wisdom.First and foremost, it’s important for white progressives to remember that when taking part in social movements which directly impact people of color, there’s a thin line between bringing focus and stealing focus. As a white person, your involvement can make other white people — especially those in power — pay attention in ways they might not if you weren’t involved. But it is essential to let people of color steer the ship, to not attempt to own someone else’s movement, however well-meaning you may be. To navigate this thin line, ask friends of color for guidance and really listen to what they say. The same goes for men in women’s movements, straight people in LGBT movements, and so on.It’s also worth remembering that for all people involved in social movements, regardless of background, it’s better to cultivate allies than alienate them. I have been aghast at the ferocity with which people who are generally in agreement attack each other, especially online. The disdain from some quarters for Hillary Clinton’s most ardent supporters was not only politically misguided, it was counterproductive. The adversaries of social change are the people in the White House and Congress, not people who are two percent less “woke” than you are.When dealing with people who truly are adversaries, it can be very useful to let them speak. In a world where anyone with an internet connection can have a global platform, the spectacle of trying to prevent someone’s voice from being heard in one specific geographic location only amplifies their voice in other forums. Hateful speech is horrific, but it is literally impossible to stamp it out, especially with modern technology. Better to counter their arguments at every turn, defeating disdainful points of view through superior argument and, above all, superior organizing.Finally, it’s important to always, always act strategically — especially when lives are at stake. The third party vote in 2016 was greater than Hillary Clinton’s margin of defeat in each of the key swing states, resulting in real harm for marginalized communities. The Dakota Access Pipeline is a go. Undocumented immigrants are being rounded up. The bipartisan consensus on criminal justice reform and de-incarceration that was ascendant only a year ago has been replaced by a Justice Department seeking to double down on those policies and impede African American voting. Clinton was far from perfect, but none of these crises would be unfolding under her watch.Twenty years after The Mobilization at the New School, I am just as committed to social, economic, and environmental justice as I was then. I am out protesting almost every weekend with my seven year old son. I have worked my way into a career path that allows me to organize investments in renewable energy which can save our climate, to lead efforts that use innovative technologies to deliver humanitarian aid, and to work with large corporations to execute their new ventures in ways that minimize harm and maximize social good.These are the ways that I personally can maximize my impact at this stage of my life. For others, the answers will be different. But it is essential for progressives to act strategically, for white progressives to know when to utilize their privilege and when to check it, for all of us who care about these issues to hold together despite disagreements within our factions — and not to demonize the allies with whom we disagree. With those guideposts in mind, we really can defeat the racist aspiring autocrat in the White House and his Congressional enablers."

This particular holiday always makes me a little bit sad. I remember my mother and wonder how we would have celebrated it this coming Sunday, when she would have been eighty-nine years old just as I round the corner of sixty-four. My mother, the late poet Anne Sexton, never saw her twenty-first Mother’s Day. In October of 1974, on a day marked by the leaves of the swamp maples behind our home turning brilliant orange and red, and under a sky the color of a robin’s egg, she took her own life. She was not quite forty-five.It is perhaps somewhat ironic that I feel a little blue about Mother’s Day, considering that my Mom thought that to observe it as a holiday was silly. “Hallmark invented Mother’s Day,” she used to declare. “It’s just an excuse to make money on a bunch of sappy cards.” Despite this, she always enjoyed the breakfast in bed that my sister and I cooked when we were children and the handmade cards over which we labored. She was a mercurial and often inconsistent woman.Perhaps her disillusionment with this particular holiday came from her conflict over being a mother to begin with. She always felt inadequate, unable to cope, and was hard on herself. The reality was that she suffered from an undiagnosed and totally uncontrolled bipolar disorder that sometimes made the selflessness parenting requires very difficult. Now I wish I could just reassure her: how great a mother she was when illness moved over to let love in.She took the time to spend an hour or two away from her writing each day after the school bus had dropped me off in the afternoon. She stood by the riding ring for countless horse shows in the worst weather, cheering for both my sister and me as we jumped over fences big enough to scare even the most intrepid mother—and in spite of the fact that she both hated and feared the beasts that towered over her.She comforted me with intense empathy when I lost a girl or boy friend I depended on or loved, and was always there with a hug and kiss that brought true solace. She had a great sense of adventure, and when I was a high school sophomore even bleached my hair blond because it was the most desired color among the popular girls; I’ll never forget the two of us bent over the bathroom sink with rubber gloves and Miss Clairol. She never made a single comment about my early attempts at poetry that was not kind and generous, and so created a strong and unbreakable bond between us through our love of writing.When her bipolar disorder was controlled, she was a great Mom. If I’d known enough then to tell her that, perhaps then she would have enjoyed Mother’s Day more.In the end, her self-destructive urges overcame her and she succumbed to an overwhelming depression. In despair, she died alone. What really haunts me is that neither my sister nor I were at her side as she faced down life’s last minutes. We weren’t able to rescue her. But, as Anna Quindlen says in her novel, Miller’s Valley: “It’s a lot harder to save people than you think it is.”I have reminded myself of exactly this over the last forty-one years since her suicide. I couldn’t save her. So, this year I shake off that sense of guilt and try not to be too sad on Mother’s Day. I try to remember instead the wonderful gifts Mom gave me, and all she continues to mean to me.In the years since 1983, when my first son was born, I have spent this holiday thinking about my own children, as well. They, too, made me cards when they were kids and brought me breakfast in bed. Now, in their thirties, they remember to phone and wish me a happy Mother’s Day. I hope they’ve found me to be as good a Mom as mine was.And so I’ll celebrate my mother this coming Sunday, remembering all we shared, but disagreeing at last with her declaration that the holiday is just a gimmick. Maybe, instead, it’s a time to be cherished—having become over the years a celebration of the complicated mother, and woman, Mom really was. I’ll lift a glass of champagne in her name and remember how lucky I am to be her daughter.A version of this post originally appeared in this newsletter by Linda Gray Sexton. ________Linda Gray Sexton was born in Newton, Massachusetts in 1953.

Gerard , ContributorInternational President United Steelworkers union",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-dont-care_us_590f4bd9e4b0f711807245b4,what the GOP really did was shoot Americans in the foot. Then slap each other on the back in the Rose Garden.,2017-05-08,"<p><strong><em>Photo from Bernie Sanders</em></strong>’ <strong><em>Twitter account, posted May 4 with this comment: </em></strong>“Donald Trump and Republicans just celebrated voting to let thousands of Americans die so that billionaires get tax breaks. Think about that.”</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590f4c4a1400000b17f8ba3b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans in the House last week passed the Trump-Don’t-Care bill.The legislation they called the American Health Care Act is not about improving health care at all. It would, in fact, strip coverage from 24 million Americans.The name of the bill shouldn’t even include the word “care,” since it threatens to deny health insurance to millions with pre-existing conditions and those suffering expensive ailments.No, there’s no caring in this legislation. It’s all about politics. Republicans promised for seven years to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And now that they control the House, Senate, White House and Supreme Court, they’re intent on doing just that, no matter who they hurt, no matter how many Americans they injure. Thus the “Don’t Care” designation for Trump’s legislation.Just how much don’t they care? Let’s count some ways.Under Trump-Don’t-Care, older people get battered. Insurers can charge them five times the rate for younger people, instead of three times under the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare because former President Obama actually cared enough to make sure his legislation would increase the number of Americans covered by 20 million and provide affordable insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.Here’s what Trump-Don’t-Care will mean in dollars and cents to older people according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office: A 64-year-old with an annual income of $26,500 pays $1,700 a year in Obamacare premiums now. And that’s a lot on a $26,500 income. But under Trump-Don’t-Care, the cost will skyrocket to $14,600, more than half of the old person’s income.ObamaCare broadened Medicaid eligibility, but Republicans would cut $880 billion from the program, making it much tougher for the nation’s poor, disabled, elderly and marginalized to get the insurance. The GOP would, for example, allow states to require recipients to work. The upshot is that 14 million would lose their coverage.Trump-Don’t-Care eliminates ObamaCare’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and asthma. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 27 percent of adults under the age of 65 have one of these ailments, about 52 million people.The foundation lists about 30 of these diseases in a report on its website. Those are only the most common, however. U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, listed 90 in alphabetical order in a series of tweets on Thursday, including: acid reflux, acne, ADD, addiction, Alzheimer’s/dementia, anemia, aneurysm, angioplasty, anorexia, anxiety, arrhythmia, arthritis, atrial fibrillation, autism, bariatric surgery, basal cell carcinoma, cerebral palsy, cerebral thrombosis, cervical cancer, colon cancer, colon polyps, congestive heart failure, COPD, Crohn’s disease, migraines, seizures, sickle cell disease, skin cancer, sleep apnea, stent, stroke, thyroid issues, tooth disease, tuberculosis and ulcers.Trump-Don’t-Care would mean that if a person with one of these illnesses is without health insurance for a time because of job loss or some other problem, when they try to get covered again, the insurer may charge them unaffordable rates. The GOP put an extra $8 billion in the bill at the last minute to fund high-risk pools for these people, but that sum is grossly inadequate, by about $200 billion.Also under Trump-Don’t-Care, states would be able to waive the requirement that insurers cover what the Affordable Care Act defined as 10 essential services. These include hospitalization, maternity care, mental health and opioid treatment, chronic disease management, prescription drugs, and ambulance transport. That might make insurance cheaper, but it would be insurance worth less to the so-called beneficiary as well.If even one state cuts essential services, millions could be affected nationwide as large employers would be able to exploit the changes to degrade the coverage it provides workers in other states. That means many workers could once again be faced with annual and lifetime limits on coverage and the loss of caps on the amount that must be paid out of pocket annually.Also, Trump-Don’t-Care whether workers have insurance. The Affordable Care Act requires employers with more than 50 workers to provide it. But the Republicans eliminated that mandate.On the other hand, the GOP retained one aspect of the Affordable Care Act that workers have protested from the outset, the tax on comprehensive, but expensive, plans. That affects workers whose employers do the right thing and provide good health insurance. It pressures those companies to scale back coverage to avoid the tax.Republicans retained that tax on workers, but eliminated levies on the nation’s wealthiest, the top 4.4 percent. Trump-Don’t-Care erases $275 billion in taxes on those fat cats that pay for Affordable Care Act benefits.That means the GOP would transfer hundreds of billions from poor, no-longer-insured people to those who don’t need the extra cash – the wealthy. The Kardashian crew doesn’t need any more diamond rings. Kanye West doesn’t need any more cars. And Donald Trump doesn’t need any more gilt. But the single mother working at McDonald’s and the widower supporting two kids on day laborer’s wages sure as hell need that Medicaid expansion.As soon as they passed the Trump-Don’t-Care bill in the House last week, GOP lawmakers ran to the Rose Garden to party – then took off for an 11-day vacation. They celebrated slashing insurance benefits for 24 million. They drank champagne to destroying any sense of security for people suffering pre-existing conditions. And since the average net worth of House Republicans is $7.6 million, they rejoiced at having voted to give themselves a big fat tax break.Democrats mocked them for reveling over passage of a bill that would hurt so many Americans. Just after the vote, the Democrats sang “Na na na na, hey, hey, hey, good bye,” from the Steam song, suggesting that Republicans had shot themselves in the foot by passing Trump-Don’t-Care because constituents would make them pay in the 2018 elections.But what the GOP really did was shoot Americans in the foot. Then slap each other on the back in the Rose Garden. They just don’t care."
41,THE WORLDPOST,Macron's Victory Does Not Mean Liberalism Is Safe,"Bill Emmott, ContributorChairman, The Wake Up Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/macron-french-election-liberalism_us_590ced7fe4b0e7021e97dd77,"The West isn't in the clear --
 elections aren’t everything.",2017-05-08,"It would be wrong to say the West's fight is over, even in France, with Emmanuel Macron's win.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590fdea21600000a12c59ecd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"OXFORD, England — In the wake of the rise of populist nationalism across Europe and the United States, it would be tempting to say that the fate of the West and the future of liberalism were in the hands of French voters. By choosing decisively in Sunday’s elections to send the centrist reformer Emmanuel Macron rather than the far-right Marine Le Pen to the presidential Elysee Palace in the second round runoff, the French avoided a spiral of destruction of the values and institutions on which the prosperity of Europe, the U.S., Japan and other liberal democracies has been based for more than half a century. The West, on this argument, has been saved.But while true in parts, such a statement would be too simple. The French vote was important but ultimately not decisive. And it would be wrong to say the fight is over, even in France, let alone the rest of the West. This battle of ideas is going to run and run. Elections count, but they do not bring the battle to a close.Although it may feel like it at times, this battle is not a sporting contest. Candidates like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton pitted against each other in the U.S., Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron in France, Geert Wilders and Mark Rutte in the Netherlands and Matteo Renzi and whichever proxy the comedian and political activist Beppe Grillo chooses in Italy, are not akin to key players that determine the league champion. The issues that lie behind populism in the West are not going to go away when the current election season is over. To understand why, we need to reflect upon why an outsider to politics is now in the White House and why a far-right candidate such as Le Pen still won around 34 percent of the second-round vote on Sunday, where her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, had had to make do with just 18 percent when he, too, competed unsuccessfully in the runoff for the French presidency in 2002.The reality is that voters in Europe and the United States are angry and disillusioned ― with good reason. Populist nationalists such as Trump and Le Pen are responding to genuine, legitimate grievances. “The system,” as both Trump and former U.S. presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) claimed, has been at best dysfunctional, at worst rigged.In France, after all, unemployment remained at close to 10 percent or more throughout much of the five-year presidency of the socialist François Hollande that began in 2012, despite his repeated promises it would fall. It is a similar, but worse, story across the border in Italy.Italy will be the next country to witness the struggle between liberal and populist ideals across Europe. After the period between 2008 and 2013 proved to be the worst economic slump in the country’s modern history, neither the economy nor household incomes have shown more than minuscule, undetectable growth during the nearly three-year premiership of their last leader, Matteo Renzi. Renzi, who at 39 (the same age as Macron) became Italy’s youngest prime minister since its unification in 1861, took power in 2014 on reformist promises but resigned ignominiously last December with a crushing defeat in a referendum over his proposals to change the constitution.No wonder Grillo’s insurgent Five Star Movement is now leading the opinion polls, ahead of general elections that are slated to take place by next spring at the latest. Five Star appeals to a wide cross-section of the Italian electorate, young and old, college-educated or high-school graduates, professional or working class. Its core policy proposals are for a referendum on Italy’s membership of the European Union’s euro single currency and ― the most popular by far ― a vast anti-corruption drive. Its most powerful slogan is just one word: “Onesta” or ”Honesty.""Like Trump, Five Star claims to be focused on “draining the swamp.” Unlike the U.S. president though, it is likely that those goals will actually be attempted by whichever prime ministerial candidate that wealthy political activist Grillo decides to put forward. The reason why Grillo will not himself be a candidate for election is that thanks to a long ago car crash indictment, he has excluded himself under his own rule that no one with a criminal conviction can run for office on Five Star’s ticket.And let us not forget the reality in America. President Trump’s inauguration speech may have been hyperbolic in its description of “carnage” in the U.S., but he wasn’t wholly off the mark. Never mind that the U.S. economy has, in simple GDP terms, recovered better from 2008 than most European economies. Any society in which something like 10 million prime working-age men have left the labor market and given up looking for work that will pay wages high enough to make the effort worthwhile, is not a society that is functioning well.Add in the growing concentration of oligopolistic corporate power in industry after industry ― the real reason why United and other airlines get away with treating their customers so badly ― and the grip of big corporations and billionaires on campaign finance, and you have a system that is neither open nor likely to feel equal, to a significant proportion of voters. This is a big reason why the U.S. fares poorly on an index that measures the preparedness of Western countries to adapt to an ever-changing global society. The 2050 Index, conducted by my educational charity, The Wake Up Foundation, which is dedicated to building public awareness of the deleterious trends under way in Western societies, shows that the U.S. comes a lowly 23rd out of 35 countries in its preparedness for future trends and shocks — that’s lower even than France, which sits at 20th. America is clearly not as open, equal or well prepared as it needs to be.Those two words ― open and equal ― are crucial words for the whole of the West. Populist nationalists such as Trump and Le Pen have sought to frame the debate as being about globalism versus patriotism. But that is to divert attention from the true issue. The real issue is that open, liberal societies have in the past succeeded by combining openness with a strong sense of equality ― a winning formula that has become neglected for so long that today it’s been effectively rendered obsolete.Openness is vital to bring new ideas, people and opportunities — all the virtues of competition, accountability and decentralization. But equality has been vital to build the social trust necessary to make the bracing changes brought by such openness acceptable. If we are all in it together, as citizens, with equal political voices, with equal protection by the rule of law and equal opportunities arising from education and meritocracy, then openness works. If we lose that sense of equality, then disillusion and anger sets in, and alternative solutions based on closing borders and minds seem more appealing.That is where we are now. Liberal ideas ― in the classic, English sense of liberalism ― are not in retreat. The problem is that over the past 10 to 15 years we failed to maintain and implement those ideas. We failed to deliver the combination of security, rising living standards and equality of treatment that citizens had come to expect. We forgot that our own successful formula, the most successful political idea the world has ever seen, requires us to not only be open to new ideas, but give all political actors equal voice as well.Now, ideas about openness and equality need to win elections, as they have just done in France. But even more than that, they need to be restored and reimplemented in public policy and political institutions in all our countries, so as to restore social mobility and a vital sense of shared citizenship.Winning was the easy part for Emmanuel Macron, happy though he will be to have won more decisively than opinion polls had predicted. Reviving France, with all the open, international engagement through NATO and the EU to which it has long been committed, will require a keen and credible focus on equality, too. The same is true of other countries in the West.This battle promises to be long and hard. But it must be won. Otherwise, in the next election season, enemies of openness such as Le Pen will be back, stronger than ever."

During what Madrigal jokingly described as “the heaviest comedy interview of all time,” the 45-year-old star also discussed his role in Showtime’s upcoming dark comedy “I’m Dying Up Here,” and how he’s hoping to nurture future Latino stand-up comics. You start the special going in on Trump and discussing a cilantro-inspired revenge plot against him from Mexico. Jokes aside, what’s your take on where Latinos stand in U.S. politics right now?I think a lot of Latinos in the United States, by all means, should be Republicans. They are super hardworking and religious. My dad and mom, they voted for both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush because they felt they earned all their money. My mom used to clean houses. My dad was a warehouse worker and had zero to start with and then started a company and sort of built this fortune. They had this ridiculous rags-to-riches story and a lot of Latinos who have had success in the United States find themselves leaning that way, where they’re fiscally conservative and think everyone should be able to pick themselves up by the bootstrap because they did. But the fact is that they feel so villainized by the right, and especially the far right, that they can’t help but side with the Democrats even though their values scream that they should be Republicans.In that first bit, you also mention that you thought the moment Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” would be the end of his campaign.Oh yeah, I really did think that! The other thing I brought up in that same bit was when Trump told Jorge Ramos to go back to Univision. I was like, “What?! The Latino people will not stand for this! You will not get elected because we decide who gets elected.” And then it happened.I [went] on Anthony Bourdain’s show and I think I said that [Latinos] may not be one of the next presidents but we will certainly decide who gets elected as president. So there might not be a Latino in the White House in the near future but we, the Latinos in the United States, will determine who gets elected.And yeah, I think we did: Donald Trump.You think Latinos elected Donald Trump?Oh, absolutely, you look at Florida. They put Florida over the top. While experts have certainly debated that, don’t you think it was more of a lack of unity within the community? Your Fusion special “Half Like Me” touched upon how divided Latinos can be and how it stops the community from progressing. Yeah, the crabs in the bucket analogy. Absolutely. But it’s not just a Latino problem. A lot of people use that analogy. And this is something that I sort of covered on “The Daily Show” constantly: When people try to lump all Latinos together, it’s just impossible. You can’t do that. There is no spokesperson for all Latinos. There is no unifying Latinos. Puerto Ricans don’t give a shit about immigration. I mean there’s [Puerto Ricans], the same as anyone else, who may feel like having an opinion on the issue but they’re not just naturally inclined to [care just] because they fall into that Latino category.I mean, I think it’s fair to say immigration isn’t an inherently Latino issue, but then what about someone like you? You’re Mexican-American with several generations in the U.S.; is immigration at the top of your list as an issue?Oh yeah, exactly. So that’s what I’m saying. But I’ve seen fellow Mexicans being so mistreated and we have a lot of employers that are taking advantage of this cheap labor and mistreating these employees. I definitely, I always side with the Mexicans even though I’m established in the United States. But just as a human. That’s something I try to address in the special.Shifting off politics, you’re also in Showtime’s upcoming dramedy, “I’m Dying Up Here,” about a group of stand-up comedians struggling to make it in 1970s Los Angeles. Can you tell us about your character, Edgar Martinez? That was a desperate time for a lot of people, so we really do show that desperation really well. My character is sort of a mash-up of a couple of different Latino comedians. I think there’s some Freddie Prinze in there, there’s some Cheech in there, there’s some Carlos Mencia in there. I was fortunate enough to be able to be in the writers room for the entire time on this thing, and I couldn’t be more proud of the product.Do you think the show truly captures that real-life struggle? How have things changed or stayed the same?Well, you still have to sort of start the same way [in comedy]. When you start doing stand-up comedy you need to take the leap. I left a job, a lot of people have done that. Howie Mandel was a carpet salesman whose friends pushed him to do an open mic and everyone has their origin story. We see a lot of that on the show. But then as people pass others and you climb up this ladder of the stand-up world there’s backstabbing, stealing, fights, accusations flying around, the competitiveness of being a sort of independent contractor in this world where you sacrificed a lot on the hopes that you might make it as a comedian. It’s crazy.Are you describing the show or your experiences in real-life?Both. That’s everyone’s experience. We’re all surrounded by it. Everyone is not standing around slapping each other on the back. I mean, there’s a great community of comedians that I’m very good friends with but we all have the same stories. That’s why when we get together, we love talking about, “OMG, have you ever done this gig?” So we’ve all sort of gone to war together and most of the big comics have paid all of the same dues.It’s also nice to see Latinos represented in the cast, because honestly it feels like there aren’t enough Latinos in stand-up.There’s certainly not a lot of popular Latino comics right now. I mean there’s George Lopez, Gabriel Iglesias ― now you tell me who the others are.Louis C.K. is part Mexican?Yeah. Louis C.K. is half Mexican. OK, we’ll take him. But he doesn’t have a lot of material about it. But I’m just saying, where are all the others? There’s just not enough. I’m starting the Latino Comedy Festival so we can actually do sort of TED-style talks for people in Los Angeles about careers in comedy because I feel we’re so underserved. I got yelled at when I told my dad I was going to be a stand-up comic. I was trying to work a job and do comedy at the same time, and he thought I was a crazy person.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5910c5251e00003a00621e0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Al Madrigal is returning to his politically driven comedy in his newest stand-up special.“Shrimpin’ Ain’t Easy,” which premiered Friday on Showtime, begins with the former senior Latino correspondent for “The Daily Show” unearthing a “cilantro plot” against Donald Trump before delving into other bits about parenting, anger and a real-life revenge story involving shrimp.The Mexican-American comedian recently spoke with HuffPost about the special and Latinos’ responsibility in putting Trump in the White House. During what Madrigal jokingly described as “the heaviest comedy interview of all time,” the 45-year-old star also discussed his role in Showtime’s upcoming dark comedy “I’m Dying Up Here,” and how he’s hoping to nurture future Latino stand-up comics. You start the special going in on Trump and discussing a cilantro-inspired revenge plot against him from Mexico. Jokes aside, what’s your take on where Latinos stand in U.S. politics right now?I think a lot of Latinos in the United States, by all means, should be Republicans. They are super hardworking and religious. My dad and mom, they voted for both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush because they felt they earned all their money. My mom used to clean houses. My dad was a warehouse worker and had zero to start with and then started a company and sort of built this fortune. They had this ridiculous rags-to-riches story and a lot of Latinos who have had success in the United States find themselves leaning that way, where they’re fiscally conservative and think everyone should be able to pick themselves up by the bootstrap because they did. But the fact is that they feel so villainized by the right, and especially the far right, that they can’t help but side with the Democrats even though their values scream that they should be Republicans.In that first bit, you also mention that you thought the moment Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” would be the end of his campaign.Oh yeah, I really did think that! The other thing I brought up in that same bit was when Trump told Jorge Ramos to go back to Univision. I was like, “What?! The Latino people will not stand for this! You will not get elected because we decide who gets elected.” And then it happened.I [went] on Anthony Bourdain’s show and I think I said that [Latinos] may not be one of the next presidents but we will certainly decide who gets elected as president. So there might not be a Latino in the White House in the near future but we, the Latinos in the United States, will determine who gets elected.And yeah, I think we did: Donald Trump.You think Latinos elected Donald Trump?Oh, absolutely, you look at Florida.

The water where she sat was about 2 feet deep.One witness heard the girl’s screams from the shore. “I realized that she was screaming that she got bit by an alligator,” witness Emilio Aquino told Fox News. “At this point, I couldn’t see anything, but a couple of seconds later, I saw the alligator so I ran towards the water.”The brave girl fought back, first by poking the alligator in its nose and then by pulling down on its lower jaw, which freed her leg, ABC News reported.The child was treated at the scene by lifeguards before family members took her to a hospital. She sustained puncture wounds to the back of her knee and lower thigh, according to the Fish and Wildlife report.“She had puncture wounds but I don’t think they’re life-threatening,” Chad Weber, a Fish and Wildlife spokesman, told the Orlando Sentinel.The gator, described as 8 feet, 9 inches long, was captured shortly after and removed from the lake in Moss Park. It was euthanized, authorities said.As for how she knew what to do in such a terrifying situation, the girl said she learned the escape tactics during a visit to Gatorland, a local wildlife attraction, ABC News reported.There, professional alligator wrangler Donald Aldarelli applauded the girl’s actions. “If you were ever in a position where an alligator were to grab ahold of you, then the nose, not the eyes, the nose is the spot you want to go for,” he told ABC News.Aldarelli marveled at the girl’s ability to pry open the gator’s mouth.“To get an animal with the strongest bite on the planet to let go of you is a miracle,” he said.In a video released by Gatorland on Monday, two gator experts again praised the girl’s response and offered some other tips to those living around gators."

Tom Udall (D-N.M,2017-05-08,"<p> The late Roy Lichtenstein, whose work “The Ring (Engagement)” is pictured, was a Democratic donor, though not as prolific as his widow. Dorothy Lichtenstein gave $1.2 million to Democratic and liberal candidates and committees in the 2016 election cycle.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/591091ef140000a616f8bce7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," by Niv Sultan The Recording Academy’s high-wattage GRAMMYs on the Hill event in early April honored Sens. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) for their commitment to the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) — an agency that President Donald Trump‘s administration has proposed cutting.Still, stars like country singers Keith Urban and Wynonna Judd, both of whom performed that night, don’t rely on the NEA for their survival; they were there, in part, to underscore the central role of the endowment in the artistic endeavors of nonprofits, museums, schools, local governments and other noncommercial organizations. Among last fall’s grantees: The city of Los Angeles, which received $50,000 for an exhibition about Latin American art and architecture; Step Afrika! of Washington, D.C., awarded $10,000 to support its Black History Month tour; and the Cuyahoga Community College Foundation in Cleveland, which won two grants, including $20,000 for an educational jazz festival.Without much of a presence on the Hill, such community-centric organizations rely largely on advocates in the broader arts universe, like the Recording Academy, which spent $162,000 lobbying last year, and Americans for the Arts, a group that spent $160,000 lobbying on issues like arts education and creative arts therapy access for veterans.In the first quarter of 2017, Americans for the Arts ramped up, spending $90,000 on lobbying — more than half its outlays for all of 2016. Funding for NEA and its companion group, the National Endowment for the Humanities, was the first concern it listed on its lobbying report.Another concern listed by the group: tax deductions for charitable contributions, which, as of last month, some in the Trump administration reportedly were considering capping as part of a tax reform proposal.That could be a matter of life and death for arts groups, which rely heavily on donations. In 2012, for example, the NEA reported that nonprofit performing arts groups and museums received nearly 45 percent of their revenue from government and private sector contributions. Almost all of that, however, came from individuals, foundations and corporations; less than 7 percent of total revenue came from the government at any level.Then why is the NEA so significant for these groups?For one, the endowment helps make up for the geographically disproportionate nature of charitable giving, said Elizabeth Auclair, an NEA spokesperson, in an email. Rural areas receive only 5.5 percent of philanthropic dollars, she explained.The second reason: Government grants can catalyze private giving by legitimizing a project. “Research shows that even a low level of public funding can stimulate private giving,” wrote Auclair. NEA’s funding must be matched by money from other sources, and “when a nonprofit receives an NEA award, it provides the credibility for other funders to step up.”In fiscal year 2016, NEA grants resulted in $500 million in matching support, Auclair noted.Art is for everyone, but its money leans leftWhen it comes to campaign contributions, the kinds of arts organizations that might receive a small NEA grant are unlikely to be rife with high-earning employees capable of donating large sums of money to politicians. Still, some of the bigger groups and arts institutions do make a mark. Americans for the Arts has a PAC (a rarity in the art world), and between that and gifts from its leadership and staff, the organization gave nearly $143,000 in contributions last cycle, 84 percent of which went to Democrats. The group’s top recipient after presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ($10,711) was Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), co-chair of the Congressional Arts Caucus. She received $10,000, and her co-chair, Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), received $3,500.Overall, Democrats get the lion’s share of contributions from arts organizations, perhaps because they seem more willing to publicly associate themselves with the cause. Although the Recording Academy honored one senator from each party (Maine Republican Collins and New Mexico Democrat Udall) with its political Grammys, about 79 percent of the 160 members of the Congressional Arts Caucus are Democrats.In the 2016 cycle, individuals associated with the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Association of Museums all gave 99 percent or more of their contributions to Democrats. In fact, Natural History has given all of its contributions of more than $200 to Democrats since at least 1994. The level of the gifts varies widely between groups: The museum association gave $1,600, Natural History gave more than $27,8000, and the Met gave a relatively whopping $282,000 ($20,000 from Joanne Lyman, who used to manage jewelry reproduction for the museum; about $50,000 from Laurel Britton, head of strategy; and nearly $161,000 from Annette de la Renta, a board member.)Private art galleries skew no less Democratic.Over the course of the past four election cycles, seven galleries (selected for their prominence and because they employ active political donors) gave less than $1 million combined. Two of them, Gagosian Gallery and Pace Gallery, accounted for more than half that total. (We didn’t include Christie’s and Sotheby’s, as their business dealings extend beyond those of a traditional gallery.)Most of the money from Gagosian and Pace came from their respective owners. In the 2016 cycle, Larry Gagosian gave about $86,400 (almost all of Gagosian Gallery’s contributions) to candidates, party committees and other groups, and Arnold and Mildred Glimcher of Pace Gallery gave more than $186,000. Gagosian made six gifts, and only one went to a Republican; all 159 of the Glimcher couple’s gifts went to Democratic candidates and groups.In addition to gallery owners and employees, some of the artists on display are donors as well. Multimedia artists Carol Brown Goldberg and Pamela Joseph have contributed more than $1 million and nearly $233,000, respectively, since 2008 — all to Democratic and liberal candidates and groups. And remember the iconic “Hope” poster from President Barack Obama‘s 2008 campaign? Shepard Fairey, its designer, gave $17,700 to the DNC that cycle. (He also sent $2,300 Obama’s way.)Before his death in 1997, pop artist Roy Lichtenstein was a reliable Democratic donor. His contributions pale next to those of his widow, though: Dorothy Lichtenstein, president of the foundation that bears his name, made more than $1.2 million in contributions in the 2016 cycle. Planned Parenthood Votes, a super PAC, received $900,000 of that, another $100,200 benefited the DNC Services Corp. and other gifts went to various Democratic party committees, candidates and PACs.Regardless of the arts universe’s progressive leanings, lawmakers of both parties might find reason to get behind the NEA; Its data shows it awards 40 percent of its grantmaking budget directly to states, and, in fiscal year 2016, it recommended grants in every congressional district in the country. At a cost equal to approximately 0.004 percent of the federal budget, that kind of local aid could be difficult even for Congress’ most hardened small-government advocates to make a stink about.On April 7, 11 House Republicans — along with many of their Democratic peers — signed a letter not only standing by the NEA, but also seeking a roughly 5 percent increase in its funding. The letter went to Reps. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) and Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the chairman and ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies, which handles the NEA and NEH’s budgets.And now, those lawmakers, along with the arts community, seem to be getting what they want — for the time being, at least. Last week, Congress agreed on a budget that calls for a $2 million increase in the NEA’s funding, which would raise the agency’s budget to what it had requested for fiscal year 2017 more than a year ago."

Not who actually coded the malware, or who unleashed it on an essential piece of the internet’s infrastructure — instead, I wanted to know if anybody could be held legally responsible. Could the unsecure devices’ manufacturers be liable for the damage their products?Right now, in this early stage of connected devices’ slow invasion into our daily lives, there’s no clear answer to that question. That’s because there’s no real legal framework that would hold manufacturers responsible for critical failures that harm others. As is often the case, the technology has developed far faster than policies and regulations.But it’s not just the legal system that’s out of touch with the new, connected reality. The Internet of Things, as it’s called, is also lacking a critical ethical framework, argues Francine Berman, a computer-science professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a longtime expert on computer infrastructure. Together with Vint Cerf, an engineer considered one of the fathers of the internet, Berman wrote an article in the journal Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery about the need for an ethical system.I spoke to her about ethical design, and how to balance individual privacy with the potential for social good of connected devices that share data with one another. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for concision and clarity, follows.RELATED: Porn Star James Deen’s Crisis of ConscienceKaveh Waddell: Why is it particularly important to think about ethics in the Internet of Things?Francine Berman: I think we’ve been running up against these issues as digital technologies become more and more prevalent — but the Internet of Things is particularly interesting.First of all, we’re just at the tip of the iceberg in what is arguably going to be a brave new world. And it’s highly heterogenous: We’ll be seeing a lot more autonomous systems, we’ll be seeing enhanced humans and smart systems, devices, and organizations. When you put all of those together, and you start thinking about how to bring out the best of the Internet of Things rather than the worst of the Internet of Things, governance is really the key.That means understanding how to design and build and think about these systems. Who’s responsible and who’s accountable, what does it mean to be ethical, and what does it mean to promote the public good?Waddell: What’s another example of a new technology driving the creation a new ethical framework?Berman: Think about the Industrial Revolution: The technologies were very compelling — but perhaps the most compelling part were the social differences it created. During the Industrial Revolution, you saw a move to the cities, you saw the first child-labor laws, you saw manufacturing really come to the fore. Things were available that had not been very available before. There was a workforce evolution.In some sense, the Information Age has had that same kind of impact on all aspects of life. And the Internet of Things exacerbates it, because now the boundaries between the physical world and the biological world and the cyber world are blending. We’re bumping into something that’s going to have a tremendous impact in the way we live, what we do, how we think about things, and even our individual rights.Waddell: Have we seen a shift in governance in the Information Age in the way we did at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution?Berman: Well, sure. You think about something like copyright: That was around at the time of the Constitution, and now we’re worrying about whether Stairway to Heaven is a copyright infringement. There’s a lot of things we’re looking at now that we never even imagined we’d have to think about. A great example: What if self-driving cars have to make bad choices? How do they do that? Where are the ethics? And then who is accountable for the choices that are made by autonomous systems?This needs to be more of a priority, and we need to be thinking about it more broadly. We need to start designing the systems that are going to be able to support social regulation, social policy, and social practice, to bring out the best of the Internet of Things.Waddell: What would those supporting systems look like?Berman: Think about designing a car. I want to design it so it’s safe, and so that the opportunity to hack my car is minimized. If I design Internet of Things systems that are effective, provide me a lot of opportunities, and are adaptive, but I only worry about really important things like security and privacy and safety afterwards, it’s much less effective than designing them with those things in mind.We can lessen the number of unintended consequences if we start thinking from the design stage and the innovation stage how we’re going to use these technologies. Then, we put into place the corresponding social framework.RELATED: Torching the Modern-Day Library of AlexandriaWaddell: I want to ask a little more about attribution. How, for example, should we think about assigning responsibility for the Mirai botnet that harnessed Internet of Things devices to attack core internet infrastructure last year? Who should be held responsible for that?Berman: That’s a really great question. There’s a shared responsibility between innovators, companies, the government, and the individual, to try and create and utilize a framework that assigns responsibility and accountability based on what promotes the public good.Think about medicine: In trying to treat symptoms and cure diseases, the medical community creates medication. Some medications are available over the counter, and some medications require a prescription because you need guidance from your doctor. Some medications can only be administered in the hospital because they’re very specialized or dangerous. We have a whole social and policy framework to govern the use and administration of medicine — even if it doesn’t work perfectly — whose purpose is to keep you safe and promote individual and public health.Waddell: How do we create a framework like that? Does it start with creating a new system of regulations?Berman: We have to be careful with regulations, because we want to make sure we have thoughtful regulations that promote the public good, instead of get in the way of things.The Internet of Things is just emerging, so this is a great time for experimentation. If you think about a smart city or a smart system or a smart building, or even an intensive-care ward, you have a lot of devices and systems that share information, you have policy issues, you have privacy issues. This is a great time for us to start experimenting with things that make sense, and getting some feedback.The National Institute of Standards and Technology is doing some really interesting work on cyber-physical systems, and they’re starting to develop standards that would help people keep things private. We’ll have more experience with that as people start putting that into practice. Some of it will work very well, and some of it won’t, and that will help us iteratively improve it.You can’t come out full force with a law about something you don’t really know about, because it’s unlikely to work effectively. But we can get a lot of experience in more circumscribed systems now. And if we make it a priority and we start looking at smart cities in that way, or smart buildings, then I think we have a chance of starting to organically grow a sensible governance and ethical system for the Internet of Things.Waddell: How do you balance individual privacy with the greater community good that can come from harvesting large amounts of personal data?Berman: I think we’re dealing with this bit by bit. When you travel to a foreign country and you come back, and the customs agent asks you where you’ve been, they’re really asking a question that you might think is private information. But you’re willing to share with them whether you’re on a farm or whether you’re bringing back vegetables: things that can be dangerous to the public good. So we’re already making those decisions all the time.The Internet of Things is exacerbated by the sheer technical challenge of trying to do things adaptively and preferentially. So imagine that I can decide whether, for example, my address can appear on Google Maps. Then, Google Maps becomes less valuable.And it’s hard to even imagine what kind of technical infrastructure you would need to maintain, or who would maintain it, to make that happen. So there will always be trade-offs. And they’ll always be in the gray area between extreme personal privacy and everything being transparent for the public good.Waddell: Has anybody struck that balance particularly well?Berman: That’s a good question. In some sense, that’s an individual opinion. I’m okay telling people whether or not I’ve been on a farm when I come back from a trip. But there are other places where I’m not so comfortable. I might feel that my device taking data and sharing data is too intrusive for me.One question I have is whether the generation of people who grew up with having their devices be a part of their lives, versus the generations that didn’t, will have different ideas about what’s okay and what’s not okay.Waddell: I also wonder if people who see what they might gain from participating in a larger community-oriented data-gathering process might shift their attitudes. For example, digital assistants like Siri learn from the people that use them. When you use Siri, you’re helping teach it—does that make people decide it’s worth it to give up a small amount of privacy to have a more useful digital assistant?Berman: I agree with that. A key question is: Are there negative repercussions to having people know about a particular thing? I think in a lot of instances, there are no negative repercussions. People might perceive a much greater benefit to sharing things, outweighing the downside.Health data is a good example of something where there can be negative repercussions to sharing things, and so we have a lot of privacy laws around that. But some people may not feel that way, so you see things like Patients Like Me, [a website where patients can share their medical details and meet others who share their symptoms]. We all make those decisions at an individual level. But for the Internet of Things, I think it’s very important for us to think of it at a societal level.RELATED: Growing Old in New York’s Snarkiest, Early-Internet CommunityWaddell: To me, one of the biggest problems with the Internet of Things right now is that manufacturers are making poorly secured devices in their rush to connect every little thing they make to the internet. Is there any way to stop that from happening without turning to regulations and laws?Berman: I was talking to someone the other day about baby monitors, which can be both great and pretty scary. It’s great to be able to monitor your baby and make sure that they’re okay, and it’s really scary when people are shrieking at your baby over the internet because your baby monitor got hacked. That’s poor design.I think the gee-whiz aspects of the Internet of Things get a lot of attention: Oh, I can do this, and the system adapts to me in this way, and I never have to turn on the lights in my house again because my house is doing it for me.But I think it’s equally important to be thinking on the social side. We don’t want to, as you point out, rush to the final result, which is maybe legislation or policy, without a lot of experience and testing and thinking about what’s in the public good.Waddell: Are people getting distracted by that gee-whiz factor: the novelty of Alexa and internet-connected lights? Are we in the honeymoon stage right now?Berman: Right. Infrastructure is never newsworthy until it fails. To get people to think about and prioritize getting infrastructure right — and governance and ethics and policy and social-interest structure — is hard. Typically we’re interested in the results and the breakthroughs and the discoveries, or the really bad things that happen, like losing social-security numbers or getting hacked. It’s not newsworthy to say the water main is working, or the lights are still on.Waddell: The Mirai botnet and the attack on the internet probably did a lot to bring infrastructure into headlines. If people keep thinking about it, do you think some of these cultural shifts might come about a little earlier?Berman: This is something where your periodical and a lot of other important ones can really help, because you can bring it to people’s attention. We need more than just innovators and designers to think about it. We really need the stakeholders to think about it: policymakers, the private sector, leadership and C-suite people, the general public.Waddell: What’s one ethical guideline that Internet of Things manufacturers should be keeping in their sights when they are developing new products?Berman: Security is critical. For all of our technologies, security is the Achilles’ Heel. If we want it to be used for benefit, we have to think about security. And we have to think about privacy, too: What data is private and what isn’t, and are we engineering our systems so that they can support whatever privacy concerns we have?This story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com.More from The Atlantic: The Life-Changing Magic of Mushrooms, The Different Stakes of Male and Female Birth Control"
50,RELIGION,Stephen Fry Reportedly Faces Blasphemy Probe After Calling God A 'Maniac',Nina Golgowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-fry-faces-blasphemy-probe_us_590f1ad4e4b0e7021e984f5a,The English comedian and atheist  made the comments two years ago on an Irish TV program.,2017-05-07,"Actor Stephen Fry called God ""utterly evil"" and a ""maniac"" during an interview in 2015. He's now reportedly being investigated for blasphemy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590f299a1700001f005a532e.jpeg?cache=J2wkQ4W4mT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"English comedian Stephen Fry is reportedly under investigation for blasphemy after calling God “utterly evil” and a “maniac” during an interview with an Irish TV show two years ago.An unidentified member of the public told the Irish Independent they had reported the outspoken atheist’s comments to authorities in western Ireland because they were doing their “civic duty by reporting a crime,” not because they were personally offended.Individuals who publish or speak blasphemy can face a fine of up to €25,000 under the Republic of Ireland’s Defamation Act 2009, according to the BBC.Fry, who currently stars in CBS’s “The Great Indoors,” criticized God on TV channel RTE in 2015 after being asked what he’d say to “him, her or it” if given the chance.“I’ll say: Bone cancer in children, what’s that about? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault? It’s utterly, utterly evil,” he told Gay Byrne, host of program “The Meaning of Life.” “Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?”“The god who created this universe, if he created this universe, is quite clearly a maniac, an utter maniac, totally selfish,” Fry added. “We have to spend our lives on our knees thanking him. What kind of god would do that?”“Yes, the world is very splendid, but it also has in it insects whose whole life cycle is to burrow into the eyes of children and make them blind,” he said. The individual claiming responsibility for reporting Fry’s comments told the Independent that they traveled to the Ennis Garda station to file the report shortly after the interview aired. They’ve repeatedly followed up with police ever since.“I told the Garda I wanted to report Fry for uttering blasphemy and RTE for publishing/broadcasting it and that I believed these were criminal offenses under the Defamation Act 2009,” the person told the news site. “I simply believed that the comments made by Fry on RTE were criminal blasphemy and that I was doing my civic duty by reporting a crime.”Local authorities told the Independent that they are investigating the complaint but that charges are unlikely.Other atheists have since rallied behind Fry. Atheist Ireland, which has called the defamation law “silly, silencing, and dangerous,” responded to news of the investigation by publishing 25 other blasphemous quotes that they released after the Irish law first went into effect.The British Humanist Association also released a statement on Saturday defending Fry’s words and also calling for the dissolution of Ireland’s blasphemy law.“It is ridiculous that Stephen Fry is being investigated for a possible breach of Ireland’s blasphemy laws,” BHA Chief Executive Andrew Copson said. “Not only are such laws detrimental to free speech here in Europe, but they also enable countries like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran to justify their own laws, which in the case of 13 states come with a death sentence.”A spokesperson for Fry, reached by the Telegraph, declined comment, stating: “[There is] nothing for us to say while this is under investigation.”"

With most votes counted, Macron claimed 66.1 percent of the vote, outdoing expectations to deliver a decisive rebuttal to Le Pen’s claim that she is the voice of the French people.Polling in the weeks before the election consistently showed Macron holding around a 20-point lead over Le Pen, who struggled to quell opposition to her extreme policies amid fears that financial markets would crash if she were elected.Macron’s landslide victory exposes the limits of Le Pen’s populist appeal and proves that she remains too divisive to gain power, despite years of attempting to de-demonize the National Front Party. The result takes pressure off the European Union, which would have had to contend with a possible French referendum on leaving the trading bloc if Le Pen had been elected. But Macron’s sizable win is hardly a death knell for Le Pen and the National Front ― her nearly 35 percent of the vote is still an all-time high for the French far-right and would have been unthinkable not many years ago. If Macron fails to deliver on his promise of reforms and economic prosperity, it’s entirely possible that Le Pen may return in a better position next election.After the vote, Le Pen appeared aware that she would need to continue to shift perceptions of the National Front to further grow support. She said in her concession speech it was time to begin a “deep transformation” of the party in order to move it forward.“The National Front ... must deeply renew itself in order to rise to the historic opportunity and meet the French people’s expectations,” Le Pen told supporters. The vote culminates an unlikely and rapid rise to power for Macron. The former banker stepped down as the minister of economy and finance last year to start his En Marche!

Otherwise, the party will face the possibility of a diminished presidency and gridlocked government. Macron could potentially be forced into a situation known as “cohabitation,” in which he must appoint an opposition prime minister who would have the ability to stymie Macron’s attempts at reform.Macron has vowed to win an assembly majority, and he received more than 14,000 applications from supporters hoping to run as members of his party. Alternately, En Marche! could ally with another party to attain the numbers it needs to successfully implement his platform.Among Macron’s proposed reforms are streamlining elements of government bureaucracy, creating a joint finance minister for the EU and playing a greater role with Germany in leadership of the union.

The country has been struggling with a lackluster economy, political scandals and major terrorist attacks in recent years, which have contributed to citizens’ distrust of their government.There were a record number of abstentions and spoiled ballots in the vote, showing that many were not willing to vote for Macron even given the possibility that Le Pen could win.

53,POLITICS,Montana Democrat Attacks Opponent Over Disability Discrimination Lawsuit,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-quist-greg-gianforte-disability-lawsuit_us_590e5af2e4b0d5d9049cf76e,It has been a rough week for Republican Greg Gianforte.,2017-05-07,"Montana Democrat Rob Quist, seen here campaigning, is attacking GOP opponent Greg Gianforte over accusations of disability discrimination against a former employee.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590e5c501600001f00c59cee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The campaign of Rob Quist, the folk music star and Democrat running for Montana’s open House seat, opened up a new line of attack in an increasingly competitive special election by slamming his opponent, Republican Greg Gianforte, for allegedly discriminating against a disabled employee.Gianforte, a tech millionaire originally from New Jersey, settled a 1991 lawsuit with a former employee who accused Gianforte of firing him for having multiple sclerosis, Raw Story reported in late April. The details of the suit are harrowing. The former employee at Brightwork Development, Gianforte’s software company, won awards for his sales numbers after his diagnosis. Gianforte allegedly heard about the disease and summoned the employee to his office to ask probing questions about whether it was affecting his performance. The company reportedly fired the employee a couple of months later. Now the Quist campaign is citing the suit as more evidence that Gianforte is out of touch with state residents.“No real Montanan would fire someone after discovering they’re suffering from a health condition like multiple sclerosis,” Quist spokeswoman Tina Olechowski said in a statement. “Every day Montanans learn more about why New Jersey multimillionaire Greg Gianforte is not one of us and doesn’t share our values.”In his failed 2016 bid for Montana governor, Gianforte also faced questions about why Petra Academy, a private Christian school in Bozeman where he was once board chairman, does not abide by the same standard as public schools when it comes to accommodating all students with disabilities, regardless of how demanding their needs are. In a tense exchange about the topic in February 2016, Gianforte told the Billings Gazette editorial board that the school, which is not subject to the law requiring public schools to accommodate students with special needs, does not admit students who need an extra staff person devoted to them.One of the editorial board members interviewing Gianforte was incredulous, demanding to know why the school couldn’t afford to welcome all students when he had donated millions of dollars to the school. Gianforte claimed it was simply too costly. He said “it would be much easier for schools like Petra” to accommodate students with disabilities if Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock had not vetoed a bill creating a public fund for parents of special needs kids to use toward any school.Petra Academy’s headmaster, Craig Dunham, emphasized that Gianforte is no longer on the board and that the school does its best to accommodate students on a case-by-case basis. “We do our best to partner with parents as they request accommodations, so long as these accommodations do not result in disruption in the classroom, detract from the learning environment of other students, or compromise our academic standards, philosophy, or pedagogy,” Dunham said in an email to HuffPost. “If testing and/or minor accommodations can be implemented, the cost is the parents’ responsibility.”The Gianforte campaign did not respond to a request for clarification about the accusations in the 1991 lawsuit or the reasons for Petra Academy’s policy. The Quist campaign’s new critique caps off a tumultuous week for Gianforte. The candidate struggles to craft a consistent message on the Republican health care bill. Gianforte’s campaign has not said whether he would have voted for the bill that passed in the House of Representatives on Thursday.In a statement to The Washington Post on Friday, Gianforte spokesman Shane Scanlon reiterated the candidate’s claims that “he will not support a bill until he knows it reduces premiums, preserves rural access and protects Montanans with preexisting conditions.”But Gianforte praised the legislation during a private conference call with Republican-leaning lobbyists the same day, The New York Times reported. “The votes in the House are going to determine whether we get tax reform done, sounds like we just passed a health care thing, which I’m thankful for, sounds like we’re starting to repeal and replace,” Gianforte said.The Gianforte campaign explained the discrepancy to the Times by claiming that he was merely “thankful” that Obamacare repeal is underway, not for the specific law, since he has not read it.That didn’t stop Quist, whose own medical problems have been financially devastating, from pouncing on the comments.“After refusing to say how he would have voted on the disastrous D.C. health care bill, it turns out Greg Gianforte was saying something different to the special-interest lobbyists bankrolling his campaign,” Quist said Friday in a statement. “We need an independent voice in Congress who will stand up to the special interests, not a dishonest politician who says one thing to Montanans and another to the millionaires behind closed doors.”Democrats are eager to translate liberal anger at President Donald Trump into concrete electoral gains ― and special congressional elections are the first opportunity to do so at the national level.The party has invested the most resources into a contest for an open seat in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District, where 30-year-old filmmaker Jon Ossoff is locked in a tight runoff slated for June 20.Democratic officials have recently begun taking a greater interest in Quist, however, apparently concluding that his chances have improved. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee more than doubled its financial commitment to Quist earlier this week by injecting $400,000 into his campaign.Republicans are sounding alarms about the race as well. Vice President Mike Pence will soon be coming to Montana to campaign for Gianforte, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) told donors during a Thursday call obtained by the Washington Post.Daines and Gianforte also told donors that Gianforte’s lead over Quist is down to “single digits.” An April poll, by contrast, had Gianforte up by 15 percentage points.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who Quist backed in the 2016 primary, is set to hit the campaign trail for Quist in the coming weeks. But Quist turned down an offer of in-person assistance from Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez.The Montana House seat opened up when Trump named then-Rep. Ryan Zinke (R) as his secretary of the interior. Election Day is May 25.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that Greg Gianforte is still chairman of the Petra Academy board. The story has also been updated to include comments from Dunham about what the school does to accommodate students with disabilities."

With almost all votes counted, Macron claimed 66.1 percent of the vote, according to government tallies reported early Monday. Le Pen conceded shortly after initial tallies were released Sunday night.Macron celebrated his victory with a rally at the Louvre in Paris, where joyous supporters waved both European and French flags as they cheered their candidate. “A new page of our long history is turned ... one of refound hope and trust,” Macron said after the results came in. In her concession speech, Le Pen said that France had decided to vote for continuity rather than change and vowed that her National Front party would undergo an overhaul to prepare for the future.“The National Front ... must deeply renew itself in order to rise to the historic opportunity and meet the French people’s expectations,” she told supporters.Florian Philippot, the National Front’s vice president, said the party will change its name. Millions of people cast their ballots in towns and cities across the country on Sunday, but turnout was lower than previous elections. The Interior Ministry said about 12.5 percent of votes cast were either blank or spoiled and nearly 25 percent of voters abstained, indicating that many voters didn’t support either of the candidates. In a solemn address Sunday night, Macron recognized the deep divisions in the country. “I know the divisions in our nation, which have led some to vote for the extremes. I respect them,” Macron said. “I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that very many of you have also expressed. It’s my responsibility to hear them,” he continued. “I will work to recreate the link between Europe and its peoples, between Europe and citizens.”France’s election is a crucial moment for both the country and the European Union. Le Pen promised to pursue a French exit from the EU, a move that would likely lead to the collapse of the trading bloc. Macron ran on a pro-EU platform, promising to reform the union and bring back economic prosperity to France.Pro-EU politicians, including President of the European Council Donald Tusk, were quick to congratulate Macron on the win.“The French people have chosen hope over fear and unity over division,” tweeted London Mayor Sadiq Khan.The vote was seen as the biggest test yet of how much support there is for France’s far-right. Similar right-wing populist figures ― who vow to take power from a corrupt elite and return it to their narrowly defined version of “the people” ― have gained popularity across Europe. Many of these leaders, including Le Pen, have played on ethno-nationalist sentiment, declaring they would implement laws targeting immigrants and Muslims. The election has also seen a fracturing of France’s traditional party system. Either candidate will be the first president not to come from one of the country’s historically powerful establishment parties. France has been struggling with years of economic malaise, major terror attacks and questions of national identity ― all contributing to widespread antipathy toward the political establishment.The road to Sunday’s vote was one of the most unconventional in modern French political history. The ruling Socialist Party is in shambles after the deeply unpopular presidency of Francois Hollande, while Republican Party candidate François Fillon’s candidacy was crippled by scandal and corruption allegations. Fillon’s fall allowed the field to broaden and saw Macron, a former banker who launched his En Marche ! political party last year, become the front-runner. Macron took the election’s first round on April 23, with 24 percent of the vote to Le Pen’s 21.3 percent. Following close behind in the 11-candidate vote were Fillon at 20 percent and far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon at 19.6.The final weeks of the campaign saw Le Pen attempting to downplay or moderate some of her policies in order to appeal to a wider range of voters and quell fears that her election would send financial markets into chaos. She announced following the first vote that she was stepping down from leadership of her National Front Party ― a bid to temporarily distance herself from a political organization many in France associate with decades of anti-Semitism and racism under the leadership of Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie. Le Pen even wavered on her signature policy of holding a French referendum on EU membership after six months, saying a return to single currency could take longer if necessary. She floated the idea of a parallel French currency for daily purchases while keeping a common currency for major business deals, but provided no details on how that would work.Le Pen also went on the offensive in the lead up to the final vote, attempting to paint Macron as no different from Hollande and “complacent” about Islamic fundamentalism. “His program seems to be very vague, but in reality it is a simple continuation of Francois Hollande’s government,” Le Pen said.Macron, meanwhile, tried to remind voters of the extreme rhetoric, policies and history of Le Pen and the National Front. At a speech in Paris on Monday, he described his opponent as a “candidate of hate” and called on voters to join together to cast their votes against her. Macron also laid flowers at a memorial for a man who was killed by skinheads during a demonstration in 1995, highlighting the history of violence associated with far-right ideologies.During a heated televised debate on Wednesday, the two ridiculed each other’s plans for governing. Le Pen accused Macron of being a stooge of private interests and banks, while Macron claimed she was stirring up fear and spinning lies for political gain.Concern over foreign interference loomed over the race, as Macron’s party alleged it was the target of hacking attempts throughout the campaign. On Friday, the election saw another twist when a massive trove of hacked emails from Macron’s campaign leaked online. Party officials claimed that the documents also contained fake messages to spread “doubt and misinformation.”French media largely refrained from covering the emails, with major newspaper Le Monde publishing a statement saying the hack was a clear attempt to influence the validity of the vote. French law asserts a media blackout and ban on campaigning for the 44-hour period before the election.Macron derived his support in the first round from major cities, as well as areas with higher levels of education. But in the second he gained he also picked up voters who simply wanted to oppose a radical Le Pen presidency. Except for Mélenchon, all the top contenders for the presidency told their constituencies to back Macron. Macron will now be tasked with fixing France’s flagging economy and dealing with security fears resulting from years of terror attacks.But the most immediate concern for the next president will likely be seeking an assembly majority in the upcoming parliamentary elections in June. Without parliamentary support, Macron will have a very difficult time implementing the sprawling changes he has promised France.This article has been updated with details from Election Day."

The Interior Ministry said about 12.5 percent of votes cast were either blank or spoiled and nearly 25 percent of voters abstained, indicating that many voters didn’t support either of the candidates. In a solemn address Sunday night, Macron recognized the deep divisions in the country. “I know the divisions in our nation, which have led some to vote for the extremes. I respect them,” Macron said. “I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that very many of you have also expressed. It’s my responsibility to hear them,” he continued. “I will work to recreate the link between Europe and its peoples, between Europe and citizens.”France’s election is a crucial moment for both the country and the European Union. Le Pen promised to pursue a French exit from the EU, a move that would likely lead to the collapse of the trading bloc. Macron ran on a pro-EU platform, promising to reform the union and bring back economic prosperity to France.Pro-EU politicians, including President of the European Council Donald Tusk, were quick to congratulate Macron on the win.“The French people have chosen hope over fear and unity over division,” tweeted London Mayor Sadiq Khan.The vote was seen as the biggest test yet of how much support there is for France’s far-right. Similar right-wing populist figures ― who vow to take power from a corrupt elite and return it to their narrowly defined version of “the people” ― have gained popularity across Europe. Many of these leaders, including Le Pen, have played on ethno-nationalist sentiment, declaring they would implement laws targeting immigrants and Muslims. The election has also seen a fracturing of France’s traditional party system. Either candidate will be the first president not to come from one of the country’s historically powerful establishment parties. France has been struggling with years of economic malaise, major terror attacks and questions of national identity ― all contributing to widespread antipathy toward the political establishment.The road to Sunday’s vote was one of the most unconventional in modern French political history. The ruling Socialist Party is in shambles after the deeply unpopular presidency of Francois Hollande, while Republican Party candidate François Fillon’s candidacy was crippled by scandal and corruption allegations. Fillon’s fall allowed the field to broaden and saw Macron, a former banker who launched his En Marche ! political party last year, become the front-runner. Macron took the election’s first round on April 23, with 24 percent of the vote to Le Pen’s 21.3 percent. Following close behind in the 11-candidate vote were Fillon at 20 percent and far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon at 19.6.The final weeks of the campaign saw Le Pen attempting to downplay or moderate some of her policies in order to appeal to a wider range of voters and quell fears that her election would send financial markets into chaos. She announced following the first vote that she was stepping down from leadership of her National Front Party ― a bid to temporarily distance herself from a political organization many in France associate with decades of anti-Semitism and racism under the leadership of Le Pen’s father, Jean-Marie. Le Pen even wavered on her signature policy of holding a French referendum on EU membership after six months, saying a return to single currency could take longer if necessary. She floated the idea of a parallel French currency for daily purchases while keeping a common currency for major business deals, but provided no details on how that would work.Le Pen also went on the offensive in the lead up to the final vote, attempting to paint Macron as no different from Hollande and “complacent” about Islamic fundamentalism. “His program seems to be very vague, but in reality it is a simple continuation of Francois Hollande’s government,” Le Pen said.Macron, meanwhile, tried to remind voters of the extreme rhetoric, policies and history of Le Pen and the National Front. At a speech in Paris on Monday, he described his opponent as a “candidate of hate” and called on voters to join together to cast their votes against her. Macron also laid flowers at a memorial for a man who was killed by skinheads during a demonstration in 1995, highlighting the history of violence associated with far-right ideologies.During a heated televised debate on Wednesday, the two ridiculed each other’s plans for governing. Le Pen accused Macron of being a stooge of private interests and banks, while Macron claimed she was stirring up fear and spinning lies for political gain.Concern over foreign interference loomed over the race, as Macron’s party alleged it was the target of hacking attempts throughout the campaign. On Friday, the election saw another twist when a massive trove of hacked emails from Macron’s campaign leaked online. Party officials claimed that the documents also contained fake messages to spread “doubt and misinformation.”French media largely refrained from covering the emails, with major newspaper Le Monde publishing a statement saying the hack was a clear attempt to influence the validity of the vote. French law asserts a media blackout and ban on campaigning for the 44-hour period before the election.Macron derived his support in the first round from major cities, as well as areas with higher levels of education. But in the second he gained he also picked up voters who simply wanted to oppose a radical Le Pen presidency. Except for Mélenchon, all the top contenders for the presidency told their constituencies to back Macron. Macron will now be tasked with fixing France’s flagging economy and dealing with security fears resulting from years of terror attacks.But the most immediate concern for the next president will likely be seeking an assembly majority in the upcoming parliamentary elections in June. Without parliamentary support, Macron will have a very difficult time implementing the sprawling changes he has promised France.This article has been updated with details from Election Day."

My, my. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590f2544140000e816f8ba08.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A couple of weeks ago I was on a group telephone call with People Power (peoplepower.org). They are an offshoot of the ACLU, which reportedly has been overwhelmed not only by donations but volunteers. I am thinking that they went from not knowing what to do with all these newly-energized people to realizing that managing us was going to require some added full-time staffers. People Power is described as a grassroots mobilization platform, and the ACLU has hired a bunch of experienced digital coordinators to get us organized.I was able to pick a time and day best for me among several of these scheduled calls. There were three-hundred people on my call, and it was a well-structured exercise, introducing our presenters Jasmin and Sam (wisely no last names, probably to protect from trolls), acquainting us with a few of the other participants, describing what People Power would do (be ready for anything that compromises Civil Liberties at a location near you), and taking several questions at the end from people who pressed 1 on their phones.The process was capably handled but still felt as though the ACLU had rushed into action before quite having its game plan or trained players in place. A question about phone calls like these also being organized for Spanish speakers drew a blank from our presenters. It was disappointing and I had to wonder if they’d been fully briefed because the ACLU as an organization is highly professional and generally not sloppy. Still, a firm answer in the positive would have been reassuring.The participants were impressive, but at least those selected for questions were definitely older. Some spoke of this as their first political action since the Vietnam War, others stated clearly that they were retired. They were generally articulate and had thought a great deal about the information they were seeking out. One man, in particular, wanted to know how People Power was going to network with other organizations, like MoveOn. Sam pointed out that the ACLU does not favor any particular party and that the caller might want to coordinate his own links with other groups.Meanwhile, People Power put together a nationwide “resistance training” event in Miami on March 11th, which was streamed to other locations at events organized by local hosts. Participation in the phone call gave us the opportunity to help with this by volunteering to be hosts, texting people about what is going on, recruiting people to attend, and other options.This was actually an important point. Problematic as it may feel at this moment, the ACLU really does steer clear of specific political affiliations, even as most of their initiatives are currently on issues to the Left. When American neo-Nazi groups start marching again, as they might feel emboldened to do under this administration, the ACLU may find itself defending their right to do so, as they did with the infamous National Socialist Party of America march in Skokie, Illinois in 1978.So, if you are a purist on civil liberties (I was not in 1978 and quit the ACLU for a few years in revulsion), People Power is the group for you. Expect to support your local mosque, protest the deportation of immigrants, defend Planned Parenthood, that sort of thing. They may not be anti-Republican, but they are declaratively opposed to all Trump administration policies and actions that threaten our civil liberties.This blog was previous published on www.SanityPapers.com, May 6, 2017.

He had no criminal record. He was unarmed. He posed no threat to the officer. The facts were straightforward enough that Dallas County District Attorney, Faith Johnson, wasted no time in filing murder charges against Oliver. But as always, in the rare times that a DA charges a cop in the killing of an unarmed civilian, a charge is just the start of what has often been a long train of frustration, muddle, and, more often than not, bitter disappointment in the prosecution of cops who wantonly kill civilians.The two starting points are the defense attorneys hired to defend the officers charged. Police unions quickly step in and retain top gun defense attorneys with lots of experience defending police officers accused of misconduct. Police unions bankroll their defense and spare no expense. Cops rarely serve any pre-trial jail time, and are released on ridiculously low bail. That was the case with Oliver. He posted bail and was almost immediately released.Their attorneys then play for time, time, time. They know that it’s on their side. To buy time, they employ an endless storehouse of legal tact’s, ploys, and dodges to delay the start of a trial.The time factor is crucial because memories dim, passions cool, and anger dissipates in police killings. Put simply, other than the victim’s families, the public moves on. The slayings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, and Terence Crutcher are near textbook examples of how cases are dragged out. The men were slain months ago. The officers involved in the Castile and Crutcher slayings were charged. In the Sterling slaying, there have been no state charges yet. The Justice Department declined to prosecute. These cases virtually disappeared from the public radar scope, with the passage of time. But defense attorneys do more than toss out motion after motion to get the charges against the officers dismissed, get a change of venue, or get a bench trial. They also massage and craft the public image of the officers as dedicated, hard-working public servants unjustly victimized by vindictive prosecutors. Johnson had barely filed the murder charge against Oliver when it started. He was an Iraq veteran. He served honorably. He suffered from PTSD. Conveniently omitted from the sympathy narrative was the obvious question, if he had a known disorder that could impair judgement why was he on the police force in the first place?This is just one part of the public and media charm campaign. The other is to dredge up any arrest or criminal record they can find on the victim, smear him in the media, and bank that it taps hard into the old, and reliable crime and violent prone stereotype and negative typecast of young black males. The message is loud and clear. The victims aren’t altar boys, but bad guys who must bear culpability for their deaths.The negative perceptions of blacks, especially black males, by much of the public are not the only problem in effecting effective legal measures against police violence. There is no ironclad standard of what is or isn’t an acceptable use of force in police misconduct cases. It often comes down to a judgment call by the officer. In the Rodney King beating case in 1992 in which four LAPD officers stood trial, defense attorneys painted King as the aggressor and claimed that the level of force used against him was justified.This pattern has been evident in many celebrated cases since then. It’s made even easier to sell the notion that somehow the victims bare culpability for their deaths by dragging in their past. Police then claim that they feared for their lives in confronting them and they use deadly force solely in self-defense. If brought to trial, judges and juries routinely buy this line and acquit.If the cops are tried by a jury, police defense attorneys seek to get as many middle-class people, whites, and even blacks and Latinos, on the jury as possible. The presumption is that they are much more likely to believe the testimony of police and prosecution witnesses than black witnesses, defendants, or even the victims.The code of silence is another powerful obstacle to convicting bad cops. Officers hide behind it and refuse to testify against other officers, or tailor their testimony to put the officer’s action in the best possible light.Then there are the judges. Studies on judicial bias, both overt and implicit, have found the bench anything but impartial. Judges make decisions on bail, pretrial motions, evidentiary issues, witness credibility, and jury selection, and instructions to the jury.In the case of police officers who appear in court, they face judges who in many cases they have faced often as police officers testifying in criminal cases, they are known quantities. They also have a phalanx of family members and police supporters standing solidly with them in court. They are anything but the average run of the mill common criminal, and judges are well aware of that.Johnson will have a tough, uphill fight on her hands to convict Oliver, no matter how seemingly compelling the evidence. And that’s exactly why cops repeatedly walk free. Will Oliver be any different?Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

For,2017-05-07,"<p>Caffeine is a wonderful drug, but it comes at a price. Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you how to strike the right balance with your caffeine consumption.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5900e624260000bf9ac47dc6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Today's tip for improving your performance is one of the most simple and straightforward methods I’ve provided thus far. For many people, this tip has the potential to have a bigger impact than any other single action. The catch? You have to cut down on caffeine, and as any caffeine drinker can attest, this is easier said than done.For those who aren't aware, the ability to manage your emotions and remain calm under pressure has a direct link to your performance. TalentSmart has conducted research with more than a million people, and we’ve found that 90% of top performers are high in emotional intelligence. These individuals are skilled at managing their emotions (even in times of high stress) in order to remain calm and in control.The Good: Isn’t Really GoodMost people start drinking caffeine because it makes them feel more alert and improves their mood. Many studies suggest that caffeine actually improves cognitive task performance (memory, attention span, etc.) in the short-term. Unfortunately, these studies fail to consider the participants’ caffeine habits. New research from Johns Hopkins Medical School shows that performance increases due to caffeine intake are the result of caffeine drinkers experiencing a short-term reversal of caffeine withdrawal. By controlling for caffeine use in study participants, John Hopkins researchers found that caffeine-related performance improvement is nonexistent without caffeine withdrawal. In essence, coming off caffeine reduces your cognitive performance and has a negative impact on your mood. The only way to get back to normal is to drink caffeine, and when you do drink it, you feel like it’s taking you to new heights. In reality, the caffeine is just taking your performance back to normal for a short period.The Bad: AdrenalineDrinking caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline is the source of the “fight or flight” response, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt email. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state, your emotions overrun your behavior.Irritability and anxiety are the most commonly seen emotional effects of caffeine, but caffeine enables all of your emotions to take charge.The negative effects of a caffeine-generated adrenaline surge are not just behavioral. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that large doses of caffeine raise blood pressure, stimulate the heart, and produce rapid shallow breathing, which readers of Emotional Intelligence 2.0 know deprives the brain of the oxygen needed to keep your thinking calm and rational.The Ugly: SleepYour self-control, focus, memory, and information processing speed are all reduced when you don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. Your brain is very fickle when it comes to sleep. For you to wake up feeling rested, your brain needs to move through an elaborate series of cycles. You can help this process along and improve the quality of your sleep by reducing your caffeine intake.Here’s why you’ll want to: caffeine has a six-hour half-life, which means it takes a full twenty-four hours to work its way out of your system. Have a cup of joe at eight a.m., and you’ll still have 25% of the caffeine in your body at eight p.m. Anything you drink after noon will still be at 50% strength at bedtime. Any caffeine in your bloodstream—with the negative effects increasing with the dose—makes it harder to fall asleep.When you do finally fall asleep, the worst is yet to come. Caffeine disrupts the quality of your sleep by reducing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the deep sleep when your body recuperates. When caffeine disrupts your sleep, you wake up tired the next day. You’re naturally going to be inclined to grab a cup of coffee or an energy drink to try to make yourself feel better. The caffeine produces surges of adrenaline, which further your emotional handicap. Caffeine withdrawal and lack of sleep leave you feeling tired in the afternoon, so you drink more caffeine, which leaves even more of it in your bloodstream at bedtime. Caffeine very quickly creates a vicious cycle.WithdrawalLike any stimulant, caffeine is physiologically and psychologically addictive. If you do choose to lower your caffeine intake, you should do so slowly under the guidance of a qualified medical professional. The researchers at Johns Hopkins found that caffeine withdrawal causes headache, fatigue, sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating. Some people report feeling flu-like symptoms, depression, and anxiety after reducing intake by as little as one cup a day. Slowly tapering your caffeine dosage each day can greatly reduce these withdrawal symptoms.Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."

Parents are flawed because they’re human. With a few tragic exceptions, parents don’t set out to harm their children; they love them and they do their best to raise them well. This isn’t really up for debate, and we (parents) know this. We know we will never be perfect parents.I’ve spent the last 20 years trying to understand my childhood and forgive my parents for their imperfections. Like a lot of Gen-Xers, I’ve sought assistance from a professional therapist from time to time to help me sort through my past, understand the source of my unhealthier motivations and impulses, and ultimately make peace with my parents’ shortcomings.At the age of 40, I am far from finished, but I’ve come a long way and the process has been constructive and healing. My interpretation of my own history and the role my parents played in it is dynamic and ever-changing with each revision slightly more gentle and gracious than the last. My parents made some mistakes, as all parents do, but I’ve come to appreciate those mistakes as inoculations; low doses of disease that have bolstered my resilience and made me stronger. Some of my greatest strengths as an adult have been born from my parents’ imperfections, essentially redeeming and absolving them.Despite knowing that no parent is ever perfect, despite my increasingly softened view of my own mom’s and dad’s limitations as parents, and despite the fact that I’ve experienced firsthand that those same limitations shaped me in powerful and important ways that have ultimately served me well as an adult, I am still secretly hoping that, if I try hard enough, I can be a perfect parent.At first glance, this doesn’t appear to be such a bad thing; arrogant, maybe, but not bad. It’s certainly better than the alternative. Like most parents, I want to maximize my kids’ chances for a healthy, happy life. But I’m beginning to suspect that my desire to be a perfect parent might be ― ironically ― the biggest threat to my kids’ happiness because at the heart of my compulsion to be perfect is fear; fear of failure and fear that my mistakes will be unforgivable and unredeemable.I already see the influence of my fear in my kids’ lives. This morning, just as we were getting into the car to drive to school, my 5-year-old son burst into an anxious fit of tears when he realized he had forgotten to do his homework. I intentionally turned away from my fear-based impulses and told my son calmly that while I understood he was afraid he’d be in trouble with his teacher, everything was going to be okay, but he was not pacified. I briefly considered letting him learn a lesson about being a responsible student, but since he’s never forgotten to do his homework before, I decided we could be a few minutes late to school so that he could complete his homework. (To be clear, by “late” I mean on the late side of early because part of being a perfect parent means leaving extra time in the mornings for “emergencies” and still getting your kids to school on time.)Less than 10 minutes later my 8-year-old daughter dissolved into tears of frustration when the fistful of roses she’d cut from our garden for her teacher started falling apart in her hand. One by one, the flowers crumbled and fell, scattering their fragile petals like confetti on the car floor. She finally gave up, tossed the few surviving blossoms aside dejectedly, and left the car with her head down, trying to hide her tears.My son’s fears were assuaged only when he was allowed to correct his mistake and complete his forgotten homework. My daughter’s distress was abated when I returned to school, fifteen minutes after dropping her off, with a fresh bouquet of roses for her to give to her teacher. (She also seemed genuinely moved by the gesture.)If this were not my story, but another parent’s story, I would hold it up as a good example of helicopter parenting from an overly accommodating, enabling mother. But my more typical, fear-based reaction to my son’s forgotten homework assignment and my daughter’s attitude about the roses would have looked very different. I may have allowed my son to complete his homework, but I wouldn’t have been calm about it. In my daughter’s case, the only reason she cut the flowers in the first place was because she had procrastinated making her teacher a card for Teacher Appreciation week. Together, my children would have had to endure my heavy sighs, stern looks of disapproval, and most likely a lecture on work habits and time-management while en route to school. And they would have been getting off easy.My oldest son, who is eleven, shows similar signs he’s been influenced by my fear of failure. He is a straight-A student, an accomplished young athlete, and a loyal, selfless friend. He is a perfectionistic parent’s dream, but it costs him to be so. I realized just how high a price he is wiling to pay to avoid failing during a family ski vacation this past winter.Although a new and inexperienced skier, my son’s confidence was growing, as was his appetite for more challenging terrain. On this particular day, we’d spent most of the morning on easy, groomed runs well-suited for the younger children in our group and he was becoming restless. We stole away, just the two of us, and I lead him down a short, but imposing black diamond, heavily pock-marked by moguls. It was the kind of run that made me fall in love with skiing 30 years ago as a kid growing up in Colorado. Since it’s still the kind of run I love - and since I’m now a middle-aged a-hole having a hard time letting go of my youth - I handed my phone to my son and asked him to go ahead of me and shoot a video of me skiing once he reached the bottom of the hill.We had already skied the run once and he had managed the moguls well that time, so I didn’t think much of sending him down the slope alone, 100 yards ahead of me, the second time around. I watched him traverse the mountain cautiously, but determinedly. Then, he fell. I called out to him, but he didn’t seem to hear me. He had lost his ski when he fell and appeared to be struggling to put it back on. Just about the time I decided to go help him ― pop! ― he got his ski back on and continued down the mountain. “Nice job,” I thought to myself, feeling proud of him. He took two turns, fell again, and lost his ski for the second time. Once again, I called out to him, but he didn’t seem to hear me. Before long, as before, he got his ski back on and he skied to the bottom of the hill, pulling my phone out of his pocket to take a video just like we’d planned.I descended the mountain, concentrating on my form and hoping I looked good for the video. But when I reached the bottom, I saw that my son’s face was contorted with emotion and covered with blood. He wasn’t badly hurt, but he’d fallen hard enough on his face to cause his nose to bleed and his upper lip to swell. My heart sank. Why didn’t he call for me? Why hadn’t he waved me down and called for help? When I asked him he said, “I wanted to get the video. I wanted to do a good job.”These stories are deeply humbling because they raise the possibility that my tendency to strive for perfection and, therefore, fear failure is harming my kids. That’s a bitter, jagged pill to swallow.It’s possible my 5-year-old son has internalized my fears. He may have cried over his forgotten homework assignment because he’s afraid if he fails as a student, it means he’s a failure as a person. It’s possible my daughter believes that it’s better to show up to school empty-handed than it is to bring her teacher a fistful of fallen petals; that sincere effort and good intentions are worthless if the result is anything less than stellar. It’s possible that my oldest son fears I won’t love him unless he takes a video of my old ass skiing down a relatively unimpressive mountain. If I love my kids and want them to become healthy, happy adults (and I do), I have to face these possibilities with an open heart and a willingness to change.With that said it’s also possible that my kids are driven from within. Not to allow for this possibility would be to give my ego more credit that it deserves. Whether I like it or not, I am not all-powerful and my kids are being influenced by a hundred other forces just as powerful, if not more powerful, as mine. My need to appease my inner critic may have been amplified and contorted by my parents’ mistakes, but I am a born perfectionist. For me to try to be any other way would be a denial and a violation of my true nature. Similarly, although my husband isn’t a perfectionist, he has high standards for himself and for our kids. Add to this the fact that my kids are white, Catholic, and live in an affluent suburb populated by high-achievers, and you have the ideal environment for breeding children who are genetically, culturally, and socially predisposed to exhibit anal-retentive, perfectionistic behavior and an unrealistic aversion to failure.Regardless of whether my kids were born believing or taught to believe the lie that perfection is achievable and anything less than perfect is unlovable, there is still hope that my kids can become healthy, happy adults because I am free and empowered to make choices about how I parent. I can choose to give in to my anxiety and teach my kids to fear failure or I can teach them that it’s okay to fall short and be a safe place to land when they do. I can stop judging myself so harshly and show them that my love unconditional and not doled out in direct proportion to their performance by extending the same grace to myself. This is really good news.The even better news is that I can redefine failure for my children altogether. Recently, I left the corporate world after 18 years of success for a more entrepreneurial venture in which I am constantly failing. My failures - and how I respond to them - are on display and occurring in real time before my children’s very eyes. They have a front row seat to witness my shocking revelation that the world does not come to an end because I fail at something. They love me just as much as they did when I was outwardly successful. My friends still like me and want to spend time with me. My value as a person has remained exactly the same as it was when I was having more success because, as it turns out, failure isn’t just relative and subjective; at the end of the day, failure just isn’t that big of a deal. In fact, failure is bona fide evidence that I’m taking risks, acquiring new skills, and learning valuable lessons. Failure is an inevitable consequence of living fearlessly.Maybe this view is self-preserving, but I’m hopeful that at least some of it is the genuine and true wisdom that comes from firsthand experience with failure. There is a lot of freedom to be gained from accepting that I will never be a perfect parent. This is a gift I can give to myself. But it’s also a gift I can and want to give to my kids.Forgiving my parents for their mistakes has been hard, time-consuming, and expensive work, but it’s improved my life and, hopefully, my kids’ will benefit from my work. My children may grow up to resent my mistakes, but I hope they will forgive me, even if it require them to do the same hard, time-consuming, and expensive work I’ve had to do. If my mistakes can inoculate my kids and make them stronger, if my flaws can shape them in powerful and important ways that serve them well as adults, then there is hope that my shortcomings can be redeemed and absolved in my children the way my parents’ mistakes are being redeemed and absolved in me, and that will be a deeper, truer, and more joyful outcome than perfection could ever be."

Parents are flawed because they’re human. With a few tragic exceptions, parents don’t set out to harm their children; they love them and they do their best to raise them well. This isn’t really up for debate, and we (parents) know this. We know we will never be perfect parents.I’ve spent the last 20 years trying to understand my childhood and forgive my parents for their imperfections. Like a lot of Gen-Xers, I’ve sought assistance from a professional therapist from time to time to help me sort through my past, understand the source of my unhealthier motivations and impulses, and ultimately make peace with my parents’ shortcomings.At the age of 40, I am far from finished, but I’ve come a long way and the process has been constructive and healing. My interpretation of my own history and the role my parents played in it is dynamic and ever-changing with each revision slightly more gentle and gracious than the last. My parents made some mistakes, as all parents do, but I’ve come to appreciate those mistakes as inoculations; low doses of disease that have bolstered my resilience and made me stronger. Some of my greatest strengths as an adult have been born from my parents’ imperfections, essentially redeeming and absolving them.Despite knowing that no parent is ever perfect, despite my increasingly softened view of my own mom’s and dad’s limitations as parents, and despite the fact that I’ve experienced firsthand that those same limitations shaped me in powerful and important ways that have ultimately served me well as an adult, I am still secretly hoping that, if I try hard enough, I can be a perfect parent.At first glance, this doesn’t appear to be such a bad thing; arrogant, maybe, but not bad. It’s certainly better than the alternative. Like most parents, I want to maximize my kids’ chances for a healthy, happy life. But I’m beginning to suspect that my desire to be a perfect parent might be ― ironically ― the biggest threat to my kids’ happiness because at the heart of my compulsion to be perfect is fear; fear of failure and fear that my mistakes will be unforgivable and unredeemable.I already see the influence of my fear in my kids’ lives. This morning, just as we were getting into the car to drive to school, my 5-year-old son burst into an anxious fit of tears when he realized he had forgotten to do his homework. I intentionally turned away from my fear-based impulses and told my son calmly that while I understood he was afraid he’d be in trouble with his teacher, everything was going to be okay, but he was not pacified. I briefly considered letting him learn a lesson about being a responsible student, but since he’s never forgotten to do his homework before, I decided we could be a few minutes late to school so that he could complete his homework. (To be clear, by “late” I mean on the late side of early because part of being a perfect parent means leaving extra time in the mornings for “emergencies” and still getting your kids to school on time.)Less than 10 minutes later my 8-year-old daughter dissolved into tears of frustration when the fistful of roses she’d cut from our garden for her teacher started falling apart in her hand. One by one, the flowers crumbled and fell, scattering their fragile petals like confetti on the car floor. She finally gave up, tossed the few surviving blossoms aside dejectedly, and left the car with her head down, trying to hide her tears.My son’s fears were assuaged only when he was allowed to correct his mistake and complete his forgotten homework. My daughter’s distress was abated when I returned to school, fifteen minutes after dropping her off, with a fresh bouquet of roses for her to give to her teacher. (She also seemed genuinely moved by the gesture.)If this were not my story, but another parent’s story, I would hold it up as a good example of helicopter parenting from an overly accommodating, enabling mother. But my more typical, fear-based reaction to my son’s forgotten homework assignment and my daughter’s attitude about the roses would have looked very different. I may have allowed my son to complete his homework, but I wouldn’t have been calm about it. In my daughter’s case, the only reason she cut the flowers in the first place was because she had procrastinated making her teacher a card for Teacher Appreciation week. Together, my children would have had to endure my heavy sighs, stern looks of disapproval, and most likely a lecture on work habits and time-management while en route to school. And they would have been getting off easy.My oldest son, who is eleven, shows similar signs he’s been influenced by my fear of failure. He is a straight-A student, an accomplished young athlete, and a loyal, selfless friend. He is a perfectionistic parent’s dream, but it costs him to be so. I realized just how high a price he is wiling to pay to avoid failing during a family ski vacation this past winter.Although a new and inexperienced skier, my son’s confidence was growing, as was his appetite for more challenging terrain. On this particular day, we’d spent most of the morning on easy, groomed runs well-suited for the younger children in our group and he was becoming restless. We stole away, just the two of us, and I lead him down a short, but imposing black diamond, heavily pock-marked by moguls. It was the kind of run that made me fall in love with skiing 30 years ago as a kid growing up in Colorado. Since it’s still the kind of run I love - and since I’m now a middle-aged a-hole having a hard time letting go of my youth - I handed my phone to my son and asked him to go ahead of me and shoot a video of me skiing once he reached the bottom of the hill.We had already skied the run once and he had managed the moguls well that time, so I didn’t think much of sending him down the slope alone, 100 yards ahead of me, the second time around. I watched him traverse the mountain cautiously, but determinedly. Then, he fell. I called out to him, but he didn’t seem to hear me. He had lost his ski when he fell and appeared to be struggling to put it back on. Just about the time I decided to go help him ― pop! ― he got his ski back on and continued down the mountain. “Nice job,” I thought to myself, feeling proud of him. He took two turns, fell again, and lost his ski for the second time. Once again, I called out to him, but he didn’t seem to hear me. Before long, as before, he got his ski back on and he skied to the bottom of the hill, pulling my phone out of his pocket to take a video just like we’d planned.I descended the mountain, concentrating on my form and hoping I looked good for the video. But when I reached the bottom, I saw that my son’s face was contorted with emotion and covered with blood. He wasn’t badly hurt, but he’d fallen hard enough on his face to cause his nose to bleed and his upper lip to swell. My heart sank. Why didn’t he call for me? Why hadn’t he waved me down and called for help? When I asked him he said, “I wanted to get the video. I wanted to do a good job.”These stories are deeply humbling because they raise the possibility that my tendency to strive for perfection and, therefore, fear failure is harming my kids. That’s a bitter, jagged pill to swallow.It’s possible my 5-year-old son has internalized my fears. He may have cried over his forgotten homework assignment because he’s afraid if he fails as a student, it means he’s a failure as a person. It’s possible my daughter believes that it’s better to show up to school empty-handed than it is to bring her teacher a fistful of fallen petals; that sincere effort and good intentions are worthless if the result is anything less than stellar. It’s possible that my oldest son fears I won’t love him unless he takes a video of my old ass skiing down a relatively unimpressive mountain. If I love my kids and want them to become healthy, happy adults (and I do), I have to face these possibilities with an open heart and a willingness to change.With that said it’s also possible that my kids are driven from within. Not to allow for this possibility would be to give my ego more credit that it deserves. Whether I like it or not, I am not all-powerful and my kids are being influenced by a hundred other forces just as powerful, if not more powerful, as mine. My need to appease my inner critic may have been amplified and contorted by my parents’ mistakes, but I am a born perfectionist. For me to try to be any other way would be a denial and a violation of my true nature. Similarly, although my husband isn’t a perfectionist, he has high standards for himself and for our kids. Add to this the fact that my kids are white, Catholic, and live in an affluent suburb populated by high-achievers, and you have the ideal environment for breeding children who are genetically, culturally, and socially predisposed to exhibit anal-retentive, perfectionistic behavior and an unrealistic aversion to failure.Regardless of whether my kids were born believing or taught to believe the lie that perfection is achievable and anything less than perfect is unlovable, there is still hope that my kids can become healthy, happy adults because I am free and empowered to make choices about how I parent. I can choose to give in to my anxiety and teach my kids to fear failure or I can teach them that it’s okay to fall short and be a safe place to land when they do. I can stop judging myself so harshly and show them that my love unconditional and not doled out in direct proportion to their performance by extending the same grace to myself. This is really good news.The even better news is that I can redefine failure for my children altogether. Recently, I left the corporate world after 18 years of success for a more entrepreneurial venture in which I am constantly failing. My failures - and how I respond to them - are on display and occurring in real time before my children’s very eyes. They have a front row seat to witness my shocking revelation that the world does not come to an end because I fail at something. They love me just as much as they did when I was outwardly successful. My friends still like me and want to spend time with me. My value as a person has remained exactly the same as it was when I was having more success because, as it turns out, failure isn’t just relative and subjective; at the end of the day, failure just isn’t that big of a deal. In fact, failure is bona fide evidence that I’m taking risks, acquiring new skills, and learning valuable lessons. Failure is an inevitable consequence of living fearlessly.Maybe this view is self-preserving, but I’m hopeful that at least some of it is the genuine and true wisdom that comes from firsthand experience with failure. There is a lot of freedom to be gained from accepting that I will never be a perfect parent. This is a gift I can give to myself. But it’s also a gift I can and want to give to my kids.Forgiving my parents for their mistakes has been hard, time-consuming, and expensive work, but it’s improved my life and, hopefully, my kids’ will benefit from my work. My children may grow up to resent my mistakes, but I hope they will forgive me, even if it require them to do the same hard, time-consuming, and expensive work I’ve had to do. If my mistakes can inoculate my kids and make them stronger, if my flaws can shape them in powerful and important ways that serve them well as adults, then there is hope that my shortcomings can be redeemed and absolved in my children the way my parents’ mistakes are being redeemed and absolved in me, and that will be a deeper, truer, and more joyful outcome than perfection could ever be."
61,POLITICS,"A Health Care Bill By Trump, For Trump","Rep. Terri Sewell, ContributorRep. Terri A. Sewell (D-AL) is serving her fourth term represe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-healthcare-bill-by-trump-for-trump_us_590f858de4b0f711807245e6,"For America’s women, our rural communities, and low-income families, we have to do better.",2017-05-07,President Trump and Members of Congress celebrate passage of health care repeal in the House of Representatives,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590f89441400000b17f8baa9.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Photos from the White House party celebrating passage of the health care repeal bill in the House paint a clear picture of what support for this legislation looks like. Mainly, it comes from wealthy men inside the Washington beltway who are deeply insulated from the realities faced by the majority of Americans.The reason the repeal bill is widely disliked among women, rural Americans, and anyone who doesn’t spend more time golfing than working is fairly straight forward: It will make health care cost more for less coverage and fewer protections. The reason for its support among wealthy Americans can be summed up just as easily: All of the savings go to high-earning individuals and insurance executives.The GOP health care repeal doesn’t just dismantle health care for millions of Americans, it actively targets programs and protections that the men attending this past Thursday’s TrumpCare celebration will likely never have to rely on.For women, the impact of TrumpCare will be disastrous. Take for example the fact that under TrumpCare, pregnancy can be labeled as a “pre-existing condition” that allows insurance companies to spike your premiums. While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibited insurance groups from raising rates on women in need of maternity and childbirth care, the repeal bill allows states to opt-out of those protections. The new bill gives insurance companies the go-ahead to price women out of health care coverage when they need it most.But pregnancy is only one of the pre-existing conditions that insurance companies may use under TrumpCare to charge women more. Lupus, depression, eating disorders, and other conditions that affect more women than men are also on the list.To make things worse, the GOP health care repeal eliminates essential benefits requirements, allowing insurance companies to provide plans that fail to cover health care options women need. Under the ACA, insurance companies were required to cover essential services like maternity care, mammograms, and pediatric services. But if TrumpCare is signed into law, plans may drop coverage for these critical services, in addition to those as necessary as hospitalization, pediatric care, and prescription drugs.Based on TrumpCare’s complete failure to address women’s health needs, it should not come as a surprise that only 13 percent of women support the proposed health care repeal.For rural Americans, TrumpCare will mean more hospital closures and the loss of local health services. Already, our rural areas face a health crisis due to the increasing cost of uncompensated care for low-income, rural Americans. In Alabama, the crisis has had visible impact on communities statewide, with ten hospitals closing over the past six years. As a matter of fact, almost 80 percent of rural hospital closures since 2010 have happened in states that didn’t expand Medicaid under the ACA.I believe our current health care debate is a chance to address the shrinking availability of rural care, but TrumpCare squanders that opportunity and does just the opposite. In fact, estimates suggest that the Republican repeal legislation would increase the cost of uncompensated care for Alabama hospitals by a whopping $97 million dollars. That could force the remaining rural hospitals in my state to close their doors for good.Take it from Will Ferniany, CEO of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) health system, which runs the largest hospital in my state. “The AHCA will hurt Alabama hospitals,” Ferniany wrote about the GOP health care repeal. “Bad debt will increase from more uninsured, and future Medicaid funding will be reduced.”Numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation tell a similar story. According to their analysis, my constituents in Jefferson County will face premiums more than $1,400 higher on average than they did under the ACA. In the end, these high costs will translate into more uninsured Alabamians and more uncompensated care for Alabama’s health providers.In exchange for eliminating and rationing care for women, rural Americans, and families in need, the GOP health care repeal bill funds a massive tax cut for the wealthiest households. The bill eliminates a Medicaid surtax on income above $200,000 per year, a threshold which less than one percent of my constituents meet. The legislation also immediately repeals a 3.8 percent investment income tax, which generally applies to the highest income households in the country.In my congressional district, the median income for a family of four is $34,000, a demographic that won’t see any relief under TrumpCare. Instead, Republicans have crafted legislation that benefits people like President Trump and his friends.As a woman and as an African American born and raised in rural Alabama, I know first-hand the challenges my constituents face in the health care market. I know that their wellbeing and their access to health care isn’t a cost we can decide to cut, but a right that we have an obligation to protect.No one deserves to pay more for health because of their gender or because of where they live. No family should have to decide whether pediatric care or maternity care is in the budget. I have always said that the Affordable Care Act is not a perfect bill, and I remain committed to lowering costs and strengthening coverage for all Americans. But TrumpCare takes our health care system in the opposite direction.For America’s women, our rural communities, low-income families, and the hundreds of millions of Americans who don’t fall into the same tax bracket as President Trump, we have to do better. The health of our country depends on it."

And you don’t suddenly become a leader once you reach a certain pay grade.A true leader influences others to be their best. Leadership is about social influence, not positional power.If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. —John Quincy Adams You don’t even need to have people reporting to you to be a leader. A janitor can influence people and lead just as a CEO can.Likewise, anyone can become a follower, even while holding a leadership position.If you’re a slave to the status quo, lack vision, or don’t motivate everyone around you to be their absolute best, then you’re a follower. Even if you happen to have a leadership title, people won’t follow you when they see those behaviors present.A senior executive who creates unnecessary bureaucracy, locks himself in his office, and fails to interact with others in any meaningful way is no more a leader than an antisocial software engineer who refuses to do anything but write code.Of course, the real question is—are you a leader or a follower?To find out, you need to ask yourself some very important questions. Think carefully as you respond to each one, and you’ll soon know for certain.1. Do you go above and beyond? Followers do their jobs, and that’s it. No matter how good they may be at those jobs, it rarely occurs to them to go beyond their basic functions. Leaders, on the other hand, see their job descriptions as the bare minimum—the foundation upon which they build greatness. Leaders see their real role as adding value, and they add it whenever and wherever they see an opportunity.2. Are you confident? Followers see the talents and accomplishments of other people as a threat. Leaders see those same talents and accomplishments as an asset. Leaders want to make things better, and they’ll take help anywhere they can find it. Leaders are true team players. They aren’t afraid to admit that they need other people to be strong where they’re weak.3. Are you optimistic? Followers see the limitations inherent in any given situation; leaders see the possibilities. When things go wrong, leaders don’t dwell on how bad things are. They’re too busy trying to make things better.4. Are you open to change? Followers are content to stick with the safety of the status quo. They see change as frightening and troublesome. Leaders are maximizers who see opportunity in change. Because leaders want constant improvement, they’re never afraid to ask, “What’s next?”5. Are you decisive? Followers often hesitate to act, out of fear that they’ll do the wrong thing. Leaders aren’t afraid to make a call, even when they’re not sure if it’s the right one. They’d rather make a decision and be wrong than suffer from the paralysis of indecision.Leaders would rather make a decision and be wrong than suffer from the paralysis of indecision. 6. Are you accountable? When mistakes are made, followers are quick to blame circumstances and other people. Leaders, on the other hand, are quick to accept accountability for their actions. They don’t worry that admitting fault might make them look bad, because they know that shifting the blame would just make them look worse.7. Are you unflappable? Followers often let obstacles and mishaps throw them off course. When something goes wrong, they assume the whole project is doomed. Leaders expect obstacles and love being challenged. They know that even the best-laid plans can run into unexpected problems, so they take problems in stride and stay the course.8. Are you humble? Followers are always chasing glory. Leaders are humble. They don’t allow any authority they may have to make them feel that they are better than anyone else. As such, they don’t hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they won’t ask anyone to do anything they wouldn’t be willing to do themselves.9. Are you passionate? Followers are trapped in the daily grind. They go to work and complete their tasks so that they can go home at the end of the day and resume their real lives. Leaders love what they do and see their work as an important part of—not a weak substitute for—real life. Their job isn’t just what they do; it’s an important part of who they are.10. Are you motivated from within? Followers are only motivated by external factors: the next title, the next raise, the next gain in status. Leaders are internally motivated. They don’t work for status or possessions. They are motivated to excel because it’s who they are. True leaders keep pushing forward even when there’s no carrot dangling in front of them.True leaders keep pushing forward even when there’s no carrot dangling in front of them. 11. Do you focus on titles? Followers care a lot about titles, both their own and those of the people they work with. They’re very conscious of who outranks whom, because they lack the skill and motivation to create leadership from within. Leaders, on the other hand, focus on what each individual brings to the table, regardless of what’s printed on a business card.12. Are you focused on people? Followers focus on what they can achieve individually. Leaders are team players, because they know that greatness is a collective feat. A leader is only as good as what he or she can achieve through other people.A leader is only as good as what he or she can achieve through other people. 13. Are you willing to learn? Leaders, while confident, know that they’re neither superhuman nor infallible. They’re not afraid to admit when they don’t know something, and they’re willing to learn from anyone who can teach them, whether that person is a subordinate, a peer, or a superior. Followers are too busy trying to prove they’re competent to learn anything from anyone else.Bringing It All TogetherTake another quick look at the questions above. There’s not a single one about title, position, or place on the org chart. That’s because you can have the title and position without being a leader.You may have worked for someone who fits that description. And you probably have colleagues who serve in leadership roles without a title.Leadership and followership are mindsets. They’re completely different ways of looking at the world. One is reactive, and the other is proactive. One is pessimistic; the other is optimistic. Where one sees a to-do list, the other sees possibilities. So don’t wait for the title. Leadership isn’t something that anyone can give you—you have to earn it and claim it for yourself.And please, share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?

But that was enough this week for white supremacists across the country to call the unidentified contractor’s business ― hired by the city of New Orleans to drop off the fence at the soon-to-be-torn-down Jefferson Davis monument ― and threaten him. “Specifically, they said they were going to burn me, they were going to burn my trucks, they were going to come to my yard and protest, they’re not gonna let my trucks leave the yard, they going to protest all day long, and one woman from Mississippi specifically said she’s going to make sure that I’m going to get burned and my truck is going to get burned,” the contractor told WVUE Fox 8. “That’s how bad it is.” Last week, police arrested a Mississippi man upset over the city’s decision to remove four white supremacist and Confederate monuments in New Orleans, after he threatened to shoot Mayor Mitch Landrieu. And in April, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke posted on Twitter the name, address, and phone number of a local business hired to remove the monuments. The business owner then received a barrage of threatening and harassing voicemails and texts from blocked numbers. “You better watch your back,” one message conveyed, according to a police report. “Better hope I don’t see you on the street,” another message taunted. Also last month, after it was revealed that New Orleans Fire Department officials had been present for the removal of the Liberty Place Monument, firehouses across the city received phone call threats. And in January, another contractor hired by the city to remove the monuments backed out of his contract after receiving death threats. A week later, his $200,000 Lamborghini was set on fire and destroyed. “History will record, I think, that we did the right thing for the right reason at the right time,” Mayor Landrieu told HuffPost this week about removing the Confederate monuments.“Everybody is entitled to an opinion if they disagree with it,” he continued. “What they’re not entitled to do is thwart the will of the people duly executed through the law by both the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.” Landrieu has led the campaign to remove four monuments in New Orleans that celebrate white supremacy and the “Lost Cause” of the Confederacy. The Liberty Place monument ― which until 1993 had the words “white supremacy” inscribed on its base ― was taken down late last month. As a security precaution, the removal was undertaken at night by workers in masks and bulletproof vests, with snipers standing by to protect them. The other three statues ― of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard, and of Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy’s president ― are scheduled to be taken down over the next month or so.The city, citing safety concerns, isn’t revealing exactly when those removals will take place. Tense and sometimes violent protests have broken out this week at the remaining three Confederate monuments, with some pro-monument protesters showing up armed with guns. National debate over the presence of Confederate symbols on public property has grown louder and louder since Dylann Roof massacred nine black parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.Roof, a white supremacist, revered the Confederate flag, often posing in pictures with the symbol of the Southern army and the bloody regime of slavery it sought to uphold. The state of South Carolina eventually removed the flag from outside its statehouse. A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center found over 700 Confederate statues and symbols on public property across the country. But as states, municipalities, and schools across the South consider what to do with these Confederate artifacts, the situation in New Orleans shows how these communities can expect harassment, intimidation, and threats from white supremacists if they elect to have the artifacts removed. In December 2015, the New Orleans city council voted 6-1 to support the mayor’s proposal to remove the four Confederate monuments. The removals, however, were stalled by legal challenges.Then, after victories in court earlier this year, the city started lining up contractors to remove the monuments. That’s when Neo-Nazi sites like the Daily Stormer, and white supremacists like Duke, the former KKK leader and Louisiana state senator, ramped up their vile online campaign, posting the names, addresses and phone numbers of contractors, firefighters, anti-monument protesters, and Mayor Landrieu. “Anytime there has been a major effort for progress that surrounds civil rights there have always been dangerous circumstances,” Landrieu told HuffPost. “When you’re in public life,” he said, “you have those threats from time to time, you know, which is why we take appropriate security precautions.” As for the contractors and other officials targeted with threats, Landrieu had this message for them: “We’re going to protect your safety. And we’re going to secure the site and we’re going to make sure you’re safe.”Landrieu emphasized that these monuments were put up in New Orleans after the Civil War with the explicit purpose of promoting white supremacy. Their presence is unacceptable, he said, especially in a diverse and black-majority city like New Orleans.Anyone who argues otherwise, he said, shows a “low depth of historical knowledge.”“They’re not just pieces of art,” he said. “These four specific monuments, these four specific ones, were put up for a specific purpose by a specific group of people to achieve a certain objective, which was to let people on the streets of New Orleans know who was still in charge.”That’s especially true of the Liberty Place monument, erected in 1891 to honor members of the White League ― a white supremacist terror group with ties to the KKK ― killed during the 1874 Battle of Liberty Place, an attempt by the White League to violently replace New Orleans’ racially integrated government. In 1932, the city of New Orleans added a plaque to the base of the Liberty Place monument celebrating how the Yankees “recognized white supremacy in the South” when the federal government ended Reconstruction, the attempt by the U.S. government to guarantee the rights of black Americans freed from slavery. The three Confederate statues in New Orleans still slated for removal were all erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries ― a period when many in the South sought to whitewash slavery’s role in the Civil War, creating the myth of the “Lost Cause of the Confederacy.”In this myth, the Confederate Army’s brave soldiers fought Northern oppression to defend states rights and protect the South’s chivalric way of life ― not to uphold the Southern economy’s dependence on slavery. As part of promoting the “Lost Cause” mythology, statues celebrating Confederate figures were erected across the South, often by Confederate veterans. “These individuals were not veterans fighting on behalf of the United States of America,” Landrieu said. “They were Confederate soldiers fighting against the United States of America and they reflect a certain set of values that I don’t think New Orleans has ever really fully represented.”Robert E. Lee, Landrieu added, “never even stepped foot in the city of New Orleans.” Landrieu admitted that didn’t expect the monument removal process to have taken so long, and the debate to have grown so bitter. Still, he said, it’s the right decision. “I’ve said many times on the issue of race and reconciliation: you can’t go over it, you can’t go under it, you can’t go around it,” he said. “You really have to go through it.”Once removed, the monuments will go into storage until the city decides on an appropriate home for them, such as a museum. America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

They are very excited about giving Americans more ""choice.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590e095317000020005a525f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Republican lawmakers talk about health care, the word “choice” invariably comes up a lot, as if buying insurance is an activity akin to buying lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. The more on the menu, the better the care, the thinking goes.“We must move to a better system that embraces competition and choice and actually lowers costs for patients and taxpayers,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) wrote in a March op-ed advocating for the GOP Obamacare repeal plan that passed this week in the House.To mock the Republican idea of health care choice, a new website purporting to be for the American Health Care Act allows visitors to “choose your plan.”For a range of prices, Americans can pick a casket of their choice for their burial when they die from lack of health insurance. The caskets even come in cute different colors.The website’s options all link back to the Democratic Socialists of America, a left-wing grassroots group that has seen its dues-paying membership explode since President Donald Trump’s election. It also plugs the hashtag #MedicareForAll, the rallying cry of progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who support single-payer health insurance.But the humor plays off a broader issue. Critics say the Republican advocacy of “health care choice” has always been something of a misnomer because health care just isn’t like other consumer goods. Consumers do not have the same power to command lower prices for health care, since it is not a product they can choose to not have. People also often lack the information and resources to choose a health care provider based on its financial value.It may be the GOP’s failure to appreciate these nuances that led them to pass a bill in the House of Representatives that would provide coverage to an estimated 24 million fewer people than the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.If enacted, the Republican legislation, known as the American Health Care Act, could very well lead people to die preventable deaths. Some 45,000 people died annually due to lack of health insurance, according to a 2009 Harvard Medical School study that was conducted prior to passage of Obamacare."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590decfa140000c80ef8b91a.jpeg?cache=tnaHhXm3Jy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An 1882 law that’s become relevant to today’s immigration debates is a blueprint for racist policies that should remain in the past, experts say.Saturday marks 135 years since passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which historians say has turned out to be an original model for today’s race-based bans, deportation policies and immigrant wages. The law, which prohibited all immigration to the U.S. by Chinese laborers, was one of the first major U.S. policies that banned a group of people on the basis on race.“The Chinese Exclusion Act gave way to America as the ‘gate-keeping nation,’” Beth Lew-Williams, an assistant professor at Princeton specializing in Asian-American history, told HuffPost in an interview in December. “What stayed in place was system of immigration deportation and removal we have today. And the idea that border control should involve deportation.”Chinese people already living in the U.S. as of 1882 were forced to face issues such as ethnic registries, deportation and hate crimes.But the new wave of Chinese coming to America amid the Gold Rush ― who would eventually help construct the transcontinental railroad at lower wages than whites ― became among the nation’s first undocumented immigrants. The ban was quasi-repealed on Dec. 17, 1943, allowing 105 Chinese visas per year, an act that many perceived as a way to maintain U.S.-China relationships against Japan during World War II.In 1965, the Immigration and Nationality Act fully reversed exclusionary practices, which some historians say was meant to prop up Asians as the “model minority” amid the Civil Rights movement.Despite repeals, experts point out how discriminatory rhetoric can yield dehumanizing treatment ― even as policies come and go. “After the Exclusion Act was passed, it emboldened people who wanted to get rid of the Chinese. The public was doing vigilante activities.”In December, HuffPost spoke with renowned Chinese immigration expert, Peter Kwong, a former Asian-American studies professor at Hunter College, before he passed away in March. Kwong, who was also the author of several books on Chinese-Americans, also drew parallels to the current administration, explaining how discriminatory laws can incite more hate.“Lawmakers were trying to appease the public back then. There were two major massacres in Wyoming and Idaho. They tried to pass more laws and terrorize Chinese people using violence,” he said.The context for how Chinese were being treated in America at the time was based on ethnocentrism and a desire to maintain power, Lew-Williams said. “The Chinese were originally seen as racially unassimilable. They could not become Americanized,” she said. “They were simultaneously racially inferior, backwards, savage heathen ― and in some dangerous ways ― superior.”She said that Americans felt threatened for two reasons – because of their desire to maintain “racial purity” and because of the fact that Chinese workers could work faster than Americans. But she said this work ethic might have been born out of necessity and then perceived as innate.Lew-Williams pointed to a discriminatory labor system in place after Chinese people came here for the Gold Rush and found work in fields including lumber, agriculture and railroad construction. She points out that people saw the Chinese as more industrious, but that could be due in part to job demands enacted by white Americans.“It was a race-based dual wage system at the time,” she said. “Chinese were paid less, given the worst strenuous jobs. People against the Chinese saw this as revealing of their innate nature. That Chinese were fundamentally “cheap” labor and designed to do this back-breaking labor.”Kwong pointed out how these stereotypes discount diversity among Asians.“Because some Chinese people succeeded doesn’t mean working class Chinese have the same capability and upward mobility. It’s a class issue.” He said that once more wealthy Chinese individuals immigrated to the U.S., the perception of Asian-Americans as model minorities was cemented. His hope was that people don’t lose sight of the struggles of the original Chinese-Americans that continue to persist."

They are as follows:Rac·ism (noun):1) When a white person gets caught saying “n*gger” in public (See also: Boston).2) When a person of color hurts a white person’s feelings by discussing actual racism.That’s it. Everything else is apparently up for debate. Everything. This article, like most of my articles, will fall under the second definition. Not because it’s actually racist, but because that’s a convenient way to dismiss all these jewels Black women are constantly dropping. In fact, according to my backlog of hate mail from angry white folks, I’m the biggest racist this side of Pennsylvania Avenue. So, today, I figured I’d switch gears and talk about baseball.This week, during a Red Sox game, a white fan was ejected after another white fan overheard him say the featured vocalist had “niggered up” the national anthem. The fan then earned the distinct honor of being the first person EVER banned for life from entering Fenway Park. I reached out to the Red Sox to determine if this fan was also the first person to ever utter a racial slur at a baseball game. I’ll keep you posted in case they decide to hit me back. The singer in question is an unnamed Kenyan woman, whose identity has either been intentionally withheld from the media (despite the fact her hobbies include performing at packed stadiums) or deemed unworthy of reporting on. I employed all my resources — Google and a box of wine — and came up empty-handed here as well. So she, like many victims of racism, has essentially been erased from her own narrative — while white folks have been centered. (Update: Readers have informed me the singer’s name is Mercy Mungai. Thank you!)On the surface, it’s commendable that the Red Sox made the decision to ban a racist fan, but let’s keep in mind that this is first and foremost a PR opportunity being used to mitigate bad publicity the city and franchise have been getting for their overt culture of racism. It’s not a coincidence that this banning occurred ONE DAY after Orioles outfielder Adam Jones was hit with a bag of peanuts and called a nigger by Red Sox fans. Predictably, racism deniers have accused Jones of fabricating the incident. Former Red Sox player and sports analyst, Curt Schilling, even went so far as to call Jones’s account “bullshit,” adding, “I don’t believe the story, given the world we live in.”That’s because Black Americans and white Americans are living in two different worlds. In one world, a white person overhears a racial slur and is immediately believed and supported by the League; and the fan in question is ejected and banned for life. Case closed. In the other world, a Black player gets called a nigger to his face, the media doubts it, and it’s “under investigation” by the second most racist police department in the world. And as Adam Jones points out, even banning fans for life is just “a slap on the wrist.” It doesn’t address the behavior; it only moves it to the sports bar across the street for Black citizens to deal with.Red Sox president, Sam Kennedy, used the ejection to congratulate his own franchise, stating, “That’s the kind of leadership [we] have in our ownership group.” To add insult to injury, Kennedy also released a statement declaring that the fans and the entire organization are “sickened by the conduct of an ignorant few.” That’s the used car salesman way of saying the Red Sox and their fans are totally NOT racist. And it politely undermines the experiences of people of color living in America Boston, screaming from the top of our lungs that society is systemically oppressive and discriminatory.Of course other sports outlets were quick to echo Kennedy’s myth of a tolerant world sullied by the actions of a “disgraced few.” Boston Mayor, Marty Walsh, weighed in as well, describing the racist taunts directed at Jones as “an unfortunate incident” that does not “reflect the city, [or] who we are as Boston.” Even the Massachusetts governor asserted “This is not what Massachusetts & Boston are about.” Except it is. These are not isolated incidents. Black Bostonians — including myself — are painfully aware of how big a problem racism is in Boston. And we’re not alone.Last year, comedian, Michael Che, said on national television, “Boston is the most racist city [he’s] ever been to.” He doubled down on those comments in March, following a swift backlash from racism deniers, including — you guessed it — racist Bostonians.Ultimately, white people need to stop discounting the overwhelming and suffocating amount of racism experienced by people of color around the country. As I said this week on Facebook (before being promptly banned), “All white people are racist.” That’s not an insult, it’s a reality. We cannot address racism if white people get to define and dismiss it as they see fit. White people cannot practice anti-racism without first acknowledging the ways they are complicit in the oppression of people of color. The same goes for men in correlation to the blatant sexism imposed on women and femmes by patriarchal institutions... like the House of Representatives.The Boston Red Sox took the easy way out by diminishing the racism occurring at Fenway and throughout the organization. It’s easier to symbolically scold one anonymous fan (knowing good and well there’s no way to enforce a lifetime ban) than to acknowledge the numerous ways in which the franchise perpetuates systemic racism. For example: It’s racist that 40 percent of MLB players are people of color, yet less than ~2 percent of the owners are non-white. It’s racist that Latino and immigrant players “earn less than white players” regardless of their level of production on the field. It’s racist that the Red Sox face off against opponents with team names like the “Indians” and the “Braves” — who promoted racist logos and imagery for decades. In fact, it’s even racist that we still sing the national anthem at baseball games, given the racist history of the song. And I don’t want to get into it now, but it’s gotta be racist to sell nachos at the concession stand for 12 dollars a pop. Maybe the league should address those things before presenting themselves as arbiters of racial justice. Until then, I’ll continue to enforce my own self-imposed ban from Fenway....Reposted from DiDi Delgado’s Medium.com page."

Thank you!)On the surface, it’s commendable that the Red Sox made the decision to ban a racist fan, but let’s keep in mind that this is first and foremost a PR opportunity being used to mitigate bad publicity the city and franchise have been getting for their overt culture of racism. It’s not a coincidence that this banning occurred ONE DAY after Orioles outfielder Adam Jones was hit with a bag of peanuts and called a nigger by Red Sox fans. Predictably, racism deniers have accused Jones of fabricating the incident. Former Red Sox player and sports analyst, Curt Schilling, even went so far as to call Jones’s account “bullshit,” adding, “I don’t believe the story, given the world we live in.”That’s because Black Americans and white Americans are living in two different worlds. In one world, a white person overhears a racial slur and is immediately believed and supported by the League; and the fan in question is ejected and banned for life. Case closed. In the other world, a Black player gets called a nigger to his face, the media doubts it, and it’s “under investigation” by the second most racist police department in the world. And as Adam Jones points out, even banning fans for life is just “a slap on the wrist.” It doesn’t address the behavior; it only moves it to the sports bar across the street for Black citizens to deal with.Red Sox president, Sam Kennedy, used the ejection to congratulate his own franchise, stating, “That’s the kind of leadership [we] have in our ownership group.” To add insult to injury, Kennedy also released a statement declaring that the fans and the entire organization are “sickened by the conduct of an ignorant few.” That’s the used car salesman way of saying the Red Sox and their fans are totally NOT racist. And it politely undermines the experiences of people of color living in America Boston, screaming from the top of our lungs that society is systemically oppressive and discriminatory.Of course other sports outlets were quick to echo Kennedy’s myth of a tolerant world sullied by the actions of a “disgraced few.” Boston Mayor, Marty Walsh, weighed in as well, describing the racist taunts directed at Jones as “an unfortunate incident” that does not “reflect the city, [or] who we are as Boston.” Even the Massachusetts governor asserted “This is not what Massachusetts & Boston are about.” Except it is. These are not isolated incidents. Black Bostonians — including myself — are painfully aware of how big a problem racism is in Boston. And we’re not alone.Last year, comedian, Michael Che, said on national television, “Boston is the most racist city [he’s] ever been to.” He doubled down on those comments in March, following a swift backlash from racism deniers, including — you guessed it — racist Bostonians.Ultimately, white people need to stop discounting the overwhelming and suffocating amount of racism experienced by people of color around the country. As I said this week on Facebook (before being promptly banned), “All white people are racist.” That’s not an insult, it’s a reality. We cannot address racism if white people get to define and dismiss it as they see fit. White people cannot practice anti-racism without first acknowledging the ways they are complicit in the oppression of people of color. The same goes for men in correlation to the blatant sexism imposed on women and femmes by patriarchal institutions... like the House of Representatives.The Boston Red Sox took the easy way out by diminishing the racism occurring at Fenway and throughout the organization. It’s easier to symbolically scold one anonymous fan (knowing good and well there’s no way to enforce a lifetime ban) than to acknowledge the numerous ways in which the franchise perpetuates systemic racism. For example: It’s racist that 40 percent of MLB players are people of color, yet less than ~2 percent of the owners are non-white. It’s racist that Latino and immigrant players “earn less than white players” regardless of their level of production on the field. It’s racist that the Red Sox face off against opponents with team names like the “Indians” and the “Braves” — who promoted racist logos and imagery for decades. In fact, it’s even racist that we still sing the national anthem at baseball games, given the racist history of the song. And I don’t want to get into it now, but it’s gotta be racist to sell nachos at the concession stand for 12 dollars a pop. Maybe the league should address those things before presenting themselves as arbiters of racial justice. Until then, I’ll continue to enforce my own self-imposed ban from Fenway....Reposted from DiDi Delgado’s Medium.com page."

They keep their nights and weekends sacred and still get more done,2017-05-06,<p>How you work is far more important than how much you work. Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you how to get more done in less time.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e66aa02c00002300ff2a34.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Some people have an uncanny ability to get things done. They keep their nights and weekends sacred and still get more done than people who work 10 or 20 hours more per week than they do.A new study from Stanford shows that they are on to something.The study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that there’s no point in working any more. That’s right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours.""Time is what we want most, but what we use worst."" -William Penn Smart people know the importance of shifting gears on the weekend to relaxing and rejuvenating activities. They use their weekends to create a better week ahead.This is easier said than done, so here’s some help. The following are some things that you can do to find balance on the weekend and come into work at 110% on Monday morning.1. Disconnect. Disconnecting is the most important weekend strategy, because if you can’t find a way to remove yourself electronically from your work Friday evening through Monday morning, then you’ve never really left work. Making yourself available to your work 24/7 exposes you to a constant barrage of stressors that prevent you from refocusing and recharging. If taking the entire weekend off handling work e-mails and calls isn’t realistic, try designating specific times on Saturday and Sunday for checking e-mails and responding to voicemails. For example, check your messages on Saturday afternoon while your kids are getting a haircut and on Sunday evenings after dinner. Scheduling short blocks of time will alleviate stress without sacrificing availability.2. Minimize chores. Chores have a funny habit of completely taking over your weekends. When this happens, you lose the opportunity to relax and reflect. What’s worse is that a lot of chores feel like work, and if you spend all weekend doing them, you just put in a seven-day workweek. To keep this from happening, you need to schedule your chores like you would anything else during the week, and if you don’t complete them during the allotted time, you move on and finish them the following weekend.3. Exercise. No time to exercise during the week? You have 48 hours every weekend to make it happen. Getting your body moving for as little as 10 minutes releases GABA, a soothing neurotransmitter that reduces stress. Exercise is also a great way to come up with new ideas. Innovators and other successful people know that being outdoors often sparks creativity. I know that a lot of my best ideas come to me while I’m surfing. While you’re out in the ocean, the combination of invigorating activity and beautiful scenery creates the perfect environment for an influx of creativity. Whether you’re running, cycling, or gardening, exercise leads to endorphin-fueled introspection. The key is to find a physical activity that does this for you and then to make it an important part of your weekend routine.4. Reflect. Weekly reflection is a powerful tool for improvement. Use the weekend to contemplate the larger forces that are shaping your industry, your organization, and your job. Without the distractions of Monday to Friday busy work, you should be able to see things in a whole new light. Use this insight to alter your approach to the coming week, improving the efficiency and efficacy of your work.5. Pursue a passion. You might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you’re passionate about on weekends. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape stress and to open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.6. Spend quality time with family. Spending quality time with your family on the weekend is essential if you want to recharge and relax. Weekdays are so hectic that the entire week can fly by with little quality family time. Don’t let this bleed into your weekends. Take your kids to the park, take your spouse to his or her favorite restaurant, and go visit your parents. You’ll be glad you did.7. Schedule micro-adventures. Buy tickets to a concert or play, or get reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven’t done before or perhaps something you haven’t done in a long time. Studies show that anticipating something good to come is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday, but it will significantly improve your mood throughout the week.8. Wake up at the same time. It’s tempting to sleep in on the weekend to catch up on your sleep. Though it feels good temporarily, having an inconsistent wake-up time disturbs your circadian rhythm. Your body cycles through an elaborate series of sleep phases in order for you to wake up rested and refreshed. One of these phases involves preparing your mind to be awake and alert, which is why people often wake up just before their alarm clock goes off (the brain is trained and ready). When you sleep past your regular wake-up time on the weekend, you end up feeling groggy and tired. This isn’t just disruptive to your day off, it also makes you less productive on Monday because your brain isn’t ready to wake up at your regular time. If you need to catch up on sleep, just go to bed earlier.9. Designate mornings as “me” time. It can be difficult to get time to yourself on the weekends, especially if you have family. Finding a way to engage in an activity you’re passionate about first thing in the morning can pay massive dividends in happiness and cleanliness of mind. It’s also a great way to perfect your circadian rhythm by forcing yourself to wake up at the same time you do on weekdays. Your mind achieves peak performance two-to-four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical, and then sit down and engage in something mental while your mind is at its peak.10. Prepare for the upcoming week. The weekend is a great time to spend a few moments planning your upcoming week. As little as 30 minutes of planning can yield significant gains in productivity and reduced stress. The week feels a lot more manageable when you go into it with a plan because all you have to focus on is execution.Bringing It All TogetherWhat do you do to make your weekends great?

Many left-wing analysts believe Macron would only exacerbate the rising inequality and precariousness that made France fertile ground for Le Pen’s demagoguery in the first place.What’s more, French leftists’ candidate of choice, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who made a historically strong showing in the first round, has declined to endorse Macron, vowing only that he would not vote for Le Pen.For Varoufakis, however, the risks that a Le Pen presidency pose to France’s liberal foundations are of far greater concern.“The touching belief in the liberal-democratic state’s checks and balances, and in the idea that the rule of law would prevent Le Pen from turning state power against the vulnerable, is not one that the left can risk entertaining,” he wrote. “Trump’s first 100 days, with its concerted crackdown on undocumented aliens, confirm this.”In addition, Varoufakis revealed that when Macron was France’s economy minister, he was more sympathetic to Greece’s predicament than his French and German colleagues. In the first half of 2015, when the center-left parties in Germany and France joined with the right in maintaining a punishing regime of austerity against the left-wing Greek government, Macron proved a notable exception. He texted Varoufakis to show his support, Varoufakis recalled.“I do not want my generation to be the one responsible for Greece exiting Europe,” Macron wrote, according to Varoufakis.The incident is one of many that Varoufakis recounts in his new memoir, Adults in the Room, which documents his brief and tumultuous stint as finance minister.Polls suggest Varoufakis’ wishes may come true. Macron enjoys a 24-point lead over Le Pen heading into the polls on Sunday. The percentage of Mélenchon voters who say they will vote for Macron jumped from 48 percent on Monday to 55 percent on Friday.The race’s outcome has nonetheless been thrown into question by a last-minute curveball. On Friday, just before the 44-hour blackout period in which French law forbids campaigning and election news coverage, the Macron campaign claimed its private documents had been hacked and released alongside fake ones to confuse voters."
74,GREEN,This May Be The 'Most Contaminated Killer Whale' Ever Recorded,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lulu-killer-whale-pcbs_us_590cf5ffe4b0d5d9049ca40b,Experts fear other members of the orca’s pod may have so much toxic PCBs in their bodies that they can’t reproduce.,2017-05-06,An orca swimming in the Atlantic Ocean near Norway.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590d21081600001f00c59c1f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Researchers in Scotland believe they’ve found one of the most contaminated killer whales on the planet. They fear members of the orca’s pod may also have sky-high levels of chemicals in their bodies that render them infertile, scientists at Scotland’s Rural College said in a news release this week.New analysis of a deceased adult female killer whale, named Lulu by researchers, shows that the animal’s blubber contained some of the highest levels ever recorded of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a toxic chemical once pervasive in electrical components.Andrew Brownlow, head of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, told HuffPost that Lulu might be one of the most contaminated killer whales ever recorded.PCBs are banned in the U.K. and the U.S. due to toxicity. But because the chemical is resistant to extreme temperatures and pressures, it takes a long time to break down. PCBs still exist in the environment, and have been known to leach from landfills into groundwater, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Brownlow told BBC News that the level of PCBs found in Lulu’s blubber was shockingly high ― an estimated 20 times the rate considered safe for cetaceans. High levels of the chemical are linked to poor health, including impaired immune function, infertility and increased susceptibility to cancers.“That puts her as one of the most contaminated animals on the planet in terms of PCB burden, and does raise serious questions for the long-term survivability” of the other orcas in Lulu’s pod, Brownlow told BBC News.The Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme, which monitors beached or stranded marine mammals on the Scottish coast and sometimes performs postmortem examinations on the animals, found Lulu dead on the Isle of Tiree in in January 2016. She apparently had become tangled in fishing line. She was a part of a relatively small pod of an estimated eight orcas, which are often seen in waters off the west coast of Scotland.The stranding scheme, with help from researchers at the University of Aberdeen, found that Lulu was at least 20 years old and had never reproduced, despite her maturity. This is a bad sign not just for Lulu, but for her entire pod, according to Brownlow, who also works as a veterinary pathologist at Scotland Rural College.“Lulu’s apparent infertility is an ominous finding for the long-term survivability of this group; with no new animals being born, it is now looking increasingly likely that this small group will eventually go extinct,” Brownlow said in the university’s news release.“One of the factors in this groups’ apparent failure to reproduce could be their high burden of organic pollutants,” he added.Officials with the World Wildlife Fund UK said the analysis of Lulu sheds light on a larger problem.“The shockingly high levels of PCB contamination found in Lulu ... are another tragic example of the impact that we are having on nature,” Simon Walmsley, the group’s oceans manager, said in a statement.“This requires action and it requires it fast,” Walmsley said. “In this case PCBs will stay in the environment and continue to pollute for many decades. ... The results of this analysis must act as a reminder that it is imperative that we continue to strive to find a way that people can live on our planet without trashing it.”This story was updated to include comments from researcher Andrew Brownlow."
75,POLITICS,Here Are The 27 National Monuments Threatened By Trump's Order,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/monument-review-trump-us_us_590ce0c4e4b0d5d9049c8865,"As part of its review, the Interior Department will begin accepting public comment later this month.",2017-05-06,"Mount Katahdin is seen in a view from Route 159 in Patten, bordering the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590d26071600002000c59c20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Twenty-seven of America’s national monuments spanning over more than 11 million acres of land and about 760 million acres of ocean are threatened by a pair of executive orders signed by President Donald Trump last week.As Trump laid out in his remarks April 26, he’s looking to end “another egregious abuse of federal power,” put “states back in charge” and open up now-protected areas to “tremendously positive things” — whatever that means.On Friday, the Interior Department — one of two agencies tasked with reviewing monument designations and expansions made under the Antiquities Act of 1906 — released a final list of the areas that will receive a second look.The agency also applauded itself for its decision to allow public participation.“A public comment period is not required for monument designations under the Antiquities Act; however, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke and President Trump both strongly believe that local input is a critical component of federal land management,” the agency said in a press release. The administration’s implication is that the public wasn’t involved in the initial designation process — something stakeholders of numerous monuments dispute.Take, for example, Katahdin Woods and Waters, an 87,000-acre national monument in Maine. It is the only monument on the Interior’s list that does not meet the executive order’s initial criteria for review — which states that a monument be 100,000 acres or larger and established after Jan. 1, 1996.In a category all its own, Katahdin is being reviewed specifically to determine whether the designation “was made without adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders,” the Interior said.Lucas St. Clair, whose family donated the land that is now Katahdin, told WABI TV5 that the designation came “after more than four years of public outreach and community input, including countless one-on-one meetings, community forums, debates and town halls.”“More than 72 percent of Mainers say they support the monument,” he said in a statement. “I’m confident that a fair review will demonstrate how important public input was to helping improve the monument idea.”The Interior Department’s public comment period will kick off later this month. Comments relating to Bears Ears National Monument, a controversial 1.35 million-acre area in Utah, will be required to be submitted within 15 days of a public notice. Comments relating to all other monuments must be submitted within 60 days of that notice.Zinke said in statement that his agency is “the steward of America’s greatest treasures,” and part of that job is “being a good neighbor and listening to the American people who we represent.” The public comment process, he added, “finally gives a voice to local communities and states when it comes to Antiquities Act monument designations.”Several of the monuments on the list, including Bears Ears and Gold Butte, were designated by former President Barack Obama. During his presidency, Obama also greatly expanded two marine national monuments, Papahanaumokuakea and Pacific Remote Islands. The acreages listed by Interior in its release for those two marine monuments do not account for those Obama-era expansions.Here’s a peek at the 27 national monuments under the Trump administration’s review:"

The news was confirmed in an Instagram post from the show’s official account.The news was also announced during “Good Morning America” Tuesday morning.Longtime “Idol” host Ryan Seacrest, who is now busy as co-host of “Live with Kelly and Ryan” — along with roughly a thousand other jobs — said he wasn’t sure whether he could return, per People. “I had no idea it was being talked about to come here until late last week I heard a rumor in the news and made a phone call,” he said to co-host Kelly Ripa, “and they said, ‘Yeah, it may actually end up here.’ And I said, ‘Well, that’s kind of good to know since I work here.’”In conclusion: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯PREVIOUSLY:“Idol” will remain idle no more.An exclusive report from Variety reveals that ABC has a deal in place to revive the singing competition show, which ended its 15-season run on Fox in 2016. TMZ said Saturday that the deal is complete and will be announced next week at the network’s upfronts, where new shows are showcased for ad buyers.The new iteration of “American Idol” has a tentative premiere date of next March, potentially for Sunday nights. There’s no word yet on which musical heavy-hitters might show up as judges.In its heyday in the mid-2000s, “Idol” pulled in numbers upwards of 20 million viewers an episode, earning a series high of 38 million viewers during the Season 2 finale with contestants Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard. Ratings stumbled in the show’s later years, with the final season averaging 9.3 million viewers.In February, Variety reported that NBC was eyeing an “Idol” reboot, but concluded that the network ultimately passed to avoid competition with its other singing competition series “The Voice,” now in its 12th season.The biggest question for “Idol” fans remains: Would Ryan Seacrest return as host? The busiest man in show business, who just scooped up a high-profile gig as Kelly Ripa’s morning show co-host on ABC, emceed “Idol” during its 15 years on television. Seacrest also has nationally syndicated radio shows with iHeartMedia and red carpet hosting duties for E! Network, and he serves as executive producer for several reality shows.Entertainment Tonight reports that there have been no formal discussions with Seacrest to return as host if the ABC deal goes through."

While every degree is special, this one is particularly significant. Earning this degree was a hard-fought battle, requiring perseverance, inner strength, and tenacity.18 years ago, my brother made a decision that put his entire life on hold. When our mother was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, she underwent a spinal surgery intended to alleviate her pain. Instead, the surgery was performed incorrectly, leaving her permanently disabled and unable to work. Two weeks prior, my brother turned 19 years old, and he was entering his sophomore year at college. He had immersed himself in a full university experience: he was an honors student in mechanical engineering, he was active in rock climbing and racquetball, and he had many friends.All of that changed when our mother’s surgery went wrong. He dropped out of college to come home to provide care for our mother and me, his little sister 7 years younger. He became responsible for her physical care, cooking, cleaning, and he also got a job to pay all of our household bills. In addition, he began taking me to school. I also took part in providing care for our mother, yet my brother bore the remarkable brunt of our mother’s care needs without any outside support or assistance.While my life as a caregiving youth certainly wasn’t easy, I will always recognize the role my brother played in shielding me from the more devastating effects of caregiving at an early age. Because of him, my life took a very different path. When I look at his experience as a young adult caregiver, I know what my life could have been. Yes, the stress of having a mother in chronic pain sometimes negatively impacted my time in school. But I will never know what it’s like to have your educational dreams snatched away because of caregiving. Yes, I know what it’s like to be bullied and to not feel comfortable telling other people about your life as a caregiver. But I will never know what it’s like to be completely socially isolated and experience the loss of every single friend you’ve ever known because your life suddenly became vastly different than your peers.Sure, I know what it’s like to push yourself through school with the goal of becoming financially successful, always mindful that one day your mother’s care will fall on your shoulders. But, I will never know what it’s like to be forced to unexpectedly work a full-time job to carry the weight of a mortgage and an entire family’s household bills at the bright young age of 19. Because of my brother, there are certain sacrifices that I have never experienced.When I tell people our family story and they ask about our mother, I say that she no longer required intense physical care around 8 years ago, mainly because she stopped having surgeries and her care progressed to the management of her chronic pain.“Oh!”, people often respond, somewhat dismissively, “So everything is fine.” Others even say, “Your brother isn’t a caregiver anymore.”“Well,”, I say, always getting a bit flustered, never knowing how quite to explain our family’s situation. For people who have never experienced family caregiving, they don’t quite understand. They don’t know that in some ways, caregiving never really ends, even if direct physical care is needed irregularly. The severe financial impact never ends. The worry over our mother’s health never ends. The constant gaze towards the uptake of future caregiving responsibilities as our mother ages never ends. And for my brother, on the eve of his graduation from college, the impact of caregiving on his career never ends.Caregiving is the reason why at age 36, despite being “on the right track” at age 19, he has finally earned his first postsecondary degree. Caregiving is the reason why at age 36, he is not yet finished in school; another 2 years of hard work is needed for him to earn a Bachelor’s degree. Caregiving is also the reason why even after those years of going back to school, he still isn’t sure how to answer the big question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” because he lost those carefree years of exploration during young adulthood.I always consider my experience in terms of what I didn’t have to give up because of caregiving, or conversely, what I still was able to experience despite caregiving. That’s all because of my brother. He is the reason why my life was not utterly broken as a caregiving youth, why I was able to pursue my dreams, and why I have hope for my future. He is the reason why my career has been devoted to helping other child and young adult caregivers finally gain much-needed recognition and support in the United States.I firmly believe that because of his conscious actions of selflessness and compassion, millions of other caregiving youths will one day also feel hopeful that having an ill or disabled family member no longer means that they must give up their educational and career goals. People often call my brother a “hero” for our family. Indeed he is. But, as someone who has intimately watched my brother care for us day in and day out for years, I know that he is more than our family’s hero. He has cultivated a legacy that will impact the lives of millions of other young caregivers, and his graduation, is only the beginning of his accomplishments."

Because of him, my life took a very different path. When I look at his experience as a young adult caregiver, I know what my life could have been. Yes, the stress of having a mother in chronic pain sometimes negatively impacted my time in school. But I will never know what it’s like to have your educational dreams snatched away because of caregiving. Yes, I know what it’s like to be bullied and to not feel comfortable telling other people about your life as a caregiver. But I will never know what it’s like to be completely socially isolated and experience the loss of every single friend you’ve ever known because your life suddenly became vastly different than your peers.Sure, I know what it’s like to push yourself through school with the goal of becoming financially successful, always mindful that one day your mother’s care will fall on your shoulders. But, I will never know what it’s like to be forced to unexpectedly work a full-time job to carry the weight of a mortgage and an entire family’s household bills at the bright young age of 19. Because of my brother, there are certain sacrifices that I have never experienced.When I tell people our family story and they ask about our mother, I say that she no longer required intense physical care around 8 years ago, mainly because she stopped having surgeries and her care progressed to the management of her chronic pain.“Oh!”, people often respond, somewhat dismissively, “So everything is fine.” Others even say, “Your brother isn’t a caregiver anymore.”“Well,”, I say, always getting a bit flustered, never knowing how quite to explain our family’s situation. For people who have never experienced family caregiving, they don’t quite understand. They don’t know that in some ways, caregiving never really ends, even if direct physical care is needed irregularly. The severe financial impact never ends. The worry over our mother’s health never ends. The constant gaze towards the uptake of future caregiving responsibilities as our mother ages never ends. And for my brother, on the eve of his graduation from college, the impact of caregiving on his career never ends.Caregiving is the reason why at age 36, despite being “on the right track” at age 19, he has finally earned his first postsecondary degree. Caregiving is the reason why at age 36, he is not yet finished in school; another 2 years of hard work is needed for him to earn a Bachelor’s degree. Caregiving is also the reason why even after those years of going back to school, he still isn’t sure how to answer the big question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” because he lost those carefree years of exploration during young adulthood.I always consider my experience in terms of what I didn’t have to give up because of caregiving, or conversely, what I still was able to experience despite caregiving. That’s all because of my brother. He is the reason why my life was not utterly broken as a caregiving youth, why I was able to pursue my dreams, and why I have hope for my future. He is the reason why my career has been devoted to helping other child and young adult caregivers finally gain much-needed recognition and support in the United States.I firmly believe that because of his conscious actions of selflessness and compassion, millions of other caregiving youths will one day also feel hopeful that having an ill or disabled family member no longer means that they must give up their educational and career goals. People often call my brother a “hero” for our family. Indeed he is. But, as someone who has intimately watched my brother care for us day in and day out for years, I know that he is more than our family’s hero. He has cultivated a legacy that will impact the lives of millions of other young caregivers, and his graduation, is only the beginning of his accomplishments."
79,POLITICS,GOP Congressman: 'Nobody Dies Because They Don't Have Access To Health Care',Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/raul-labrador-nobody-dies-health-care_us_590de6aae4b0e7021e982003,Factcheck: False.,2017-05-06,Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) told constituents nobody dies due to lack of health insurance.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590de8231700001f005a5221.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Faced with criticism from constituents about the Obamacare repeal bill, Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) denied that lack of health insurance prompts people to die from preventable deaths.“You are mandating people on Medicaid accept dying,” a constituent told Labrador at a town hall meeting at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston, Idaho, Friday morning. “You are making a mandate that will kill people.”“No one wants anybody to die. That line is so indefensible,” Labrador responded.“Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care,” he continued, drawing loud jeers from the audience.It is virtually impossible to know exactly how many people would die from the GOP health care plan that the House of Representatives passed on Thursday. But prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act, the landmark law commonly known as Obamacare, some 45,000 Americans died annually due to their lack of health insurance, according to a 2009 Harvard study.And the Republican health care bill effectively guts Obamacare. It rolls back the bill’s expansion of Medicaid, slashes the federal money available to low-income Americans to purchase insurance on the health exchanges and allows states to opt out of federal regulations, including the ban on discriminating based on preexisting conditions.It also further reduces Medicaid payments by capping federal funding per person. Taken together, the law cuts over $800 billion from Medicaid over 10 years, which is roughly the cost of the tax cuts on high earners it would enact.Although the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office does not provide estimates of legislation’s fatality rate, it did project that this bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance in its first decade as law.Perhaps that’s why so many of the 20 million Americans already benefitting from Obamacare view attempts to destroy the law as life-threatening.“I keep wondering why they want to kill me,” Jacqueline Church Simonds, who has coverage thanks to Obamacare, told HuffPost."
80,HEALTHY LIVING,15 Signs That You Are Emotionally Intelligent,"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorTalentSmart, President and 'Emotional Intelligence 2.0,' Coauthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/15-signs-that-you-are-emotionally-intelligent_us_590a21b0e4b05279d4edc20b,"Unlike your IQ, your EQ is highly malleable.",2017-05-06,"<p>Emotional intelligence is a choice and a discipline, not an innate quality bestowed upon the lucky. Find out if you have what it takes in this critical skill.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/590a22001700002400dd6592.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When emotional intelligence (EQ) first appeared to the masses, it served as the missing link in a peculiar finding: People with average IQs outperform those with the highest IQs 70 percent of the time. This anomaly threw a massive wrench into the broadly held assumption that IQ was the sole source of success.Decades of research now point to emotional intelligence as being the critical factor that sets star performers apart from the rest of the pack. The connection is so strong that 90 percent of top performers have high emotional intelligence.Emotional intelligence is the “something” in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions to achieve positive results.Despite the significance of EQ, its intangible nature makes it very difficult to know how much you have and what you can do to improve if you’re lacking. You can always take a scientifically validated test, such as the one that comes with the Emotional Intelligence 2.0 book.Unfortunately, quality (scientifically valid) EQ tests aren’t free. So, I’ve analyzed the data from the million-plus people TalentSmart has tested in order to identify the behaviors that are the hallmarks of a high EQ. What follows are sure signs that you have a high EQ.1. You Have a Robust Emotional Vocabulary.All people experience emotions, but it is a select few who can accurately identify them as they occur. Our research shows that only 36 percent of people can do this, which is problematic because unlabeled emotions often go misunderstood, which leads to irrational choices and counterproductive actions.People with high EQs master their emotions because they understand them, and they use an extensive vocabulary of feelings to do so. While many people might describe themselves as simply feeling “bad,” emotionally intelligent people can pinpoint whether they feel “irritable,” “frustrated,” “downtrodden,” or “anxious.” The more specific your word choice, the better insight you have into exactly how you are feeling, what caused it, and what you should do about it.2. You’re Curious About People.It doesn’t matter if they’re introverted or extroverted, emotionally intelligent people are curious about everyone around them. This curiosity is the product of empathy, one of the most significant gateways to a high EQ. The more you care about other people and what they’re going through, the more curiosity you’re going to have about them.3. You Embrace Change.Emotionally intelligent people are flexible and are constantly adapting. They know that fear of change is paralyzing and a major threat to their success and happiness. They look for change that is lurking just around the corner, and they form a plan of action should these changes occur.4. You Know Your Strengths And Weaknesses.Emotionally intelligent people don’t just understand emotions; they know what they’re good at and what they’re terrible at. They also know who pushes their buttons and the environments (both situations and people) that enable them to succeed. Having a high EQ means you know your strengths and you know how to lean into them and use them to your full advantage while keeping your weaknesses from holding you back.5. You’re A Good Judge Of Character.Much of emotional intelligence comes down to social awareness: the ability to read other people, know what they’re about, and understand what they’re going through. Over time, this skill makes you an exceptional judge of character. People are no mystery to you. You know what they’re all about and understand their motivations, even those that lie hidden beneath the surface.6. You Are Difficult To Offend.If you have a firm grasp of whom you are, it’s difficult for someone to say or do something that gets your goat. Emotionally intelligent people are self-confident and open-minded, which creates a pretty thick skin. You may even poke fun at yourself or let other people make jokes about you, because you are able to mentally draw the line between humor and degradation.7. You Let Go of Mistakes.Emotionally intelligent people distance themselves from their mistakes, but do so without forgetting them. By keeping their mistakes at a safe distance, yet still handy enough to refer to, they are able to adapt and adjust for future success. It takes refined self-awareness to walk this tightrope between dwelling and remembering. Dwelling too long on your mistakes makes you anxious and gun shy, while forgetting about them completely makes you bound to repeat them. The key to balance lies in your ability to transform failures into nuggets of improvement. This creates the tendency to get right back up every time you fall down.8. You Don’t Hold Grudges.The negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event sends your body into fight-or-flight mode, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. When the threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when the threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you’re holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Letting go of a grudge not only makes you feel better now but can also improve your health.9. You Neutralize Toxic People.Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. High EQ individuals control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation rationally. They identify their own emotions and don’t allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person’s standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring them down.10. You Don’t Seek Perfection.Emotionally intelligent people won’t set perfection as their target because they know that it doesn’t exist. Human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you’re always left with a nagging sense of failure that makes you want to give up or reduce your effort. You end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently instead of moving forward, excited about what you’ve achieved and what you will accomplish in the future.11. You Disconnect.Taking regular time off the grid is a sign of a high EQ because it helps you to keep your stress under control and to live in the moment. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even—gulp!—turning off your phone gives your body and mind a break. Studies have shown that something as simple as an e-mail break can lower stress levels. Technology enables constant communication and the expectation that you should be available 24/7. It is extremely difficult to enjoy a stress-free moment outside of work when an e-mail that will change your train of thought and get you thinking (read: stressing) about work can drop onto your phone at any moment.12. You Limit Your Caffeine Intake.Drinking excessive amounts of caffeine triggers the release of adrenaline, and adrenaline is the source of the fight-or-flight response. The fight-or-flight mechanism sidesteps rational thinking in favor of a faster response to ensure survival. This is great when a bear is chasing you, but not so great when you’re responding to a curt e-mail. When caffeine puts your brain and body into this hyper-aroused state of stress, your emotions overrun your behavior. Caffeine’s long half-life ensures you stay this way as it takes its sweet time working its way out of your body. High-EQ individuals know that caffeine is trouble, and they don’t let it get the better of them.13. You Get Enough Sleep.It’s difficult to overstate the importance of sleep to increasing your emotional intelligence and managing your stress levels. When you sleep, your brain literally recharges, shuffling through the day’s memories and storing or discarding them (which causes dreams) so that you wake up alert and clearheaded. High-EQ individuals know that their self-control, attention, and memory are all reduced when they don’t get enough—or the right kind—of sleep. So, they make sleep a top priority.14. You Stop Negative Self-Talk in Its Tracks.The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that—thoughts, not facts. When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain’s natural tendency to perceive threats (inflating the frequency or severity of an event). Emotionally intelligent people separate their thoughts from the facts in order to escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive, new outlook.15. You Won’t Let Anyone Limit Your Joy.When your sense of pleasure and satisfaction are derived from the opinions of other people, you are no longer the master of your own happiness. When emotionally intelligent people feel good about something that they’ve done, they won’t let anyone’s opinions or snide remarks take that away from them. While it’s impossible to turn off your reactions to what others think of you, you don’t have to compare yourself to others, and you can always take people’s opinions with a grain of salt. That way, no matter what other people are thinking or doing, your self-worth comes from within.Bringing It All Together:Unlike your IQ, your EQ is highly malleable. As you train your brain by repeatedly practicing new emotionally intelligent behaviors, it builds the pathways needed to make them into habits. As your brain reinforces the use of these new behaviors, the connections supporting old, destructive behaviors die off. Before long, you begin responding to your surroundings with emotional intelligence without even having to think about it.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me?
