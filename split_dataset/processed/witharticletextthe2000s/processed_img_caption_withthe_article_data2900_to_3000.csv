0,ARTS & CULTURE,I Asked Artists About Empathy: Here Is What They Said...,"John Seed, ContributorProfessor of Art History",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/i-asked-artists-about-empathy-here-is-what-they-said_us_587bbac0e4b094e1aa9dc740,"“It is my duty to voice the sufferings of people, the sufferings that never end and are as big as mountains.” ― Käthe Kollwitz",2017-01-15,"<p>Käthe Kolwitz, <em>The Grieving Parents</em>, a memorial to Kollwitz' son Peter, now in Vladslo, Diksmuide, West Flanders, Belgium</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587bbbcd170000870192a2ea.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“It is my duty to voice the sufferings of people, the sufferings that never end and are as big as mountains.” ― Käthe KollwitzThe great German artist, printmaker and sculptor Käthe Kolwitz (1867-1945) knew profound personal suffering. After her younger son Peter died in battle in Flanders in October, 1914 she fell into a deep depression that re-shaped both her art and political views. The double sculpture that she finally completed in 1931 for the cemetery in which he son was buried, shows the artist and her husband apparently kneeling in grief. However, when asked about the theme of the sculpture Kollwitz explained that it was about much more than grief: it also represents all parents of her generation, asking forgiveness for having led their sons into war.The Grieving Parents, like so many of Kollwitz’ finest works, is grounded in empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. She recognized that she was expressing something greater than her own feelings and that her art could only function if it served an entire society. Grief and loss are universal feelings that bind us, and sharing them with others leads to consolation and social transformation. It is not surprising that in 1936 the Nazi party barred Kollwitz from displaying her work which they branded as “degenerate.” Deep feelings for the sufferings and losses of others—which lead to collective introspection—can lead to resistance against authoritarian politicians and those who advocate war and other forms of sacrifice and suffering.It is interesting to note that the idea of empathy is a late-nineteenth/early twentieth century development, that derives from the imaginative act of projecting oneself into a work of art. In her book You Must Change Your Life: The Story of Rainer Maria Rilke and Auguste Rodin, author Rachel Corbett writes:The invention of empathy corresponds to many of the climactic shifts in the art, philosophy and psychology of fin-de-siècle Europe, and it changed the way artists thought about their work and the way observers related to it for generations to come.The development of empathy as a social expectation and custom parallels the development of Expressionism: of inwardness as a gateway to emotional connection. That inwardness—so essential in the modern conception of a self-aware individual—is the hinge that connects to social awareness and the empathetic understanding of others.Empathy is, without doubt, a political force that plays a considerable role in attitudes towards social issues. In a recent article for Psychology Today—Beware America’s Shocking Loss of Empathy—attorney and social advocate David Noise argues that empathy and it’s “cousin” compassion are crucial elements in politics and policy, arguing that they “lead to an intelligent assessment of what is happening internally and around the world, a minimal level of humane values, and rational attempts to apply those values.”In the context of America’s recent Presidential election, where outrage, uncivil discourse and personal attacks demonstrated a shocking lack of empathy, it seems critical for artists to ask themselves about the role of empathy in their own work. Whether their work is political, personal or somewhere in-between, the element of empathy can allow an artist to “give voice to the sufferings of others,” as Käthe Kolwitz did so nobly in her works.Below is a selection of responses posted on my personal Facebook page after I asked the question:What is the role of empathy in your art? Note: some responses have been edited for brevity.Steven Holmes: Making art assumes empathy. Making art is an act of sharing. It is by definition, an invitation to others to leave their isolation and meet others on the same road as you. An artist without empathy is a sociopath.Mark David Lloyd: Empathy can be painful. Much of my artwork on a conceptual level deals with suffering in one form of another, empathy is experienced in the making process of the artworks and sometimes by the viewer. When we witness suffering and distress in others, our natural tendency to empathize can bring us vicarious pain.Colin Darke: It plays the central role. I only paint or draw in hopes of having a shared experience ― my picture echoing the viewer’s feelings (past or present, happiness/sadness/wonderment) in a new and powerful way.Julia Morgan Scott: I have become somewhat suspicious of efforts to consciously insert empathy into painting. It seems IMHO to politicize something natural to the process of simply painting what one truly loves.Isaias Sandoval-Streufert: For me empathy is essential, without empathy it will be only apathy, my work is about passion, I can’t paint apathy even if I try.Karen Kaapcke: I also have the thought that it is possible that people with high levels of empathy take to the arts as vehicles for that way of being, because it is possibly not an easy way of being (I am thinking of myself when quite young, being almost unbearably disturbed by seeing certain things, or being almost unbearably moved by the beauty of something. Both are equally empathic. A life in the arts might make being that way a little more bearable).Nancy Good: Empathy is key as it speaks the language of connection, i.e. connection to the life experiences of the viewer. We are all connected in pain, joy, fear, wonder, hunger, yearning ... all we experience. Empathy in art banishes isolation and invites healing.Franck De Las Mercedes: Most of my work stems from an emotionally charged, at times dark, at times painful place. To hear others regard it as beautiful or meaningful to their lives is the biggest compliment. The gift is in sharing and understanding the feelings and experiences of another.F. Scott Hess: Empathy is the link that a painter of figures relies on to make others feel the work. It happens before conscious thought, before critical analysis kicks in. You grab your audience by their empathetic guts before they know what’s happening. Gesture, facial expression, movement, composition, and paint application all work together to achieve this end.Judith Peck: In order to create, I have to feel very deeply, without that connection I believe my work would be a hollow shell.Steph Rocknak: From an article I wrote a few years ago: “Psychology, which in many respects grew out of Hume’s work, is helping us to further clarify the fundamental role that empathy plays in our moral sensibilities. Hume’s work, written over two hundred and fifty years ago, is still profoundly relevant. But great artists have always seemed to know what Hume knew; they hook us up to the empathy machine when we become too self-involved, too isolated. For the most part, artists, not philosophers, keep us human; they can put us—no, sometimes force us—into the other person’s shoes. We see what it is like to be a victim a war, we see what it is like to be terribly conflicted, we see what it was like to be trapped inside the World Trade Center on 9/11. Artists can also expose our horror for what it is; we get a look inside the heads of those who know no empathy: the psychopaths, the sociopaths, the narcissists. Sometimes, we even get to see what it is like to live in an entire society that has gone the way of a psychopath. Once again, Bosch and Michelangelo come to mind, or, more recently, Cormac McCarthy’s novel, The Road. “Dab Zabooty: Without empathy art becomes a technical exercise.Tristan Xavier Köster: In German there is this word “Sympathie” (not to be confused with sympathy) which basically means that you can understand and empathize with somebody(always used positively). I think that this sensation of Sympathie, finds itself in nearly all forms of art, allowing complete strangers to feel and see/hear with the artist. ‪Empathy (veiled by a sense of guilt) fuels just about every single melody I write, but I always try and make sure that my music is “sympathisch” to the listener.Joseph Bravo: Genuine aesthetic communication rests on empathy between the artist and the viewer. If art is to maintain some intrinsic cultural relevance then the audience indeed needs to be broadened. With that broadening of the audience must also come a broadening of the messages and the identity of the messengers as well, even at the risk of a disquieting cacophony. But ideally, each artist would be endeavoring to expand that empathic communication to edify as wide a range of humanity as possible. If artists are to speak with their audience rather that merely at it, then they should seek to find at least a point of common ground on which to plant that seed of empathy.Conor Walton: Empathy assumes reciprocal emotional relations between artist, subject and viewer that are egalitarian insofar as each can identify with the other, and this might naturally be expected to form the basis of an egalitarian art. It might suit a modern style of portraiture or figure painting which takes human equality for granted, but most of the great artworks of the past were produced in a different social context, and embody power relations and notions of social hierarchy that obstruct empathic relations. Are they to be admired less as a consequence? Is a contemporary work that expresses empathy superior to an ancient masterpiece that doesn’t? Or might it be the reverse: that cultivating empathy leads towards an urbane, popular, sentimental art, but places the highest summits of achievement off limits because of its antipathy to the sublime?Vonn Sumner: Empathy is the most important, most essential, most foundational element of painting and drawing. Empathy was the guiding principle of Wayne Thiebaud’s teaching, and he would often state it plainly. He would also say that empathy is the basis of civilization and quote Gloria Steinham: “Empathy is the most radical human emotion.”Joao de Brito: A Portuguese Proverb:”O artista é a voz do povo” or “ artists are the voice of the people” empathy is what is channeled by many artists to express what needs to seen or heard from the public when the world is in confusion.Ingrid Reeve: My art is not about progress; it’s about truth. Empathy is essential for discerning truth.Note: The original Facebook post and all replies can be viewed at this link. "

4,WORLDPOST,A New Joint Message From The Kremlin And The Trump Administration,"Raghida Dergham, ContributorColumnist and Senior Diplomatic Correspondent, Al Hayat",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-new-joint-message-from_b_14180560.html,,2017-01-15,"Exxon Mobil CEO and Chairman Rex Tillerson speaks as he and other top oil and gas industry executives testify during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on ""Oil and Gas Tax Incentives and Rising Energy Prices"" on Capitol Hill in Washington May 12, 2011. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: ENERGY BUSINESS POLITICS)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc0e73e26000035006fea67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amid a calculated and proactive realignment by Russia and China ahead of the inauguration of Donald Trump, Europe appears tense and scattered. The Gulf states seem to be waiting in limbo, without a preemptive strategy. Iran appears vigilant, eager to preserve its regional gains and protect itself from the new U.S. administration that seems intent to scrutinize its every action. The UN has launched a new era with the inauguration of its new Secretary General Antonio Guterres earlier this month, amid reinvigorated efforts by the Security Council and international envoys in conflict zones from Libya to Yemen via Syria. Russia has commandeered the Syrian issue from the UN in Geneva, and taken it to its backyard in Astana, Kazakhstan, deliberately excluding the international organization from the Syrian peace process. The Gulf countries have responded by clinging to the UN role and resolutions, and by renewing their wager on the partnership with Europe in rejecting Russia's hijacking of the issue and refusing to reward Moscow by allowing the talks in Astana to succeed, betting instead on their failure. Washington is still familiarizing itself with the new president as it bids farewell to the 44th president, Barack Hussein Obama, amid a deep division among Americans regarding the identity of their country at home and its foreign policy, especially with regard to its leadership of the world and US-Russian relations. The 45th president, Donald J Trump, will enter the White House next week, in the middle of a storm of controversy, apprehension, but also enthusiasm from his uncritical supporters. He enters the White House armed with threats against the media and his ability to stir up social media. Meanwhile, the unprecedentedly public rift between the president-elect and U.S. intelligence services over alleged leaks and Russian hacking shows no sign of healing. All indications suggest Trump will keep his campaign promises, unless his cabinet and the establishment manage to restrain his arbitrary tendencies. His nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, has given the House of Representatives a glimpse of his attitudes and convictions, but also made it clear that he had not coordinated in advance those positions with Trump, and that the final decision will be in the president's hands. The priorities listed by Tillerson indicate that he desires a partnership with Russia against the terrorism of ISIS and similar groups, and fighting the rise of Sunni and Shiite radicalism alike including the Muslim Brotherhood, unlike the Obama administration which he blamed for supporting radical Islamism and the rise of ISIS, and the implications of the U.S. abandoning its global leadership and traditional alliances especially in the Middle East. Tillerson vowed that Iran would be under a microscope, whether with regard to its support for extremists and militias, or its implementation of its commitments under the nuclear deal, which will be kept in place apparently contrary to what was suggested on the campaign trail, but will be reviewed. The nominee appeared to be a pragmatist, well verses in the language if strategic interests, bringing to the post his experience in energy and geography. Tillerson also had a lot to say about Russia and China.The key difference between what the Kremlin wants for the American and European communities, by destabilizing them through support for nationalist movements and undermining their social cohesion, and what Tillerson wants for America and the world, lies in the principle of leadership and restoration of prestige. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, benefited immensely from Obama's leading from behind, and reaped great rewards after the U.S. abandoned its global leadership. They had radical differences on the issue of the rise of Islamists to power in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Syria. And this point is the subject of convergence that will newly emerge between Russia and the U.S. under Trump: opposing the rise of Islamists to power, including the Muslim Brotherhood.This will have implications for the relationship with Egypt, which is fighting the Muslim Brotherhood, and will affect Turkey if it remains a key sponsor of the Muslim Brotherhood project. Indeed, the joint message that will be sent by the Kremlin and the Trump administration will address all stakeholders, including the Arab Gulf states, declaring refusal to coexist with Islamic radicalism and any encouragement of the Muslim Brotherhood, in addition to declaring joint intent to eliminate ISIS and its ilk. Indeed, the shelf life of ISIS has expired, and the time has come to take it out of the equation with a joint Russian-American decision. However, relations between the two countries will not be confined to this convergence on fighting terror and extremism. The yardstick for US interests will differ from the one used by the Obama administration, and instead will be a version of what Tillerson described, in terms of reviving the U.S. global weight after the absence of US leadership allowed Moscow's rise and the reassertion of Russia's influence in its near abroad and the Middle East. Tillerson said the U.S. allies in NATO were right to worry about Russian resurgence, and that to restore stability, it is necessary to not only revive U.S. leadership but also assert its position vis-à-vis the threats coming from Russia. Tillerson therefore backed the continuation of sanctions against Russia until opportunities for cooperation are carefully explored. He also proposed giving room to cooperation with China, but insisted that China has not been a reliable partner and has failed to use its influence to contain North Korea. Tillerson said China's goals sometimes conflict with U.S. interests, saying Beijing always places its own objectives above all considerations.Another major difference between Trump's administration and Obama's will emerge with regard to the relationship with Iran. There had been some convergence on the matter between the Kremlin and Obama. Obama's fixation with the need to conclude the nuclear deal intersected with Putin's need for a strategic alliance with Iran in Syria. Both effectively blessed the rise of Shiite extremism in Iran and rewarded it. While the Russian strategy was intent on fighting Sunni radicalism and stopping Washington's bid to push forward so-called moderate Islamists represented by the Muslim Brotherhood, Moscow turned a blind eye to the growth of radical Shiite Islamism represented by the Revolutionary Guards in Iran and Iranian proxy militias in the Arab region.Tillerson placed the Muslim Brotherhood, Iranian elements, and al-Qaeda in the same basket of Islamic extremism. This is an important difference in the attitudes of the Trump administration and the Obama administration, and also between the Kremlin and the new White House depending on jow Russian-Iranian strategic relations evolve.Iran is aware that the Trump administration will bring new pressures, but also through the Russian eagerness to have special relations with the new U.S. administration and even forge a grand bargain with Washington. This does not mean that Moscow is automatically ready to discard its strategic alliance with Tehran, but if Russia is forced to choose between Washington and Tehran, then Washington may take precedence. Russian-Iranian differences over Syria are not small ones. However, any rush to assume that a strategic divorce between them is coming is a mistake. Moreover, addressing the longstanding crisis of confidence between America and Russia, the competition over grand interests, and forging what may become grand bargain subsequently, are all things that take time because conditions have yet to fully ripen. In the meantime, Iran is bent on benefitting from opportunities wherever they may become available, in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Iran is adopting a strategy of building on victories on the ground while giving signs of diplomatic demarches and willingness to engage in dialogue on its own terms. The diplomacy of the Arab Gulf states seem as if deliberately absent while moving to contain Iranian regional influence and Russia's hijacking of the Syrian issue, pending Trump's inauguration. The Gulf states seem reassured by the uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration, because the certainty that comes with Obama has been disappointing. The remarks by Rex Tillerson this week have revived some hopes in the corridors of Gulf diplomacy, when he called for rebuilding the U.S.'s old, now fragile links, being firm with foes, and responding when they violate agreements, in reference to the nuclear deal with Iran. His caustic criticisms of Obama's policies reassured many in the Gulf and increased their sense of anticipation.Waiting is not a policy, especially since all other parties are actively aligning and carefully planning their next moves. Insisting on keeping the Syrian issue in the UN is a position but it is not a strategy. Betting on the failure of the Astana conference in the absence of Saudi Arabia and European powers may be a winning wager, but this amounts to little more than a tactic in a time marked by Russian and Iranian victories in Syria. The Gulf states are in dire need for a comprehensive strategy of alignment, not just vis-à-vis the Trump administration, but also with regard to the Russian infiltration of the Middle East and Russian-Iranian victory in Syria, Iranian supremacy in Iraq, and Iranian incursions in Yemen. Perhaps the time has come for a Gulf initiative that would sweep the rug from under the feet of Washington, Moscow, and Ankara, and move away from the wait and see tactic.The traditional cold, back-channel communication between Gulf countries and Iran has not advanced Arab interests, especially in the time of the love triangle between Iran, and Obama's America and Putin's Russia, allowing Iran to advance its strategic agenda in the Arab geography. Perhaps then Trump's tenure will make room for a new approach, but this cannot happen through complacency. It requires a calculated push and a daring initiative. It suffices not for the Gulf summit in Bahrain to task Kuwait with engaging with Iran based on mutual non-interference and good neighborliness. Iran has yet to respond anyway, and continues to arm cells, militias, and rebels in Yemen. The emir of Kuwait's dispatching of a high level delegate to offer condolences for the death of Iranian former president Rafsanjani was a good message but what is needed is a qualitative shift in Gulf-Iranian relations, in accordance to a comprehensive initiative coinciding with the new administration in the White House, in order to avoid relying on false preconceived notions regarding Trumps thinking: a pragmatic and realistic initiative.Translated by Karim Traboulsi: http://www.alhayat.com/m/opinion/19576740"

I dare you to watch the premiere of their first video here, and not, for at least a few seconds, experience that sensation of pure joy once again.Melmark's Joybells is an incredibly talented hand bell choir that has been around since the 1970s. The choir, consisting mostly of adults with Down syndrome, have made appearances at the White House, been featured on the ""Today"" Show and performed for Pope Francis at the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia. The video's director is Andrew Bilindabagabo, a video producer for Franklin & Marshall College.A native of Rwanda, Bilindabagabo is a graduate of The Templeton Honors College at Eastern University with a BA in Communication Studies and a Media Concentration and has worked as a filmmaker in the Philadelphia area.Singer-songwriter Catie Parker is a music therapist and co-director for the Joybells and the writer and performer of the video's tune, ""Ooh La La."" Parker makes up a third of the  Little Hill Trio (her sister Amelia Parker and cousin Tess Beckwith round out the group), which released its newest CD at Scythian's second annual Appaloosa D.C.'s Roots Music Festival over Labor Day Weekend 2016.""I was writing a song about the Joybells specifically and my experience with them and their attitudes toward life, which tends to be about openness and warmth,"" Parker explains.""We took a break from ringing the bells and I thought it would be fun for them to act out the song so I started playing it for them and they just started acting out so well. Their comedic timing is so good!""Parker continues, ""The Joybells rely almost entirely on donations to continue playing and touring. They could also really use a new tour bus to get around. I thought if we did a music video to advocate for them, to show that they are people too, it could raise money for a tour bus in the process. The money raised through this campaign will go to the Joybells and their cause.""Parker started a Indiegogo fund in part to produce the video. That was before Bilindabagabo stepped in to volunteer his talents.He says, ""I have worked on many different projects, in different capacities; it is rare, but very much appreciated, when one gets to work on a project just for the joy of it. Truthfully, the idea of collaborating with talented friends who I admire, having fun and being silly on set was simply too enticing. I was very honored to spend a day with individuals who exude such 'joie de vivre.' Once we had costumes, a boombox, a choreographer and the camera was rolling, it was not just about making a video, it was just about enjoying each others company while we create something together... hopefully it makes someone smile.""Parker adds Bilindabagabo brought in Laura Parks to do choreography and his wife, Carley Evangelista, who is a professional fundraiser, to help. Scythian's Alexander Fedoryka was very involved in the making of the video as well.""We had the best, most fun day of dancing and recording even though it was really cold,"" she said. ""It's been an awesome experience for me and the Joybells.""As Parker says in the Indiegogo campaign information, ""Join us as we help them create a beautiful music video that will be used to forever capture their joy!""Want to read more stories like this?

6,SCIENCE,Scientists In Last-Minute Scramble To Save Environmental Data Before Trump Takes Over,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scientists-save-environmental-data-before-trump_us_58797f6de4b09281d0eb07fa,Sierra Club files major request for records to buy some time.,2017-01-14,Climate change scientists steel for expected Trump administration storm.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5879a4e21200002d00ad7898.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists across the nation are in a frantic push to save as much environmental data as possible before a feared government information purge orchestrated by climate-change denier Donald Trump.The Sierra Club on Thursday filed Freedom of Information Act requests, seeking information held by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, Bloomberg reports. The organization is asking those agencies to turn over a multitude of documents, including data on greenhouse gas emissions and power plants. Even if the requests are ultimately denied, the move buys valuable extra time for a mounting effort to gather and preserve data before anything is lost.“We’re interested in trying to download and preserve the information, but it’s going to take some time,” senior Sierra Club attorney Andrea Issod told Bloomberg. “We hope our request will be a counterweight to the coming assault on this critical pollution and climate data.”Researchers fear that the incoming administration could wipe out important information on a broad range of environmental factors.“There is no reason to think its efforts would be restricted to climate data alone,” Gretchen Goldman, a research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the Pacific Standard. She’s concerned about data on animals, particularly research by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on endangered or threatened species.“There are a lot more eyes on climate, whereas with federal endangered species science, there are a smaller number of people looking at it and there are fewer data,” making it more vulnerable, she added.Fears about data purges were sparked when Trump’s transition team reached out to the U.S. Energy Department in December demanding the names of employees and contract experts working on environmental and climate change issues. Observers worried that was the first step in a political witch hunt against those scientists. Trump has called climate change a “hoax” by the Chinese to “make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.” Incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus more recently said his boss believes it’s a “bunch of bunk.” Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who have been picked by Trump to lead the EPA, has expressed doubts that human-caused pollution is responsible for what’s happening in the environment. While the Sierra Club presses its request for data, other organized efforts are continuing to save what can be preserved from government databases and post the information on independent websites. A major part of that effort, DataRefuge, is headquartered at the University of Pennsylvania’s Program in the Environmental Humanities. Other efforts include Guerrilla Archiving and Climate Mirror to save environmental information, and the End of Term Web Archive, which attempts to save as many records as possible from outgoing presidential administrations.Data purges and manipulation have been carried out by other administrations. Under President George W. Bush, the EPA moved to shut down some of its research libraries, reducing access to important information. The administration was also accused by the Union of Concerned Scientists of suppressing or distorting research by government scientists or contractors at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Canada’s former conservative government was responsible for purging significant fishery and ocean data.Trump and his supporters have been “salivating at the possibility of dismantling federal climate research programs for years. It’s not unreasonable to think they would want to take down the very data that they dispute,” Michael Halpern of the Union for Concerned Scientists told The Washington Post in a recent email. “Scientists are right to preserve data and archive websites before those who want to dismantle federal climate change research programs storm the castle.”"

Al Sharpton marched along the National Mall toward the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, about two miles (3 km) from the steps of the U.S. Capitol, where Trump will be sworn in as president on Friday.Pre-march speakers denounced Trump to protesters, who braved drizzle and temperatures just above freezing to show their support for minority rights and President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, which Trump has vowed to dismantle.“We stand together, not as a people of hate, but as a people of hope,” said Charley Hames Jr., president of the Oakland, California, chapter of Sharpton’s National Action Network. “We believe this march is the first of many.”Trump, a New York real estate developer, won with a populist platform that included promises to build a wall along the Mexican border and restrict immigration from Muslim countries. He also promised to crack down on companies moving jobs out of the United States.Trump’s disparaging comments about immigrants and women and stance against Obama’s healthcare law have drawn the anger of many on the left, who plan a series of protests.“He’s a clown,” said marcher Ken Coopwood Jr., 17, of Washington. “I think he’s not going to care about much, unless it’s personal.”Civil rights groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Council of La Raza, as well as Democratic lawmakers had all said they would take part in Saturday’s march.The march began hours after Trump blasted U.S. Representative John Lewis after the Georgia Democrat and civil rights campaigner said he did not see Trump as a legitimate president.Lewis told NBC News in an interview for Sunday’s “Meet the Press” that he believed Russia’s alleged hacking aimed at helping Trump put his legitimacy into question.Trump replied on Twitter on Saturday that Lewis should focus instead on his Atlanta district. “All talk, talk, talk - no action or results! Sad!,” he wrote.About 30 groups, almost all of them anti-Trump, have gotten permits to protest before, during and after the inauguration. Thousands of demonstrators also have vowed to shut down the inauguration, including by closing off security checkpoints along the inaugural parade route.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Scott Malone and Tom Brown)"

About 10 minutes after Saturday’s launch, the first stage of the rocket, which had separated from the rest of craft, successfully touched down on a platform in the Pacific Ocean, a feat previously accomplished by four other returning Falcon rockets. SpaceX intends to reuse its rockets to cut costs.The mission will test changes implemented by Space Exploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, since the launchpad explosion.Accident investigators determined that a canister of helium burst inside the rocket’s second-stage liquid oxygen tank, triggering the explosion. The canister is being redesigned, but until then SpaceX is addressing the issue by modifying its fueling procedures.The explosion destroyed a $62 million SpaceX booster and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite that it was to put into orbit two days later.The accident clouded the company’s aggressive agenda, which includes beginning to ferry U.S. astronauts into space next year, when it also plans to make its first voyage to Mars.Saturday’s flight begins to clear a logjam of more than 70 missions, worth more than $10 billion, awaiting flights on SpaceX Falcon rockets, which last flew in August, SpaceX said.The launch is the first in a seven-flight contract with Iridium worth $468.1 million, company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said.SpaceX aims to launch 27 rockets in 2017, more than triple the eight flights the privately held firm managed in 2016, according to a report on Friday in the Wall Street Journal.In addition to its dozens of commercial customers, SpaceX is one of two companies hired by NASA to fly cargo to the International Space Station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.The company’s 2017 agenda includes the debut launch of a heavy-lift booster, flying its first reused rocket and repairing the Florida launchpad damaged in the explosion.(Reporting by Irene Klotz; Editing by Daniel Trotta and Tom Brown)"

Bush, has championed the notion that we humans should increase rather than curb carbon dioxide emissions.As The Washington Post reported Friday, Happer testified before the Senate in 2015 that the “benefits that more CO2 brings from increased agricultural yields and modest warming far outweigh any harm.”Happer has also argued that today’s warming “seems to be due mostly to natural causes, not to increasing levels of carbon dioxide,” that children are being “force-fed propaganda masquerading as science” and has compared the “demonization of carbon dioxide” to the suffering Jewish people endured during the Holocaust. “Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so were the Jews,” he told Andrew Ross Sorkin on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” in 2014.E&E News was among the first to report on Friday’s meeting at Trump Tower. Although it remains unclear whether Trump is considering Happer for an administration position, the climate skeptic would be a fitting pick given the Republican’s previous choices.To the disgust of scientists and environmentalists, Trump has tapped climate denier and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to head the Department of Energy, former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, an ally of the fossil fuel industry, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.Trump himself has dismissed climate change as “bullshit” and a Chinese “hoax.” He has also promised to pull the U.S. out of last year’s historic Paris climate agreement, in which nearly 200 countries pledged to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to keep global temperatures from reaching 2 degrees Celsius above what they were in pre-industrial times.Last week, Natural Resources Defense Council President Rhea Suh called on Americans to fight back against what she described as the Trump administration’s and the Republican Party’s “war” on health and the environment. “Already we’ve seen a set of cabinet nominees dominated by fossil fuel advocates, billionaires and bankers; a president-elect who says ‘nobody really knows’ what’s happening to our climate; and a full-on witch hunt for the experts who know the truth,” she said in a statement. “This is not normal.”"

The only thing left to do was to wait in line until he and another group of Cubans were allowed to enter the United States under a five-decade-old policy that gave preferential treatment to migrants from the communist island. “When I tried crossing yesterday morning, the law still applied,” Rodríguez, 41, told HuffPost. “Everything was ready.” But by around 4 p.m., something was wrong. When official word came down that the Obama administration was scrapping the so-called wet foot-dry foot policy that allowed Cuban migrants, Rodríguez said American immigration authorities laughed, cheered and applauded. The officials assured Rodríguez that everyone in line would make it through. But the line barely moved. And by 9 p.m., U.S. authorities at the border said no more Cubans would be allowed to cross. Last year, some 36,000 Cubans without visas crossed into the U.S. through Laredo in southern Texas, according to Customs and Border Protection. Many simply walked across the pedestrian bridge from Mexico and presented themselves at Laredo’s legal port of entry. Under a unique policy stemming from the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, Cubans were generally paroled into the U.S., even without papers, and were then allowed to apply for U.S. residency with a short path to American citizenship. Obama’s 11th-hour policy change put an end to that, leaving an unknown number of Cubans caught in transit. Few countries allow Cubans to enter on tourist visas, so many migrants travel by air to the South American country of Guyana, and then work their way toward the U.S. by land. Others try their luck reaching the U.S. by sea, knowing they risk their lives and will be returned if caught ― the “wet foot” part of the now-abandoned wet foot-dry foot policy. On Friday, dozens of dejected Cubans lingered at the bridge entrance, unsure where to go with their plans dashed by Obama’s surprise announcement. Cubans once migrated to the U.S. seeking freedom from political persecution. But some have always come to the U.S. to seek a better economic future. And as the U.S. relationship with the island has changed and the Cuban economy has soured, an improved standard of living has become perhaps the biggest reason. Both the Obama administration and many exile-generation Cuban-Americans have criticized the old policy as antiquated. The Cuban government has long urged the U.S. to end wet foot-dry foot, arguing it encourages Cubans to risk their lives.But those stuck in limbo described a tangle of political and economic reasons for leaving ― not unlike other Latin American migrants ― and said they feared retaliation if forced to return.Ernesto Vázquez, 33, left Cuba two months ago with his girlfriend. They flew to Guyana, then traveled by land to Brazil, then onward through the isthmus of Panama, through Central America, and into Mexico. Along the way, they spent thousands of dollars on planes, buses and “coyotes” ― the Spanish slang for human smugglers. They reached Nuevo Laredo one day too late. “We’ll have to see what happens,” Vázquez told HuffPost. “This dream is dead.” If crossing the U.S. border now seems impossible, going back to Cuba isn’t an easy option, either. Vázquez said returning Cubans have trouble getting work and face “constant persecution.” Communist Party officials, who still control most of the island’s economy, would view him as a “gusano,” or “worm” ― a derogatory term for Cubans who flee to the U.S., he said.“Once you leave, and you return as a deportee, they treat you as if you were their enemy,” Ernesto’s girlfriend Lilian said. Michael Bustamante, a professor at Florida International University who studies Cuba, said Cubans who leave have in the past had problems reinserting themselves into life on the island. But he said he doubted the Cuban government would demonize today’s repatriated migrants the way they did to the exile generation. “Might there be unofficial obstacles that one faces having that status? Perhaps,” Bustamante said. “I don’t see a scarlet letter in a political sense that people will wear.”Bustamante said economics and politics have always played intertwined roles in prompting Cubans to leave. “Even if you look back to the 1960s ― yes, people were leaving for political reasons,” Bustamante said. “But they were also leaving because they might have lost a business, they might have lost their bottom lines. Even back then, the motives have always been blurred.”Some of the stranded Cubans said they’d stay in town for a few days, holding out a flicker of hope that the incoming president would undo Obama’s change next week. “There’s nothing to do but hope that Trump reverses this,” Yoandris Pardo, 36, told HuffPost.Pardo had spent the last two months in Mexico City, helping organize conferences as part of a cultural exchange. When his job duties ended, he hoped to apply for asylum. He said that he didn’t have documentation showing that he’d been persecuted politically, but that most everyday Cubans who opposed the Castro government felt afraid to do so publicly.“We’ve always been accepted by the American government,” Pardo said. One couple ― a Venezuelan and a Cuban ― had traveled from Chile, where they’d lived for the last few years. But, having fled what they viewed as dysfunctional and tyrannical socialist governments, they grew anxious about the rising power of left-wing parties in Chile. They sold their house, quit their jobs, flew to Mexico City and took a 20-hour bus ride to Nuevo Laredo. Friday morning, they stopped for breakfast on their way to the border crossing. They were shocked to hear the TV news report that U.S. immigration authorities were refusing Cubans. The couple ― who declined to be identified by name, citing fears of botching their immigration cases if they attempted to cross ― stood paralyzed for more than hour with their suitcases in the Plaza Juárez, just steps from the bridge. They repeatedly reviewed their options, always reaching the same conclusion: Trying to step across the border wasn’t worth it. Finally, they walked to the bridge with a Mexican relative to ask. In front of the turnstiles, a Mexican security official told them that if they tried to cross, they’d be turned away or taken into custody. “I’m not crossing just to be detained,” the Cuban man said. So the man and woman turned around, and headed to the relative’s house in Torreón, unsure for the moment which country was home. "

If it does, it will not help peace and we hope it does not happen,” Abbas told reporters outside the Vatican gates minutes after 25 minutes of talks with the pope.Abbas, who spoke through an interpreter, stopped in Rome to open the new embassy of the State of Palestine to the Vatican.Trump’s promise to relocate the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would upend decades of U.S. policy. Israel and the Palestinians, who are seeking a state of their own, both claim Jerusalem as their capital. Successive U.S. administrations have said the city’s status must be negotiated.Jerusalem, which Israeli has declared its “united and eternal capital,” is home to sites sacred to Jews, Muslims and Christians.The Vatican, which keeps its embassy to Israel in Jaffa and also backs a two-state solution, implicitly recognized a Palestinian state for years but in 2015 made it official by signing a treaty with the State of Palestine.As he was leaving the pope’s study, Abbas said the opening of the new embassy to the Vatican was “a sign that the pope loves the people of Palestine and loves peace.”In a statement, the Vatican called for a resumption of direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians “to bring an end to the violence that causes unacceptable suffering to civilian populations, and to find a just and lasting solution.”It called for a climate that could lead to “courageous decisions”.In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper on Saturday Abbas said he had written to Trump to warn him against moving the embassy.“Not only would it strip the United States of all its legitimacy to play a role in resolving the conflict, but it would reduce to nothing a two-state solution.”He said the Palestinians would discuss several options on how to respond after consultations with Arab states.“Going back on our recognition of Israel is one of them, but we hope that we won’t get there and will be able to work with the next American administration,” Abbas said.(Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris and Ari Rabinovitch in Jerusalem; Editing by Angus MacSwan an Andrew Heavens)"

14,POLITICS,Donald Trump Poised To Become Misstater In Chief,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-falsehoods-president_us_5879637ee4b09281d0eb0142,The president-elect's propensity for falsehoods looks like it will follow him into the Oval Office.,2017-01-14,President-elect Donald Trump is set to take his proclivity for falsehoods into the Oval Office next week.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587964251200002d00ad784f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Donald Trump told America this week that he had no loans from Russia. That Russian intelligence could not possibly have compromising material about him. That no one on his staff had any contacts with the Russians during the presidential campaign.And after 18 months of listening to him, Americans might be excused if they choose not to believe even a word of it, as the candidate who issued falsehoods at a historic rate will next week find himself the least believed president since Richard Nixon, right from the moment he takes the oath of office.“You don’t want to be accused of lying,” said Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based GOP communications consultant. “But that doesn’t seem to bother Trump.”Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, said voters obviously tolerated Trump’s loose relationship with facts when they went to the polls in November. “Trump comes from a business world where what’s important is: Can you turn a pile of dirt into a tower of steel?”As to whether and how Trump can win back credibility, the question itself might be irrelevant.“Politically it may not matter because if people in general like what he’s getting accomplished and notice improvements in their lives, I don’t think people are going to be too worried about the precision of his language,” said Rick Tyler, a former aide to Trump’s last remaining Republican primary rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. “As long as things are going great, you know: Tell me lies! Tell me lies!”And that, says frequent Trump critic Jay Rosen, is precisely the next president’s plan. “Trump is preparing a presidency that optimizes for a low-trust environment,” said Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University. “The whole premise of ‘winning back credibility’ is off. He’s prepared to govern without credibility. He seeks to profit from maximizing distrust.” Trump through the years has been notoriously willing to say things that are untrue. During a 2007 deposition in a defamation lawsuit he filed because he was angry that the writer had questioned his claimed net worth, Trump repeatedly made statements that proved to be false. He claimed ownership of properties, for example, in which he was either merely licensing the use of his name or was in line to receive a share of future profits. When confronted by lawyers, Trump then argued that, in fact, not having an ownership interest was smarter because it limited his losses.A decade and a half earlier, Trump had taken untruth to a new level, calling a gossip columnist to claim a nonexistent sexual relationship with Italian supermodel Carla Bruni while claiming to be his own nonexistent press aide.The proclivity for falsehoods accompanied Trump into his presidential campaign, as Trump regularly misrepresented facts about ― among many, many other things ― the crime rate, the unemployment rate, the size and strength of the U.S. military, the nature and significance of the balance of trade, Muslims cheering from rooftops on 9/11, self-funding his campaign and the current state of illegal immigration.In a Republican primary debate in the autumn of 2015, Trump claimed he had no idea where a characterization describing rival Marco Rubio as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s personal senator could have come from ― even though the source was his own campaign website. (When confronted on this a few minutes later, Trump responded with 158 words on unrelated topics that failed to address the question.)Then there was the debate in which Trump claimed a strong relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin because he’d been on the same CBS News broadcast with him: “I got to know him very well because we were both on ‘60 Minutes.’ We were stablemates.” Trump later denied knowing him at all. “I don’t know Putin,” he said during the final general election debate 11 months later.Over the span of just days last year, Trump claimed the NFL had sent him a letter complaining of the fall debate schedule (it had not), that the billionaire Koch brothers had wanted to meet with him (they had not) and that he had seen video of pallets of cash sent by the United States being unloaded in Iran (no such video existed). In the case of the invented Iranian cash video, Trump added embellishments describing where and how it had been shot.Trump on a number of occasions during the campaign even said that the father of Cruz had been involved in the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, basing his theory on an article in the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid.Cruz, on the day he lost the Indiana primary that effectively ended his candidacy after months of praising the reality TV star, finally unloaded on Trump. “I’m going to do something I haven’t done before – those of you who follow me around on the campaign trail. I’m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump,” he said to reporters. “This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies. I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory. And he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it.” Trump and his top staff’s casualness with facts has continued after the election and right up through his Wednesday news conference.Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, for example, claimed that Trump had never personally been briefed by U.S. intelligence officials about a privately gathered dossier of his contacts with Russia, including salacious material about Trump’s purported activities with prostitutes in that country. But late Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper essentially confirmed that information about the dossier had been included in his overall briefing last week regarding Russia’s efforts to get Trump elected.Even in the news conference itself, Trump continued his reliance on falsehoods. He claimed, for instance, that 96 million Americans are looking for full-time work but cannot find it ― or nearly one-third of the nation’s entire population. (The real number is less than 6 million.)In the end, his misstatements, even if proved intentional, may not matter. The election is over, and the next one is four years away.What’s more, Republican consultants agreed, enough voters in enough key states decided that Trump’s promise to improve their lives was more important than his personal qualities, including his willingness to dispense untruths.“The tolerance for ambiguity is a function of whether people are satisfied or dissatisfied with the leadership,” said Tyler, the former Cruz aide.And if voters do not see improvement in their lives and wind up dissatisfied?That’s where American’s lack of trust in their new president could prove devastating. A president like Barack Obama, whose personal integrity and honesty were among his strongest features, was able to weather bad times because voters were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, Fleischer said.Trump will not have that to fall back upon should the economy worsen instead of, as he has promised, take off.“If he says things that are not accurate and things haven’t turned around,” Fleischer said, “then the double whammy can set in.”“He’s got a six-month period,” Mackowiak predicted. “He’s either going to be a real success, or he’s going to have real problems.”"

I mean, she’s thrived as a first lady, but it’s not her preference,” he said. “She never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic given how good she is.” Michelle Obama expressed a similar sentiment in an interview with Vogue in November.“The nature of living in the White House is isolating,” she said. “And I think Barack and I — because we’re kind of stubborn — we’ve maintained some normalcy, mostly because of the age of our kids. I go out to dinner with my girlfriends; I go to Sasha’s games; Barack has coached a little basketball with Sasha’s team. But at the same time, when you can’t walk into CVS?”While the family is looking forward to the next stage of their lives, President Obama said it is bittersweet to leave their home of the last eight years. “We just have a lot of memories here,” he said in the “60 Minutes” clip. “Our kids grew up here. Some of our best friends have been made here in this place. There have been moments that were highlights for us that are going to be hard to duplicate.”The Obama family will remain in Washington as Sasha, who is 15, completes high school. Malia is set to attend Harvard in the fall. And both the president and the first lady have said they’ll remain engaged in public life in some way.CBS will air the full “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday, marking the final major network TV interview of Obama’s presidency."

In Washington, where Trump will be sworn in as president in six days, people piled out of buses from as far as New York and North Carolina, and crammed into the pews of a historically black church several blocks north of the White House. About 1,900 people made it inside the Metropolitan AME Church, and another 300 marched around the block in the cold drizzle, according to estimates from organizers. “Are we going back into the shadows?” Cristina Jimenez of United We Dream, one of the advocacy groups that organized the event, asked the crowd inside. “No!” they screamed in response. The event was part of a day of action for immigrants rights that included more than 70 such rallies and meetings nationwide. Some took place outside detention centers, like the one in Broward County, Florida, where undocumented immigrants facing deportation were held inside. Others gathered in restaurants or community centers, where advocates strategized how to protect undocumented communities under Trump. Some were large rallies, like the one in Los Angeles. They all were intended to show resistance to Trump’s promises to expand “deportation forces” aimed at driving out undocumented immigrants, stripping young people of protections, rejecting refugees, banning Muslims from the country, and building a wall on the Mexico border that could impede not just those coming to the U.S. to work, but also those seeking asylum.The protests showed it isn’t solely immigrant communities that will fight back, but also other allies, including other people of color, labor organizations and LGBTQ rights groups. The event was organized by a large coalition of groups: CASA de Maryland, United We Dream, the Center for Community Change/Fair Immigration Reform Movement and the Service Employees International Union. “This is your home,” Metropolitan AME Pastor William H. Lamar IV said while welcoming attendees to the church. “Together we will fight to ensure that the justice that God intends for all of us is enjoyed by all of us.” Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards spoke about the need to fight to protect health care and reproductive rights for people of color and immigrants. “We stand with you and now is the time to link arms in this country and join the fight,” she said. Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), a leader in Congress in the fight for immigration reform, tied immigrant rights to the effort for fair wages, and for justice for women and all people of color.Gutiérrez compared recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and other so-called Dreamers who came to the U.S. as children to “freedom fighters.” He is one of several lawmakers ― Democrats and Republicans ― pushing for a bill called the Bridge Act to extend DACA protections, should Trump follow through on his promise to yank protections from more than 750,000 young people.“We’re building a bridge,” Gutiérrez said. “750,000 young people walk across that bridge, and every time one of them walks across that bridge, they strengthen the bridge.”They will lead the way to reform that helps all 11 million undocumented immigrants, Gutiérrez said. “I hear them, you hear them,” he said, “and we’re going to make sure that Donald Trump hears them.”More images and videos from events around the country:"

DelBene and Jayapal, and women’s health advocates Jan. 14, 2017 at Planned Parenthood. Photo: C. Alderson, The Seattle Lesbian</em> </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a9e2b1700000002fdea7c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, at least this one did - with a 14-month-old. You have to admit, it’s a headline the GOP would have loved to have thought up first.On Saturday, January 14, 2017, I attended a press conference wherein the topic was the GOP’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood along with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The start of the presser was immediately following my daughter’s class at The Little Gym so I did what any working mother in the independent progressive media would do: I buckled her into the car seat while my wife drove us to Planned Parenthood - pumping all the way (yes, sung to the tune of “Jingle Bells” because, quite frankly, there’s a corny Christmas song for just about everything these days). Ironic? Maybe, but I prefer to use the term “appropriate” because, after all, patients of Planned Parenthood are not all there for the one reason GOP lawbreakers (we’ll be frank) would have you believe. In fact, if you truly want background on services offered at Planned Parenthood, check out this handy guide.Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and Representatives Suzan DelBene (WA-01) and Pramila Jayapal (WA-08) joined advocates, patients and supporters of Planned Parenthood inside the building on Madison while protesters waved their “helpful” pamphlets outside near the sidewalk at anyone minding their own business walking nearby because, don’t we all love to be accosted when we’re minding our own business? Meanwhile, my little Harriette the Bunny (if you get this reference we really should connect because “Harry the Bunny” is my daughter Sophia’s world nowadays and, therefore, ours as well) took her place inside the lobby.The main takeaway from the event: women are once again about to become a “pre-existing condition” for the simple act of being born female.“By repealing the Affordable Care Act, Republicans in Congress will strip health care away from thousands of people struggling to make ends meet,” said Jayapal. “If Republicans have it their way, being a woman, once again, will become a pre-existing condition. Women would lose access to preventative care like cancer screenings, birth control and Pap tests. Health care is a fundamental right, not a privilege. Instead of rolling back the progress we’ve made, we should be strengthening and expanding health care to cover all who live in our nation.”Watch the Facebook live video below and also here. “Repealing the Affordable Care Act – with no plan to replace it – will create chaos. This isn’t just my view or Suzan’s view or Pramila’s view – it’s a view shared by the majority of independent experts, including state leaders – from both parties – across the country,” Murray said as she addressed the media. “As if this weren’t enough, extreme Republicans have also announced that they plan to defund Planned Parenthood as part of their effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. It’s shameful. That’s why I sent a very clear message to Republicans this past week: not on my watch and not without a fight.”“House and Senate leaders are working on a dangerous plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip more than 20 million Americans of their health insurance. And if they succeed, it will have devastating consequences for our constituents, particularly women,” DelBene said. “Make no mistake – dismantling it now means being a woman will once again be treated as a pre-existing condition. It will mean fewer options, less access and higher costs for tens of millions of women. What’s worse, Speaker Paul Ryan is also calling for the defunding of Planned Parenthood. We should be building on the progress we’ve made, not turning back the clock. Women deserve better.”As soon as the 115th Congress went into session, Republicans made it clear that they plan to rip apart our health care system, and at the same time defund Planned Parenthood – the nation’s largest provider of women’s health care. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, nearly 30 million Americans stand to lose their coverage. Planned Parenthood serves roughly 2.5 million patients in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and many families rely on Planned Parenthood as their primary source of health care.So, women and men with 14-month-old babes in arms, I have one thing to say: be vigilant. Now is not the time to low the roll; seize every opportunity. If this mother can do it, so can you."

They were goals he knew well, having already conquered the dance world through his Emmy-nominated choreography. The multi-talented Packard says there was one long-time love, though, which took years to tackle.“I have always done lectures and talked about everybody always following their passions and doing what they love,” said Packard. “One of my passions happened to be horror and horror films.”For years, Packard’s love of scary movies took a backseat to other pursuits, namely dance. Told as a child he might never walk again, the Michigan native not only did, he became one of the entertainment industry’s most sought-after choreographers. By the time he landed the VH1 reality series gig as Brooke Hogan’s gay best friend and roommate, his resume was brimming with success. Dubbed a “dancing entrepreneur” by The New York Times, Packard has worked with everyone from Pink and Liza Minnelli to Usher and “The King of Pop” Michael Jackson, for which he earned an Emmy nomination. While reality TV took Packard from behind the scenes to being a recognizable face within the LGBT community, he notes that was nearly a decade ago. Since then, a series of professional experiences – including work on a Bollywood movie – confirmed he was ready to pick up the camera himself.“In Bollywood, they have the choreographer come onset, the director steps back, and the choreographer pretty much directs the whole scene,” he shared on a recent episode of Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl. “That was when I realized I was ready to direct my first film.”WATCH: The Pitchfork Movie TrailerIn 2015, Packard sat down to make his dream a reality. Now 18 months later, Packard is anxious to introduce the world to his creation: Pitchfork. Written in the typical teens-getting-skewered vein of Friday the 13th and Halloween, this film carries a queer twist. After coming out, Hunter (Brian Raetz) invites a group of friends from his New York performing arts school for a weekend with his family. Unbeknownst to either the teens or his parents -- especially his less-than-supportive father -- a maniac is on the loose. With the exception of the rampaging psychopath, Packard says early elements of the film (set in his hometown of Clare, MI, and filmed on his family farm) are semi-autobiographical.“When I sat down with the writer of this film [Darryl F. Gariglio], I had all these ideas in my head. I based a lot of the events on me coming out to my family,” he shared. “I lived in New York City at the time and would always bring my friends back with me to the farm to make me feel a little more comfortable around my dad and mom.”In conversation separate from the podcast, Packard shared how uncomfortable it was coming out in such a small, rural area. He expressed the all-too-common fears of rejection from both his community and family. Those real-life tensions, he said, seemed the perfect cinematic backdrop.“I felt it was a great way to introduce these characters, who are in the right place at the wrong time,” said Packard. “Then you get to see this gay character, that we don’t always get to see in these films, be a strong, confident person by the end.”At its heart, Pitchfork is a first-time director’s nod to many of his core influences growing up. In the beginning, Packard serves a little Footloose, later offers a tongue-in-cheek homage to ‘80s John Hughes films and even sandwiches in a fully-choreographed dance scene. (Keep an eye out for the extra sexy “Rocky,” played by Keith Webb, formerly of Packard’s E! Network series Men of the Strip about a Las Vegas male revue.)“I came from the dance world, so of course my first film -- even if it’s horror -- there’s going to be a dance scene,” Packard acknowledged with a laugh.The real star of the film, though, is the title character. With one hand replaced by – you guessed it! – a pitchfork and sporting an animal-fur mask, “Pitchfork” is alternately childlike and psychotic. He longs for physical contact -- then kills when rejected. He is also shirtless. “I thought about the gay horror fans –- and the female horror fans -– and I have this background in male revue,” Packard explained, “So right away I knew my villain, my slasher, was going to be shirtless.”Actor Daniel Wilkinson manages to make “Pitchfork” both frightening and sympathetic. The product of a twisted upbringing, touched upon at the film’s torture-horror finale (think Saw), Packard assures the character’s backstory will be explored in greater detail as the “franchise” unfolds.The first in a trilogy, though this installment begins with the central character’s sexuality as a key focus early, viewers should certainly not expect a psychological examination of the coming out process. However, Packard notes the LGBT role increased dramatically when shooting Pitchfork.“Hunter’s death was a lot sooner in the film originally,” he shared. “That sort of changed during the 21 days we filmed in Michigan. Does the gay character stay alive or not? I was making those decisions while we were filming.”After considerable thought, Packard came to his conclusion -– one he hopes the queer community appreciates.“He’s really the hero of the film,” Packard stated during an off-air discussion of the film. “That was really important for me, to show that gay people can be strong in a way we are not always represented.”Pitchfork is now available on video-on-demand and other online streaming services.

Now 18 months later, Packard is anxious to introduce the world to his creation: Pitchfork. Written in the typical teens-getting-skewered vein of Friday the 13th and Halloween, this film carries a queer twist. After coming out, Hunter (Brian Raetz) invites a group of friends from his New York performing arts school for a weekend with his family. Unbeknownst to either the teens or his parents -- especially his less-than-supportive father -- a maniac is on the loose. With the exception of the rampaging psychopath, Packard says early elements of the film (set in his hometown of Clare, MI, and filmed on his family farm) are semi-autobiographical.“When I sat down with the writer of this film [Darryl F. Gariglio], I had all these ideas in my head. I based a lot of the events on me coming out to my family,” he shared. “I lived in New York City at the time and would always bring my friends back with me to the farm to make me feel a little more comfortable around my dad and mom.”In conversation separate from the podcast, Packard shared how uncomfortable it was coming out in such a small, rural area. He expressed the all-too-common fears of rejection from both his community and family. Those real-life tensions, he said, seemed the perfect cinematic backdrop.“I felt it was a great way to introduce these characters, who are in the right place at the wrong time,” said Packard. “Then you get to see this gay character, that we don’t always get to see in these films, be a strong, confident person by the end.”At its heart, Pitchfork is a first-time director’s nod to many of his core influences growing up. In the beginning, Packard serves a little Footloose, later offers a tongue-in-cheek homage to ‘80s John Hughes films and even sandwiches in a fully-choreographed dance scene. (Keep an eye out for the extra sexy “Rocky,” played by Keith Webb, formerly of Packard’s E! Network series Men of the Strip about a Las Vegas male revue.)“I came from the dance world, so of course my first film -- even if it’s horror -- there’s going to be a dance scene,” Packard acknowledged with a laugh.The real star of the film, though, is the title character. With one hand replaced by – you guessed it! – a pitchfork and sporting an animal-fur mask, “Pitchfork” is alternately childlike and psychotic. He longs for physical contact -- then kills when rejected. He is also shirtless. “I thought about the gay horror fans –- and the female horror fans -– and I have this background in male revue,” Packard explained, “So right away I knew my villain, my slasher, was going to be shirtless.”Actor Daniel Wilkinson manages to make “Pitchfork” both frightening and sympathetic. The product of a twisted upbringing, touched upon at the film’s torture-horror finale (think Saw), Packard assures the character’s backstory will be explored in greater detail as the “franchise” unfolds.The first in a trilogy, though this installment begins with the central character’s sexuality as a key focus early, viewers should certainly not expect a psychological examination of the coming out process. However, Packard notes the LGBT role increased dramatically when shooting Pitchfork.“Hunter’s death was a lot sooner in the film originally,” he shared. “That sort of changed during the 21 days we filmed in Michigan. Does the gay character stay alive or not? I was making those decisions while we were filming.”After considerable thought, Packard came to his conclusion -– one he hopes the queer community appreciates.“He’s really the hero of the film,” Packard stated during an off-air discussion of the film. “That was really important for me, to show that gay people can be strong in a way we are not always represented.”Pitchfork is now available on video-on-demand and other online streaming services.

21,POLITICS,Trump Is Set To Violate His D.C. Hotel Lease And The Agency Holding It Has No Plan,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-washington-dc-hotel-gsa_us_587947bfe4b0e58057fed977,"“It does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this.""",2017-01-14,"Eric, Donald and Melania Trump cut the ribbon at the grand opening of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58794ad41200002d00ad7813.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When explaining how he would (somewhat) extricate himself from his myriad conflicts of interest this week, President-elect Donald Trump and his tax lawyer completely ignored what would happen to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. It looks like he also failed to discuss that with the government agency that holds the hotel lease.Trump’s deal with the General Services Administration to operate a hotel in the Old Post Office building specifically states that the lease cannot be held by an elected official. And the clock is ticking down to Trump’s inauguration.Yet the GSA released a statement on Wednesday, after the president-elect’s press conference, indicating that it was not aware of his plans for the Trump Organization until he announced them to the public.“GSA understands that an announcement has been made to change the business structure of the Trump Organization,” the agency said in a statement. “We are seeking additional information that explains and describes any new organizational structure as it applies to the Old Post Office lease. Upon receipt, consistent with our treatment of any contract to which we are a party, we will review this new organizational structure and determine its compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.”The agency’s apparent lack of knowledge is “extraordinary,” according to Steven Schooner, a government procurement law professor at George Washington University.“It does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this,” said Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget. “This is a legitimate international scandal and they’re not part of the conversation.”The GSA did not respond to a request for comment.The lease for the D.C. hotel was signed in 2013 and Trump announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. That means the agency has had nearly two years to come up with a plan on what to do if Trump won the presidency. So far, it has refused to state publicly whether it thinks Trump will be in violation of his lease the moment he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.On Wednesday, Trump announced his plans to hand over control of his business to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, while still maintaining his ownership stake. Such an arrangement does little to nothing to resolve any conflicts related to the business. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, called the plan “meaningless” and far short of the steps that every other modern president has taken to eliminate financial conflicts upon taking office.The hotel lease with the GSA clearly states, “No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”Since Trump will keep his ownership in the Trump Organization, he will inevitably remain a beneficiary of the lease.The GSA has another Trump-related problem looming. As president, Trump can and probably will name a new head of the agency. That person will be in charge of annual lease negotiations with the president’s sons.“There’s an imbalance of power,” Schooner previously noted to HuffPost. “In a 60-year, complicated contract, we’re going to ask a civil servant at GSA to negotiate annually with the president’s children.”The fact that the GSA was left out of the loop on Trump’s business plans fits with how the president-elect and his company lawyers have treated the Office of Government Ethics. Shaub has said he lost touch with the Trump team after the election and attempted to get their attention with a stream of tweets calling on the president-elect to fully divest his business holdings.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told HuffPost that he is “very concerned” in light of the latest GSA statement.“I think they were reluctant to give a decision early on,” Cummings said. “In other words, before he violates it.”Cummings added, “We’ll see what happens, I guess, see next Monday after he’s sworn in. I expect that there will be a decision on [Jan. 20].”The GSA’s current silence on the hypothetical violation of the lease is consistent with its past public assertions.Back in December, Cummings and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sent a letter to the agency asking whether it believed Trump would violate the lease agreement if he did not divest his holdings. The letter, released by Cummings, stated that Michael Gelber, deputy commissioner of the GSA’s Public Buildings Service, had said the new president would indeed be in violation.The GSA, however, refused to comment, insisting that it could not make any determination until Trump assumed office.“We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,” the GSA statement said in December. “In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect’s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.”Congressional Republicans have held no hearings on the issue."

They have been the target of police crackdowns and two lawsuits by area residents who say the mostly white and wealthy “trust fund” surfriders have hijacked a Pacific Ocean beach that belongs to everyone.Hawaiian actor and former champion body boarder Christopher Taloa said he was subjected to “gang-style intimidation” and kicked twice in the face when he tried to ride the waves with friends at Palos Verdes Estates three years ago on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.“It’s over. What’s going on was way out of hand and I don’t want to see it going on anymore,” Taloa told the Daily Breeze.So Taloa is heading back to the beach again, this time with supporters to protest the intimidating Bay Boys.He’s aiming for a fun day in the sun, with some people paddling out to the waves and others just enjoying the beach. “We’re going to go out Monday with the intention of enjoying the success of being able to get down there,” said the 43-year-old Los Angeles actor, who has appeared in “Blue Crush,” “Into the Blue” and “Knots.” “We want that to be the main thing. We want to make sure that public access is safe for everyone — not just me, not just those guys, but everyone.”The nonprofit Coastal Protection Rangers, dedicated to protecting public beach access, has been contacting families, community organizations and surfing groups about the event.“The response has been tremendous,” board member Alicia Apostol told the Los Angeles Times.The Rangers and supporters sued Palos Verdes Estates last year and 10 alleged members of the Bay Boys in both state and federal court. The suit characterizes the Bay Boys as a criminal gang and accuses members of threats, vandalism, and assault. It charges that the city has done little to stop it. A court hearing set for Feb. 21 will determine whether the federal case will became a class-action lawsuit, which would allow more people to join the action. After months of pressure from the California Coastal Commission, the city finally demolished a stone-fort clubhouse in early December, which the Bay Boys had illegally constructed on the beach. During the work, unidentified vandals damaged workers’ trucks at night and set fire to an air compressor.The city also recently began to negotiate with park rangers from the Santa Monica Mountain Conservancy for extra patrols.

23,HEALTHY LIVING,New Discovery Sheds Light On The Origins Of Complex Life,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/science-new-bacteria-discovery_us_5877f818e4b0e58057fde3ec,Landmark research sheds light on the origins of complex life.,2017-01-14,Asgard archaea (named after Norse gods) form a group with the eukaryotes. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58791dea120000c301ad7729.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before complex life evolved, 1.7 billion years ago, only single-celled bacteria and archaea existed. Bacteria and archaea ― microorganisms together known as prokaryotes ― represent two of the three basic branches of all life. The third branch is eukaryotes, organisms with more complex cells that comprise the higher forms of life, up to humans. The origin of these complex eukaryotic cells is considered by scientists to be one of the major evolutionary leaps in the history of life on Earth, but how the complex cells evolved from the simple-celled microbes has been something of a mystery.But a recently discovered class of microorganisms, deemed “marvel microbes” for their unique properties, sheds light on the evolutionary transition from simple to complex cells. In a paper published this week in the journal Nature, an international team of microbiologists presented its discovery of a microbe that is more closely related to complex life than any other simple microorganism. “Our new paper tells what our microbial ancestors might have looked like,” Dr. Thijs Ettema, a biologist at Uppsala University in Sweden and the study’s lead author, told The Huffington Post. “We humans are eukaryotes, and our cells are big and complex. In contrast, the cells of bacteria and archaea are tiny and simple. The main question is how the big and complex cells of eukaryotes have evolved from the smaller and simpler prokaryotic cells.”The findings build on previous work from famed American microbiologist Carl Woese, who showed that eukaryotes evolved from archaea. The two types of organisms shared a common ancestry, but how the eukaryotes evolved into complex life from small, simple cells was unknown. The new study details the discovery of a new group of archaea, the Asgard archaea, which provide insight on how eukaryotes evolved. Asgard archaea microbes fall into one of four known lineages, named after Norse gods. They’re typically found in environments such as the sea floor, river sediments, lakes and hot springs. What’s unusual about Asgard archaea is that while they are prokaryotes, just like bacteria and archaea, they have several eukaryotic genes in their genome, which suggests we may have evolved from these microbes. “[Asgard archaea] represent a sister group of eukaryotes in the tree of life,” Etterma said. “In addition to that, their genomes contain a lot of important eukaryotic genes. Altogether, the discovery of these Asgard archaea tells us that eukaryotes, and hence humans as well, share a common ancestry.”These “microbial cousins,” as he puts it, already contained certain genes that later became important in the process of eukaryotic cells to become as complex as humans are today. The fact that Asgard archaea share several genes with more complex life forms suggests that their cells may feature something similar to the structures that make eukaryotes complex, only more simplified. To be sure, scientists need to conduct further research, putting their cells under a microscope for the first time.“These organisms are our closest microbial relatives, and we know next to nothing about them,” Ettema said in a statement. “Current methods allow us to take a first genetic sneak peek. It is really exciting!’’"

After her tragic death in December, many were unsure whether Fisher’s best-remembered character, Leia Organa, would live on in future films. The actress, who originated the princess in 1977, brought Leia back to the big screen as a general in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in 2015. She was rumored to have a larger role in the latest trilogy’s second two films, presenting a challenge to those at the helm of the franchise. Now, Lucasfilm is putting to rest the rumors that Fisher would be digitally recreated in future films.“We don’t normally respond to fan or press speculation, but there is a rumor circulating that we would like to address,” Lucasfilm said in a statement posted on the Star Wars website Friday. “We want to assure our fans that Lucasfilm has no plans to digitally recreate Carrie Fisher’s performance as Princess or General Leia Organa.“Carrie Fisher was, is, and always will be a part of the Lucasfilm family. She was our princess, our general, and more importantly, our friend. We are still hurting from her loss. We cherish her memory and legacy as Princess Leia, and will always strive to honor everything she gave to ‘Star Wars.’”Fisher died on Dec. 27 at age 60, a few days after she was stricken with a heart attack while on a flight from London to Los Angeles. She reportedly filmed her scenes for “Star Wars: Episode VIII” before her death.The Hollywood Reporter previously reported that a “Star Wars” brain trust was considering how best to proceed with Leia’s story. The team reportedly was discussing resurrecting Fisher with CGI effects, as they did with the late Peter Cushing in “Rogue One,” or writing her character out of the third film in the trilogy altogether. Filming for “Star Wars: Episode IX” won’t begin until early 2018, so there’s time to fittingly pay tribute to Fisher. Now, we’re confident they’re moving in the right direction. “Star Wars: Episode VIII” hits theaters Dec. 15, 2017."

And just 2 percent of Russian victims of domestic abuse report attacks to police.Now, the country has just passed a bill that would decriminalize some forms of domestic violence, enraging rights groups who say the measure will leave abuse victims even more vulnerable.The bill ― known as the “slapping law” ― passed an initial hurdle in the Duma legislative body. It would eliminate criminal penalties for first offenses or attacks that occur only once a year in which a woman or child is not “seriously” injured.The measure’s major proponent, arch conservative senator Yelena Mizulina, has said the current penalties are “anti-family” and a “baseless intervention into family affairs,” CNN reports.“Battery carried out towards family members should be an administrative offense,” she told her colleagues in the Duma. “You don’t want people to be imprisoned for two years and labelled a criminal for the rest of their lives for a slap.”The Russian Orthodox Church also backs the bill, which its leaders see as in line with its patriarchal view demanding a man’s wife and children’s absolute submission to him.The bill applies to violent actions that cause injuries but don’t require hospital treatment or require sick leave from work for the victim, according to one of its authors, the BBC reports.Under the measure a first (or infrequent) offense would not be considered criminal and punishment would be limited to a fine or community service. Women and anti-violence activists say the measure invites an open season of violence on abused women and children. Activist Alena Popova has launched a petition on change.org that demands the Duma pass a completely new law against domestic violence. It had garnered nearly 180,000 signatures by Saturday morning.Novaya Gazeta journalist Olga Bobrova has noted that many violent assaults may not require hospitalization or event leave marks on a victim’s body, but can still “transform her life into a living hell.” She said that domestic violence is a normal way of life in Russia. There’s a saying in the country that “If he beats you, it means he loves you,” notes the Moscow Times.Some 36,000 women are beaten by their husbands daily, the state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. In 2008 the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs stated that two-thirds of all homicides in Russia were attributable to household or domestic confrontations.The controversial bill breezed through its first reading — 368 to 1, with one abstention. It will next go through a second and third reading and be voted on again."

Martin Luther King Jr., who led the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and ’60s.The city quickly responded to the backlash on Facebook, initially claiming that it was using the holiday name that was officially designated by the state. (This claim could not be verified by The Huffington Post.) They also pointed out that the city celebrates MLK Day every year with city-sponsored events and parades that honor King, all of which are clearly promoted on their website and social media pages.“Here in Biloxi, we embrace cultural diversity,” Vincent Creel, the city’s public affairs manager, told The Huffington Post on Friday. “In fact, in the same Facebook page and Twitter account that everybody’s talking about, we’re touting our MLK Day celebration.”Biloxi Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich also defended the city, saying that he is not opposed to the federal holiday’s original name. Creel attempted to distance Biloxi from some of Mississippi’s racial tension, pointing out that, every year, the state of Mississippi legally designates the third Monday in January a state holiday that honors the birthdays of both King and Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general.“For whatever reason, the state couldn’t bring itself to just say ‘Martin Luther King Jr. Day,’” Creel said of the state’s inclusion of Lee in the holiday. “Somewhere along the lines, that evolved into ‘Great Americans Day,’ unfortunately. And yes, I did say ‘unfortunately.’”After some research on Friday evening, Creel discovered some unsettling news about his city: Biloxi’s own City Council was actually involved in erasing King’s name from the state holiday.Two years after the U.S. government designated MLK Day a federal holiday in 1983, the city of Biloxi legally renamed the state holiday to “Great Americans Day,” as revealed in the recorded minutes of a 1985 City Council meeting posted on the city’s website.But the backlash may do some good for the city.Gilich issued a news release late Friday requesting that the City Council change the name of the holiday back to Martin Luther King Jr. Day.“That is the appropriate step to take for the holiday to have the same name as the federal holiday,” Gilich said in the news release. “The city’s longstanding support of our annual MLK celebrations speaks volumes about our support for this holiday.”When asked why the city’s social media manager did not just use the holiday’s formal name in the first place, Creel said they were just following their code of ordinances and they were not trying to belittle the federal holiday.“It was an innocuous little thing letting people know that city offices will be closed on Monday,” Creel told HuffPost. Now, he added, “we are being unfairly characterized. This is going viral in a way that’s unfair.”Still, some Biloxi residents were not pleased with the city’s tweet. “It makes the entire state look bad,” one person wrote on the city’s Facebook page in response to the mayor’s news release. Others called for the original posts to be deleted.Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama are the only states that celebrate Lee’s birthday along with King’s. "
27,POLITICS,The Republican Obsession With Dismantling Social Security And Medicare,"Nancy Altman, ContributorPresident, Social Security Works",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-republican-obsession-with-dismantling-social-security_us_587a4bb9e4b077a19d180e11,Today’s Republicans want to avoid political accountability by destroying Social Security and Medicare without leaving clear fingerprints.,2017-01-14,"<p>Congressional Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep. Tom Price</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587a4ce31200002008ad790b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Republicans are desperate to destroy Social Security and Medicare. These two programs demonstrate government at its best. The federal government runs these two extremely popular programs more efficiently, universally, securely, and effectively than the private sector does with its alternatives — or indeed could, no matter how well those private sector programs were designed. Because Social Security and Medicare are government programs that work so well, the Republican elite — with its seemingly religious belief that the private sector is always the best — hates them. So obsessed are the Republicans in their desire to eliminate these effective government programs that the very first action that House Republicans took in the new Congress was to adopt a rules package that included a new rule that amounts to a stealth attack on Social Security and Medicare.The rules package, adopted at the start of every new Congress, sets out how the chamber will operate for the next two years. This year’s package is already infamous for provisions in the initial version that would have gutted the Office of Congressional Ethics — provisions that were ultimately dropped after a massive outcry from the American people. Unnoticed by most was an additional provision, which is one part of the Republican game plan to destroy Social Security and Medicare.Social Security — the people’s pension — and Medicare — the first step toward universal health insurance for all — do not go through the appropriations process because, as monthly pension payments and medical insurance, they must pay what is owed, not what Congress chooses to spend. If Social Security and Medicare were subject to the whims of every Congress, they would be radically transformed. No one could count on the benefits they had earned. Presumably with that goal in mind, the new rules require the relevant committees to make “recommendations for changes to existing law for moving [unspecified} programs…from mandatory funding to discretionary appropriations, where appropriate.”Note the vague language. Republican politicians understand how popular Social Security and Medicare are. Yet they desperately want to destroy the programs, which put the lie to their anti-government agenda by illustrating clearly that there are some tasks that government does much better then the private sector. The solution? Cut and radically transform Social Security and Medicare, but do it in a manner that avoids political accountability. Using changes in the arcane rules of the budget to force through subsequent cuts fits that bill perfectly. By the time the American people realize what’s happening, the rules that usher in the changes are in the past, and those voting for the cuts can claim that they have no choice, for budgetary reasons. The rule that has been adopted was telegraphed shortly after the election when Representative Tom Price, Chairman of the House Budget Committee and Donald Trump’s nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, proposed changes to the budget rules, which, if enacted, would end Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as we know them. (As an aside, it is horrifying to know that, if confirmed, Price will be in direct control of Medicare and Medicaid, and will be a trustee of Social Security.)Not only are today’s Republicans obsessed, they are wily. Price, Speaker Paul Ryan, and their fellow Republicans have, unfortunately, learned from President George W. Bush’s failure to convince the American people to dismantle Social Security. Unpopular as the Bush proposal was, he traveled the country to convince the American people that they should support it. In stark contrast, today’s Republicans want to avoid political accountability by destroying Social Security and Medicare without leaving clear fingerprints. They favor arcane budget rules and fast-tracked, undemocratic procedures so that the American people don’t know what is happening. We cannot let that happen.It is essential that an energized electorate with heightened awareness makes noise at every turn. The next four years are perilous ones for Social Security and Medicare. But if they survive the unrelenting attacks, brighter times may well lie ahead. In the last few years, we’ve seen the Democratic Party, led by visionaries including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, unite around expanding, not cutting Social Security. Meanwhile, Republican politicians and elites have continued to support cutting benefits and ultimately destroying both programs. Historically, Social Security and Medicare have been winning issues for Democrats. They can be now, as well. In addition to expanding, not cutting Social Security, Democrats should forcefully advocate expanding, not cutting, Medicare. Furthermore, Democrats should challenge Republicans when they claim the programs are in need of “saving.” Republican claims that they are simply seeking to save Social Security and Medicare is the same Orwellian language used during the Vietnam War, when a military officer claimed that a village had to be destroyed in order to save it. Similarly, when today’s Republicans talk of “saving” Social Security and Medicare, their plans are to destroy both programs.And when Republicans talk about “fixing” Social Security and Medicare, Democrats should point out that Republicans are using the word “fix” the same way veterinarians do, when they talk about neutering dogs and cats. The reality is that Social Security and Medicare don’t need fixing. They can and should be expanded, but they work fine, having stood the test of time. And, most assuredly, neither Social Security nor Medicare need saving. Indeed, both programs are solutions to a looming retirement income crisis, a broken health care system, and income and wealth inequality. Expanding them would allow them to be even better solutions to these and other challenges facing the nation.If Democrats are successful in making the American public aware that the Republicans desire to steal their earned Social Security and Medicare benefits, Social Security and Medicare could well be a potent issue in 2018, when seniors vote in disproportionately large numbers. If, in 2018 and 2020, seniors and others vote for progressives who champion expanding, not cutting, Social Security and Medicare, we will be in a position to expand these vital programs. Moreover, we will have elected champions of the environment, civil and human rights, and so many other important causes that those who support expanding Social Security and Medicare also support. For that to happen, Democrats must be united in their fight against all Social Security and Medicare cuts and all stealth efforts to accomplish the same result indirectly. The Democratic Party must stand clearly and forcefully in favor of expanding, not cutting, Social Security and Medicare. If the Democratic Party can draw a clear distinction on this vital issue, it can create a powerful wedge between the Republican elites and their base. If the base catches on and realizes who truly represents their economic interests, the next four years, difficult as they are going to be, will be followed by important progress for many years to come."

Keith Kempenich introduced would exempt drivers from liability if they accidentally hit a pedestrian, according to the Bismarck Tribune. House Bill 1203 was written up in direct response to groups of protesters blocking roadways, Kempenich told the paper. He claims protesters were seen jumping out in front of vehicles.“It’s shifting the burden of proof from the motor vehicle driver to the pedestrian,” Kempenich said. “They’re intentionally putting themselves in danger.”He admits that the law might be used in cases that don’t involve protests. But a few casualties of justice are apparently worth it; his bill would mitigate instances when panicked drivers might have accidentally “punched the accelerator rather than the brakes” as protesters blocked the roads.Other new bills would be a thorn in the side of protesters and the federal government. One measure would make it a crime for adults to wear masks nearly across the board, while another would allow the state to sue the federal government over millions in extra police costs, according to ABC News.At this point, it’s unclear whether any of these measures stand a chance, and there’s no committee hearing set for HB1203. It might be crazy to think they’re anything more than posturing, dissenters say.“Knee-jerk legislation often is poor legislation,” Democratic state Rep. Marvin Nelson told ABC News.The Dakota Access protests have cost the state more than $22 million and locals are reportedly upset over the rise in crime in the area ― police have arrested nearly 600 people in the region since August.UPDATE: The North Dakota state House voted against the bill, 50-41, on Feb. 13."

Pence has been criticized for a variety of reasons recently, but one area that deserves more attention is his environmental racism.In February last year, the drinking water in Greentown, Indiana tested high in lead. Governor Pence responded immediately to aid the community, and even compared the situation in Greentown to Flint, Michigan's lead crisis. Within two months, the problem had been remedied, and the Greentown residents were back to drinking clean water.Now, let's compare Pence's response to Greentown to his response to another Indiana town, which sits on the shore of Lake Michigan: East Chicago. In June of 2016, the mayor of East Chicago ordered the relocation of the residents of the West Calumet Housing Complex due to lead contamination. The testing of the soil revealed what may be the highest levels ever found in the country. The housing complex had been built on the site of a defunct lead smelter and close to other lead smelting operations. It was eventually revealed that the problem had been known to both city officials and the EPA for decades, yet residents were not warned and nothing was done to protect them or their children. Recently, it was discovered that East Chicago's drinking water is also contaminated with lead. To understand the relative scale of the problem, the water in Greentown was found to be 20 parts per billion. The EPA considers 15 parts per billion to be ""elevated"". In contrast, the soil in East Chicago showed lead levels over 91,000 parts per million (ppm). The EPA's limit is 400 ppm limit, at which point a cleanup is supposed to be triggered. That's 227 times the level at which a cleanup is required! (Testing also showed dangerously elevated levels of arsenic.) Testing of the blood of the children in the area revealed lead levels as high as 33 micrograms per deciliter. Five micrograms is considered ""acceptable"". (There is no safe level of lead in the body, even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect I.Q.) Over 20% of the children under age 7 were shown to have elevated lead levels (over 5 micrograms), compared to 2% nationally.  (Residents of West Calumet Housing Complex, East Chicago, IN)In spite of the scale and urgency of the situation, Governor/soon-to-be-Vice-President Pence has not acted to help the citizens of East Chicago like he did the citizens of Greentown. Governor Pence did not come to East Chicago, Indiana, like he did to Greentown. And he has had nothing to say the people of East Chicago about their plight, like he did for the citizens of Greentown. Now, why would this be? Why would Governor Pence act so quickly and decisively and effectively in response to a relatively low-level lead contamination in Greentown, but remain so conspicuously silent in response to the historic crisis in East Chicago?The answer is to be found in the demographics of the two communities. Greentown's population of 2,400 is 97% white. In contrast, the over 28,000 residents of East Chicago, Indiana are 43% African American and 51% Hispanic or Latino.This is what is called environmental racism. Environmental racism is the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color. As Jacqueline Patterson, NAACP Director of Environmental Climate Justice Program, has explained recently in response to the East Chicago crisis:""This is too frequent, these hazardous contaminations occurring within black, brown, and vulnerable communities, it is a systemic pattern I see across the nation. This challenge must be addressed at the root of the socio-economic and political underpinnings of these types of systemic inequities that disproportionately impact communities of color and low income communities.""Like Flint, Michigan, the city of East Chicago, Indiana is a perfect example of environmental racism. Racism, in the form of  ""white flight"", redlining by banks, and discriminatory housing laws, explains the depressed economic conditions which now prevail in East Chicago and other lakefront Indiana communities like Gary. Racism explains why communities of color like East Chicago and Flint are forced to bear the brunt of the environmental damage caused by dirty industries, which the rest of us benefit from without paying the real cost. Racism explains the failure of the EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to act in any meaningful way to protect the citizens of East Chicago for decades. Racism explains the lack of public outrage when we learn that people of color and their children are being poisoned by lead and arsenic and that those charged with protecting them did nothing. ... And racism explains the silence and inaction of our soon-to-be Vice President, Mike Pence. This is the new face of racism--new in the sense that whites are beginning to acknowledge it, though it has been going on a very long time. This face of racism does not wear a white hat or shout the N-word. This ""new"" racism is covert and systemic. It wears the face of benevolent superiority and operates behind the closed doors of boardrooms and congressional chambers--but it is no less deadly. Though the form it has assumed may be unfamiliar to some, it is the same racism. Though it may seem innocuous to those not directly affected by it, it is insidious for those that are. And it has decimated generations of our black and brown brothers and sisters and their innocent children.The fight against environmental racism and other forms of systemic racism can begin by calling our elected leaders to account. And we should start with Vice President-elect Pence."

That’s exactly when I needed it most.,2017-01-13,"Alia Shawkat's character spends many late-night hours in front of her laptop trying to piece together the conspiracy behind her acquaintance's disappearance in ""Search Party.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5877ebae120000c301ad7461.png?cache=QDtw12A6IK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When the TBS show “Search Party,” a dark detective sitcom starring Alia Shawkat, dropped in November, I wasn’t paying much attention ― this, despite the fact that I’d been intrigued for months by the unsettling trailers. In the pre- and post-election madness, I’d become a cable news junkie and, alternately, switched off the TV entirely and retreated with stacks of books. Turns out, this was a mistake. During a month when I was trying to figure out what had happened to my country, how it had become so obsessed with imagined pedophile rings run out of D.C.-area pizza parlors and millions of undocumented immigrants voting in California (didn’t happen), “Search Party” would have been the perfect fictional chaser to all those hours with The Washington Post and New York Times. It’s a show for an age of conspiracy theorists and amateur gumshoes, a jagged-edged sitcom that tries to unravel the psychological roots and painful consequences of our yearning for morbid puzzles.Of course, politics never overtly enters the picture. “Search Party” takes, as its subject, another zeitgeisty genre: amateur detection. Self-effacing Dory (Shawkat), who channels a hipster ‘50s vibe with her subdued curly bob and boxy blouses, lives with her uptight boyfriend, Drew (John Reynolds), in New York. They’re a few years out of college, but Dory is adrift, working as a personal assistant to a wealthy, dysfunctional housewife while occasionally making noises about pursuing a job mentoring underprivileged girls. One day, she spots a missing poster with a familiar face: Chantal Witherbottom, a girl she recognizes from her college dorm, has vanished. When Dory brings up Chantal’s disappearance at brunch with Drew and friends, they’re dismissive. Chantal, they recall, kind of sucked. Anyway, they doubt she’s really in danger. Dory’s besties Elliott (John Early) and Portia (Meredith Hagner) barely notice her new preoccupation with Chantal’s case as they toggle through social media feeds, where they’re absorbed in the maintenance of their own manicured self-images ― the former, as a gay cancer survivor who’s launching a charity water bottle startup; the latter, as an adorable blond actress starring as a Latina detective on a new procedural. But Dory can’t let it go. As she pursues apparent leads, shows up uninvited at the Witherbottom family’s vigil for Chantal, gets caught up in a Brooklyn boutique-based cult, and partners up with a dissolutely handsome private detective, Keith (Ron Livingston), her relationships suffer. In her quest to save Chantal ― an unlikely outcome at best ― Dory inflicts irreparable damage on everyone around her, and even on herself. In the horrifying finale (SPOILER!), she and her now-estranged boyfriend accidentally bludgeon to death Keith, with whom she had an affair but had come to believe was her stalker. Immediately thereafter, Portia arrives on the scene with the missing woman herself, who confesses glibly that she had simply run away and dropped contact with her loved ones after a bad breakup. The show ends there, with Dory in the bloody wreckage of her own botched self-investigation of a non-crime with a non-victim at its center. The only damage that has been caused, in the end, was caused by her own paranoia and recklessness.This narrative undoubtedly skewers the recklessness of the amateur detective trend, both in fiction and in reality (think Redditors regrettably and incorrectly fingering Sunil Tripathi, a missing student, as a suspect in the Boston bombings), but it’s also an indictment of a paranoid, hair-triggered approach to the world that’s hardly restricted to crime-solving forums. When a presidential candidate promises to jail his opponent on unspecified charges during a debate, or when a man with a gun shows up at a pizza parlor to “self-investigate” rumors of a candidate’s child sex ring, or even when the media is rocked by thinly sourced assertions that the president-elect might have had sex workers in Russia perform a golden shower for him, it seems our political arena has become little more than another theater for conspiracy theorizing and distracting dramatics.How different, really, is the allure of true crime mystery from that of a conspiracy theory? It’s been argued that the crime genre’s allure lies, in part, in its ability to grant a comforting order to the universe ― the hero vs. the villain, the mystery followed by the answer. In a rather crotchety 1944 essay, critic Edmund Wilson suggested that the popularity of the detective story at the time was due to ...“an all-pervasive feeling of guilt and by a fear of impending disaster which it seemed hopeless to try to avert because it never seemed conclusively possible to pin down the responsibility. Who had committed the original crime and who was going to commit the next one? [...] Nobody seems guiltless, nobody seems safe; and then, suddenly, the murderer is spotted, and — relief! — he is not, after all, a person like you or me. He is a villain [...] and he has been caught by an infallible Power, the supercilious and omniscient detective, who knows exactly how to fix the guilt.”Though today’s crime dramas are more often souped up with an amateur element, allowing the reader to put him- or herself in the infallible shoes of the somehow omniscient detective, the psychology still rings true.Dory herself manifests both the guilt and the fear; she’s terrified that she’s just like Chantal, a pending victim who will be instantly forgotten, and she feels driven to place herself on the side of justice, instead, by becoming the lost girl’s savior. Her search party, her ex-boyfriend Julian (Brandon Micheal Hall) points out early on, is not really about Chantal ― it’s about Dory’s own lack of control over her life and her thirst for attention. “I think you’ve decided this matters to you because you have nothing else,” he tells her bluntly.Conspiracy theories play into this same psychological need for control over an unpredictable and frightening cosmos. Many recent conspiracy theories are political; as the country becomes more partisan, the opponents to the party in power tend to respond with conspiracy theories that restore sense to the world as they know it. Donald Trump rose to political popularity through championing the birther conspiracy theory, which held that President Obama could be unseated from office because he was not born in America ― a relatively quick-seeming fix to the Obama presidency, for his most rabid opponents. Trump ultimately, and reluctantly, disavowed birtherism, but he became the conspiracy theory president. During his campaign, he retweeted racially charged fake crime statistics. At rallies, he repeatedly proclaimed, “I alone can fix it.” It’s the sort of self-aggrandizing appropriation of the hero role that makes amateur sleuthing and running for president alike so ego-boosting and comforting: You’re taking control, making sure you’re on the side of good rather than the villain or the victim.This desperate need to feel worthy and necessary might initially seem understandable, and even innocuous ― in certain settings. Dory’s meddling on “Search Party” appears fairly well-intentioned and mild, at least at first. Of course, inserting herself into a stranger’s life, with little understanding of the situation and the effect she might have, is hardly a harmless hobby. The final result of her quest strikingly resembles a scene that actually took place shortly after “Search Party” premiered: the above-mentioned Pizzagate believer’s ill-fated attempt to search the basement of Comet Ping Pong for a pedophile ring run by Hillary Clinton’s associates.That horrifying event, also motivated by a misplaced sense of heroism and resulting in (near) tragedy, shared another notable characteristic with Dory’s quest ― it couldn’t have happened without a staggering surplus of confirmation bias, which, in brief, is the tendency to seek out, notice and interpret information in a way that reinforces one’s existing hypotheses. Pizzagate, like many other debunked yet persistent conspiracies, rests on slender coincidences, oddities and manufactured or distorted evidence that proponents focus on to the exclusion of clear and convincing proof to the contrary. Usually, this is because they already believe involved parties ― in this case, Hillary Clinton and her associates, one of whom owns the pizza parlor in question ― are corrupt and evil. Likewise, many on the left have been troublingly frenzied for details about Trump’s alleged golden shower party, recently reported upon by several outlets, the actual evidence for which looks mighty shaky. Caught up in her own neuroses and fears, Dory, too, latches on to the smallest scraps of evidence that she’s working on the side of good, easily ignoring or discarding any evidence to the contrary. If given two possible paths, she’ll always pursue the line of inquiry that confirms her original, outlandish theory ― even if, at each turn, her suspicions lead her absurdly awry. She’s still convinced, somehow, that she’s right, that she’s the hero, and that she will be vindicated.Doggedly pursuing an imagined problem might seem to be merely wasted effort, but it can turn into something sinister. When fighting a great evil, extreme measures might appear justified; if that evil is fabricated, distorted or imagined, then the collateral damage from the extreme measures taken to destroy it remains real. Thankfully, the appearance of a gunman at Comet Ping Pong didn’t result in any casualties, but lives were put at risk by a debunked conspiracy theory. Parents of Sandy Hook victims have been put through unspeakable emotional suffering due to harassment by “truthers” who believe the mass shooting was a false flag operation by the government and that the grieving family members are actors. By the time Dory’s investigation has completed, the body count of her quest exceeds that of the original crime she set out to rectify. In seeking to make herself a superhero, she’s made herself a monster.“Search Party” couldn’t be more timely and razor-sharp, capturing, in its noir spoof of a crime drama, a sharp satire of our true crime obsessions, conspiracy theory addictions and weakness for political sideshows, as well. Throughout the arc of the season, the seductive tropes of the mystery and true crime genres are exploded and revealed for the farce they are, mere pleasing visions that allow each of us to imagine ourselves the heroic protagonist rather than someone who would fuck it all up if we stepped in. Conspiracy theories and crime shows let us imagine that we are capable, not culpable. As the show slowly reveals, humans can wreak untold damage when our self-perceived goodness and guiltlessness, rather than the actual effects of our actions, consume us.You can be highbrow. You can be lowbrow. But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Sign up to receive it in your inbox weekly."

Elijah Cummings, D-Md., center, accompanied by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., right, and Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 12, 2017 to discuss President-elect Donald Trump's conflicts of interest and ethical issues.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587812ef1200002d00ad74f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President-elect Donald Trump’s decision to keep his ownership in his business, creating a multitude of conflicts of interest while he sits in the Oval Office, has so far drawn no critical response from Republicans in Congress. Democrats on Thursday began to show what they’ll do about it. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) signed by all House ranking committee members asking him to “join us in fulfilling our sworn constitutional duty by seeking and obtaining copies” of all relevant documents related to Trump’s business empire.Cummings’ letter seeks Trump’s personal and corporate tax returns for the past five years, documents referenced by Trump and his tax lawyer at Wednesday’s press conference, corporate charters, balance sheets and income statements from the past five years, and documents that would help Congress protect against violations of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bars most foreign payments to government officials.“We must do our job,” Cummings said at a news conference explaining the letter. “We must obtain documents of President[-elect] Trump’s vast global entanglements. In other words, we don’t even know what he owns. We don’t know what he owes money to.”He added: “We want the speaker to join us in doing our job under the Constitution ― to act as a check.”The letter and news conference underscored the position that Democrats find themselves in as Trump prepares to take power as a walking, talking conflict of interest. They are in the minority in both chambers of Congress. They control no committees. They have no subpoena power. If they want any congressional oversight of Trump, they’ll need help from Republicans.So far, that hasn’t materialized. Ryan has not commented on Trump’s unprecedented business arrangement, deferring to Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). Chaffetz has said that he won’t be a “cheerleader” for Trump, but won’t hold any hearings until after the inauguration. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House and Senate are plotting how they can best pressure Trump to do what bipartisan ethics advisers say he should do ― divest his conflicting business holdings. This inevitably will involve getting congressional Republicans on the record on various pieces of legislation.Cummings, from his perch as the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, is the leader of House Democrats on the issue. He has sent multiple letters to Chaffetz calling for hearings on Trump’s conflicts. In December, he held a shadow hearing that featured Norm Eisen, Obama’s former ethics adviser; Richard Painter, former ethics adviser to President George W. Bush; and Stephen Gillers, a New York University ethics professor. All testified with recommendations, which Trump failed to take.Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.), the leading House proponent of campaign-finance and ethics reforms, will lead House Democrats’ Democracy Task Force. In the last Congress, the task force focused on discussion and promotion of campaign-finance, lobbying and ethics reforms, and was led by former Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.). Sarbanes will continue those efforts, while expanding the task force as an organizing body for Democrats responding to Trump’s conflicts.“We’re going to kind of keep Trump and his crowd ― keep their feet to the fire on this,” Sarbanes told The Huffington Post.The task force will act as a main hub of information about Trump’s business conflicts for Democratic members on oversight committees. The task force also will help Democratic lawmakers craft messaging that connects issues related to Trump’s conflicts with the GOP agenda. For example, Democrats will show how Republican efforts to gut the Dodd-Frank financial reform law could benefit Wall Street and foreign banks that Trump owes huge debts to.Democrats also plan to force Republicans to take a position on legislation that would make Trump and future presidents more accountable to the public by requiring the divestment of conflicting assets and the disclosure of tax returns. Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) is the chief sponsor of a key measure that would do this.“Every Democrat and every Republican should want to eliminate the uncertainty and promote accountability within the executive branch,” Clark said at Thursday’s news conference with Cummings. “We invite our colleagues to work with us together.”In the Senate, Democrats plan a similar effort. Their leader is Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has introduced legislation identical to Clark’s. After Trump announced his plan for his business on Wednesday, Warren took to Twitter to call it “a joke” that “puts us all at risk.”Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, put out a statement joined by Warren and six other Democrats, declaring, “every tweet, statement, meeting, policy, executive order, bill signing, or other decision will present a fresh opportunity for President-elect Trump to line his pockets at the expense of the American people.”The plan in the Senate will begin to take shape when the next budget reconciliation comes up. Democrats said they will force votes on amendments aimed at ending Trump’s conflicts of interest and requiring more disclosure. This would most likely include a vote on Warren’s legislation.Senate Democrats also will look for ways that businesses or citizens could bring legal challenges to Trump’s operation of his businesses, and for cases Democrats can support with legal briefs. This could be a rival hotel company claiming it lost business due to an unfair advantage Trump’s hotels have gained by his presidency. It could be citizens challenging a favorable local government action for a Trump golf course. Or it could be a rival vintner challenging government approval of foreign workers for Trump’s winery.Finally, Senate Democrats are looking for ways to get executive branch inspectors general and the General Accounting Office to investigate potential conflicts or wrongdoing in government actions related to Trump’s businesses. Cummings said on Thursday that a letter that he and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) sent the Department of Justice inspector general prompted the new investigation into the FBI’s handling of its Hillary Clinton email probe.Cummings blamed Trump for putting Democrats in this position. “I wish we would not have to do this, but President-elect Trump has now made his decision and his decision has made this necessary,” he said.He added: “It is up to us to act as an independent check on the executive branch.”"

Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed to run - guilty as hell,” Trump wrote on Twitter.“They were VERY nice to her. She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states - no enthusiasm!”Trump had often led crowds in chants of “lock her up!” during the 2016 election campaign, accusing Clinton of illegal conduct over her use of a private email server for official correspondence while she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama.In a debate in October, the Republican real estate developer vowed Clinton would “be in jail” over the matter if he became president, but later said he would not pursue prosecution.Some of the Clinton emails were determined to contain classified information. The FBI ultimately decided not to refer her case for prosecution.Democrats said FBI Director James Comey’s announcement of the new inquiry into the emails damaged her standing with voters right before the election, and he faced complaints that his moves were politically motivated.Brian Fallon, Clinton’s spokesman, told MSNBC on Thursday that Comey’s actions “cried out for an independent review.”Senator Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the U.S. Senate said Comey’s statements were not “fair, professional or consistent with the policies of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”Comey said on Thursday the FBI would cooperate fully with the investigation.Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, will not have the power to dismiss the investigation. Federal law permits U.S. presidents to dismiss inspectors general for federal agencies, as long as the president provides Congress a written justification for the removal 30 days in advance.(Reporting by Washington Newsroom; Editing by Bernadette Baum)"

But instead of asking the ethics chief how to fix Trump’s plan, House Republicans have their own idea: Threaten the ethics official.Walter Shaub, the head of the OGE, is “blurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, wrote in a sternly worded letter to Shaub Thursday. Chaffetz, the Republican who announced last year that he wouldn’t be able to look his daughter in the eye if he endorsed Trump and then went on to vote for Trump, demanded that Shaub show up for a private interview on Capitol Hill as soon as possible — or else face a subpoena forcing him to do so. “He’s coming in,” Chaffetz told Politico. “This is not going to be an optional exercise.”Chaffetz noted in the letter that his committee has the power to reauthorize the ethics office. What Chaffetz didn’t have to say is that his committee could also push to shutter the office entirely. Earlier this month, House Republicans tried to gut another ethics watchdog, the Office of Congressional Ethics, before backing down.Chaffetz is trying to punish Shaub for criticizing Trump, Richard Painter, former President George W. Bush’s ethics lawyer, told The New York Times Thursday.“They are strong-arming them,” Painter said. “They are obviously very upset the Office of Government Ethics is leaning on Trump and not willing to jam through his nominees. It is political retaliation.” Democrats, who have been pushing the Republican-run Congress to investigate Trump’s conflicts, are livid.“The Oversight Committee is supposed to protect whistleblowers and independent government watchdogs like the Office of Government Ethics instead of retaliating against them for political reasons,” Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement Friday morning.White House press secretary Josh Earnest reportedly said on Friday that Chaffetz was “threatening to shut down the office of the guy who is doing the job that Jason Chaffetz himself is refusing to do.”Cummings noted that he sent a letter to Chaffetz on Thursday calling for a public hearing with Shaub as the main witness, prior to Chaffetz threatening to summon Shaub for a closed-door meeting. “The Oversight Committee has not held one hearing, conducted one interview, or obtained one document about President-Elect Donald Trump’s massive global entanglements,” Cummings said, “yet it is now apparently rushing to launch an investigation of the key government official for warning against the risks caused by President-Elect Donald Trump’s current plans.”According to Chaffetz, a closed-door hearing is necessary because the OGE’s statutory authority lapsed in 2007. This, however, is largely a byproduct of the ongoing bipartisan breakdown in the congressional budget and appropriations process. Many other agencies have not been reauthorized for much longer than the Office of Government Ethics. For example, the Department of Homeland Security hasn’t been reauthorized since it was created in 2002."

Sixty-eight percent say have an unfavorable view of the Russian leader.President-elect Donald Trump has a well-known interest in Russian politics and a controversial relationship with Putin. U.S. intelligence reports suggest that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump win. But even among GOP voters, Putin is not very popular. Only 12 percent of Republican respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 3 percent of Democrats and 10 percent of independents. However, the gap in skepticism about Putin seems to be less of a partisan issue and more a matter of age. Sixty-two percent of people between 18 and 34 years old ― a group that tends to be more Democratic ― have an unfavorable view of Putin. But three-quarters of people over 65 ― who are more likely to remember the Cold War, and to be Republican ― don’t have a favorable view of him.A HuffPost/YouGov survey conducted in December yielded similar results. It asked Americans if they consider Russia an ally, friendly, unfriendly or an enemy. Nineteen percent of people under 30 said they think Russia is an ally or friendly, while 51 percent said the country was unfriendly or an enemy. But only 11 percent of respondents over 65 said the company was an ally or friendly, and a whopping 78 percent said they considered Russia an enemy or unfriendly. Despite widespread dislike for Putin, Americans are more split on whether the believe Russia interfered with the presidential campaign. Fifty-five percent of respondents say they think Russia meddled with the election through hacking, while 36 percent say it didn’t and 10 percent say they don’t know. Three-quarters of those who think Russia inserted itself in the presidential election believe the country did so in order to help Trump, and 89 percent say it’s a very or somewhat important problem. Additionally, half of Americans say Trump has been too friendly with Russia, while 40 percent say his attitude is just right. There are more voters who dislike Putin than voters who believe Russia hacked the election or want Trump to stop fraternizing. However, those who have negative views of Putin or Russia in general feel very strongly.The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted on Jan. 5-9, 2017, and consists of 899 registered voters via landline and cell telephone with a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points."
39,THE WORLDPOST,Assad Linked To Syrian Chemical Attacks For First Time,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/investigators-assad-chemical-attacks_us_587908b4e4b0b3c7a7b0f9d4,The probe shows the decision to use toxic weapons came from the very top.,2017-01-13,"Syria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks during an interview with Australia's SBS News channel in this handout picture provided by SANA on July 1, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58790938170000fa01fde7e1.jpeg?cache=wfeJ3q2f9y&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"International investigators have said for the first time that they suspect President Bashar al-Assad and his brother are responsible for the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict, according to a document seen by Reuters.A joint inquiry for the United Nations and global watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) had previously identified only military units and did not name any commanders or officials.Now a list has been produced of individuals whom the investigators have linked to a series of chlorine bomb attacks in 2014-15 - including Assad, his younger brother Maher and other high-ranking figures - indicating the decision to use toxic weapons came from the very top, according to a source familiar with the inquiry. The Assads could not be reached for comment but a Syrian government official said accusations that government forces had used chemical weapons had “no basis in truth”. The government has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the civil war, which is almost six years old, saying all the attacks highlighted by the inquiry were the work of rebels or the Islamic State militant group.The list, which has been seen by Reuters but has not been made public, was based on a combination of evidence compiled by the U.N.-OPCW team in Syria and information from Western and regional intelligence agencies, according to the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.Reuters was unable to independently review the evidence or to verify it.The U.N.-OPCW inquiry - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism - is led by a panel of three independent experts, supported by a team of technical and administrative staff. It is mandated by the U.N. Security Council to identify individuals and organizations responsible for chemical attacks in Syria.Virginia Gamba, the head of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, denied any list of individual suspects had yet been compiled by the inquiry.“There are no ... identification of individuals being considered at this time,” she told Reuters by email.The use of chemical weapons is banned under international law and could constitute a war crime.While the inquiry has no judicial powers, any naming of suspects could lead to their prosecution. Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court, but alleged war crimes could be referred to the court by the Security Council - although splits among global powers over the war make this a distant prospect at present.The list could form the basis for the inquiry team’s investigations this year, according to the source. It is unclear whether the United Nations or OPCW will publish the list separately.‘HIGHEST LEVELS’The list identifies 15 people “to be scrutinized in relation to use of CW (chemical weapons) by Syrian Arab Republic Armed Forces in 2014 and 2015”. It does not specify what role they are suspected of playing, but lists their titles.It is split into three sections. The first, titled “Inner Circle President” lists six people including Assad, his brother who commands the elite 4th Armoured Division, the defense minister and the head of military intelligence.The second section names the air force chief as well as four commanders of air force divisions. They include the heads of the 22nd Air Force Division and the 63rd Helicopter Brigade, units that the inquiry has previously said dropped chlorine bombs.The third part of the list - “Other relevant Senior Mil Personnel” - names two colonels and two major-generals.Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an independent specialist in biological and chemical weapons who monitors Syria, told Reuters the list reflected the military chain of command.“The decisions would be made at the highest levels initially and then delegated down. Hence the first use would need to be authorized by Assad,” said de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of British and NATO chemical and biological defense divisions who frequently visits Syria for professional consultancy work.The Syrian defense ministry and air force could not be reached for comment.CHLORINE BARREL BOMBSSyria joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U.S.-Russian deal that followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013.It was the deadliest use of chemicals in global warfare since the 1988 Halabja massacre at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, which killed at least 5,000 people in Iraqi Kurdistan.The Syrian government, which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack, also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1,300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision.The United Nations and OPCW have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the agreement, which averted the threat of U.S.-led military intervention.The bodies appointed the panel of experts to conduct the inquiry, and its mandate runs until November. The panel published a report in October last year which said Syrian government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015.The October report identified Syria’s 22nd Air Force Division and 63rd Helicopter Brigade as having dropped chlorine bombs and said people “with effective control in the military units ... must be held accountable”.The source familiar with the inquiry said the October report had clearly established the institutions responsible and that the next step was to go after the individuals.Washington on Thursday blacklisted 18 senior Syrian officials based on the U.N.-OPCW inquiry’s October report - some of whom also appear on the list seen by but not Assad or his brother.The issue of chemical weapons use in Syria has become a deeply political one, and the U.N.-OPCW inquiry’s allegations of chlorine bomb attacks by government forces have split the U.N. Security Council’s veto-wielding members.The United States, Britain and France have called for sanctions against Syria, while Assad’s ally Russia has said the evidence presented is insufficient to justify such measures.A Security Council resolution would be required to bring Assad and other senior Syrian officials before the International Criminal Court for any possible war crimes prosecution - something Russia would likely block.For a graphic on chemical attacks in Syria click tmsnrt.rs/2cukvFr(Additional reporting by Ellen Francis in Beirut; Editing by Pravin Char)"

President-elect Donald Trump accepted in a press conference this week that Moscow could have interfered, saying ""As far as hacking, I think it was Russia.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58792c19120000c301ad7760.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Congressional Democrats raged against FBI Director James Comey on Friday after he and other intelligence agency chiefs provided legislators with a classified briefing on Russia’s involvement in last year’s presidential election.Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) told The Hill that he lost confidence in Comey, citing the last 15 minutes of the briefing as a tipping point but providing no details on what the FBI head or other intelligence officials said.“I’m disappointed, outraged — many of us are right now,” Walz told The Hill immediately following the briefing.That anger had yet to subside by Friday afternoon.“What I heard in the briefing made me not trust him, that’s all,” Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters.Gallego added that he went into the meeting with an open mind, but left with a different outlook. “I have more displeasure now than ever,” he said.One Democrat, speaking on condition of anonymity about the classified briefing, confirmed that Democrats became enraged in the final minutes.“People are upset with him,” the lawmaker said. “There were very pointed questions asked of him.”Comey upset both Democrats and Republicans by declining to comment on whether his agency is investigating reported ties between President-elect Donald Trump and the Russian government, sources inside the briefing told the Guardian. Democrats want Comey to look into the allegations, which the intelligence community has not proved but has flagged as important enough to share with Trump and President Barack Obama.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said he still thinks Comey is a good man, but is now questioning whether he is fit to run the FBI.“I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt,” Cummings told reporters Friday. “Today, I must tell you, when I left the hearing I felt a great sense of disappointment.”All Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) would say about the meeting was that Comey “has no credibility.”Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) wouldn’t get into the details about what was discussed in the classified meeting, but said many questions remain unanswered.“It’s hard to comment on these meetings. So much of this whole thing has been handled badly,” he said. “I’m interested to see whether any information comes out about any coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. I’m hoping at some point we get a final answer on that.”Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) called the briefing “one of the most substantial” meetings he has ever attended.“[It] had the interest of everyone in that room,” Meeks told HuffPost. “It gave me a lot to think about.”Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the former chair of the Democratic National Committee, confronted Comey during the briefing, according to The Hill. One Democrat even yelled at Comey, shouting, “You let us down,” an attendee told The Hill. Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign amid the hacking scandal during the 2016 campaign.In a statement released Friday night, Wasserman Schutlz wouldn’t comment on what members learned in the classified briefing, but said Comey needs to start answering outstanding questions. “The FBI Director must clarify for the American people, the agency’s policies for investigating and alerting those who are hacked by foreign governments,” she said. “There are further questions that must be answered by Director Comey, who must provide more clarity on this and other questions that have arisen surrounding the FBI’s handling of Russian hacking during the 2016 election cycle.”House Democrats held a caucus meeting about an hour after the classified briefing. In it, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she understood why her caucus is frustrated with Comey’s refusal to say whether his agency is looking into alleged Trump-Russia ties, a Pelosi spokesman said. Pelosi still respects Comey, but she’s concerned that he’s continued to evade questions on the issue, the spokesman added.Now that the intelligence community has concluded Russia intervened in the election to boost Trump, Democrats and some Republicans have demanded new sanctions on Moscow and asked intelligence agencies to release more information about Russian activities to the public.Legislators seeking to hold Russia accountable were also disappointed earlier this week, when Comey refused during a public hearing to comment on investigating connections between the president-elect and Russia. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) noted that Comey had publicly commented on investigations related to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. On Friday, the Guardian reported, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) suggested that the FBI had adopted a double standard.The Justice Department’s inspector general is planning to review the steps taken by the FBI and DOJ during the investigation into Clinton’s private email server use while secretary of state. The Clinton campaign and many of its supporters believe Comey had a major impact on the race by suggesting just before Election Day that new evidence could link Clinton to criminal activity, despite previously concluding an investigation into her with no charge.Pressure from members of Congress helped prompt the DOJ review. Cummings said Friday that the investigation gives him hope.“Of all the organizations that we have, the FBI is one that we must have the ultimate trust in,” he said. “This investigation by the IG, I don’t know what it will reveal, but I think we need to go through that process because if we’re not careful, we will reach a crisis of illegitimacy with regard to the very fabric of our country, and when I say the fabric I’m talking about organizations like the CIA, FBI and others.”Republicans remain supportive of the FBI, The Hill reported. And the party ― which controls both the House and the Senate ― has successfully quashed Democratic efforts to bring more attention to the issue by, for instance, establishing a select committee to investigate it.Friday’s briefing to House members came after a Thursday briefing to senators that did not immediately inspire similar reactions."

Tammy Baldwin will fight for milk until the cows come home.Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, otherwise known as America’s Dairyland, introduced the Dairy Pride Act on Thursday to fight back “against non-dairy products that are mislabeled as milk, yogurt and cheese,” a practice Baldwin says “hurts our dairy farmers.”Passage of the bill would mean all nondairy items now labeled as some form of dairy product, including the health-conscious community’s beloved almond milk, would need to undergo name changes. Plant-based cheddar-like nondairy brick?The bill would support American dairy businesses and “protect the integrity of milk” by enforcing label restrictions on nondairy options to milk, yogurt and cheese.Though Food and Drug Administration regulations define dairy products as coming from dairy animals, alternatives remain on the market, often labeled using dairy-specific terms. Baldwin’s bill targets those products.“Imitation products have gotten away with using dairy’s good name for their own benefit,” the act states.Still, there’s growing evidence that American consumers are loving their options, despite dairy’s good name.Almond milk sales rose 250 percent in five years, according to a 2016 consumer report by market-research firm Nielsen. Other milk alternatives, such as cashew and coconut, have also seen increased popularity, reports the Financial Times.Meanwhile, dairy milk consumption has been on the decline for decades. Department of Agriculture data show that Americans drink 37 percent less milk today than they did in the 1970s.The proposed legislation promotes the health benefits of dairy and suggests that labeling plant-based alternatives as “milk,” “cheese” or “yogurt” could be confusing for consumers, conveying “a nutritional equivalency that is not accurate.”While calcium is an important part of a balanced diet, and current federal dietary guidelines suggest that adult women and men consume three cups of dairy each day, the best way to get enough calcium remains a source of debate. As the Harvard School of Public Health points out, there are many nondairy sources of calcium that can be included in your diet.If the bill passes, we’re eagerly awaiting the alternative names for almond milk. Almond juice? Almond sweat? Aqueous almonds? To be honest, we’re not sure what else to call it."

The officers initially charged Hines, yet the serious charges were dropped and Hines won a lawsuit judgment. The officers had a history of prior misconduct complaints. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5879200c1700008501929f6b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Reade LevinsonSan Antonio, Texas, Jan 13 (Reuters) - In late 2013, a San Antonio police officer stood accused of handcuffing a woman in the rear of his police car and then raping her. The same officer had remained on the force despite prior sexual misconduct complaints and other brushes with the law.So early in 2014, backed by the city council, City Manager Sheryl Sculley proposed reforms to thepolice union contract in the Texas city. She wanted to eliminate a clause that erased prior misconduct complaints from cops’ records, increase citizen participation in the complaint process, and end officers’ ability to forfeit vacation time rather than serve suspensions.The San Antonio Police Officers Association’s response: It targeted Sculley with a $1 million advertising campaign, according to estimates by the manager’s office. The union ran full-page newspaper ads and placed billboards downtown claiming crime rates rose because she refused to fill open police positions. Police backers broadcast ads highlighting Sculley’s six-figure salary and created a Facebook page, Remove City Manager Sheryl Sculley.“They were really trying to intimidate,” said Sculley. “I knew it would be one of the hardest things I would work on here in San Antonio.”Mike Helle, the officers’ association president, said Sculley pitched the changes simply to ride a wave of protest over police. The contract ensures fair discipline, he said, and if anyone was on the attack, it was the manager. “Her tone was immediately aggressive,” he said.In the end, after two years of bitter negotiations, the sides agreed to a contract capping salaries and benefits at rates manageable for the city. But it did not include Sculley’s disciplinary changes. “The bottom line is that we could not change the contract,” she said.The episode is a telling snapshot of the power police unions flex across the United States, using political might to cement contracts that often provide a shield of protection to officers accused of misdeeds and erect barriers to residents complaining of abuse.From city to city, union contracts have become just as crucial in governing departments as policemanuals and city charters. Yet those contracts are coming under scrutiny amid civil rights protests over alleged police abuses, including shootings of unarmed black subjects.Reuters, examining the fine print of 82 police union contracts in large cities across the country, found a pattern of protections afforded the men and women in blue: A majority of the contracts call for departments to erase disciplinary records, some after just six months, making it difficult to fire officers with a history of abuses. In 18 cities, suspensions are erased in three years or less. In Anchorage, Alaska, suspensions, demotions and disciplinary transfers are removed after two years. Nearly half of the contracts allow officers accused of misconduct to access the entire investigative file - including witness statements, GPS readouts, photos, videos and notes from the internal investigation - before being interrogated. Twenty cities, including San Antonio, allow officers accused of misconduct to forfeit sick leave or holiday and vacation time rather than serve suspensions. Eighteen cities require an officer’s written consent before the department publicly releases documents involving prior discipline or internal investigations. Contracts in 17 cities set time limits for citizens to file complaints about police officers - some as short as 30 days. Nine cities restrict anonymous complaints from being investigated.Police supporters say the contract rules are common-sense protections.“Our job isn’t to keep bad officers in this profession. Our job is to make sure that due process is given to the officers,” said Rick Weisman, director of labor services at the National Fraternal Order of Police. “If the agency’s got a case, make your case.”But many law-enforcement veterans think the protections go too far.“The balance has dramatically shifted  to the creation of barriers to actual accountability that don’t serve the public good,” said Jonathan Smith, former chief of special litigation in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.Over the last 40 years, cities have bargained away the power to discipline police officers, often in closed negotiation meetings with local unions. Historically, contracts covered salary, pensions and healthcare. Discipline was brought to the negotiating table in the 1980s, when cash-strapped cities gave more management control to unions rather than increase salaries.“During recessions [the city] would give the union management rights in lieu of money,” said Robert Olson, chief inspector of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate in Ireland and former chief ofpolice in Minneapolis. “And when that happens, that’s when trouble starts.”“We’re not talking about just one union contract,” he added. “We’re talking about incremental changes in contracts over years that cumulatively, suddenly, there’s all of these hoops, which makes it far more difficult for chiefs to sustain discipline.”THE CASE IN COLUMBUSJoseph Hines was in his junior year at Ohio State University studying agribusiness. On August 29, 2012, Hines and his two best friends were out celebrating the first day of their junior year. They were sitting on a bench joking about fantasy basketball when two police officers on bicycles pulled up and asked Hines for his ID, according to internal police documents and interviews with witnesses.Hines said he didn’t have his ID. The male officer grabbed his arm, and Hines jerked it back. Then the female officer took out her handcuffs, and the two tackled him to the pavement.A police car dashcam recorded Hines’ shouts. “Stop! Stop! Please!”“Shut the f―- up!” an officer screamed. “Shut up! Get down!”“Please, stop!” Hines cried. “I can’t breathe, stop!”He lost consciousness, and then awoke on the sidewalk, surrounded now by at least 15 officers, with one eye swollen shut. Hines was hospitalized for three days, diagnosed with facial contusions, a concussion, mild brain damage and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, according to medical records he provided to Reuters.Hines was charged with six crimes, including resisting arrest and underage drinking. Police contended he was drinking in public - a can of Four Loko alcohol was found nearby. Hines says the can wasn’t his, and the charges for open container and public intoxication were dropped.Ultimately, he pleaded guilty only to littering and paid a $100 fine. “I wasn’t charged with assault,” Hines said. “My face didn’t match up to my charges.”Department records show a history of misconduct complaints against the two Columbus officersinvolved, Thomas DeWitt and Debra Paxton.Prior to this incident, citizens filed 40 complaint allegations against DeWitt and 14 against Paxton. Those numbers should have “raised eyebrows and raised questions,” said Norm Stamper, former chief of the Seattle Police Department and author of a book outlining police reforms.The details of many of those cases are missing because Columbus files are routinely destroyed every four years. “We shred them in various cycles,” said Jonathan Schirg, the management analyst in charge of records retention in the Columbus Division of Police. The retention schedule is approved by the Records Commission, Ohio Historical Society and Auditory of State.Wes Phillips, the attorney for both officers, declined to comment.The officers were never suspended in the Hines case. The department began an administrative investigation into their “response to resistance” - a new term used by the Columbus Division ofPolice to describe police use of force. The investigating sergeant was “unable to resolve” the allegations because Hines declined to be interviewed, as instructed by his attorney, records show.Mike Miller, Hines’ attorney, said he would advise any client not to talk to police in the midst of a case. “The police are the ones that brought these charges against him,” he said.After interviews with 15 officers and two paramedics, police brass determined the misconduct allegations were unfounded. That ruling came as a jury in September 2015 found DeWitt used excessive force and awarded Hines $30,000 in damages for his injuries. Hines appealed the award, which did not cover his attorney’s fees, and the case is pending at the Sixth Circuit Court.Like many police departments, Columbus has a procedure in place to identify patterns of behavior and recommend counseling, called the Employee Action Review System.The union contract prohibits complaints deemed by the department to be unfounded from factoring into discipline. In the department’s view, there is no just cause to discipline without a proven allegation, Columbus Division of Police Chief Kimberley Jacobs said in an email.The review committee recommended Officer Paxton be monitored and given remedial training after 13 investigations in six months were opened into her use of mace, records show. In July 2014, she took a 30-minute course in handcuffing techniques.Since the review, the department has investigated eight additional incidents involving Paxton’s use of mace and force.Another Columbus case shows how officers can build up mounting complaints and stay on the force - until even more serious events occur.Last September, Columbus officer Bryan Mason shot and killed 13-year-old Tyre King, who was carrying a BB gun. Mason had been the subject of more than 60 investigations, including 25 incidents in which citizens required medical attention, and was involved in two additional fatal shootings in 2009 and 2012, according to internal police documents obtained by Reuters.Mason has been moved to an investigative assignment and is no longer on patrol, according to a spokesperson for the department. His lawyer, Phillips, declined to comment on specifics but said: “Columbus is a very well trained police force.”Jason Pappas, president of the Columbus Fraternal Order of Police, said the union contract does not skew investigations or limit accountability. “If every officer started getting disciplined or moved because somebody started filing complaints, hell, the whole neighborhood would start filing complaints,” he said.CASES CLOSEDIn 15 cities reviewed by Reuters, few citizen complaints were sustained by police internal review boards. In Tacoma, Washington, for instance, just 10 percent of 215 complaint allegations filed against police were sustained between January 2015 and March 2016.Assistant Chief Kathy McAlpine said complaints are often not sustained for lack of independent witnesses. “It is the complainant’s word versus the officer,” she said.In Chicago, a Reuters analysis of 1,000 civilian complaints sent to Internal Affairs in 2016 shows just one resulted in disciplinary action.One Chicago officer, Raymond Piwnicki - the subject of reports by The Invisible Institute, a Chicago journalistic organization focused on civil rights - accumulated at least 89 misconduct allegations in his 18-year career, files reviewed by Reuters show. Of those, four were sustained and one of the four, fighting with another officer, resulted in punishment, complaint records and internal investigative files show.In one sustained case in 2005, Piwnicki exchanged words with a couple as they boarded an elevator, telling the man, “Shut up, you f―-ing coon, you f―-ing cluck, I do whatever the f―- I want to,” according to a report by the Department’s Office of Professional Standards. The argument began after Piwnicki pushed the wife out of the way so he and a friend could board first, the OPS investigation found. The report said Piwnicki attempted to punch the man.Piwnicki denied wrongdoing in a statement to OPS, but the department sustained all six allegations against him.“Piwnicki has clearly exhibited a pattern of using profane and derogatory language in his contact with citizens,” an investigator wrote. In 2013, Piwnicki was promoted to detective. He declined comment.FILES DESTROYEDIn many cities, prior disciplinary cases simply disappear from the record, thanks to the contract.Honolulu’s contract specifies “derogatory” materials in an employee’s file - including disciplinary records - be destroyed after four years. Files may be “temporarily withheld from destruction” if officers are involved in pending litigation, said Sarah Yoro, a Honolulu Police spokeswoman. “Files are normally shredded or burned,” she said.In Baton Rouge, complaints of sexual misconduct or harassment are removed from an officer’s record and destroyed after five years. The department did not respond to interview requests.Destroying data that could signal wider problems can hurt the police department as well as the public, said Smith, the former DOJ official. Officers who become involved in shootings or other serious violations frequently have faced less serious allegations in the past. By limiting the use of past complaints, he said, union contracts can render institutions unable to correct their own behavior.Glendale, Arizona, with a population of more than a quarter million residents, is among nine cities where the union contract restricts anonymous complaints from being investigated.“We want the complainant to come in,” said Justin Harris, a Glendale police officer and union representative. “There’s a form, and it lets the taxpayer know that if you’re knowingly and intentionally making a false statement, you could be prosecuted.”Glendale police defend their other contract protections. Among them: Officers under investigation get to see video footage that isn’t made available to citizens. Incidents involving police use of force can be emotional, and looking at video footage can help officers refresh their memory, policesay.“That way they know all the facts, there’s no witch hunting,” Harris said.By contrast, he said, “You don’t want to let a witness review footage of something they may or may not have seen, because if they review that footage, then they’re going to come back and just tell you what they just saw. So that’s not an independent statement.”In eight cities, contracts allow officers to refuse to testify before civilian oversight boards. In Las Vegas, the union contract requires a court order to access an employee’s file.Detective Steve Grammas, president of the Las Vegas Police Protective Association, said the policy is “consistent with public and private sector employment practices.”Some contracts afford second chances when officers are found to have alcohol in their system.In Chicago, officers who are breathalyzed on the job and register a blood-alcohol content of 0.021 through 0.039 - close to the 0.05 cutoff for a driving-while-intoxicated citation in Illinois - are sent home and tested again the next day. “If the return-to-duty test reveals an alcohol level of .00, the Officer may return to duty and shall not be subject to discipline based on the initial test result,” the contract states.Toledo is equally forgiving. “Any on-duty officer who has under a .04 BAC shall not be subject to discipline but will be required to go home,” the contract says. “This officer may utilize any accumulated compensatory or vacation time to cover their absence.”Officer Daniel Wagner, president of the Toledo Police Patrolman’s Association, said the language was recently added “to be proactive in addressing a common problem seen in policing nationwide” involving officers and alcohol. But, he said, the force has not had to put the provision into action.UNIQUE BENEFITS, PUBLIC BARRIERSIn Milwaukee, officers can be paid during disciplinary suspensions - a benefit not bestowed on other city workers. “It is recognized that financial losses are not typically borne by the offending member alone, but by his or her family as well,” the police contract states.Officers are also paid during lengthy internal affairs investigations. One Milwaukee police officer, Sonthana Rajaphoumi, was on paid suspension for more than five months after being charged in April 2016 with three felony counts of causing mental harm to a child and soliciting prostitution. He allegedly offered $200 for sex with a 16-year-old girl and tried to court another 15-year-old girl. He was fired in October.Rajaphoumi’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment.A department spokesperson said officers stay on payroll until found guilty by the court system or an internal investigation, processes that can take years.Columbus’ contract mandates that complaints be submitted in writing within 60 days of an incident. Beyond that, officers typically are not required to participate in the investigation, and their name doesn’t appear on the complaint. At least 25 allegations of misconduct, or nearly 5 percent of all complaints, were not investigated in Columbus due to the 60-day clause, a 2015 report said.“It’s very difficult for a supervisor to investigate outside of 60 days,” said Jennifer Knight, commander of the Columbus Internal Affairs Bureau.Like most union contracts, the Columbus agreement allows officers access to all investigative materials. If new evidence is discovered, officers can pause an interview, step out with their lawyer and review the material.Complainants are not given the same access in the city, where a string of police-involved shootings has sparked citizen marches.THE CASE IN SAN ANTONIOIn San Antonio, the case that helped spur the city manager to action involved officer Jackie Neal, arrested in November 2013 on charges he raped a woman in the rear seat of his police vehicle. Later that night, released from jail, Neal returned to the home where the woman was staying and was arrested again.Three months earlier, the police chief found that Neal, supervisor of the department’s youth program, had had sex with a teenage girl participating in the program.The chief suspended him for three days, but Neal never lost a dime in pay or a day off patrol: The union contract allowed him to serve the suspension using vacation days.Helle, the union president, said he too wanted Neal off the force, viewing him at an outlier. “I told the chief, you need to watch this guy,” he said. Helle has a daughter, and he said Neal’s actions deeply troubled him.Neal declined to comment.Neal had two prior complaints of sexual misconduct, court documents show. A woman alleged he put his hands inside her panties, lifted up her shirt and felt her breasts during a routine traffic stop in November 2006. Neal was accused of digitally penetrating another woman in February 2007. Neither complaint was sustained by the department.Police Chief William McManus declined interview requests. In a deposition in the civil case against Neal, McManus said he “had a stern conversation” with Neal after the sexual encounter with the teenager in the police youth program and felt confident allowing him to continue performing his duties unsupervised.McManus said he did not see a connection between the teen sex incident and Neal’s prior complaints. “These incidents, to me, were not - not sexually related, but they were what I considered to be a very, very aggressive officer in trying to find drugs,” he said.The officer had other brushes with the law. In February 2007, Neal’s stepdaughter called policeafter he allegedly punched a door and began throwing clothes and a suitcase. Two months later, Neal’s wife, Debbie, called 911 saying he was threatening to kill himself with a gun.“He rarely raised his voice, but when he got mad it was scary,” said Debbie Neal, who divorced Neal in 2009 but defended him in court. “I’d never seen him like that.”In November 2013, after the alleged rape in his police car, Neal pleaded no contest to improper sexual activity with a person in custody. He was fined $5,000 and sentenced to 14 months behind bars. As part of the plea, he agreed to surrender his officer certification.Neal’s sentence was shortened by five months through a state program allowing credit for work and education.In April 2015, San Antonio approved a $500,000 settlement with the victim.Yet such cases are not enough to spur change. The city manager, Sculley, said the police union wouldn’t budge on her demand that it cede control over discipline, and city council leaders urged her to yield in order to settle a new contract.“There is so much that still needs to be changed in the contract,” Sculley said. “I lost the political support of the council to continue to press on that issue.”(Editing by Ronnie Greene and Janet Roberts)"

44,POLITICS,British Spy Behind Report On Donald Trump Aided FBI With Soccer Scandal Probe,Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/british-spy-behind-trump-report-in-hiding-terrified-for-his-life_us_587814dae4b0e58057fe0e20,Christopher Steele is now in hiding after being named as the author of the unverified report.,2017-01-13,"Journalists cluster outside the offices of Orbis Business Intelligence in London, the company co-owned by former MI6 spy Christopher Steele, who has been identified as the man responsible for unverified reports on Donald Trump's alleged activities in Russia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58789362170000fa01fde687.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The former MI6 British spy named as the author of an unverified report on Donald Trump’s alleged relationship with Russia earned his reputation as an investigator aiding the FBI in its bombshell probe of world soccer.Christopher Steele, 52, and his family were in hiding Thursday night, after media reports exposed him as being behind the report containing potentially compromising but unsubstantiated information about the president-elect. Intelligence leaders said they informed Trump about the dossier last Friday as they briefed him about Russian hacking during the presidential campaign.Steele runs the London-based private investigation firm Orbis Business Intelligence, which he co-founded after leaving the British Secret Service. The FBI may have taken his allegations about Russia and Trump more seriously because agents had worked with him during an investigation into world soccer’s governing body FIFA, Reuters and The New York Times reported.England’s Football Association hired Steele in 2009 to investigate Russia, which was then a rival to England to the host the 2018 World Cup, Reuters said Thursday. Steele eventually turned information he gathered on Russia to the FBI’s New York-based Eurasian Task Force in a 2010 meeting in London. Steele’s FIFA work lent credibility to his Russia expertise and contacts, U.S. officials told the news agency.The FBI’s probe ultimately resulted in dozens of U.S. indictments in 2015 against soccer administration leaders and sports marketing executives on charges ranging from bribery to tax evasion and money laundering.Coincidentally, the key informer in the FBI’s case was former FIFA executive Chuck Blazer, a friend of Trump’s who was a frequent guest at the real estate businessman’s beauty pageants. Blazer lived in Trump Tower and ran CONCACAF, the regional confederation overseeing soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, from offices in the building. (Blazer admitted in 2013 to accepting bribes related to South Africa’s 2010 World Cup bid, court filings show.)One of Steele’s reports involves alleged pressure from Russia on Trump to build projects connected to the 2018 World Cup, which the British agent’s report said the real estate businessman had rebuffed.Steele’s firm was hired during the presidential campaign by anti-Trump Republicans — and later Democrats — to probe the businessman’s relationship with Russia, Reuters reported.The British agent, who had worked as a spy in Russia for years, reportedly used contacts to create a series of reports on claims about the country’s alleged relationship with Trump. The unverified reports also allege that members of Trump’s campaign team maintained ties with Russians during his race for the presidency.Trump denounced media coverage of the existence of the report this week as “fake news,” a “political witch-hunt” and “crap.” A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin called the reports “absolute fantasy.”CNN was the first to report that Trump was briefed on the existence of Steele’s reports by U.S. intelligence chiefs. The network said Trump should be aware of the report, even though its claims were unverified, because it had been circulating for months among politicians and members of the media.Trump has said that intelligence agencies determined there was no truth to Steele’s finding.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement Wednesday saying that he had called Trump to clarify that intelligence agencies had made no judgment about the reliability of the allegations. He also insisted that the leak about the report did not come from any intelligence agency.During his press conference Wednesday, Trump refused to call on a reporter from CNN, calling the broadcaster “fake news.” Buzzfeed is the only media outlet to date that has printed the full dossier that Steele reportedly wrote."

We’re gonna team up and see if we can bring about some positive change in the inner cities, which I felt was my only agenda, and he agreed. And he wants to do something, and he realized that he needs some allies in that department, and he seemed really sincere about it.”Harvey later tweeted that Trump was “congenial and sincere” and seemed like he “genuinely wants to make a difference in this area.”Trump tapped Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development last month. Detroit, where Carson is from, and Chicago are two of the cities they will focus on. Harvey said he was grateful to contribute to the conversation, even though he is outside the political realm. “It’s not my jump into politics. I ain’t gonna pass a background check,” he joked. “It’s just me following orders from my friend, President Obama, who said, ‘You gotta get off from behind your computers, stop tweeting and texting, and get out there and talk.’ I did what I was supposed to do. That’s the only way we’re going to unify our country. ... I have a responsibility for the community that I service to try to be a voice.” Harvey was clear about his political stance during the 2016 presidential election, and he was not in Trump’s camp. While he admitted finding Trump “entertaining,” he scoffed at the idea of him winning the presidency. “If Donald Trump becomes president, then I’m running,” Harvey told The Daily Beast in February. “Because then, obviously, background checks have gone out the window. How do you let a dude who was on the cover of Playboy magazine and has been married 18 times be your president? Now come on. Hell, then I qualify.”Harvey won’t be attending the inauguration ceremony next week. It’s on his 60th birthday. "
46,POLITICS,Patagonia Is Gearing Up For War With Utah Republicans Over National Monument,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/patagonia-utah-national-monument_us_587907a7e4b0b3c7a7b0f7fc,The outdoor apparel giant wants to pull $40 million out of the state over officials' pledge to undo President Barack Obama's conservation efforts.,2017-01-13,Patagonia has a long history of environmental activism. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58790844170000fa01fde7dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Patagonia last year spent $1 million on a get-out-the-vote campaign, completely shut down its operations on Election Day and donated all $10 million it earned on Black Friday to environmental causes. Now, the high-end outdoor apparel retailer is gearing up to battle Utah officials’ plan to roll back President Barack Obama’s designation of a new national monument in the state. The company this week threatened to pull out of Salt Lake City’s biannual Outdoor Retailer Show, a trade show that brings in 45,000 visitors spending more than $40 million each year. “We’re going to fight with everything that we have,” Rose Marcario, Patagonia’s chief executive, told The Huffington Post by phone on Thursday. “What we have is our economic power and the ability to withdraw from it if we need to.” She’s not alone. Peter Metcalf, co-founder of the outdoor gear giant Black Diamond Equipment, issued a call to arms on Tuesday urging the trade show, which he helped bring to Utah 20 years ago, to leave the state in protest. “Gov. Gary Herbert and Utah’s D.C. delegation are leading a national all-out assault on the sanctity of Utah and the country’s public lands,” Metcalf, who lives in Utah, wrote in the op-ed published Tuesday in The Salt Lake Tribune. “This agenda is antithetical to our industry, let alone the majority of our citizens regardless of party affiliation.”The Outdoor Industry Association, which organizes the show, did not return a call requesting comment, but told Hatch Magazine it would “continue to listen to members and show attendee feedback on ... the appropriate venue for the show.” Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes (R) vowed to sue the White House last month after Obama set aside 1.35 million acres, including sacred tribal lands, to become Bears Ears National Monument. The Navajo Nation and conservationists alike hailed the designation as a victory. But Reyes, later joined by the state’s Republican governor and lawmakers in Washington, D.C., denounced the move as a federal land grab. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) urged President-elect Donald Trump to reverse the designation under the 1906 Antiquities Act.The statute does not explicitly prohibit a president from completely scrapping a previously designated monument, The Salt Lake City Tribune noted. But legal research suggests that though presidents can adjust a prior designation, they cannot outright abolish it. “No president has ever abolished or revoked a national monument proclamation, so the existence or scope of any such authority has not been tested in courts,” an analysis published last month by the Congressional Research Service stated. “However, some legal analyses since at least the 1930s have concluded that the Antiquities Act, by its terms, does not authorize the president to repeal proclamations, and that the president also lacks implied authority to do so.” Obama may be among the most frequent users of the Antiquities Act, invoking it 26 times during his two terms to designate or enlarge monuments, mostly in the deserts of the southwest. But nearly every president since Theodore Roosevelt has applied the law to preserve tribal lands and natural treasures. Only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush declined to use the law, according to The Wilderness Society. “Conservation is really a bipartisan issue,” Marcario said. “It doesn’t have to become so polarized.” Patagonia has long been a darling of conservationists. Founded in 1973 by rock climber and environmentalist Yvon Chouinard, the privately-held firm placed nature and climate stewardship at the core of the brand. The company donates 1 percent of sales each year to green causes. In 2011, Patagonia, in opposition to the fashion industry’s wasteful culture, began urging shoppers to buy fewer of its jackets and make the ones they have last. That same year, the company certified as a benefit corporation, forcing it to adhere to strict environmental and corporate responsibility standards. In March, the firm led a $35 million investment into a fund that helps pay for rooftop solar installations across the country. To be sure, Patagonia has its faults. Internal audits found human trafficking in the company’s supply chain as recently as 2011. Since then, the retailer has been working to root out labor violations, which occurred mostly at factories in Taiwan, where several of the company’s second-tier mills are located. The Ventura, California-based retailer insists its political efforts are nonpartisan. But given the Republican Party’s close ties to heavily polluting industries and history of denying the science behind climate change, Patagonia’s politics fall firmly on one side of the divide. Employees at the company have given a total of $54,317 to the Democratic Party over the last 27 years, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Republicans, by contrast, received just one $500 donation in 1990. Marcario has yet to meet with any officials from the incoming Trump administration, she said. But she is concerned about the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (R), who has alarmingly deep ties to the oil and gas industry, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a bureau he has spent much of his recent career suing. Secretary of state hopeful Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp., worries her, too.“We’re getting some very clear signals,” she said. “There’s a lot of discussions around deregulation of really basic things that I think every American should be concerned about that affect air, water and soil. We’ll fight each of those fights where we see that we’ll have the most impact.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified Peter Metcalf as CEO of Black Diamond Equipment. He stepped down from the role in 2015. The article originally misstated that child labor was found among the human trafficking in Patagonia’s supply chain. "

Gary Herbert and Utah’s D.C. delegation are leading a national all-out assault on the sanctity of Utah and the country’s public lands,” Metcalf, who lives in Utah, wrote in the op-ed published Tuesday in The Salt Lake Tribune. “This agenda is antithetical to our industry, let alone the majority of our citizens regardless of party affiliation.”The Outdoor Industry Association, which organizes the show, did not return a call requesting comment, but told Hatch Magazine it would “continue to listen to members and show attendee feedback on ... the appropriate venue for the show.” Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes (R) vowed to sue the White House last month after Obama set aside 1.35 million acres, including sacred tribal lands, to become Bears Ears National Monument. The Navajo Nation and conservationists alike hailed the designation as a victory. But Reyes, later joined by the state’s Republican governor and lawmakers in Washington, D.C., denounced the move as a federal land grab. Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT) urged President-elect Donald Trump to reverse the designation under the 1906 Antiquities Act.The statute does not explicitly prohibit a president from completely scrapping a previously designated monument, The Salt Lake City Tribune noted. But legal research suggests that though presidents can adjust a prior designation, they cannot outright abolish it. “No president has ever abolished or revoked a national monument proclamation, so the existence or scope of any such authority has not been tested in courts,” an analysis published last month by the Congressional Research Service stated. “However, some legal analyses since at least the 1930s have concluded that the Antiquities Act, by its terms, does not authorize the president to repeal proclamations, and that the president also lacks implied authority to do so.” Obama may be among the most frequent users of the Antiquities Act, invoking it 26 times during his two terms to designate or enlarge monuments, mostly in the deserts of the southwest. But nearly every president since Theodore Roosevelt has applied the law to preserve tribal lands and natural treasures. Only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush declined to use the law, according to The Wilderness Society. “Conservation is really a bipartisan issue,” Marcario said. “It doesn’t have to become so polarized.” Patagonia has long been a darling of conservationists. Founded in 1973 by rock climber and environmentalist Yvon Chouinard, the privately-held firm placed nature and climate stewardship at the core of the brand. The company donates 1 percent of sales each year to green causes. In 2011, Patagonia, in opposition to the fashion industry’s wasteful culture, began urging shoppers to buy fewer of its jackets and make the ones they have last. That same year, the company certified as a benefit corporation, forcing it to adhere to strict environmental and corporate responsibility standards. In March, the firm led a $35 million investment into a fund that helps pay for rooftop solar installations across the country. To be sure, Patagonia has its faults. Internal audits found human trafficking in the company’s supply chain as recently as 2011. Since then, the retailer has been working to root out labor violations, which occurred mostly at factories in Taiwan, where several of the company’s second-tier mills are located. The Ventura, California-based retailer insists its political efforts are nonpartisan. But given the Republican Party’s close ties to heavily polluting industries and history of denying the science behind climate change, Patagonia’s politics fall firmly on one side of the divide. Employees at the company have given a total of $54,317 to the Democratic Party over the last 27 years, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Republicans, by contrast, received just one $500 donation in 1990. Marcario has yet to meet with any officials from the incoming Trump administration, she said. But she is concerned about the nomination of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (R), who has alarmingly deep ties to the oil and gas industry, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a bureau he has spent much of his recent career suing. Secretary of state hopeful Rex Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp., worries her, too.“We’re getting some very clear signals,” she said. “There’s a lot of discussions around deregulation of really basic things that I think every American should be concerned about that affect air, water and soil. We’ll fight each of those fights where we see that we’ll have the most impact.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified Peter Metcalf as CEO of Black Diamond Equipment. He stepped down from the role in 2015. The article originally misstated that child labor was found among the human trafficking in Patagonia’s supply chain. "

49,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Voters Say They'd Side With Him Against Congressional Republicans,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-republican-poll_us_58792e13e4b0e58057feb075,"That means you, too, Speaker Paul Ryan.",2017-01-13,"President-elect Donald Trump meets with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on Capitol Hill in Washington, Nov. 10, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587937f71700002e00fde8bb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President-Elect Donald Trump has never exactly been a paragon of Republican Party orthodoxy. Even before he takes office, he’s been at odds with politicians in his own party over everything from infrastructure and trade policy to strategy on Obamacare and attitudes toward Russia.Voters who elected Trump largely are inclined to take his side in such disputes against congressional Republicans and traditionally conservative pressure groups, according to a new poll.The survey, conducted by HuffPost and YouGov, asked people who they’d be more likely to support in a series of hypothetical political disagreements. Respondents were given the option to pick neither side, or to say that they weren’t sure.Unsurprisingly, Trump voters overwhelmingly say they’d back him in a dispute against Democrats in Congress. Eighty-four percent say they’d be more likely to agree with the president-elect, with fewer than 1 percent saying they’d be inclined to side with Democrats.But a majority also say they’d be likely to support Trump over both congressional Republicans generally and Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in particular. That’s despite the fact that Ryan is well liked among those who voted for Trump. In another recent survey, 60 percent of Trump voters said they approved of Ryan’s handling of his job as speaker, with just 24 percent disapproving.Other traditionally powerful voices on the right also fared badly in a hypothetical argument against Trump. Just 13 percent of Trump supporters say they’d be likely to side with conservative commentators, like Bill O’Reilly and Laura Ingraham, over the president-elect, and just 23 percent that they’d be inclined to support evangelical Christian leaders. (Self-described born-again Christians who voted for Trump, however, say by a 19-point margin, 41 percent to 22 percent, that they’d follow their religious leaders.)The one voice that Trump voters prioritized over the president-elect was that of the military. By a 7-point margin, 39 percent to 26 percent, a plurality say they’d be more inclined to agree with military leaders than with Trump in a political disagreement.The survey’s wording, of course, is extremely broad. Political disputes may arise where public opinion on an issue is strong enough to outweigh any general inclination to sympathize with Trump. But the results suggest that the loyalties of Trump’s voters lie more with him than with the party at large ― and that he may be able to coax some followers into positions they wouldn’t otherwise support. A 2015 poll, for instance, found that Republicans were significantly more likely to embrace universal health care and affirmative action when the ideas were attributed to Trump rather than President Barack Obama.Use the widget below to further explore the results of HuffPost/YouGov’s survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups: The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Jan. 5 to Jan. 9 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Americans approve of Barack Obama, but are less sure they want to see his legacy continued. And a lot about the U.S. has changed in the past eight year. This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 13, 2017.APPROVAL FOR TRUMP’S TRANSITION SINKS - Lydia Saad: “Gallup polling conducted two weeks before Inauguration Day, President-elect Donald Trump continues to garner historically low approval for his transition performance, with 51% of Americans disapproving of how he is handling the presidential transition and 44% approving. Last month, the public was split on this question, with 48% approving and 48% disapproving….Trump’s 48% transition approval rating in December was already the lowest for any presidential transition Gallup has measured, starting with Bill Clinton’s in 1992-1993. Trump’s current rating only further separates him from his predecessors ― particularly Barack Obama, who earned 83% approval for his handling of the transition process in January 2009, up from 75% in mid-December 2008….Republicans’ rating of Trump’s transition has remained positive, with 87% approving in the Jan. 4-8 poll, similar to the 86% recorded last month. Very few Democrats approve, which has also been fairly steady, at 13% this month versus 17% in December. Meanwhile, his transition approval among independents has fallen from 46% to 33%.” [Gallup] Other surveys give him similarly low marks - HuffPollster: “A majority of voters disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his role as president-elect, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday. Only 37 percent of respondents approve of how Trump’s managing the transition, while 51 percent disapprove. They rated him favorably versus unfavorably by the very same margins….Quinnipiac also shows a broad drop in optimism about Trump. Only 39 percent of voters find him honest, down from 42 percent in late November. Voters are also less positive about his leadership abilities, intelligence and level-headedness, and fewer respondents viewed him as a strong person. Asked whether Trump ‘cares about the average American,’ voters’ views remain largely unchanged. In late November, 36 percent of respondents said Trump’s behavior since the election made them feel better about him, and only 14 percent said it made them feel worse. However, the most recent numbers reflect a different sentiment. Today, only 23 percent feel better about him, while 28 percent feel worse.” [HuffPost, more from Quinnipiac and Pew]AMERICANS’ APPROVAL OF BARACK OBAMA DOESN’T TRANSLATE INTO SUPPORT FOR MAINTAINING HIS LEGACY - HuffPollster: “As President Barack Obama concludes his time in office, his most immediate legacy is a paradox. Obama’s approval rating, which languished in the mid-40s during much of his tenure, soared during the tumult of the 2016 presidential campaign. He will leave office with an average approval rating of just over 55 percent, according to HuffPost Pollster’s aggregate….But Americans’ positive opinion of the president didn’t translate into an argument for electing a Democratic successor, nor does there seem to be much desire to maintain his legacy. Eight years after Obama ran for office on a slogan of ‘change we can believe in,’ the nation is still keen on trying something different, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey. Fewer than a third of respondents said they want to see President-elect Donald Trump continue Obama’s policies. A majority of respondents said they hope their new commander in chief strikes out on a different path on everything from the nation’s economy to the political atmosphere in Washington.” [HuffPost]Views are sharply divided along partisan lines - More from HuffPollster: “Obama will leave office remarkably popular among Democrats: 87 percent approve of his performance, and 59 percent strongly approve. Seventy-nine percent said that he changed things for the better as president and 77 percent that he did the best job that he could….By contrast, Obama is close to universally loathed by Republicans, 90 percent of whom want to see Trump take the country in the different direction.Just 14 percent of Republicans said they approve of his performance as president, with 83 percent saying they disapprove and 72 percent saying they strongly disapprove.”HOW THE U.S. HAS CHANGED SINCE OBAMA TOOK OFFICE - Michael Dimock: “Barack Obama campaigned for the U.S. presidency on a platform of change. As he prepares to leave office, the country he led for eight years is undeniably different. Profound social, demographic and technological changes have swept across the United States during Obama’s tenure, as have important shifts in government policy and public opinion. Apple released its first iPhone during Obama’s 2007 campaign, and he announced his vice presidential pick – Joe Biden – on a two-year-old platform called Twitter. Today, use of smartphones and social media has become the norm in U.S. society, not the exception. The election of the nation’s first black president raised hopes that race relations in the U.S. would improve, especially among black voters. But by 2016, following a spate of high-profile deaths of black Americans during encounters with police and protests by the Black Lives Matter movement and other groups, many Americans – especially blacks – described race relations as generally bad….The nation’s stark partisan fissures are likely to persist and may deepen. Just as Obama’s job approval ratings are deeply divided along partisan lines, the public’s ratings for how Trump has handled his transition to the White House are more divided by party than they were for recent presidents-elect.” [Pew]POLICE OFFICERS DON’T THINK BAD COPS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE - Ryan Reilly: “U.S. police officers largely believe high-profile deaths of black people at the hands of law enforcement officers have made their jobs more difficult, according to a new national survey. They’re also skeptical of the protests that have followed those tragic incidents. But there’s one key issue where it turns out protesters and law enforcement officers overwhelmingly agree: Bad cops aren’t held accountable….Asked whether they agreed with the idea that officers who consistently do a poor job are held accountable, 47 percent of officers disagreed and 25 percent strongly disagreed. Barely one-quarter of officers surveyed either agreed or strongly agreed that officers who do a poor job are held accountable (24 percent agreed, while just 3 percent strongly agreed)....The survey also found that the overwhelming majority of white officers, 92 percent, believe the country has already made the needed changes to achieve racial equality, a view shared by just 8 percent of African-American citizens and by a comparatively low percent of the public at large.” [HuffPost] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

His Legacy Changed The Court.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-supreme-court-legacy_us_58704aafe4b02b5f85890071,The law and the politics of justice will never be the same.,2017-01-13,The president called Donald Verrilli after the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in 2012 — not the other way around -- the former solicitor general told HuffPost.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5876e564120000c301ad71c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This piece is part of a series on Obama’s legacy that The Huffington Post will be publishing over the next week.WASHINGTON ― The relationship between Chief Justice John Roberts and President Barack Obama got off to a rocky start.Roberts bungled the wording of the oath of office as he administered it to the former senator, who had once opposed his nomination to lead the Supreme Court. The two men, “out of an abundance of caution,” met up for a do-over the next day. The moment marked the start of a historic period for the nation’s highest court ― one that has shaped Obama’s legacy far beyond the courtroom.A longtime student of the Constitution and the branch that interprets it, Obama didn’t dramatically reshape the Supreme Court, as much as progressives might have wished it. If anything, under Roberts, the institution remained as deeply conservative as it has been for nearly half a century.But over the course of two presidential terms, Obama and his lawyers found ways to persuade the court to make the law a little more liberal — including progress for same-sex couples, health care for millions and protection for abortion rights and civil rights laws. All of this in the face of a five-justice majority that repeatedly handed Obama notable defeats — as when it rolled back voting rights protections and expanded the influence of corporations and unions in our electoral system.“I think that the president was able to achieve a very great deal, especially when one considers that he was litigating in front of a court that was decidedly conservative in its jurisprudential inclinations,” said Donald Verrilli, the former solicitor general who argued successfully against the Defense of Marriage Act and twice helped the Obama administration save its crowning achievement, the Affordable Care Act.In 2012, Roberts’ vote was key to upholding the health care law as constitutional, even as the totality of his majority opinion was decidedly conservative. (For one thing, it freed states from the law’s mandatory Medicaid expansion, which Roberts wrote was akin to putting a “gun to the head” of the states.) The court’s compromise, difficult though it was, wasn’t nearly enough to appease conservatives, whose wrath against the chief justice only grew when they learned that he’d changed his vote in the case, after initially siding with the four justices who wanted to strike down the law.Republicans still haven’t forgotten how Roberts, a George W. Bush nominee, broke ranks and voted with the court’s liberal bloc. The public may never know exactly what went down at the Supreme Court in the weeks the justices pondered their decision. But the chief is known for resisting partisanship, and another justice has suggested that the desire to safeguard the court’s legitimacy may have led him to hand Obama his biggest legal victory.“The institution moves you, and perhaps even more a chief justice,” an unnamed Supreme Court colleague told National Law Journal reporter Marcia Coyle for her 2013 book, The Roberts Court: The Struggle for the Constitution.For all the highlights, including a second watershed victory for Obamacare in 2015, there were lowlights. Verrilli points to the court’s invalidation of a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as his biggest loss as solicitor general — one that continues to reverberate today.“I was concerned with what would follow if it were invalidated, that it would open the doors to enact aggressive voting suppression measures. And that’s what happened,” Verrilli said of the Roberts-written decision, which was joined by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, as well as Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Three years on, Congress is yet to answer Obama’s call to restore the full law.Dissenting in this and other cases with civil rights on the line were the two individuals who are probably Obama’s biggest contribution to the Supreme Court: Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Even if the president ultimately could not tilt the court’s ideological balance — Republicans successfully stalled his third and final nominee — Sotomayor and Kagan will continue shaping the law in ways that long outlast his presidency.Don’t call the 111th and 112th justices Obama loyalists — at least not yet. Lee Epstein, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied how “loyal” Supreme Court justices are to the presidents who appoint them, said “it’s actually hard to know” where Sotomayor and Kagan fall — in part due to their relatively young tenures under just the one president so far.Yet Epstein’s preliminary assessment may surprise skeptics of judicial independence and maybe even please Obama, who holds such independence in high esteem. “Sotomayor and Kagan appear to be disloyal, voting in favor of Obama only around 50 percent of the time when the average is close to 66 percent,” she said.As the first Latina justice, Sotomayor has already carved out a distinctive place both on and off the court. Off the court, she’s often referred to as “the people’s justice”: The Bronx-born Sotomayor draws bigger crowds than anyone else on the Supreme Court, and she likes to mingle with them and demystify the law with a populist warmth that her more elite colleagues wouldn’t dare attempt. On the court, her decades of experience as a prosecutor and a trial judge in New York have come in handy as she has developed into one of the bench’s strongest voices on criminal justice issues. She’s even opened up about her personal life during oral arguments.On the law, Sotomayor has stood up to the court’s more conservative members — including Roberts himself — when the Constitution’s promise of equality has been under fire.“The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination,” Sotomayor wrote in a strongly worded dissent to a 2013 ruling that upheld Michigan’s decision to outlaw affirmative action at the ballot box.She was on the losing side in that case, but the spirit of her words — a riff on Roberts’ views in a 2007 school integration case — was vindicated in 2016, when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin’s limited consideration of race in its admissions process. Obama heralded the outcome, which his administration had supported before the court.“We are not a country that guarantees equal outcomes, but we do strive to provide an equal shot to everybody,” the president said this past June after the ruling came down. Kagan, it turns out, recused herself from that case due to her previous role as the president’s first solicitor general. In 2009, that job found her arguing before Sotomayor, in the latter’s debut as a justice, in a little case called Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which ushered in a new era for money in politics.Although she lost the Citizens United case back then, Kagan has asserted herself as an intellectual force on the court, both in her written opinions and during oral arguments. Some even suggest she is moving into the space created by the death of Scalia. The late justice happened to be an early Kagan fan, and the pair developed a bond over duck hunting.“I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation. But I hope he sends us someone smart,” Scalia reportedly told Obama senior adviser David Axelrod during a White House correspondents’ dinner. “Let me put a finer point on it. I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.”Since her confirmation in 2010, Kagan has drawn praise for her wit and clear, lively prose. She’ll draw from popular culture, children’s books and other unlikely sources to get her point across. And court observers like to point out that the former Harvard Law School dean is one of the sharpest questioners at oral argument.“The thought [Obama] put into each of those selections will pay large dividends,” said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who taught Kagan in law school and was her early booster for the Supreme Court. Tribe didn’t feel as positively about Sotomayor at the start, but now he said both have “proven to be remarkably able justices, each in her own distinctive way.”According to Sotomayor, Obama once asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, “Are you happy with the two sisters I brought you?”Ginsburg, the court’s second-ever female justice, had been several years without a female colleague at the court before Sotomayor’s arrival. Her response to Obama perfectly captures the size of this step after the court’s two centuries of male dominance: “I’m very, very happy. But I’ll be even happier when you give me five more.”If his public statements about the Supreme Court’s role mean anything, Obama didn’t pick Sotomayor and Kagan specifically because they were women, let alone because he expected they’d vote for a particular policy.“I don’t have litmus tests around any of these issues,” Obama once told a group of reporters when asked if a judge’s position on women’s rights was a prerequisite for his Supreme Court nominees. He was more thoughtful. It’s probably not an overstatement to say he was a nerd about how he approached his nominees. And if he had to rely on the nerdy SCOTUSblog — a go-to source for lawyers and academics for all things Supreme Court — to explain his thinking to the American public, so be it.Indeed, years before he was elected president, Obama was thinking long and hard about the role of judges in a constitutional democracy. He disliked the idea of courts being used as an avenue for partisan politics.“Because federal judges receive lifetime appointments and often serve through the terms of multiple presidents,” Obama wrote in his 2006 bestselling book, The Audacity of Hope, “it behooves a president ― and benefits our democracy ― to find moderate nominees who can garner some measure of bipartisan support.”Obama was talking then about Senate norms around the judicial confirmation process, which broke down, perhaps irreparably, during his eight years in office. But his words could equally well apply today to Merrick Garland, the highly respected appellate judge the president wanted to fill the seat left vacant by Scalia’s death.After passing him over in 2009 and 2010, Obama settled on Garland the third time around. The highly qualified nominee came with two decades of experience on a powerful federal appeals court in Washington ― the same court where Scalia, Roberts, Ginsburg and Thomas once served.Garland didn’t break the mold like Sotomayor and Kagan, however, and liberals were disappointed that a moderate, older, white man got the nod instead of someone younger or with more progressive bona fides. And yet to Obama, all three nominees shared a critical characteristic: empathy for those on the receiving end of the law.“He understands the way the law affects the daily reality of people’s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times,” Obama said of Garland, echoing the words he used in announcing his other two nominees. Words he repeated when he laid out his vision for Scalia’s replacement on SCOTUSblog.“A sterling record. A deep respect for the judiciary’s role. An understanding of the way the world really works. That’s what I’m considering as I fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court,” Obama wrote last February.Obama’s legacy at the Supreme Court is historic and complicated. And under his successor, there’s no telling what an invigorated conservative majority will do to it. (As of this writing, yet another potentially fatal Obamacare challenge is inching its way to the court.)Verrilli, the former solicitor general, said he hopes Americans remember how Obama’s administration fought for what it believed in under the law and the Constitution.“What I think and what I hope is that what the public will see and what history will see is that we fought for progressive causes and progressive ideals and that we did so in a manner that was consistent with our profound respect for the rule of law and the highest and best traditions of advocacy before the Supreme Court,” Verrilli said. “That’s what I hope and that’s what I believe.”"

The court’s compromise, difficult though it was, wasn’t nearly enough to appease conservatives, whose wrath against the chief justice only grew when they learned that he’d changed his vote in the case, after initially siding with the four justices who wanted to strike down the law.Republicans still haven’t forgotten how Roberts, a George W. Bush nominee, broke ranks and voted with the court’s liberal bloc. The public may never know exactly what went down at the Supreme Court in the weeks the justices pondered their decision. But the chief is known for resisting partisanship, and another justice has suggested that the desire to safeguard the court’s legitimacy may have led him to hand Obama his biggest legal victory.“The institution moves you, and perhaps even more a chief justice,” an unnamed Supreme Court colleague told National Law Journal reporter Marcia Coyle for her 2013 book, The Roberts Court: The Struggle for the Constitution.For all the highlights, including a second watershed victory for Obamacare in 2015, there were lowlights. Verrilli points to the court’s invalidation of a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as his biggest loss as solicitor general — one that continues to reverberate today.“I was concerned with what would follow if it were invalidated, that it would open the doors to enact aggressive voting suppression measures. And that’s what happened,” Verrilli said of the Roberts-written decision, which was joined by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, as well as Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Three years on, Congress is yet to answer Obama’s call to restore the full law.Dissenting in this and other cases with civil rights on the line were the two individuals who are probably Obama’s biggest contribution to the Supreme Court: Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Even if the president ultimately could not tilt the court’s ideological balance — Republicans successfully stalled his third and final nominee — Sotomayor and Kagan will continue shaping the law in ways that long outlast his presidency.Don’t call the 111th and 112th justices Obama loyalists — at least not yet. Lee Epstein, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied how “loyal” Supreme Court justices are to the presidents who appoint them, said “it’s actually hard to know” where Sotomayor and Kagan fall — in part due to their relatively young tenures under just the one president so far.Yet Epstein’s preliminary assessment may surprise skeptics of judicial independence and maybe even please Obama, who holds such independence in high esteem. “Sotomayor and Kagan appear to be disloyal, voting in favor of Obama only around 50 percent of the time when the average is close to 66 percent,” she said.As the first Latina justice, Sotomayor has already carved out a distinctive place both on and off the court. Off the court, she’s often referred to as “the people’s justice”: The Bronx-born Sotomayor draws bigger crowds than anyone else on the Supreme Court, and she likes to mingle with them and demystify the law with a populist warmth that her more elite colleagues wouldn’t dare attempt. On the court, her decades of experience as a prosecutor and a trial judge in New York have come in handy as she has developed into one of the bench’s strongest voices on criminal justice issues. She’s even opened up about her personal life during oral arguments.On the law, Sotomayor has stood up to the court’s more conservative members — including Roberts himself — when the Constitution’s promise of equality has been under fire.“The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination,” Sotomayor wrote in a strongly worded dissent to a 2013 ruling that upheld Michigan’s decision to outlaw affirmative action at the ballot box.She was on the losing side in that case, but the spirit of her words — a riff on Roberts’ views in a 2007 school integration case — was vindicated in 2016, when the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin’s limited consideration of race in its admissions process. Obama heralded the outcome, which his administration had supported before the court.“We are not a country that guarantees equal outcomes, but we do strive to provide an equal shot to everybody,” the president said this past June after the ruling came down. Kagan, it turns out, recused herself from that case due to her previous role as the president’s first solicitor general. In 2009, that job found her arguing before Sotomayor, in the latter’s debut as a justice, in a little case called Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which ushered in a new era for money in politics.Although she lost the Citizens United case back then, Kagan has asserted herself as an intellectual force on the court, both in her written opinions and during oral arguments. Some even suggest she is moving into the space created by the death of Scalia. The late justice happened to be an early Kagan fan, and the pair developed a bond over duck hunting.“I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation. But I hope he sends us someone smart,” Scalia reportedly told Obama senior adviser David Axelrod during a White House correspondents’ dinner. “Let me put a finer point on it. I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.”Since her confirmation in 2010, Kagan has drawn praise for her wit and clear, lively prose. She’ll draw from popular culture, children’s books and other unlikely sources to get her point across. And court observers like to point out that the former Harvard Law School dean is one of the sharpest questioners at oral argument.“The thought [Obama] put into each of those selections will pay large dividends,” said Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who taught Kagan in law school and was her early booster for the Supreme Court. Tribe didn’t feel as positively about Sotomayor at the start, but now he said both have “proven to be remarkably able justices, each in her own distinctive way.”According to Sotomayor, Obama once asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, “Are you happy with the two sisters I brought you?”Ginsburg, the court’s second-ever female justice, had been several years without a female colleague at the court before Sotomayor’s arrival. Her response to Obama perfectly captures the size of this step after the court’s two centuries of male dominance: “I’m very, very happy. But I’ll be even happier when you give me five more.”If his public statements about the Supreme Court’s role mean anything, Obama didn’t pick Sotomayor and Kagan specifically because they were women, let alone because he expected they’d vote for a particular policy.“I don’t have litmus tests around any of these issues,” Obama once told a group of reporters when asked if a judge’s position on women’s rights was a prerequisite for his Supreme Court nominees. He was more thoughtful. It’s probably not an overstatement to say he was a nerd about how he approached his nominees. And if he had to rely on the nerdy SCOTUSblog — a go-to source for lawyers and academics for all things Supreme Court — to explain his thinking to the American public, so be it.Indeed, years before he was elected president, Obama was thinking long and hard about the role of judges in a constitutional democracy. He disliked the idea of courts being used as an avenue for partisan politics.“Because federal judges receive lifetime appointments and often serve through the terms of multiple presidents,” Obama wrote in his 2006 bestselling book, The Audacity of Hope, “it behooves a president ― and benefits our democracy ― to find moderate nominees who can garner some measure of bipartisan support.”Obama was talking then about Senate norms around the judicial confirmation process, which broke down, perhaps irreparably, during his eight years in office. But his words could equally well apply today to Merrick Garland, the highly respected appellate judge the president wanted to fill the seat left vacant by Scalia’s death.After passing him over in 2009 and 2010, Obama settled on Garland the third time around. The highly qualified nominee came with two decades of experience on a powerful federal appeals court in Washington ― the same court where Scalia, Roberts, Ginsburg and Thomas once served.Garland didn’t break the mold like Sotomayor and Kagan, however, and liberals were disappointed that a moderate, older, white man got the nod instead of someone younger or with more progressive bona fides. And yet to Obama, all three nominees shared a critical characteristic: empathy for those on the receiving end of the law.“He understands the way the law affects the daily reality of people’s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times,” Obama said of Garland, echoing the words he used in announcing his other two nominees. Words he repeated when he laid out his vision for Scalia’s replacement on SCOTUSblog.“A sterling record. A deep respect for the judiciary’s role. An understanding of the way the world really works. That’s what I’m considering as I fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court,” Obama wrote last February.Obama’s legacy at the Supreme Court is historic and complicated. And under his successor, there’s no telling what an invigorated conservative majority will do to it. (As of this writing, yet another potentially fatal Obamacare challenge is inching its way to the court.)Verrilli, the former solicitor general, said he hopes Americans remember how Obama’s administration fought for what it believed in under the law and the Constitution.“What I think and what I hope is that what the public will see and what history will see is that we fought for progressive causes and progressive ideals and that we did so in a manner that was consistent with our profound respect for the rule of law and the highest and best traditions of advocacy before the Supreme Court,” Verrilli said. “That’s what I hope and that’s what I believe.”"

The biggest offenders were halibut and snapper ― which were mislabeled 100 percent of the time. Researchers found that flounder had often replaced fish labeled as halibut.

However, in the U.S., ‘madai’ is translated into ‘red snapper.’”Barber said. “According to the FDA, only northern red snapper can be sold under the name of ‘red snapper.’ As such, when red sea bream snapper is sold as ‘red snapper,’ this is legally seafood mislabelling.” Substitutions at other places in the study seemed intentional, as more expensive fish like red snapper was clearly swapped out with a lower value replacement like tilapia or white bass ― a freshwater fish that Barber said could in no way be confused for red snapper or red sea bream snapper.“The irony in this substitution is that ... from the perspective of a consumer interested in promoting sustainability through their food choices, sushi made from tilapia would be viewed as more desirable, and red snapper, less desirable,” Barber noted. “Given that consumers seem to be accepting of tilapia sushi, there is likely an untapped market where consumers could choose more sustainable options like tilapia when they go out for sushi.”On the other hand, when it came to tuna, researchers found that bigeye tuna, which the World Wildlife Fund classifies as “vulnerable,” was used as a common replacement for other tuna sushi offerings ― even for those that are less threatened, like yellowfin tuna, which was mislabeled 78 precent of the time. Of all tuna offerings, bluefin tuna was never found to be mislabeled.In addition to the issues surrounding sustainability, the study’s authors were quick to point out the public health risks associated with mislabeled fish. Halibut, for example, was was replaced with olive flounder 33 percent of the time, a fish that has previously caused rampant food poisoning in Japan.Of all the findings, salmon and mackerel came out looking like the most reliable options.

Those nominations ultimately went to other candidates, but Trump said last month that he could “see an important place for [Giuliani] in the administration at a later date.”It’s unclear what exactly Giuliani will be doing in his new role, but it could raise conflict of interest issues. Giuliani chairs the global cybersecurity practice at Greenberg Traurig and is chairman and CEO of Giuliani Partners, a consulting firm he launched after leaving public office. As The Huffington Post previously reported, Giuliani Partners had clients with political interests that could conflict with Giuliani’s governmental duties. Giuliani also has ties to foreign governments and political parties. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for further comment. Discussing the new position on “Fox & Friends,” Giuliani said on Thursday that the idea is to bring together “corporate leaders and their technological people.” Trump has met with Silicon Valley executives before. His biggest tech ally has been PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who said this month he does not plan to take a White House job. Giuliani said on Thursday that “a lot of the solutions are out there, we’re just not sharing them. It’s like cancer. You know, there’s cancer research going on all over the place ― you’d almost wish they’d get together in one room and maybe we’d find a cure.”Kyle Wilhoit, a cybersecurity researcher at the firm DomainTools, said he is a “bit skeptical” about Giuliani’s appointment. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to know his experience with cybersecurity,” he said. But he added that “a lot of what we do as cybersecurity experts revolves around sharing, and it’s positive Giuliani recognizes that.” Trump repeatedly questioned the U.S. intelligence community’s consensus that Russia hacked into the Democratic National Committee with the goal of interfering in the 2016 election. During the campaign, he also openly invited Russia to hack Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. He finally acknowledged this week that Russia was probably behind the hacks, but added “look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking.”Last month, when asked whether he would support sanctions against Russia over the cyberattacks, Trump blamed computers for the whole mess.“Computers have complicated lives very greatly,” he said.” The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on.”This post has been updated with comment from Wilhoit."

Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) talks with reporters after a meeting of the House Republican Conference in the Capitol, Oct. 21, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587724c11700008501929a4d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It should be an easy vote.House Republicans have successfully voted to repeal parts of Obamacare ― or the entire thing ― more than 60 times in the last six years. But now that lawmakers could actually be making law, there’s sudden apprehension in parts of the GOP conference.Republicans generally agree they want the 2010 health care law gone. It’s just that many disagree over what they should replace it with.Now conservatives and some GOP moderates, concerned that Republicans don’t have a clear plan on how they’ll move forward with an Obamacare alternative, could team up later this week to take down the first real vote in the House to set up a repeal of the law.Even if lawmakers do, as expected, get behind this vote setting up an Obamacare repeal on Friday, there are already signs that some Republicans may eventually withhold support on a final repeal vote until GOP leadership releases details of an alternative.Those concerns would be moot in President-elect Donald Trump’s version of the Obamacare repeal and replace, where those actions would happen “essentially simultaneously.” (“Most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably the same day ― could be the same hour,” Trump said Wednesday, evidently believing in an alternate universe where Congress works like that.)Here in the real world, where Senate action on any bill generally takes a week and an Obamacare replacement could take months or even years, GOP leaders are trying to convince members to trust that Republicans will be able to come up with something that won’t come back to haunt them. Some members, however, are reluctant to take that leap of faith.A last-minute whip operation from Freedom Caucus hard-liners has raised new questions about the first vote on Friday. The budget resolution, acting as a vehicle for an Obamacare repeal, advanced out of the Senate early Thursday morning and is supposed to get a vote in the House on Friday.GOP leadership aides are brushing aside any concerns about the vote going down.“I feel great,” one GOP leadership aide told The Huffington Post Wednesday night. An aide for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Republicans were “looking forward to a good vote.”All the same, leadership may want to double-check their head count.Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) spent much of the House’s long vote series Wednesday night whipping members of the HFC and talking to conservatives sympathetic to their cause.“You know our concerns,” Jordan told HuffPost on Wednesday. “We want to make sure we fully repeal it. We want to make sure it happens in two years, not three or four.”After the evening votes, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) met with Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the co-chairman of the moderate GOP Tuesday Group, who said this week that he has “reservations” about voting for a repeal. According to Meadows, he and Dent discussed how many moderates might vote against the resolution to set up a fast-track for an Obamacare repeal.“This particular budget issue has found common ground between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus,” Meadows told HuffPost Wednesday night.Although the two groups have different ideas of what a replacement should look like, both of them want more information from GOP leadership on the Obamacare alternative.“So the question becomes, will we continue down that path of getting more details quickly after a vote on Friday?” Meadows said.Meadows suggested that if the Freedom Caucus wanted to take down this first vote, they could ― though some HFC members have questioned whether that’s the best strategy.Jordan was taking the temperature of conservatives, and there look to be more than a few far-right Republicans who will vote no ― either out of concern over the resolution deeming the addition of more than $9 trillion in new debt as “appropriate” or because leadership has offered few details about a replacement.Jordan noted that some Republicans are pushing to keep the Obamacare taxes in place. Others are pushing for a longer delay to the date of enactment. And still others are trying to keep Planned Parenthood funding in the health care law. These are all ideas that are anathema to conservatives.“There are some of our Freedom Caucus guys who are willing to say, ‘Let’s give them a chance to bring something conservative in a replacement,’” Meadows said. “There are some who say, ‘We know what’s coming.’”“If leadership had not committed to provide additional details to address some of the concerns, only some of the concerns of the Freedom Caucus, we probably would have taken a much harder line,” Meadows added.Thursday could be a turning point for the vote. If the number of moderates with reservations about repealing reaches a critical mass, conservatives who are undecided or leaning against the bill might come out against it. If moderates get on board, conservatives might decide to go along on Friday as well.Freedom Caucus leaders can keep a close eye on where their members stand using a private website they created ― whipteam.com ― to group-text members and find out which way they’re voting.Even if the vote on Friday goes smoothly, this would just be the first in a series of votes to repeal and replace Obamacare. In some ways, this should be the easiest vote. Republicans are merely setting up the process to begin a repeal. But as they grapple with more details about a replacement, and as leadership tries to push a repeal through before Republicans ever start debating a replacement ― or even hold a hearing on the impact of getting rid of Obamacare ― a once-easy messaging vote might prove more difficult than leaders have let on."

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) asked.“A little of both,” Tillerson replied.But despite the former CEO’s maneuvering, environmentalists hailed Wednesday’s legal ruling and the timing of the decision.“Rex Tillerson may be trying to make his getaway, but it’s good to see that the courts may yet hold Exxon responsible for the damage it’s done to this planet and to our democracy,” 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben said in a statement.“This is a huge victory for democracy and uncovering the truth about Exxon’s decades of deception and with Rex Tillerson poised to be the next U.S. Secretary of State, the timing couldn’t be better,” said Tamar Lawrence-Samuel, policy director for the watchdog group Corporate Accountability International, in a statement."

In contrast, 2% of films employed 0 or 1 man in the roles considered, 3% employed 2 to 5 men, 19% employed 6 to 9 men, and the remaining majority (76%) employed 10 or more men.In a separate study from the same institute published in May 2016, women directors were shown to fare slightly better in independent films, taking up 28 percent of the share there. That’s no surprise given the surfeit of men hired to direct studio blockbusters.If you’re wondering whether women didn’t create commercially viable or quality films in 2016, that's simply not the case. Women were behind a number of big-budget films, like “Kung Fu Panda 3,” co-directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson; “Miracles from Heaven,” directed by Patricia Riggen; “Queen of Katwe,” directed by Mira Nair; and “Bridget Jones’s Baby,” directed by Sharon Maguire.Critically acclaimed films in 2016 like “American Honey,” “The Edge of Seventeen,” “Maggie’s Plan,” “Certain Women” and “The Fits” were also all directed by women.The results of studies like the ones from San Diego State can come down to the gatekeepers — if female directors aren’t being considered for big-budget ventures or reboots of beloved films, it stands to reason they might not figure in box office hits.

VW installed emissions-defeating software on 11 million vehicles, compared to the 104,000 FCA vehicles the EPA says contain illicit software.Fiat Chrysler faces fines of up to $44,000 per vehicle sold in violation of the rules.Sergio Marchionne, Fiat Chrysler’s CEO, strongly denied the allegations and said the company has complied with EPA requests.“We have done nothing that is illegal,” he said, according to Reuters. “There was never any intent of creating conditions that were designed to defeat the testing process. This is absolute nonsense.”Trading in Fiat Chrysler stock was halted Thursday morning after shares plummeted nearly 16 percent on the news.“Failing to disclose software that affects emissions in a vehicle’s engine is a serious violation of the law, which can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe,” Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, said in a statement. “We continue to investigate the nature and impact of these devices. All automakers must play by the same rules, and we will continue to hold companies accountable that gain an unfair and illegal competitive advantage.”In a statement to The Huffington Post, the automaker said it is “disappointed” in the EPA’s decision, and indicated that it intends to fight the charges.“FCA US intends to work with the incoming administration to present its case and resolve this matter fairly and equitably and to assure the EPA and FCA US customers that the company’s diesel-powered vehicles meet all applicable regulatory requirements,” Fiat Chrysler said.“FCA US diesel engines are equipped with state-of-the-art emission control systems hardware, including selective catalytic reduction,” the statement went on. “Every auto manufacturer must employ various strategies to control tailpipe emissions in order to balance EPA’s regulatory requirements for low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and requirements for engine durability and performance, safety and fuel efficiency. FCA US believes that its emission control systems meet the applicable requirements.”Fiat, an Italian automaker, took a controlling stake in Chrysler in 2011 as the U.S. auto industry was climbing out of the Great Recession."

A Trump spokesman denied that Le Pen would meet with the president-elect or anyone from the transition team, telling reporters that “Trump Tower is open to the public.” An aide to Le Pen said a meeting with Trump “is not on her public agenda,” but added, “We don’t communicate about private visits. Le Pen is a deeply polarizing figure in France, where she is frequently accused of racism and xenophobia for her nationalist, anti-immigrant policy positions. The daughter of National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, she regularly claims to be “fighting the Islamisation of French society.” In a 2010 speech, she likened the presence of Muslims in France to the Nazi occupation.Le Pen was accompanied to Trump Tower by her partner, George “Guido” Lombardi, a longtime friend of Trump’s who lives in the building and was active in the “Citizens for Trump” campaign this fall. Lombardi is also the leader of a group called the North Atlantic League, which espouses anti-Islamic views, and warns that “Judeo-Christian civilization” is under attack from Islam, the media and a “cultural assault.”Like Trump, Le Pen’s presidential campaign is built on a populist, nationalist ideal that promises a return to bygone days. Both she and Trump supported Britain’s vote to exit the European Union last year, and both are champions of strict border controls to prevent the arrival of undocumented immigrants. Le Pen has repeatedly said she admires Trump, calling his victory in November “a sign of hope” for hard-line conservative European politicians.Trump has met several times with another populist European politician, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party.It was unclear late Thursday morning whether Le Pen would ride the elevator to Trump’s offices, or just sit downstairs and drink coffee."

On Wednesday, the 58-year-old actress announced that she and her fiancée, Chelsea Fairless, have called it quits. The couple had originally planned to tie the knot Jan. 8, which is also DeLaria’s parents’ wedding anniversary, People magazine reported. DeLaria, who also appeared on “Will & Grace” and “Californication,” confirmed the news in a Jan. 11 Instagram photo. The cheeky post is a take on David Gest and Liza Minnelli’s legendary 2002 nuptials, with DeLaria and Fairless’s faces superimposed on Gest and Minnelli’s bodies alongside Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor.In the background, Roxette’s ‘80s hit, “It Must Have Been Love,” which was featured on the soundtrack to “Pretty Woman,” plays. Minnelli and Gest split in 2007 in what’s since been described as Hollywood’s “dirtiest divorce,” but DeLaria explained in the post that she wanted the comparisons between the two relationships to stop there. “Our split is amicable. Please exclude us from the tragic and basic celebrity breakup narrative,” she wrote in the caption below. “We were happy together for four years and will remain in each other’s lives. In fact, we look forward to finding new ways to torture each other.” Last year, DeLaria told Out magazine how she’d met Fairless, a fashion editor, through co-star, Emma Myles, during the first season of “Orange is The New Black” in 2012. “We set up a date, and within 10 minutes, we pretty much knew. I tend to push relationships away, but this was magical,” she said. “We were screaming with laughter and finishing each other’s sentences.” The pair got engaged in February 2015.

And while the 16-year-old classical crossover singer is facing harsh criticism for her decision to perform, she’s helping fight another battle.Jackie’s sister Juliet came out as transgender in 2015 and is one of three transgender students suing a Pennsylvania school district over their right to use the bathrooms that best correspond with their gender identity.“For me it’s not political,” Jackie said about trans rights in an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday. “It’s just accepting people for who they are.”Juliet, 18, told the Times she will not attend the inauguration. She said she has “prior engagements” but will be there “in spirit.” It’s not clear whether she received an invitation to the event.The incoming administration’s dubious position on transgender rights is of great concern to many LGBTQ activists.Vice President-elect Mike Pence has railed against a directive put forward by President Barack Obama’s administration that threatens public schools’ funding if they fail to allow trans students access to bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.“The federal government has no business getting involved in issues of this nature,” Pence said in May.In April, the president-elect said he was fine with allowing trans people to use whichever bathroom they prefer. But nearly three months later, he voiced his support for a North Carolina law that bars them from doing just that.Mike Evancho, Jackie and Juliet’s father, wouldn’t tell the Times who he voted for in the 2016 presidential election, but said his political leanings weren’t a factor in the family’s decision to support Juliet’s legal battle.“We’re fighting this discrimination at the high school,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who’s going into the office, we would still fight that fight.”Jackie said her inauguration appearance won’t stop her from being able to “100 percent” support her sister’s fight for legal rights.Trump tweeted earlier this month that Jackie’s record sales “skyrocketed” after she announced her inauguration performance, though there is little evidence to support this claim.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to Jackie Evancho as a country singer.

65,GREEN,New Pipeline Protest Models Itself On Dakota Access Fight,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trans-pecos-pipeline-protest-dakota-access_us_58754bc4e4b092a6cae388f6,The target this time is the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in west Texas.,2017-01-12,Protesters trying to stop a natural gas pipeline in west Texas were arrested on Jan 7 near Marfa.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5877cee61200002d00ad73d8.jpeg?cache=zJ6hVxYeZu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A new front has opened in the fight against the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The battleground this time is rural west Texas, where a small, yet intense opposition to building the Trans-Pecos Pipeline has gained force in recent days.The rugged geography and arid climate around the Texas pipeline is different than the North Dakota landscape where thousands of Native Americans and their allies have camped in the snow and risked arrest to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. But the protesters are copying the playbook that brought victories to the Standing Rock Sioux and setbacks to developer Energy Transfer Partners.Many of the protesters in west Texas are also Native American and identify as water protectors or defenders. Small groups have bunkered down at sites like the Two Rivers Camp, near Marfa, and promise an extended resistance through the winter.“We saw what they did successfully. We’ve learned some of the logistics and tactics,” said 68-year-old Jesse Manciaz, a former Marine and a member of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas. “The perspective from being Indian is that this land is sacred. Many see our land as real estate, but it’s more than that. It’s a living entity that’s being destroyed.”The 148-mile Trans-Pecos Pipeline, which runs underground, would transport natural gas, extracted by fracking in the state, through the Chihuahuan Desert and canyons of the Big Bend region of the Rio Grande and across the border to Mexico. Opponents fear that en route, the volatile gas could ignite and start a devastating fire. In one of the first big actions against the pipeline, several dozen people holding signs entered an active construction site this past Saturday and two protesters who had attached themselves to construction equipment were arrested and released.Mark Glover, one of the two people charged Saturday with trespassing by the Presidio County sheriff’s office, told HuffPost that he hoped his arrest raised the profile of the fight against the Trans-Pecos project. “Anytime you can bring attention to an unjust corporate move, to a dereliction in our laws that is against the people … that to me is worth the time I spent underneath the bulldozer and in jail,” said Glover, 61, of Alpine, Texas.Glover complained that the oil and gas industry sits in the driver seat of Texas politics. “The people were put in the back seat. But we don’t want to be in the back seat anymore. We want to be in the front,” he said.A third pipeline protest led by Native Americans and others is gathering strength in Florida against the 515-mile Sabal Trail project.The Trans-Pecos Pipeline is about one-eighth the length of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access project, but it may be much harder to stop. The Texas pipeline is 90 percent built, and completion is scheduled for March.Because this pipeline cuts entirely through private land, government authorities have fewer ways to exercise oversight than they did with the Dakota Access project. The state already used eminent domain to clear land for the Texas pipeline, which has reportedly sparked lawsuits from some property owners.The Dakota project has been at a standstill since December when the Obama administration declined to issue a permit for the final section of the crude oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux’s water source. The tribe argues the pipeline would violate federal laws and potentially contaminate their drinking water and spoil sacred land. While taking their case to court, the tribe was joined on the Northern Plains by thousands of supporters. There were some violent clashes with police, and more than 580 people have been arrested since August. With the first arrests of Trans-Pecos protesters in his county earlier this month, Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez worried about their intentions. “They’re peaceful, but you get a couple in there who want to stir it up and cause some drama,” Dominguez told HuffPost. “They have the right to protest, but they need to do it legally.”Energy Transfer Partners contends that the Trans-Pecos Pipeline will improve regional air quality by supplying cleaner-burning natural gas as an alternative to wood-, coal- and diesel-powered plants in northern Mexico. Pipelines like this are necessary because renewable energy sources can’t keep up with America’s demand, a company spokeswoman said in a statement. “We understand that there are a number of opinions regarding our country’s need for infrastructure, including underground pipelines to transport natural gas and crude oil. However, underground pipelines provide the most environmentally safe and the most efficient means to transport natural gas, crude oil or other carbon-based energy products that are critical to Americans’ daily lives, and to our economy,” said spokeswoman Vicki Granado.

It is court enforceable,” Attorney General Loretta Lynch said.",2017-01-12,Captain Erik Pecha of the Baltimore Police Department chats with demonstrators in front of the Baltimore Police Department Western District station during a protest against the death in police custody of Freddie Gray in 2015. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5877a0d7120000c301ad72c6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The city of Baltimore and the Department of Justice agreed to a far-reaching deal Thursday that will require the Baltimore Police Department to implement a more transparent disciplinary system and prohibit officers from stopping city residents without reasonable suspicion.The proposed 242-page consent decree follows a 15-month-long investigation into the police department, launched after the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray in 2015. The reforms will bring the department in line with the Constitution.“The agreement is robust and comprehensive. It includes a range of reforms to achieve our three main goals: to ensure effective and constitutional policing, to restore community’s trust in law enforcement and to advance public and officer safety,” said Attorney General Loretta Lynch at a press conference in Baltimore on Thursday. “It will help BPD gain the cooperation it needs from residents to fight and prevent crime. Most importantly, it reflects significant input from the people of Baltimore.”The decree that the Department of Justice filed in the federal court is “designed to enhance BPD’s relationship with its community through increased transparency and public input, improve oversight and accountability systems to ensure that the Department will collect and analyze data on officer activities, impose discipline for misconduct fairly and efficiently, and enhance support for officers through robust employee wellness programs, law enforcement policies, training, and supervision,” according to the text.It was announced eight days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), has been skeptical of the Justice Department’s pattern-or-practice investigations and consent decrees such as the one reached with Baltimore, leaving the future of federal assistance with police reform uncertain.Lynch addressed concerns that Sessions would null the agreement on Thursday. While she and other key Obama administration officials within the Justice Department will be leaving, career staffers on the team that negotiated the consent decree will remain at the DOJ after Trump takes office.“This agreement will live on. It is court enforceable,” Lynch said. “There will be an independent monitor, and it will live on as a document of the court and as binding agreement between the city and the Department of Justice.” A damning report released in August detailed the DOJ’s findings that the BPD routinely abused the civil rights of residents, conducted unconstitutional searches, retaliated against civilians exercising free-speech and did not hold cops accountable for misconduct. Black and Latino residents were disproportionately targeted by the department’s practices, the report said.Vanita Gupta, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the DOJ, said the practices “eroded trust” and “put the lives of officers and residents at risk.”“Under the consent decree, the city and BPD will implement comprehensive reforms to end the legacy of Baltimore’s zero-tolerance policing,” Gupta said on Thursday. “And in its place, Baltimore is empowering officers to engage in proactive, community-oriented policing.”Now all strip searches would need to be “approved by a permanent rank supervisor, lieutenant or above, and be conducted in a setting that ensures the privacy of the person searched,” unless there are exigent circumstances. The provision is a response to the Justice Department’s findings that civilians were strip searched for offenses as minor as having a broken car headlight.The agreement also places restrictions on arrests for several low-level offenses, including disorderly conduct, failure to obey and officer, gambling, making a false statement and misdemeanor trespassing. When possible, officers must seek permission before making such an arrest, or must notify a supervisor as soon as practically possible.Officers will be instructed to use the “least intrusive response appropriate under the circumstances” for quality of life offenses (such as public urination and littering). “In other words, a verbal warning and counseling is preferable to a Citation, and a Citation is preferable to a custodial Arrest,” the agreement states.The decree also includes First Amendment protections. “BPD will ensure that officers do not take any police action in retaliation for individuals lawfully exercising their right to witness, observe, record, comment on, or peacefully protest police activity,” it states.And it mandates that the department will update its oversight methods, how it tracks misconduct as well as officer training protocol. The city will form a Community Oversight Task Force that will help residents hold police officers accountable for misconduct. Civilians will also be tapped to serve on police trial boards (though the city’s police union says that would violate the union’s bargaining agreement with the city). Read the entire decree below: This article has been updated with new details, including comments from Lynch and Gupta."

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-subsidy_us_58779d8fe4b092a6cae585f7,"Call it what you like, but the oil and gas industry receives SOMETHING that works like a subsidy.",2017-01-12,"Rex Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil, testifies during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing to become secretary of state on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., Jan. 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5877e1191700008501929c46.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, denied that tax breaks to fossil fuel companies amount to subsidies during his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday.Yet Exxon Mobil Corp., the oil giant Tillerson worked at for 41 years and led for 10, receives between $700 million and $1 billion per year in government giveaways, according to a new analysis by Oil Change International, a nonprofit research firm that tracks the fossil fuel industry. During the hearing, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked Tillerson if he would pursue a 2009 pledge ― led by the United States and backed by Russia, China, India and 16 other nations ― to scale back subsidies for oil and other carbon dioxide-spewing fuels. Tillerson argued that he would have little influence over incentives baked into the tax code, and said he was “not aware of anything that the fossil fuel industry gets that I would characterize as a subsidy.”“The industry’s long-time argument is that liability loopholes and sweetheart tax breaks like the Intangible Drilling Costs are not a form of special treatment for the oil and gas industry,” Janet Redman, U.S. policy director at Oil Change International, wrote in the group’s analysis. “In reality, the IDC is specifically designed to make drilling, survey work, clearing ground, workers’ wages, drilling supplies — basically anything you need to produce oil and gas (aka ExxonMobil’s products) — less expensive for oil and gas companies.”Exxon Mobil’s spokesman dismissed the analysis and pointed to a primer by the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas lobbying group.“Oil Change International is not [a] credible source,” Alan Jeffers told The Huffington Post in an email. “As API points out, these frequently criticized provisions are the same as or analogous to those used by other industries.”It’s possible that Tillerson was evading the question on a semantic technicality.Roughly 13 percent of provisions in the Treasury Department’s tax expenditure report provide incentives to energy companies, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Some come in the form of tax credits for wind and solar production, while others allow fossil fuel companies to deduct the upfront costs of drilling or mining for oil, gas or coal.Those deductions function in the same way that provisions to any other business work under the baseline tax code, allowing companies to dock heating costs, postage stamps and employee salaries from their annual tax bill. “The word ‘subsidy’ is a bit of a loaded term, because in order to figure out whether or not a provision is a subsidy, you need to compare it to some kind of baseline as to how the tax code is supposed to work,” Scott Greenberg, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, told HuffPost on Thursday.“As a credit, under all views, that’d be a subsidy,” he went on. “In the case of intangible drilling costs, it’s immediate expensing. Therefore, there’s a case to be made that this is not a tax subsidy and is in fact correct treatment of those capital investments.”Still, the existing tax credit for marginal wells ― oil or gas wells that are nearing depletion ― counts as a subsidy, Greenberg said. The industry depends on such subsidies to avoid losing money by continuing to extract fuel, regardless of drops in the price of oil or gas.But the issue at hand is the federal money allocated to the oil and gas companies in the form of deductions ― not how, technically speaking, those deductions are qualified. “These guys get tax handouts left and right,” Ron Eckstein, communications director for the nonprofit Americans for Tax Fairness, told HuffPost. “[Tillerson] can categorize them as fossil-fuel or manufacturing or business, but Exxon has access to deductions that small businesses and regular families would never get. It’s indisputable.” Yet the push to cut federal handouts to fossil-fuel producers isn’t about leveling the playing field between the world’s largest publicly listed oil company and mom and pop shops. It’s about incentivizing a move away from fuels that worsen global warming and toward zero-emissions energy sources. Study after study shows that even with the implementation of the Paris climate agreement that Trump now threatens to undo, global temperatures are expected to rise by more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century. By that point, the effects of climate change ― more violent storms, rising sea levels, droughts, acidifying oceans ― may become far more intense and impossible to roll back. “Oil and gas subsidies are designed to incentivize fossil fuel production, and the more oil is produced, the cheaper it is, and the more of it we burn,” Redman wrote. “That means greater greenhouse gas pollution and worse climate disruption.”"
68,POLITICS,Obama To End Automatic Residency For Cuban Migrants,Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-to-end-wet-footdry-foot-policy-for-cuban-migrants-report_us_5877f474e4b0e58057fddd09,The surprise move comes after a major uptick in Cuban migration.,2017-01-12,President Barack Obama announced changes to U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58780ba11700008801929d04.jpeg?cache=OfTaUeAeYH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. government will no longer automatically extend residency to Cuban migrants arriving in the country without visas, President Barack Obama announced in a surprise decision Thursday.The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was “designed for a different era,” the president said in a statement.“By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,” he said. “The Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.”The major policy change came with only days left in Obama’s presidency and after the president had worked for years to normalize diplomatic relations and chip away at the decades-old trade embargo. Obama capped his efforts with a visit to Havana last year. The warming of relations with the onetime Cold War enemy became one of his signature foreign policy achievements.As the two countries became closer, Cuban nationals sought to take advantage of the immigration option before it potentially changed. The rule allowed Cubans who reached American soil to immediately apply for U.S. residency, with a quick pathway to citizenship. But the new policy, which was first reported by the Associated Press, ends this program. It also halts a George W. Bush-era program to recruit the island’s medical professionals, according to a congressional source who declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was long despised by Cuban officials, who said the policy encouraged people to take their lives into their hands by crossing the Florida straits illegally in anything that would float. “This has been a big bone of contention for the Cubans throughout this whole process,” Chris Sabatini, a Cuba expert and the executive director of Global Americans, told HuffPost. But in recent years, it’s also become unpopular among older generations of Cuban Americans in Miami, who contend that the policy benefits people who migrate for economic reasons rather than the people fleeing Cuba’s communist government, whom the policy was originally intended to benefit. Ric Herrero, the executive director of #CubaNow, a group that has pressed to liberalize policy toward the island, said the changes would take a “highly contentious issue off [President-elect Donald] Trump’s plate before he enters the White House.”“This is another concrete example that a policy of engagement yields results,” Herrero told HuffPost. “Our migratory policy toward Cuba has been one that’s problematic for many years but no one has been willing to touch it since Clinton’s first term.”Roughly 28,400 Cuban nationals with criminal convictions have for years faced the possibility of deportation from the United States, but the Cuban government has refused to accept them.Some 56,400 Cuban migrants entered the United States without visas last year, according to Customs and Border Protection ― nearly twice the number in 2014. White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters that they did not want to speculate publicly about the policy change and risk encouraging more people to come to the U.S. without authorization.The 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, from which the “wet foot, dry foot” policy originally derives, remains standing, though Obama administration officials urged Congress to repeal it. Cubans who reach U.S. soil will still be allowed to request asylum or other humanitarian relief under U.S. law, but immigration authorities will now treat those claims like those of other foreign nationals.To carry out the new policy, the Cuban government agreed to accept back its nationals in cases where the U.S. starts the deportation policy sooner than four years after that person left the island, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on a call with reporters. That leaves the vast majority of the longstanding cases pending, though Johnson said the Cuban government agreed to review the decisions on a case-by-case basis.“Essentially what the agreement means is that past is past but that the future will be different,” Johnson said.In Congress, supporters of engagement with Cuba applauded the move.“It’s a move that brings our Cuba policy into the modern era while allowing the United States to continue its generous approach to those individuals and refugees with a legitimate claim for asylum,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said.But the fact that the Obama administration is making a major policy change with only a week to go in his presidency concerned some congressional sources.“There is absolutely a need to crack down on the small universe of people abusing the policy, but throwing the baby out with the bathwater AND on the 9th inning AND without Congressional consultation?” a congressional aide said in an email. “Hard to defend.”There was dissent from Congress as well. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a longtime critic of Obama on Cuba policy, called the decision “yet another shameful concession to the Castro regime.”“His policy has been a succession of betrayals of America’s longstanding commitment to human rights and freedom, and a betrayal of the Cuban people who have suffered under oppression for far too long,” Diaz-Balart said in a statement. “This last act of diminishing lifelines to Cubans languishing in totalitarianism is one final despicable betrayal of a people who deserve better from an American president.”The policy change also could put President-elect Donald Trump in an uncomfortable position of agreeing with a last-minute move by the current president he often disparages. The president-elect’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Obama’s decision, but Trump has previously criticized the “wet foot, dry foot” policy. “I don’t think that’s fair,” Trump said in February 2016. “I mean why would that be a fair thing?”This was a breaking story and has been updated throughout."

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hold a press conference in October 2016. Ecuador is assuming leadership of the U.N.'s G-77 bloc.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5877e6941700002d00fde4f9.jpeg?cache=EebclFp9qD&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Eight months after the Panama Papers shed new light on the scale of tax avoidance by the global elite, Ecuador plans to make cracking down on tax havens the centerpiece of its leadership of the G-77 bloc of developing countries at the United Nations.Ecuador formally assumes leadership of the influential group on Friday, and one of its top priorities will be the creation of an international body to combat the practice of hiding wealth in countries with low taxes and secretive financial laws.Tax dodging “is one of the great scourges of the 21st century and we need to put an end to it,” Guillaume Long, Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs and human mobility, told The Huffington Post on Thursday.In an attempt to put its proverbial money where its mouth is, Ecuador is pairing its international initiative with a domestic referendum on whether it should be illegal for any elected official or civil servant to have financial assets in tax havens. A vote on the measure will coincide with the country’s general elections on Feb. 19.Like many other developing countries, Ecuador has a strong stake in reining in tax-dodging schemes since they remain a widespread practice among its own elite class. Cash equal to some 30 percent of Ecuador’s economy escapes the country every year for overseas shell companies, secret bank accounts and other tax shelters, Long estimated.That level of avoidance is a “huge irony,” he said, in light of the cash remittances that flow in from the far-less-privileged segment of Ecuadoreans working abroad. Those transfers totaled more than $2.4 billion in 2015.“Those are basically people from the poorest sectors of society … and that bolsters the Ecuadorean economy, and you have elites, who haven’t migrated because they haven’t had any necessity, who actually take money physically out of the economy and send it away,” Long said.Under the left-wing government of President Rafael Correa, poverty and inequality in Ecuador have dropped dramatically. But much of that gain is dependent on the funding of ambitious social programs. Tax avoidance threatens to undermine that progress ― particularly when the economy slows down, as it did in 2015.Globally, the use of tax havens deprives impoverished nations of $170 billion in tax revenue annually, according to the anti-poverty group Oxfam International.An “intergovernmental United Nations body that fights for tax justice” would provide countries with a forum to challenge the policies of other countries that function as tax havens, Long suggested. He pointed to the way nations can challenge one another’s trade practices at the World Trade Organization, arguing there is no reason that a similar body should not exist to monitor fiscal policies.Such an institution could also be empowered to intervene, Long said, “when it sees there is a kind of race to the bottom between two neighboring states ― one lowering its taxes, the other lowering its taxes ... in order to be able to kind of pull money from each other.”At a July 2015 U.N. conference on financing and development in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the G-77 failed in its efforts to win support for such a global tax body.But Long expressed confidence that the Panama Papers, which revealed the offshore holdings of 140 public officials around the world and resulted in the ouster of Iceland’s prime minister, have changed the politics of the issue.“This year, because of the scandal, because of the Panama Papers, there is a new historic conjuncture that we can use in order to bring this topic forward,” Long said.“The time is ripe,” he added.The prospects for a global tax body may still remain rather dim. The economies of many U.N. member-nations depend on their status as tax havens, and they would likely fight such a proposal vehemently.Eric LeCompte, executive director of the faith-based anti-poverty organization Jubilee USA and moderator of a Thursday panel on tax havens for which Long delivered the opening remarks, nonetheless lauded Ecuador’s leadership on this issue.“It is clear to me that the government of Ecuador has looked at how tax and trade issues impact vulnerable communities in their country,” LeCompte said earlier this week.Short of a global body to combat tax havens, a coordinated push to reduce tax avoidance could involve providing greater resources to developing nations to monitor exports, LeCompte argued. Commercial goods that get past customs officials represent a major source of lost tax revenue, he noted."

John Nicholson, commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan said in the statement, adding that “all possible measures” would be taken to protect Afghan civilians.While the investigation concluded that more than 30 civilians had been killed, it said aircraft providing support had used “the minimum amount of force required to neutralize the various threats from the civilian buildings.”It also found that no civilians were seen or identified, and the dead and wounded were probably inside the buildings used by Taliban fighters. Some of the casualties may also have been caused by a Taliban ammunition dump that exploded.Two U.S. soldiers and three Afghan army commandos were killed and another four Americans and 11 Afghan commandos wounded, with around 26 Taliban fighters also killed.Last year, the U.S. military disciplined 16 service members over a separate incident in Kunduz in 2015, when a U.S. air strike killed 42 people in a hospital run by medical aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Now, President-elect Donald Trump is moving toward what they’ve long wanted: a weak agency that sides with financial predators over consumers.Trump met with former Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-Texas) on Wednesday and is considering Neugebauer to run the CFPB, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed on a Thursday call with reporters.A source close to the transition team told HuffPost that Neugebauer has yet to be offered the job, but that no other candidates are being looked at yet. HuffPost previously reported that Neugebauer’s name was being floated as agency chief if Trump decides to fire the current director, Richard Cordray.When he was in Congress, Neugebauer opposed CFPB actions like the first-ever federal rule cracking down on payday loans. He labeled the agency’s effort to require payday lenders to take basic steps to ensure consumers can pay back their loans and not get trapped in a cycle of debt as a “paternalistic erosion of consumer product choices.” He introduced a bill to overhaul and weaken the agency.As the CFPB was originally designed, the president could not fire its director at will before his five-year term expired. But a federal appeals court ruled last year that the agency structure is unconstitutional. Unless that ruling is overturned by the Supreme Court or reconsidered by the lower court that decided it — the CFPB petitioned that court to vacate the earlier ruling — Trump will be able to remove the Obama-appointed Cordray at any time for any reason.Warren pushed for the CFPB to be created in the wake of the financial crisis as part of the 2010 Wall Street regulatory reform law. It is funded as part of the Federal Reserve system, which means its budget cannot be cut through the congressional appropriations process, and it has a single powerful director, rather than the bipartisan boards found at other agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission.Under Cordray’s leadership, the CFPB has returned $12 billion to 27 million people caught up in various scams, passed pro-consumer rules on issues like mortgage disclosure, proposed a mandatory arbitration rule that is being finalized, and hit banks for conning customers into paying for expensive add-on products that don’t do much. The agency was central in exposing the large-scale checking and credit card fraud at Wells Fargo.CORRECTION: The CFPB has proposed but not finalized a rule on mandatory arbitration."

Before the measure went to a vote, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand addressed the Senate floor urging her colleagues to support the amendment to the measure she proposed this past Tuesday. The amendment was meant to ensure women’s health services under the Affordable Care Act would remain in place even if the ACA were repealed. Gillibrand explained exactly why this amendment is so integral to women’s health and well-being. “[The Affordable Care Act] said to women of America ‘You can’t be charged more just because you’re a woman,’” the New York Senator said. “Imagine becoming pregnant and having your insurer drop your coverage because you are no longer economic or you cost too much money. Imagine being a cancer survivor and having your coverage dropped because you survived cancer and you cost too much money.”Watch Gillibrand’s full speech below. Under the Affordable Care Act, contraception, mammograms and preventive care services were affordable and accessible. If the ACA is repealed, Gillibrand said, “families are left without the basic care they need to survive.”Gillibrand ended her speech on a powerful note, addressing her fellow senators directly: “So if you love women, and you love your mothers and daughters and wives, please do not unwind the Affordable Care Act. We need women’s health protected.”During the vote later that night, each Democratic Senator explained why she or he was voting against the repeal (although most of their explanations were drowned out by the gavel).“Because health care shouldn’t be just for the healthy and wealthy ― I vote no,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also opposed the repeal, shouting over the gavel: “On behalf of the Republicans and Democrats who worked for a decade in Massachusetts to bring health care to 97 percent of our people, I vote no.”"
80,TASTE,Let's Unwrap The Mystery Of How Lactaid Works,Julie R. Thomson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-lactaid_us_5875207fe4b02b5f858b6862,Haven't you always wondered?,2017-01-12,"This is what the milk sugar molecule, lactose, looks like.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/587660b51200002d00ad6fc0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We often eat our daily meals without even realizing all the things we don’t know about our food. Like the fact that cinnamon comes from the bark of a tree. Or that saffron is the stigma of an orchid. Our recent eggnog taste test made us wonder about another interesting food ― Lactaid, which surprisingly won the taste test. How on earth does Lactaid work, anyway?We’ve seen Lactaid milk at the supermarket for years, but what in the world is it, actually? Is it even real milk? If you realize you have that same question, you have come to the right place. We have answers.Most milk sensitivities are a result of people having trouble digesting the sugar in milk, which is called lactose. Once ingested, lactose is broken down in the small intestine into two simple sugars ― glucose and galactose ― with the help of the enzyme lactase, so that the body can digest it. However, some people’s bodies don’t make enough lactase to break down lactose, and that’s where intolerance comes in.First, you should know that Lactaid is 100 percent real cow’s milk. We know it doesn’t sound like it is, and some would even say it doesn’t taste like it ― that it’s too sweet ― but it is. It’s just milk that has been enriched with lactase.Lactaid adds the enzyme lactase to milk to break down the lactose for people whose bodies can’t do it naturally. (That’s actually why Lactaid tastes a little sweeter ― even though it doesn’t actually have a higher sugar content than regular milk.) We never thought we’d say this, but Lactaid makes some of the best store-bought eggnog on the market ― surprising, but true. (It comes with the bonus that no one at your next holiday party will have trouble digesting this dairy-rich drink.)Lactaid is produced for people who have a lactose sensitivity, but anyone can drink it, because remember, it’s just milk with the enzyme lactase added to it."

Obama rose on a wave of hope and optimism, while Trump won by essentially telling people things were so bad they had nothing to lose by giving him a shot. Wednesday’s news conference was Trump’s first since he won the election. At times, it felt like the campaign was still going on as he took a shot at his onetime opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Because it’s up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face.”TRUMP: “Now, I don’t know that I’m going to get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do. But there’s a good chance I won’t. And if I don’t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that?

I’d do a very good job, but I don’t want to do that.”OBAMA: “For too many of us, it’s become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses, or places of worship or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. ... And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it’s true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.” TRUMP: “As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, I think they’re going to suffer the consequences. They already are. ...

We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others, when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt, and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them.” TRUMP: “I think it was disgraceful ― disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that ― and I say that, and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did so.”OBAMA: “In the course of a healthy debate, we prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them. But without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter ― then we’re going to keep talking past each other, and we’ll make common ground and compromise impossible.” TRUMP: “We talk about the hacking and hacking’s bad and it shouldn’t be done. But look at the things that were hacked. Look at what was learned from the hacking. That Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate and didn’t report it? That’s a horrible thing.

Jeff Sessions as the next attorney general of the U.S. Amita Swadhin, a genderqueer femme woman of color (who uses the pronouns they/them) and founder of anti-child sexual abuse organization Mirror Memoirs, spoke with their head held high and an unwavering sense of purpose. Swadhin told the committee that they were raised in New Jersey by two immigrant parents, and throughout their childhood they were sexually abused by their father. “My father raped me at least once a week from age 4 to age 12. I endured psychological, verbal and physical abuse from him for years,” the activist said. “I also grew up watching my father abuse my mother in a textbook case of domestic violence and marital rape.” In October, Sessions told the Weekly Standard that he didn’t characterize President-elect Donald Trump’s comments about grabbing women “by the pussy” as sexual assault. It wasn’t until his confirmation hearing began on Tuesday that Sessions backtracked on his original comments, telling Sen. Patrick Leahy that “clearly” Trump’s comments constitute assault. “Millions of sexual assault survivors were triggered in the wake of these events. I was one of those survivors,” Swadhin continued. “Time and again, Senator Sessions’ voting record has shown us that he’s not the man for the job. Despite his claim to be a champion for victims of violent crime, he has not been a friend to vulnerable survivors.”Watch Swadhin’s full testimony below. Swadhin went on to list Sessions’ voting record when it comes to legislation meant to decrease violence against women and other marginalized communities. Although he initially supported the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, Sessions voted against it in 2013 when it was expanded to include protections for the LGBTQ, immigrant and native communities. In the confirmations hearings this week, Sessions claimed that he voted against the expansion to VAWA because he opposed a provision that allowed tribal courts to try non-tribal members. “We must trust the attorney general to respect the humanity of all Americans and especially to be committed to seeking justice for our most vulnerable victims of crime,” Swadhin concluded. “Given his voting record on VAWA and on LGBT rights we have no reason to put our faith or our trust in Senator Sessions as attorney general.” The activist was one of many to testify against Sessions’ bid for attorney general. Others included Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. John Lewis, both of whom said they feared that Sessions will roll back civil rights in America. Trump’s attorney general pick also opposes hate crimes and believes Roe v. Wade is one of the “worst” Supreme Court decisions “of all time.”"

The original, which ran from 1983 through 1994, attempted to match singles with compatible partners, sending them on three blind dates before allowing them to “dish” about their experiences in front of a live audience. The Fox revamp will differ from the original by including same-sex couples, Fox executives told Entertainment Weekly. It will be executive produced by Mike Fleiss (”The Bachelor”). On Wednesday, Cohen confirmed the news with an Instagram post. “I was a huge fan of the original ‘Love Connection,’ and hosting the new version allows me to do one of the things I love most: meddling in people’s personal lives,” the “Watch What Happens Live” host said, according to Entertainment Weekly. Cohen’s signature sass will no doubt be a perfect match for such a dishy show. The new “Love Connection” will debut this summer. "

It gathered an extremely loyal cult following in the years after and finally returned for a highly anticipated fourth season in 2013 on Netflix. While some praised the fourth season, many others were more mixed on it. In Variety, Brian Lowry wrote, “Ultimately, this ‘Arrested’ revival plays a bit like a reunion special, where the individual cast members come out and take their curtain calls.” Jason Bateman, who plays Michael Bluth in the show, admitted that some parts of Season 4 were “a little confusing and frankly underwhelming for the audience,” and creator Mitch Hurwitz had some misgivings as well. BuzzFeed reported at the time that some of the awkwardness on camera was due to an over-reliance on green screens made necessary by scheduling conflicts, which would explain why Grazer is carefully preparing a “work matrix” for Season 5. Maybe things will be better this time around. At least money shouldn’t be an issue. Netflix is in the midst of an enormous push into original content. In 2017, the media company is expected to spent $6 billion on its own shows, specials and movies, more than both NBC and CBS. "

Olango’s mother later told reporters she believes her son was having a mental breakdown because of the recent death of a friend.Police have said Olango ignored commands to take his hand out of his pocket before pulling out an object later determined to be a vaping device used to inhale nicotine. Olango assumed a “shooting stance” and pointed the device, police said. No gun was found at the scene.(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb)"

I won. I became president.”But that’s false.Most Americans are indeed interested in Trump’s tax returns, polling suggests ― very interested, in fact.Sixty percent of Americans believe the president-elect has a responsibility to release his returns, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted earlier this month. And a CBS News poll produced similar results last month, finding the majority of Democrats and independents believe it’s necessary for Trump to share his releases.Sixty-two percent of Republicans who responded to a Quinnipiac University survey in October said they wanted Trump to release the returns. The Pew poll from this month, however, shows that just 38 percent of the party members feel that way.Trump has pointed to an ongoing audit to justify his unwillingness to release his returns. But the IRS told The Huffington Post last year that “nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information,” and every Republican presidential nominee in the last nine elections has made this information public.

90,ENTERTAINMENT,Aziz Ansari Slated To Be 'SNL's' First-Ever South Asian Host,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aziz-ansari-snl-host_us_587576c6e4b05b7a465c42b2,"The iconic show has run for 41 years, and 90 percent of its hosts have been white.",2017-01-11,"Russel Crowe during his monologue as the host of ""Saturday Night Live"" on April 9, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5875998a170000850192964b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Aziz Ansari will host his first-ever “Saturday Night Live” episode on Jan. 21, the comedy sketch show announced Tuesday.The honor of hosting the iconic show has been a long time coming for the actor, writer, comedian and co-creator of the Emmy award-winning Netflix series “Master of None” ― but it’s also a huge milestone for diversity in comedy.Ansari’s appearance on the show will mark the first time “SNL” has cast a South Asian entertainer as host in its 41-year history.Ansari’s career reached an all-time high in 2016.Not only did “Master of None,” which he co-wrote with Alan Yang, win an Emmy for Best Writing for a Comedy Series, it took home a Critics’ Choice Television Award for Best Comedy Series and a Peabody Award, with several more Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. The groundbreaking show is also debuting a second season in 2017.All this, as the Washington Post points out, makes the Indian American actor a timely choice for the coveted spot as “SNL” host, just like “Rogue One” breakout star Felicity Jones, who will host the week before.But Ansari’s “SNL” debut also seems like a personal win for the comedian, especially since his advocacy for diversity in Hollywood has grown louder in recent years. After all, the “Indians On TV” episode of “Master of None” was essentially a critique of the stereotyping that Indian-American actors face in casting. “I still wonder if we are trying hard enough,” the comedian wrote of making film and TV more diverse in a 2015 column for the New York Times.“Even at a time when minorities account for almost 40 percent of the American population,” Ansari added, “when Hollywood wants an ‘everyman,’ what it really wants is a straight white guy. But a straight white guy is not every man. The ‘everyman’ is everybody.”“SNL,” with its prestige in the entertainment industry and its cult-like following, is arguably one of the most visible platforms (and career-boosters) for celebrities. Yet in the show’s 41-year-long run, the people who have benefited from its coveted host spot were overwhelmingly white.More than 90 percent of “SNL’s” past hosts have been white, with black celebrities making the second-best showing, according to a data breakdown by IndieWire. Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu are the only two Asians who have ever hosted the show (not including Fred Armisen and Bruno Mars, who are mixed-race) and that was more than 15 years ago, IndieWire reported.(IndieWire also noted that “SNL” taps a “diverse” range of talents to host the show, “but many decline or can’t be secured for a variety of reasons.”)So when Ansari steps out onto the stage for his “SNL” monologue at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, he’ll not only be debuting on his own merits as a professional, he’ll also be reflecting his vision for the future of Hollywood ― and it’s one that is decidedly more diverse."
91,STYLE,This Touching Video Will Remind You Of The Power Of A Compliment,Jamie Feldman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/covet-compliments-video_us_5876704ee4b03c8a02d4a72c,"BRB, telling everyone we know that they're beautiful.",2017-01-11,Covet's new model options for its style challenges.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58767cc9170000880192987a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chances are, you throw compliments around pretty freely on any given day. Maybe you like a co-worker’s shoes, or a friend’s particularly adorable photo on Instagram. But what we take for granted is the lasting effect a compliment can have on someone’s ideas about self-love.Covet, a fashion-focused video game in which users complete “style challenges,” debuted 50 new digital models of all different sizes, shapes, heights, skin colors and facial features on Tuesday. In conjunction with the launch, Covet has released a video titled “A Beautiful Perspective: How Compliments Can Empower.”In the video, three Covet users are interviewed about their own views of themselves and the insecurities they face ― and it’s all too familiar to anyone who owns a mirror.“It takes more than a dress or a different hairstyle to change the way you feel about yourself,” Samantha said. But after receiving makeovers, the three women are introduced to three other women who, according to the video, “got to know them and shared what they saw.” Slowly but surely, you can see the women’s attitudes and emotions changing as they hear things like, “You’re very beautiful” and “You really do brighten the room up.” It is a truly beautiful shift that, by the end, has you wanting to compliment just about everyone ― which it then challenges us all to do. Check out the inspiring video above, and head to Covet to learn more. "

One of the six, Oliver Schmidt, who was a manager in charge of VW’s environmental and engineering office in Michigan, was arrested in Florida on Saturday.The six held “positions of significant responsibility at VW, including overseeing the company’s engine development division and serving on the company’s management board,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said, declining to say if any higher level executives could face charges. “Over the course of a conspiracy that lasted for nearly a decade, they seriously abused those positions.”On Monday, Schmidt was accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States over the company’s emissions cheating and the automaker was charged with concealing the cheating from regulators.According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Detroit, VW will pay a $1.5-billion civil fine and $2.8-billion criminal fine. It would have faced higher fines if it hadn’t agreed to spend an estimated $11 billion to address consumer vehicles.After the company pleads guilty to the three-count felony criminal information - conspiracy to commit fraud, obstruction of justice and entry of goods by false statement - it will be formally sentenced.VW admitted that six unnamed supervisors between 2006 and 2016 agreed to mislead regulators and customers about the standards. The Justice Department said VW officials told engineers in 2012 to destroy a document that detailed the cheating and that lawyers prodded employees to destroy documents.VW will face oversight by an independent monitor for three years and has agreed to make significant reforms. The company agreed to fire six employees, suspend eight and discipline three who participated in diesel misconduct. The agreement still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Sean Cox in Detroit.The world’s second-largest automaker confirmed Tuesday it had negotiated a $4.3-billion concrete draft settlement with U.S. regulators to resolve its diesel emissions issues and plans to plead guilty to criminal misconduct as part of the civil and criminal settlement.The VW plea agreement says the automaker could have been fined as much as $34.1 billion for its criminal conduct.Volkswagen had previously agreed to spend up to $17.5 billion in the United States to resolve claims by U.S. regulators, owners and dealers and offered to buy back nearly 500,000 polluting vehicles. The automaker was in intensive talks with regulators in recent weeks in an effort to reach a deal before the end of the Obama administration.Without a deal by next week, a final resolution could have been delayed by months until the Trump EPA and Justice Department teams are in place.VW admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide.Much of the company’s senior management departed following the scandal, including chief executive Martin Winterkorn.(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington and Andreas Cremer in Berlin; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)"
