0,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Donald Trump Is Lagging Far Behind Hillary Clinton,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Natalie Jackson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-polls_us_57fcd814e4b0e655eab7708f,"It’s not clear yet how much he’s declined in the last few days, but the initial numbers don’t look good.",2016-10-11,"Natalie Jackson - Senior Polling Editor, The Huffington Post",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c934a8d240000ad064e6a93.png?ops=100_100,"New surveys spell further problems for the Trump campaign. Mitt Romney’s 2012 numbers are looking pretty good for the GOP right now. But Republicans downballot are so far being spared the effects. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, October 11, 2016.POLLS INDICATE TRUMP IS IN TROUBLE - Three new national polls show Donald Trump’s support declining, although by different amounts. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump down to 35 percent, with Clinton 11 points higher at 46 percent. That poll was conducted Saturday and Sunday, after the tape showing Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women was released Friday but before Sunday night’s debate. A PRRI/Atlantic poll conducted October 5-9, including time before and after the tape release, also shows Clinton with an 11-point lead and Trump with only 38 percent of the vote. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Saturday showed Trump with 38 percent support, but that was only a 1 percent drop from their previous poll and only 4 points behind Clinton. A post-debate Morning Consult poll shows Trump dropping another point to 37 percent with Clinton holding steady at 42 percent. The margins between Trump and Clinton vary across these polls, but all show evidence of Trump declining into the 30s. That’s not a good sign 4 weeks out from the election. [NBC, PRRI, Politico, Morning Consult]ANOTHER POLL FINDS LITTLE EFFECT ON VIEWS OF TRUMP’S RESPECT FOR WOMEN - HuffPollster: “Even before the release of a video that showed Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault, most voters didn’t think he respected women. But Friday’s revelation had only a modest effect on the minds of those who did, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey.Thirty-two percent of registered voters now think Trump respects women, identical to the percentage who said so in a poll taken days before the video’s release. The share who say he does not respect women rose from 54 percent to 59 percent, as some people left the ‘not sure’ camp. ...The lack of change shows how deeply opinions can harden along partisan lines, with voters willing to rationalize away criticism of the candidate they support….Surveys released so far this week have found varying results on how much the controversy has affected Americans’ opinions of Trump. The HuffPost/YouGov survey differs significantly from a poll by NBC and SurveyMonkey, which found the percentage of likely voters who think Trump doesn’t respect women at all jumping from 39 percent to 46 percent in the aftermath of the video’s release. One potential reason for the discrepancy: While the HuffPost/YouGov poll laid out a binary set of options ― Trump does or does not respect women ― the NBC/SurveyMonkey offered a more gradual scale, asking people whether Trump respects women ‘a lot,’ ‘some,’ ‘not much’ or ‘not at all.’” [HuffPost]More than 450,000 votes were cast before anyone heard about the tape. [CNN]Many Republicans will still vote for Trump - HuffPollster: “Sixty-seven percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said congressional candidates should still support Trump, according to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. In the Politico/Morning Consult poll, 74 percent of Republicans agreed that party leaders should continue to back the embattled nominee…. Republicans who don’t want to support Trump face an unpleasant decision: Vote for Trump, or allow Clinton to become president…. For many Republicans (and Democrats), the idea of aiding the other party is anathema. In an April HuffPost/YouGov survey, 76 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agreed that “the worst Republican candidate for president is still better than the Democratic candidates.” The same proportion of Democrats said the same thing about their party. More than half of Republicans, and just under half of Democrats, strongly agreed with the statement. Less than 10 percent of each group strongly disagreed. None of these numbers are surprising. Party identification is by far the strongest predictor of vote choice in American elections, and has been for decades.” [HuffPost] Downballot Republicans don’t seem to be suffering - Janie Velencia and Grace Sparks: “Donald Trump’s boasts about sexually assaulting women could be causing him to lose some ground in the polls, but it doesn’t seem to be hurting down-ballot Republican candidates yet. Trump has declined by 2 percentage points among registered voters, according to YouGov/Economist polls conducted before and after the release of that notorious recording. At the same time, the GOP has seen a 2-point increase in generic House polling, which asks voters which party’s congressional candidate they’d vote for. Voters in his own party also seem to be targeting their ire at Trump specifically. Among registered GOP voters, Trump has dropped by 4 points, from 85 percent to 81 percent. But the generic down-ballot Republican candidate has seen no change, maintaining 88 percent support.” [HuffPost]CURRENT HUFFINGTON POST FORECAST - Hillary Clinton has an 88.3 percent chance of winning the presidential election. Republicans have a 65 percent chance of keeping the Senate. [Presidential forecast, Senate forecast]ALL ATTENTION ISN’T GOOD ATTENTION, 2016 EDITION - Geoffrey Skelley, via Twitter: “I noticed earlier this cycle that there’s a negative correlation between getting more attention than the other candidate & poll margin. E.g. during periods where Clinton was in the news more than Trump, her lead shrank and vice versa. Gallup and Google Trends provide data on who’s getting more notice in the news. Over the past month, correlation between Trump’s margin of being heard about in the news (Gallup) & HuffPost margin is a solid -.67!! Comparing Trump’s HuffPost margin to Google Trends margin between Trump and Clinton, correlation is -.55 over the past month. So we have 2 indicators where the correlation between Trump being in the news relative to Clinton & Trump’s margin is above .5! And let me add that there’s something to these correlations over time, at least going back to after the conventions.” [@geoffreyvs]TRUMP WOULD KILL FOR MITT ROMNEY’S POLL NUMBERS RIGHT ABOUT NOW: HuffPollster: “In mid-October 2012, Romney lagged President Barack Obama by just about half a percentage point in HuffPost Pollster’s model of the race. By contrast, Trump’s current polling average, which still largely reflects polls taken before the latest revelations, puts him more than 6 points behind Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head race. That’s a gap more than 10 times larger than Romney’s…State polling tells a similar story. In most of the states where HuffPost Pollster has enough data for a model, Trump’s current margin against Clinton is less than Romney’s final margin against Obama in the 2012 election….And Romney, of course, lost the 2012 election by a larger-than-predicted margin. For Trump’s campaign to be on track to victory, he would likely need to be outperforming his predecessor. Instead, he’s behind and facing the specter of even worse numbers to come.” [HuffPost] MARRIED VOTERS DON’T ALWAYS KNOW WHO THEIR SPOUSE IS BACKING - Will Jordan, via Twitter: “I may have cracked the code of the gender gap and how American families are not ripping themselves apart...Married WOMEN who say they are voting for Hillary Clinton: 45%. Married MEN who think their SPOUSE is voting for Hillary Clinton: 33%. Married MEN who say they are voting for Hillary Clinton: 31%. Married WOMEN who think their SPOUSE is voting for Hillary Clinton: 37%.” [@williamjordann]PEW RESEARCH STEPS BACK FROM HORSERACE POLLING - Michael Dimock: “We’ve been getting questions about what people can expect to see from Pew Research Center in the final weeks before Election Day. Compared with past years, our October and November plans have changed significantly in that the Center will not be producing likely-voter estimates of the state of the race or making a final projection of the national vote total….[T]he field of pre-election ‘horse-race’ polling has become increasingly crowded, including by organizations rightfully putting a focus on polling in key battleground states. Putting resources toward an already saturated market doesn’t make much sense for us….The number of survey aggregators now giving the public a general sense of how the race is ebbing or flowing, however, makes this less of a loss. Our decision also takes away an opportunity for us to test our survey accuracy against an objective external reality: the national vote total. However, elections are only one way – and not necessarily the best way – to gauge polling accuracy…. Perhaps most importantly, this does not mean we believe that polling is no longer accurate enough to be used to predict election results. “ [Pew] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Clinton kicked things off by praising Trump’s children, who have played a major role in his campaign.“I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald,” Clinton said.Trump seemed pleased with the answer.“I consider that a compliment,” Trump said. “I don’t know if that was meant to be a compliment, but I consider it a compliment.”Trump then praised Clinton’s perseverance.“She doesn’t quit, she doesn’t give up. I respect that,” Trump said. “I tell it like it is. She’s a fighter ― I disagree with much of what she’s fighting for. I disagree with her judgment in many cases.”“I consider that to be a very good trait,” he added. Read more updates from the second presidential debate here.

4,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Campaign Goes All In On Jailing Hillary Clinton,Igor Bobic and Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-jail-threat_us_57fb1177e4b0b6a430338df6,"The idea is more commonly associated with dictators, but that didn't stop team Trump from cheering it on after the debate.",2016-10-10,"Ryan J. Reilly - Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1228202600005e0484ece5.jpeg?ops=100_100,"ST. LOUIS ― Donald Trump’s overt threat Sunday night to put Hillary Clinton behind bars if he is elected president ― an unprecedented declaration in modern U.S. politics ― was met with applause by his top campaign surrogates.“That was classic Donald Trump,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson said after the debate. “He does want a special prosecutor because these emails were deleted.”During the debate at Washington University, Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton for her use of a personal email account while she was secretary of state. She responded by expressing regret for doing so, and urged viewers to check out the facts about her emails on her campaign website. “Last time, at the first debate, we had millions of people fact-checking. So I expect we’ll have millions more fact-checking because, you know, it is, it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” she said.Trump responded with a jarring put-down. “Because you would be in jail,” he said to Clinton.The FBI and Department of Justice formally closed the inquiry into Clinton’s use of a private email server earlier this year. Though they said she was careless in the way she handled classified information, neither FBI Director James Comey nor Attorney General Loretta Lynch moved forward to bring charges.Reacting to the moment in the debate “spin room,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he believed a special prosecutor “might be justified” in this case. But he pushed back against the notion that Trump could unilaterally put Clinton behind bars, noting a special prosecutor would be independent of the executive branch.“I liked that he said a special prosecutor,” Sessions told reporters. “So I think one might be justified, we’ll just have to see about that. I haven’t studied it. But he didn’t say he was going to appoint a prosecutor to bring charges. He just said a special prosecutor to investigate them. That would be an independent prosecutor in the special prosecutor system, not one picked by the president.”Trump’s supporters repeat their “lock her up” chant at nearly every one of his campaign rallies. After modestly dismissing it earlier this summer, Trump in July embraced the rhetoric ― more frequently associated with dictators who jail political opponents ― by telling his supporters he was “starting to agree” with them. (He has even said he would nominate Supreme Court justices who “would look very seriously at her email disaster.”)Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who served as a U.S. Attorney, took a similar tack on the campaign trail. In a scrum with reporters after the debate, he too cheered the jail threat.“Destroying 33,000 emails after you get a federal subpoena is called a federal crime. When he said you can go to jail for that, nobody laughed ― because they all thought it was true,” Giuliani said with a chuckle.Trump’s campaign seemed to delight in the retort. After the debate, his social media team posted the quote with an easily sharable photo.Clinton’s campaign dismissed the threat, arguing Trump was simply trying to appease his voting base.“It’s just another incoherent baseless attack that he throws at her,” Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri told HuffPost after the debate. “He’s not winning anyone over with those kinds of attacks.”Former Attorney General Eric Holder, however, blasted Trump on Twitter. He noted that President Richard Nixon’s attorney general resigned after being asked to fire the special prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Prior to the event, the former Kanye West-affiliate appeared on Friday’s episode of “Windy City LIVE” to share his efforts to forge a better union with local residents to combat gun violence.“We have too many walls in Chicago and not enough bridges. It’s time that we start being solution based in areas other than just the south and the west sides of Chicago,” he said on the daytime talk show. “Because all of Chicago is suffering from trauma. And I’m talking about people on the Gold coast, people on Michigan Avenue is not reconciled, so they build walls. And we’re not working as one Chicago.” In addition to leading Sunday’s vigil, Rhymefest is also initiating citywide therapy sessions for Chicago residents through his “Truth & Reconciliation” event series. Although he’s raising awareness on local social issues in the city, he’s still reluctant to label himself as an “advocate.”“I don’t like the word activist for me, because advocate says I’m advocating on behalf of a community or someone else,” he said.“I don’t think people need to be advocated for, I think people need to be given agency over themselves. If we can use ― as artists, entertainers, athlete, media people ― if we can use our platform to help people give agency over our own lives, that’s great. But to set ourselves up as the advocate for someone else really continues to set them up for failure.”Check out more of Rhymefest’s “Windy City LIVE” interview in the clip above."

Among questions about how Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would handle Supreme Court appointments, tax reform and the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the former secretary of state was also asked to respond to comments her husband made about the Affordable Care Act. “Your husband called Obamacare, quote, ‘the craziest thing in the world,’” CNN’s Anderson Cooper, one of the debate moderators, asked. “Small business owners are getting killed, coverage is cut in half. Was he [exaggerating] or simply telling the truth?” Clinton responded that her husband clarified his remarks, then explained how she as president would improve the current system. Trump took an opportunity to bring up Bill Clinton as well when he was grilled about a 2005 recording released Friday in which he talked lewdly about women and boasted of being able to get away with sexual assault and other predatory behavior.Trump brushed off his comments as “locker room talk” before bringing up his rival’s husband. “If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, mine are words, his was action,” Trump said, adding, “There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women.” Most Americans disapprove of Trump’s use of that attack point on his rival, and she didn’t take the bait. She instead invoked the words of Michelle Obama: “When they go low, you go high.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Podesta, who is now the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s campaign, recommended Steyer for the job in a 2008 email to the late Obama adviser Cassandra Butts. (Butts died earlier this year.) At the time, Steyer was a hedge fund manager running Farallon Capital. Steyer has since pushed his way into the political scene as a megadonor, funneling millions into congressional races in an attempt to make climate change a wedge issue. Podesta also added Tim Wirth, a former Democratic senator from Colorado, and then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper (D) to the list of potential nominees. None of them made the cut, of course; Obama picked physicist Steven Chu. Steyer’s name came up again in 2013 when Obama began looking for a replacement for Chu. Steyer appeared open to the idea at that time. “There are things we can do ... that will make us all much better off and will make the world much better off. I’m incredibly excited to work on those problems, but I’d be awfully surprised if I were the next energy secretary,” Steyer told Bloomberg TV.The email was included in a batch that WikiLeaks released on Friday. While the White House hasn’t confirmed the authenticity of every email, they have blamed Russian hackers for the leak. Wikileaks released a second batch of Podesta’s emails Monday.Podesta is expected to stick with Clinton if she is elected, and it wouldn’t be surprising if he throws Steyer’s name in the mix for a cabinet spot again. Steyer endorsed Clinton in June, and has held fundraisers for the Democratic presidential nominee. Steyer spent $74 million during the 2014 cycle and this year his climate organization NextGen has spent at least $25 million on a get-out-the-vote campaign targeting young voters. “In 2016, Tom is focused on the most urgent issues facing American voters today, including economic opportunity, climate change, and ensuring that young people and people of color have their voices heard in this election,” a spokesperson for Steyer said when asked if he’d be interested in working for the Clinton administration. “He is working with organizations across the nation ― and especially in California ― to promote voter registration and engagement on an unprecedented scale. He is also laser-focused on electing climate champions to the White House and the Senate on November 8.”The emails show Podesta weighed in on a number of cabinet posts. He also pitched Katie McGinty, who headed the White House Council on Environmental Quality under former President Bill Clinton and is now a Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Yale University law professor Dan Esty was also on Podesta’s list for EPA chief.The messages also give some insight into the Obama administration’s thought process as it made appointments for that first term. A list of potential nominees sent to Podesta included candidates ranging from former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, for energy secretary, to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg for the EPA. Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric, seemed “impossible” to Podesta for the energy spot. Obama’s advisers also floated the vocal, attention-hungry Brian Schweitzer, then the Democratic governor of Montana. The list drew obvious skepticism from Podesta.“These seem wildly different in potential although all could play a [role],” he wrote. This article has been updated with comments from Steyer’s spokesperson. "

LOUIS ― Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton went head-to-head for a second time on Sunday night just miles from Ferguson, Missouri, where in 2014 an unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by police. Yet somehow, the nominees were not asked a single question about police brutality all night.The events in Ferguson two years ago still loom over Missouri politics, and the latest polling shows that Trump is likely to win the state. Democrats running statewide have not made police reform a major component of their platforms, and there has been little progress on police reform in the state legislature since Ferguson erupted.Nationally, support has increased for criminal justice reform and police reform, but the nominees did not discuss how they’d tackle either. There was no mention of Ferguson or the demonstrations there in 2014, which launched a national conversation over law enforcement’s treatment of black people. Likewise, there was no mention of the Black Lives Matter movement that has kept the issue at the forefront of state and national politics.Antonio French, a city alderman currently running for mayor of St. Louis, expressed disbelief that the debate could be held just 15 miles from Ferguson and include no mention of it, or of Black Lives Matter. Instead, Trump in his opening remarks called for “law and order” and for respecting police, but didn’t explain how his policies would accomplish this. In an attempt to reach black and Latino voters, Trump turned to the inner cities. “I want to do things that haven’t been done, including fix our inner cities and make things better for the African-American citizens who are so great, and the Latino Americans, the Hispanics,” he said. The debate took place at Washington University in St. Louis, about a 10-minute drive from Ferguson. Trump has made the ludicrous claim that Ferguson is one of the most dangerous places in the world, and previously said that gangs of illegal immigrants were roaming the streets in a city that is mostly black and has a small Hispanic population. Clinton on Sunday briefly criticized Trump’s racist claims that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the U.S., and called him out for “what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos,” among other groups. During the first presidential debate, Trump said that black and Latino people are “living in hell” because inner cities are so dangerous. He continued that during the second debate. “I’ve heard them when Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise, every way possible,” Trump said. “I’m going to help the African-Americans, I’m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics, I am going to help the inner cities.” Later, when asked how he would be a devoted president for all Americans, Trump again brought up violence and poverty in the inner cities. “You go into the inner cities and you see it’s 45 percent poverty,” Trump said. “African-Americans, now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. I mean it’s ― you know, and I’ve been saying it, big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people: What do you have to lose? It can’t get any worse.”Trump blamed Clinton for the state of inner cities, saying nothing would change if she were elected. Clinton, for her part, pointed to her time as a lawyer “working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.”Clinton has spoken about the need to eliminate racism in the criminal justice system. A group called “Mothers of the Movement,” which includes several black women whose children have died in police custody or during encounters with law enforcement, endorsed Clinton at the Democratic National Convention this summer. Trump, meanwhile, has courted white voters who fear the Black Lives Matter movement, and has retweeted white nationalists on a number of occasions, along with false statistics about crime and race.Trump said in July that he would have his attorney general investigate the Black Lives Matter movement. Clinton, on the other hand, has met with advocates affiliated with Black Lives Matter and has called for improving police-community relations.As he made the case for why he’d be a president for all Americans, including people of color, Trump mentioned several cities that have experienced unrest in the past year. “We have a very divided nation,” Trump said. “You look at Charlotte, you look at Baltimore, you look at the violence that’s taking place in the inner cities ― Chicago. You take a look at Washington, D.C. We have a increase in murder within our cities ... We have a divided nation because [of] people like [Clinton], and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.”In fact, although the national homicide rate crept up slightly in 2015, overall the last year was one of the safest on record, according to a recent report from the FBI.Trump’s comments about inner cities, and his suggestion that a majority of African-American and Latino people live in them, didn’t go over well with people watching the debate. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(On Monday, a federal court extended Florida’s deadline from Tuesday to Wednesday.) Just over half of these states allow online voter registration, but prospective voters in Arkansas, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas must complete the process in person or via mail.To register in person, you can go to your state or local election office, Department of Motor Vehicles, armed services recruitment center, or state and county public assistance offices. You can send in an absentee ballot or vote by mail if you won’t be in your home county on Nov. 8.Anyone who isn’t sure whether they’ve registered can check this website. Increasing voter turnout has been a primary focus for many advocacy organizations, including Rock the Vote and America Votes. But even this renewed push hasn’t propelled turnout in recent general elections. Just 57.5 percent of all eligible voters made their voices heard in the 2012 election, down from 62.3 percent in 2008 ― the largest decrease since 1996.Voter turnout has been particularly low for people between the ages of 18 and 24, a group that had a turnout of around 41 percent in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, citing a Census Bureau report. The stakes in this election are high, as voters must decide who will nominate the next Supreme Court justice, continue fighting ISIS, push for police reforms and work on a slate of other crucial issues.

Early polls indicate Hillary Clinton won the second debate. And some controversies stick to candidates more than others. This is HuffPollster for Monday, October 10, 2016.POLLS SHOW TRUMP DECLINING BEFORE LATEST SCANDAL - HuffPollster: “New polls out Sunday morning show Donald Trump was the electoral underdog even before the news broke about a 2005 tape in which the GOP nominee made lewd comments about assaulting women…. The worst news for Trump comes out of Ohio. The Buckeye State had been tilting toward the Republican throughout September, but his lead has evaporated in the last two weeks. A new CBS/YouGov poll shows Clinton leading by 4 points, 46 percent to Trump’s 42 percent…. Florida has been leaning toward Clinton on average for most of 2016, but a few occasional polls have shown Trump leading. The new NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll continues a trend of Clinton leading Trump by a few points ― she’s up 45-42…. [Sunday] morning’s CBS/YouGov poll puts Clinton up by 5 points in Wisconsin, 43 percent to Trump’s 38…. Two polls in Pennsylvania show Clinton winning by sizable margins. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll has the Democratic nominee up by 12 points…. A CBS/YouGov poll finds an 8-point lead for Clinton, 48 to 40.” [HuffPost]Will his numbers be affected by the video? - Friday’s tape release seems to have resulted in more reaction from Republican elites than previous missteps by Donald Trump: Many prominent Republicans withdrew their support from the presidential candidate over the weekend. This is an unprecedented situation in American politics, so there’s no guidance on what might happen in the polls from recent history. Simply put, we don’t know what will happen. And polls conducted this week will also reflect any effects from Sunday night’s debate. It will be very difficult to separate debate effects from the fallout from the video. An initial one-day survey indicated little change nationally - Steven Shepard, Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer: “[A]t least for now, rank-and-file Republicans are standing by the party’s presidential candidate, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted immediately after audio was unearthed Friday that had the GOP nominee crudely bragging about groping women and trying to lure a married woman into an affair. Overall, fewer than 4-in-10 voters — 39 percent — think Trump should end his presidential campaign, while only slightly more voters, 45 percent, think he should not drop out…. As of now, GOP voters largely want the party to stand behind Trump. Nearly three-quarters of Republican voters, 74 percent, surveyed on Saturday said party officials should continue to support Trump. Only 13 percent think the party shouldn’t back him. Still, Hillary Clinton leads Trump in the four-way race for the White House by 4 percentage points, 42 percent to 38 percent, with 8 percent supporting Gary Johnson, 3 percent supporting Jill Stein and 9 percent undecided. [Politico]But fewer voters think Trump respects women - Hannah Hartig, John Lapinski and Stephanie Psyllos: “After a 2005 recording of Donald Trump making lewd comments about women emerged on Friday, 63 percent of likely voters said they do not think the Republican nominee respects women, according to the latest NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll. In the four days the poll was in the field prior to the revelation of Trump’s comments on Friday, 55 percent of likely voters said they did not think he respects women....The question regarding Trump’s respect for women was fielded the entire week, but the opinions were analyzed before and after the tape surfaced on Friday….Before the recording was made public, 64 percent of likely women voters said they did not think Trump respects women. After the recording was made public, 69 percent of women said they did not think Trump respects women, including 53 percent who said he does not respect women at all.” [NBC]SNAP POLLS SUGGEST CLINTON ‘WON’ DEBATE - HuffPollster: “Those who watched Sunday’s match between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump think Clinton won, preliminary polls find, but the results suggest the event did little to change the race. In a scientific online snap poll from YouGov, Clinton won a relatively narrow victory, with 47 percent of registered voters who watched the debate saying she did a better job, 42 percent saying Donald Trump did, and 12 percent saying it was a tie….Clinton scored a bigger win in a snap poll from CNN/ORC, which recontacted people who said in a past poll that they planned to watch the debate. Fifty-seven percent of the debate-watchers polled said that Clinton won, while 34 percent favored Trump. Clinton’s advantage was in part due to the fact that those tuning into the debate are more likely to be Democrats than the nation as a whole, as CNN’s Jake Tapper noted. Both snap polls, in fact, suggest that few minds were changed by the debate. The share of those polled by CNN who thought Clinton won is nearly identical to the 58 percent of viewers who said before the event that they supported her. YouGov, similarly, found their respondents planning to vote for Clinton by a 48-42 margin, neatly mirroring the divide on who won the debate….[Trump] needed an exceptionally good night if he hoped to regain ground. The earliest results suggest that’s very unlikely to be the case.” [HuffPost] CURRENT HUFFINGTON POST FORECAST - Hillary Clinton has an 86.2 percent chance of winning the presidential election. Republicans have a 63 percent chance of keeping the Senate. [Presidential forecast, Senate forecast]WHY SOME CONTROVERSIES MATTER MORE THAN OTHERS - Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie: “One of the more perplexing riddles to those of us who spend far too much time pondering over politics is why some scandals, accusations, and missteps do damage while others seem to hardly matter at all….Donald Trump entered the fray by bragging during the first presidential debate that he was smart to not have to pay taxes….At least among his core voters, those authoritarian Republicans looking for a strong leader not constrained by social norms or constitutional constraints, Trump may well find a sympathetic ear. Authoritarians care less about cheating on government than other violations of traditional social norms….His most recent set of comments are unlikely to play well with a prudish authoritarian base that is more willing to damn violations of traditional sexual norms than cheating on taxes….

Rick Scott (R) had refused to extend the state's voter registration deadline, arguing would-be voters had ample time to register.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fc07ca170000bc16acaede.jpeg?cache=LA3XEPF1Pw&ops=crop_0_258_2945_1486%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Oct. 12 ― At a hearing Wednesday, Judge Mark E. Walker further extended the voter registration deadline to Tuesday, Oct. 18, to accommodate Floridians displaced by Hurricane Matthew. “No right is more precious than having a voice in our elections,” he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “We are thrilled the court agreed to extend the voter registration deadline a full week following Hurricane Matthew,” said Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant in a statement. “While we wish it had not taken a lawsuit to get the Scott administration to do the right thing, today’s ruling is a major victory for all Floridians and for the democratic process in the Sunshine State.” PREVIOUSLY: The U.S. District Court for Florida’s Northern District extended the state’s voter registration to Wednesday evening after Gov. Rick Scott (R) refused to do so in anticipation of Hurricane Matthew. The state’s voter registration deadline will now be extended from Tuesday to Wednesday at 5 p.m. local time in order to give Floridians displaced or otherwise burdened by the storm more time to register. The deadline may be further extended after a hearing Wednesday.The order, issued by U.S. District Court Judge Mark E. Walker on Monday, came less than a day after Florida Democrats sued to extend the deadline. The judge sided with the plaintiffs, ruling that not extending the registration period is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to vote.“These voters have already had their lives (and, quite possibly, their homes) turned up-side down by Hurricane Matthew,” reads the order. “They deserve a break, especially one that is mandated by the United States Constitution. Ensuring that they can exercise their constitutional right to vote thus promotes the public interest.”Walker argued that the interests of voters should be prioritized over Scott’s interest in maintaining the existing deadline, noting that there are no do-overs for voters. “If aspiring eligible Florida voters are barred from registering to vote then those voters are stripped of one of our most precious freedoms,” reads the order. “This isn’t golf: there are no mulligans.”Scott, a Trump supporter who co-chairs a super PAC supporting the GOP nominee, had previously refused to extend the deadline after Hillary Clinton’s campaign pressed him to do so.“I’m not going to extend it,” Scott said Thursday evening. “Everybody’s had a lot of time to register. On top of that, we have lots of opportunities to vote, early voting and absentee voting, so I don’t intend to make any changes.”In the ruling, Walker preemptively dismissed any speculation that his decision was politically motivated.“It has been suggested that the issue of extending the voter registration deadline is about politics,” he wrote. “Poppycock. This case is about the right of aspiring eligible voters to register and to have their votes counted. Nothing could be more fundamental to our democracy.” Hurricane Matthew hit the southeastern U.S. over the weekend, killing at least 27 people across five states and causing billions of dollars in damage. Some Florida towns experienced significant flood damage, and hundreds of thousands reported power outages across the state.South Carolina, also hit hard by the storm, extended its voter registration deadline last week.Read the court’s full ruling below: "

The order, issued shortly before the symbolically important Columbus Day holiday, denied the Standing Rock Sioux’s attempt to halt work on the pipeline while their lawsuit proceeds against the federal agency that approved the project. The Sioux contend that the 1,172-mile pipeline running from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to facilities in Illinois may contaminate the Missouri River, their water source, and destroy sacred and historical sites.“The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is not backing down from this fight,” said tribal chairman Dave Archambault in a statement. “We are guided by prayer, and we will continue to fight for our people. We will not rest until our lands, people, waters and sacred places are permanently protected from this destructive pipeline.”The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., said in its two-page order that the tribe did not prove “the existence of irreparable harm” nor did it meet other conditions necessary to obtain an injunction. The ruling addresses only work in the 20-mile area around Lake Oahe in North Dakota. Soon after the three-judge panel handed down its decision, the Associated Press reported that the departments of the Interior and Justice, as well as the Army, announced that no construction on federal land would be allowed within that buffer zone around the lake. Energy Transfer Partners, the Dallas-based company that designed the pipeline to carry 570,000 barrels of oil per day, may resume building on other land in the area. The U.S. Army and the departments of Interior and Justice, however, asked the company to voluntarily suspend all work within this section, according to Reuters.A final reckoning on the project could come in weeks as the departments involved have been reviewing what factors led the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue construction permits. Pipeline opponents have argued the Corps didn’t fully investigate the potential for environmental harm, and the Standing Rock Sioux have said they weren’t properly consulted as required by the National Historic Preservation Act. The Court of Appeals panel sounded sympathetic to the last concern. “Although the Tribe has not met the narrow and stringent standard governing this extraordinary form of relief, we recognize Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act was intended to mediate precisely the disparate perspectives in a case such as this one,” the order said. “We can only hope the spirit of Section 106 may prevail.”Opposition to the project intensified over the summer as a large encampment of Native Americans and environmentalists took root near Lake Oahe. Native Americans have accused Energy Transfer Partners of deliberately destroying burial sites and artifacts before they could be properly examined.The company has denied finding anything potentially historic and has alleged that protesters have threatened its workers. Dozens of people, including Archambault, have been arrested for charges like disorderly conduct and trespassing. Protests have also grown in Iowa, where state authorities used eminent domain to seize farmers’ land to make way for the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post’s request for comment. "

It was a lie and a conspiracy. “Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, he said it was a great lie, a big lie,” Trump said.Trump denied sending tweets at 3 a.m. that alleged a former Miss Universe had a “sex tape,” and then turned the conversation to Benghazi.“No, it wasn’t ‘check out a sex tape,’” Trump told moderators about his tweet, which did say that. “It was just take a look at the person... by the way, just so you understand, when [Clinton] said 3 in the morning, take a look at Benghazi!”Trump, in his rambling way, was referring to an ad Clinton cut in 2008 that suggested she was the person Americans would want answering an emergency in the dead of night. His point was that Clinton didn’t save Ambassador Chris Stevens from being killed in the Benghazi attacks, although nine separate investigations have absolved her of wrongdoing.“The only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who’s her friend and not a good guy, by the way,” Trump said.He also hauled out Blumenthal’s name to remake the debunked charge that Clinton was responsible for Trump being a birther. “He’s the one that got this started,” Trump said, bringing up a Jewish-sounding name again.Indeed, some observers did not find it coincidental that while Trump was trying to shore of the conservative base, he kept mentioning Jewish people as examples.There was plenty more for the fever-dream set.The campaign trotted out women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, and seated them in the debate hall. Conway said on NBC’s “Today” show that those women were there because Hillary, as Bill’s wife, had been complicit in mistreating them.Perhaps the biggest bone Trump tossed to the hard-right base, though, was the promise that Clinton would be in jail if he won ― a thoroughly unsubtle nod to his most fervent supporters who like to chant “lock her up!” at rallies.First he promised to direct a special prosecutor to look into Clinton. But he went further when she chided him later for essentially being an erratic bully.“It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Clinton said.“Because you would be in jail,” Trump shot back, going from prosecutor to jury in about a heartbeat ― and ignoring the fact the FBI director has repeatedly said there’s no there there. (And Director James Comey’s term runs until 2023.)Conway made clear the debate message was the one the campaign wanted.“I think it was a good night for democracy,” she said on “Today” when asked if the display was good for American politics.“They really have a contrast. They really have a choice in two candidates this year, in this election cycle, next month,” Conway insisted.“For those interested in issues, which we talk about every day, there was plenty to hear about in those 90 minutes,” Conway added. She also went back over the emails and the oft-investigated Benghazi.So yes, there was a contrast. And while it probably will do little for moderates and independents, at least the message should torture Republican leaders who desperately want to dump Trump, even as their voters are eating up his words.This article has been updated throughout.

When host Ellen DeGeneres asked how she manages to get into character for some of the more sensual routines, Hernandez, who noted she’s “never had a boyfriend,” agreed it can be quite difficult. “When we were talking about tango, I had to reference ‘The Notebook,’ or ‘Finding Nemo’ ― like, how did the father feel when Nemo was gone?” Chmerkovskiy said as the crowd laughed. Right before she performed the tango on the show, Hernandez said she had a lightbulb moment. “I was like, I have to channel me smelling a quesadilla right before I get up there,” she explained. “That’s the only way this is going to work.” After dishing on her secret to success, the Olympic gold medalist revealed another secret: her celebrity crush, Dave Franco.“If he shook my hand or high-fived me, I don’t think I’d wash it for probably, like, a week,” she told DeGeneres. “Or longer.” Naturally, DeGeneres gifted Hernandez with a dress covered in pictures of Franco’s face before playing an adorable video message from the “Now You See Me” actor and his cat. Her reaction is priceless. "

LOUIS – Anyone waiting to hear contrition from Donald Trump about recently leaked audio of him bragging that his celebrity allowed him to grab women by their genitals will just have to keep waiting.When the question inevitably came up at the second presidential debate Sunday night, Trump tried to minimize its significance, repeating the phrase that he put out shortly after the audio was released on Friday ― “locker room talk” – while appearing to dispute that those actions constitute sexual assault.“No, I didn’t say that at all,” Trump said about the sexual assault description by moderator Anderson Cooper. “I don’t think you understand what was said.”Trump then spent the next 70 seconds responding. Seventeen of those seconds dealt with Cooper’s question, while the remainder focused on the horrors inflicted by the Islamic State and Trump’s vow to “knock the hell” out of them.After Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said that Trump’s words on that tape were yet more proof that he is unfit for the presidency, Trump lashed out at her, using four women he brought to the debate – three of whom have accused Clinton’s husband, former President Bill Clinton, of unwanted sexual advances against them. The fourth was raped as a child, and Hillary Clinton won the accused attacker’s release as his court-appointed lawyer.Many Republicans had warned Trump not to bring up Bill Clinton’s women problems, while others had said that unless Trump offered a sincere and heartfelt apology for his remarks, his problems with women voters would continue to worsen.Trump’s staff and supporters nevertheless lauded the nominee for confronting the issue head-on and apologizing for his words. “Mr. Trump owned his mistake, he apologized,” said Trump spokesman Jason Miller.Sean Spicer, a strategist and spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said Trump had apologized not once, but twice. “He didn’t think it was appropriate,” Spicer said.But Trump’s response to those questions was more defiant than contrite. While he pointed out three times that he already apologized to his family and the country, he used the phrase “locker room talk” as a rationale four times.“But it’s locker room talk and it’s one of those things,” he said in the middle of a long digression about ISIS. “That was locker room talk,” he said a few minutes later. “And certainly I’m not proud of it, but that was something that happened.”“I said things that, frankly, you hear these things,” Trump said. “And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women. And women have respect for me.”It took Cooper several follow-ups before Trump finally answered whether he actually had grabbed women by the genitals, as he had boasted on the audio tape. “No, I haven’t,” Trump said.Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said on Saturday that Trump needed to “beg” for forgiveness and promise to change his ways. “If he doesn’t do those things, if he won’t do those things, then he should step aside and allow the Republican Party to replace him with an elder statesman who will,” Cotton said.Trump did not ask for forgiveness, and spent far more time lashing out at the Clintons than he did dealing with the contents of the leaked audiotape. The coming days could start revealing whether that decision will cost him even further.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Preventing sexual assault in this country is no less important than preventing terrorism or stopping ISIS. When Trump flippantly excuses his misogynistic comments as “locker room talk,” he is reminding every survivor of sexual assault that their voices don’t matter; he insists that their stories and their bodies and their lives don’t matter. Trump moving on to “bigger things” recalls the same deep disregard for women as a a judge telling a survivor they don’t want to ruin her rapist’s “promising” or “successful” future. Trump using ISIS as a “more important” issue than rape, is another reminder to survivors to not come forward with their stories because no one will care, much less believe them.

However, all of my life I’ve sort of struggled to feel fully American because I hear so many people telling me that my story is different from the American story.”But it really isn’t, explains the 30-year-old Colombian-American actress, “Being the daughter of immigrants is a very American story. And I want to be part of this narrative, whether people like it or not.” Guerrero, who has penned a memoir detailing the deportation of her parents and the impact it had on her, goes on to explain how her personal experiences have caused her to have conflicting feelings about what the U.S. stands for.“When I think about the United States and being an American, I think about freedom. But fear contradicts freedom, right? So when I hear fear of immigration, I don’t feel very free,” she added. And the star says building literal and figurative walls help perpetuate that fear. “Walls are just a way to scare people, to instill fear,” she said. “’Beyond the wall’ is love, empathy, inclusion.

28,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren Calls Out Senate Republicans' Hypocrisy On Trump,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-debate-tweet_us_57fafd23e4b0e655eab5745d,Republicans are criticizing Donald Trump while keeping a Supreme Court seat open in hopes he'll become president.,2016-10-10,Elizabeth Warren brought the real talk during Sunday's debate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fafd7b1b0000e218ef5bb3.jpeg?cache=u8ocNBfq75&ops=crop_27_34_2973_1397%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) offered an important reality check for Senate Republicans during Sunday night’s presidential debate: They’re keeping a Supreme Court seat open for a man many have suddenly decided is unfit for office.Warren’s tweet came after Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were asked about the high court vacancy since Justice Antonin Scalia’s death in February. President Barack Obama nominated centrist federal appeals judge Merrick Garland to fill the post in March, but Republicans have refused to move the nomination forward.“The next justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country, so of course the American people should have a say in the Court’s direction,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in March. “The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next President nominates, whoever that might be.”Warren has fiercely criticized her GOP colleagues for their obstruction, accusing the party of caving to the extremism that also led to Trump’s rise.“It’s not about a problem with a particular nominee,” she said in March. “What they were trying to do is effectively deny the legitimacy of this president, try to shut down the government, try to keep it from functioning.”McConnell and his fellow Senate Republicans have remained steadfast in their decision to block Garland’s nomination, even when Trump became the GOP nominee. Now, many of those same Republicans are withdrawing support for Trump over his lewd comments and boasts of sexual assault caught on a 2005 tape that was leaked Friday. Some have even called on him to drop out of the race. McConnell, however, is still waiting until after the election to hold a vote on Garland’s nomination.Read more updates on the presidential debate here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

31,POLITICS,"Snap Polls Suggest Clinton Won Debate, But Changed Few Minds",Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/who-won-the-debate_us_57fb0e0ae4b068ecb5dfbc2c,Two surveys both give her the advantage.,2016-10-10,"Ariel Edwards-Levy - Senior Reporter and Polling Editor, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d532dc22200001a00f53c4b.jpg?ops=100_100,"Those who watched Sunday’s match between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump think Clinton won, preliminary polls find, but the results suggest the event did little to change the race.In a scientific online snap poll from YouGov, Clinton won a relatively narrow victory, with 47 percent of registered voters who watched the debate saying she did a better job, 42 percent saying Donald Trump did, and 12 percent saying it was a tie. Undecided voters favored Clinton by a 3-point margin, the pollsters said, with female viewers saying by a 12-point margin that Clinton won and men saying by a 3-point margin that Trump won.A majority of debate-watchers polled by YouGov said that Clinton was better-prepared, more knowledgeable and more presidential, while Trump won top marks only for being more negative and for interrupting more often.Clinton scored a bigger win in a snap poll from CNN/ORC, which recontacted people who said in a past poll that they planned to watch the debate. Fifty-seven percent of the debate-watchers polled said that Clinton won, while 34 percent favored Trump. Clinton’s advantage was in part due to the fact that those tuning into the debate are more likely to be Democrats than the nation as a whole, as CNN’s Jake Tapper noted.Both snap polls, in fact, suggest that few minds were changed by the debate. The share of those polled by CNN who thought Clinton won is nearly identical to the 58 percent of viewers who said before the event that they supported her. YouGov, similarly, found their respondents planning to vote for Clinton by a 48-42 margin, neatly mirroring the divide on who won the debate.The significant difference between the two surveys exemplifies why post-debate snap polls aren’t a reliable way to measure the sentiment of the full electorate. As The Huffington Post wrote after the first presidential debate:The results of snap polls like CNN’s are a step up from focus groups and online “reader polls,” in that they’re making an effort to be representative of the audience that watched the debate, rather than merely recording the opinions of whomever happens to be around to talk on TV or click on a button. Still, there are plenty of reasons to take them with a grain of salt. First, the universe of people watching the debate isn’t the same as the universe of people who will vote in the election. ... Second, it takes time to reach survey respondents. Polls that rush into the field will, by necessity, make some tradeoffs to do so, such as pre-screening for people who planned to watch the debate and are willing to answer questions afterward. And third, to the extent that debates matter ― which they often don’t ― their impact depends in large part on how they’re covered after the fact.Polls taken next week will provide a better reflection on how much this debate, as well as Friday’s release of a tape that caught Trump making derogatory comments about women, changed voters’ minds.But Trump, who lagged Clinton in the polls by 6 points before the latest damaging news cycles and had a less than 14 percent chance of winning per HuffPost’s presidential forecast, needed an exceptionally good night if he hoped to regain ground. The earliest results suggest that’s very unlikely to be the case.YouGov used an online panel to interview 812 registered voters who watched the debate. CNN recontacted 537 voters, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The Internet praised the gentlemen ― who both had a chance to take spotlight and ask a question ― for instilling a sense humanity into an otherwise heated event. Viewers fondly took to Bone’s warm and fuzzy sweater, which matched the warm and fuzzy tone with which he has asked his (serious) question. “What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?”And Becker shut the whole thing down by challenging candidates to say something nice about each other. “Would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?”Candidates take note: Both of these gentlemen asked thoughtful questions, in a respectful tone.Social media users didn’t hesitate to show that Bone and Becker are really what makes America great. A few suspected that with a question like his, Becker probably has experience in conflict resolution. A ton of people applauded Becker for bringing some pleasantness to an otherwise fierce debate.And one person pointed out that Becker achieved the impossible. Bone racked up an equally giant following of fans on social media. Some found him to be a comforting presence. Others became immediate fans of Bone because he reminded them of a certain someone from their childhoods. A few pointed out that Bone, who brought up energy policy, actually asked a very thoughtful question.  And some really just wanted Bone or Becker to run for president. So here’s to Kenneth Bone And Karl Becker, our national treasures. "

Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had several intense verbal exchanges throughout the night. Clinton passionately condemned Trump’s “locker room talk” in the leaked video, in which he spoke about groping women.“What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women,” Clinton said. “And he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is, but I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is, because we’ve seen this throughout the campaign.”She also reminded viewers that Trump has previously ranked women by their appearance and spent nearly a week attacking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado on Twitter.Another notable moment of the debate came when Trump threatened to appoint a special prosecutor to “look into” Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. He suggested that if he were to be elected president, the former secretary of state “would be in jail.”Watch all the highlights above.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But some commentators still attempted to paint Sunday night’s event as a evenly matched fight.Some pundits, like MSNBC’s Chuck Todd, gave Trump credit for not imploding. CNN host Jake Tapper also called the debate a “wash.”Other media outlets, like the Washington Post, compared Trump’s terrifying jail threats to Clinton’s very legitimate criticisms of her opponent’s history of sexism. On Friday, Trump became embroiled in yet another sexism scandal after video leaked showing the GOP nominee boasting about groping women to then-“Access Hollywood” host Bill Bush. CNN referred to Trump’s jail comment and Clinton’s criticism of Trump’s temperament as “the nastiest lines at the town hall.”The New York Times described both candidates as using an “angry tone.” Meanwhile, Reuters lobbed Trump’s “devil” remark in with shots Clinton took on his record with women.The issue of false equivalence has been central to coverage of the 2016 election. In pursuit of objectivity, journalists often stack up the sins of the two major party candidates: the Clinton Foundation vs. the Trump Foundation. Clinton’s use of a private email server vs. Trump’s praising of dictatorships. But as The New York Times’ Paul Krugman puts it, it’s “hard to escape the impression that he’s being graded on a curve.”Sunday seemed to be no different.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

So Trump did what he’s been threatening to do for weeks: He launched a full-out attack on his Democratic rival over her husband’s past behavior toward women, as well as her response to it. “I was getting beaten up for 72 hours on all the networks for inappropriate words from 12 years ago ― locker room talk, whatever you want to call it,” Trump said at a rally in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. “But I said to myself, ‘Wait a minute’ ... Bill Clinton sexually assaulted innocent women and Hillary Clinton attacked those women viciously.” “If they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things, we’ll continue to talk about Bill and Hillary Clinton doing inappropriate things,” Trump said, even though there’s no evidence the Clintons were behind the release of the 2005 tape.Trump hinted he might bring up Bill Clinton’s past during the first presidential debate ― and then praised himself for holding back ― but he referenced it directly at the second presidential debate. On Monday, Trump said that “Bill Clinton was the worst abuser of women ever to sit in the Oval Office” and put some of the blame on his wife.“For decades, Hillary Clinton has been deeply familiar with her husband’s predatory behavior, and instead of trying to stop it, she made it possible for him to take advantage of even more women,” Trump said. “She put even more women in harm’s way and then she goes out and says ‘Oh, I love women, I’m going to help women, I’m going to help women.’ She’s a total hypocrite.”Trump referenced several women who have accused the former president of sexual harassment or assault. Three of them ― Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick ― were his guests at the debate, and have accused Hillary Clinton of attacking them and enabling her husband’s behavior. Bill Clinton has denied all allegations of abuse, and PolitiFact found no evidence that Hillary Clinton threatened his accusers.Trump said Monday that “perhaps the greatest window into the character of Hillary Clinton” was her treatment of the fourth woman he brought as a guest, Kathy Shelton. Clinton was appointed by the court to defend a man accused of raping Shelton when she was 12 years old in 1975. Trump accused Clinton of laughing at the victim, although the audio he references doesn’t back up that claim. “There’s nothing Hillary Clinton won’t do or say to obtain power, and it’s about time people started to understand that,” Trump said after accusing Clinton of laughing about Shelton. During Sunday’s debate, Trump denied that he had ever kissed or groped women without their consent, though it was something he discussed in the 2005 videotape from NBC’s “Access Hollywood.” But multiple women have accused Trump of sexual abuse over the years, and he has his own past of infidelity. He’s also been willing to associate with accused abusers in the past ― Trump launched his Ambridge event by talking about his friendship with Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who has been accused of sexual assault twice.The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s latest remarks.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

It does, however, represent a pretty solid cross-section of the more unique offerings. We selected the below beers for tasting because they were either highlighted as “odd/unique” by the beer blog Porch Drinking, pulled from the Great American Beer Festival’s own “fear no beer” list, or entered into the competition under the “Experimental” category.Weird is good.

Bone began the night as an undecided voter who posed a question at the debate. But he ended the night as the hero America deserves.Bone’s question was thoughtful, to be sure. He asked the candidates how they planned to meet America’s energy needs. But his question was simply overshadowed by his commanding presence and bold fashion choice ― a red power sweater worthy of Hillary Clinton herself.It’s a sweater so vivid ― so daring ― that even Melania’s pussy bow knew to back the f**k off. It’s the one sweater to rule them all. GQ managed to track down Bone’s debate sweater on Amazon.

One percentage point would be added for every point on a meal Sunday through Thursday.Michigan shellacked Rutgers, 78–0, which would have given steakhouse patrons 78 percent off their meal! Well done on such a rare feat, Wolverines.But the restaurant later altered its Facebook promotion copy to cap the discount at 50 percent.Some say they got a raw deal.“Shouldn’t make promises you don’t plan on keeping,” one fan wrote on the restaurant’s Facebook page. “Lol, not enough balls to go 78% off huh?” wrote another.The restaurant said the 50 percent limit was always in place. “Our apologies the discount cap at 50% was not in this initial post,” read a message on Facebook. “This amazing promotion was launched with a cap of ‘up to 50% off’ the food portion of the bill and we’ve updated this post to reflect that.”Business after the lopsided victory was still apparently brisk.H/T For The Win"

The Twittersphere is standing in solidarity with Michael Luo, who was out with family and friends on New York City’s Upper East Side when a woman shouted at him, “go back to China ... go back to your f―-ing country.”Luo, who is the deputy Metro editor at the Times, recounted the experience in a poignant open letter to the woman. He emphasized that although he has grown up in the U.S., he and so many other Asian-Americans feel they’ll always be seen as foreigners. “Maybe you don’t know this, but the insults you hurled at my family get to the heart of the Asian-American experience,” he wrote in the piece. “It’s this persistent sense of otherness that a lot of us struggle with every day. That no matter what we do, how successful we are, what friends we make, we don’t belong.”Luo prompted other Asian-Americans to share their own experiences with racism using the hashtag #ThisIs2016.

And yet every year we send them checks for hilariously small amounts of money. We’re basically Cuba’s grandparents.”Oliver also pointed out that the deodorant for the inmates bears the unfortunate brand name of “Maximum Security.”“It would be like a Holiday Inn Express calling its complimentary lotion ‘Tearful Masturbation,’” he said.Watch the clip above, and stick around to see him finally mention a certain Republican presidential nominee.

In one case, a 15-year-old Syrian boy was being treated for autism in a refugee camp in Turkey, but remained uncommunicative and aggressive and was referred to the Telemental network. A child psychiatrist at the University of Massachusetts who reviewed the case, including a video of the boy, changed the diagnosis to post-traumatic stress disorder and recommended testing him for learning disabilities.The conflict has a double-edged impact on mental health – the trauma of war can cause or exacerbate psychological disorders while making it harder for people to find treatment, Jefee-Bahloul and Barkil-Oteo explain.For example, one of Syria’s two public psychiatric hospitals was forced to close early in the conflict because of fighting in Aleppo. Most of its patients fled across the border to Turkey, cutting their access to treatment at a time when stress was very likely to make their conditions even worse, says Jefee-Bahloul. A 2015 survey by humanitarian organization International Medical Corps of its Syrian patients revealed that 54 percent suffered from severe emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety, and 11 percent from psychotic disorders including schizophrenia.Yet it is extremely hard for Syrians to obtain mental healthcare. Apart from the social stigma associated with psychological disorders, many Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan are unable to afford the countries’ medical fees. While registered refugees in Turkey are entitled to free healthcare, there is a shortage of Arabic-speaking doctors, and psychiatrists in particular. In Syria, the entire health system lies in ruins after what Physicians for Human Rights describes as an “all-out assault on the country’s medical system” by government forces.Meanwhile, humanitarian groups are not always well equipped to provide specialized mental healthcare, or even comfortable doing so, explains Barkil-Oteo. “The larger picture that many NGOs are trying to figure out is, what’s our strategy here? Are we in the business of saving people’s lives, or setting up primary care clinics that could be there for the next five years?”In addition, there are simply not enough highly trained psychiatrists in the region – there were only 70 psychiatrists in Syria before the war broke out, according to the World Health Organization. Most Syrians now working in mental healthcare have an undergraduate degree in psychology, but very little advanced education or clinical experience, Barkil-Oteo says.That is why the Syrian Telemental Health Network is designed to help build the skills of mental health workers through expert supervision, and has experimented with providing online lectures and training videos.While the Syrian conflict “is an emergency situation, it is also not going to be solved anytime soon, so we are thinking five years ahead, and how to set up a system that will be sustainable,” says Barkil-Oteo.Sustainability has been one of the network’s biggest challenges. On the one hand, using telemedicine – the remote delivery of medical care using technology – has helped sustainability, allowing a broad array of psychiatrists and clinics to become involved, and helping local staff develop their skills rather than become reliant on outside experts.The network uses an online system called Collegium Telemedicus that is offered free to humanitarian agencies, and works with a local medical organization that is already well established in the region, called the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM).But being a remote network also has its difficulties. The clinics’ involvement can fluctuate because of the precarious situation on the ground. Everyone from the supervising psychiatrists to the founders work for the network on a voluntary basis, squeezing it in alongside demanding day jobs. Barkil-Oteo and Jefee-Bahloul are currently looking for funding to put more resources into the platform.They have both moved on from Yale.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fbc1fa1a00006e145b8530.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, Foreign Policy has endorsed a presidential candidate, adding its voice to the growing chorus of publications breaking with tradition to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.“In the nearly half century history of Foreign Policy, the editors of this publication have never endorsed a candidate for political office,” the editorial board explained in an article published late Sunday. “We cherish and fiercely protect this publication’s independence and its reputation for objectivity, and we deeply value our relationship with all of our readers, regardless of political orientation. It is for all these reasons that FP’s editors are now breaking with tradition to endorse Hillary Clinton for the next president of the United States.”FP’s editorial board believes Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ― whom it labels “the worst major-party candidate for the job in U.S. history” ― presents such a threat to global stability that the publication had an obligation to weigh in.To support its argument, FP lays out a damning, comprehensive list of Trump’s questionable policy proposals, arguing that he’s already hurt America’s international standing without even setting foot in office.The list includes Trump’s praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s leadership and his encouragement of Russian interference in the U.S. election, his support for torture in violation of international law, his wavering support for treaties with U.S. allies, and his jaw-dropping statements about the proliferation and use of nuclear weapons. “In the areas in which we at FP specialize,” the editorial board writes, “he has repeatedly demonstrated his ignorance of the most basic facts of international affairs, let alone the nuances so crucial to the responsibilities of diplomacy inherent in the U.S. president’s daily responsibilities.”“The dangers Trump presents as president stretch beyond the United States to the international economy, to global security, to America’s allies, as well as to countless innocents everywhere who would be the victims of his inexperience, his perverse policy views, and the profound unsuitability of his temperament for the office he seeks.”Meanwhile, FP calls Clinton “one of the best qualified candidates this country has produced since World War II.”“As first lady, New York senator, and secretary of state, Hillary Clinton regularly distinguished herself by her intelligence, dogged work ethic, ability to work across the political aisle, and leadership on difficult issues,” the editors note. “Whether you agree with all the policy stances of her campaign or not, impartial eyes will conclude that her proposals on climate change, combating terrorism, and human rights are thoughtful and comprehensive — and ultimately worthy of consideration.” What’s more, the paper argues that by electing Clinton, Americans would strike a major blow to one of our greatest threats: “the grotesque and deeply disturbing prospect of a Donald Trump presidency.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The emails ultimately were obtained by hackers working for the Russian government, according to the FBI.Giuliani, a Donald Trump surrogate, lamented that the excerpts were not made public during the primary and attempted to shift the focus away from recently released audio of Trump making lewd comments about sexually assaulting women. “We’ve got two candidates that have flaws,” Giuliani said on “Fox News Sunday” with Chris Wallace. “And I do think one of the really horrible things about that is, had those come out, Bernie Sanders would be the candidate now that we’d be running against, not her, because she fought so hard to keep those secret.”“We now know why, because if she had run the way she ran on those tapes for all those bankers, for all that ― I mean, she got paid millions of dollars for saying that stuff,” Giuliani continued.Host Chris Wallace later pressed Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, whose emails were hacked, ultimately revealing the transcripts. Wallace quizzed Podesta specifically on Clinton’s suggestion to the Wall Street crowd that bankers are in the best position to regulate the banking industry because they know it better than anybody.That has long been a talking point Wall Street uses to fend off regulation, though it was disproven rather dramatically by the 2008 financial crisis.Podesta struggled to answer, suggesting that Clinton meant the opposite of what she said.“That’s hardly a revelation,” he said. “What people on Wall Street know is how to game the system. What she wants to do is crack down on the system, make sure that there’s no one institution that’s too big to fail, and no person that’s too big to jail.”He then noted that Sanders himself, after reading the partial transcripts, said he still supports Clinton."

But according to interviews from 1999, uncovered by CNN, Trump expressed sympathy for Hillary Clinton and the intense public scrutiny she received over her husband’s affairs and the ensuing investigations.“I think she’s gone through terrible times,” Trump told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “I think she’s been through more than any woman should have to bear — everything public. I mean, women go through this on a private basis and can’t take it, she’s on the front page of every newspaper every week with what went on in Washington.”In a similar interview on CNBC, Trump called Clinton “a very, very good person” and said that her situation “[has] gotta be pretty tough.”Throughout this year’s election, Trump and his campaign have tried to present Clinton’s handling of her husband’s affairs as evidence she is unfit to be president. They have further pressed the issue in an attempt to distract from the fallout of a bombshell video released Friday, in which Trump boasted about sexual assault.The GOP nominee has also suggested that he may mention Bill Clinton’s affairs at Sunday’s presidential debate, where the video is expected to take center stage.In a videotaped statement responding to the release of his lewd remarks on Friday, Trump immediately brought up the Clintons.“I’ve said some foolish things, but there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people,” he said. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.”An hour and a half before that debate in St. Louis, Trump held an impromptu press conference with multiple women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

60,POLITICS,Ferguson Looms Over Missouri Politics In The Year Of Trump,Ryan J.

Koster, who's running for governor, said ""being present"" in Ferguson ""was one of the biggest challenges that the administration missed.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS, Mo. ― Nearly two years ago, a grand jury declined to indict a police officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown, sparking widespread unrest. But the scars of the tragedy can be seen far beyond West Florissant Ave., the center of most of the damage sustained on the cold night of Nov. 24, 2014.The events in Ferguson, which drew enormous focus to issues of race and policing in the United States, remain a major factor for politicians running for statewide office in Missouri in 2016. The state, which hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1996, is likely to go for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has proclaimed himself the “law and order” candidate. So Democrats hoping to be elected to statewide office have to find Trump voters willing to split the ticket. (Most Republicans running statewide have condemned Donald Trump’s comments advocating sexual assault, but have stopped short of withdrawing their support.)In a country where most citizens incorrectly believe that crime is up over the past 10 years, Trump ― who has won the endorsement of the national Fraternal Order of Police ― has run a campaign by telling people things are worse than ever. Even with little to no knowledge of the city of Ferguson ― he once made the ludicrous claim that Ferguson is one of the most dangerous places in the world ― Trump’s message still resonates with many. “In almost every county in Missouri, if you blocked traffic with a sign that says ‘Black Lives Matter,’ your ass would get run over with no police investigation into the crime,” said Chris King, managing editor of The St. Louis American. “Realistically, it’s a very dispiriting state for progressives or for black people that are trying to protect their lives and trying to organize their government to be more equitable in the enforcement of justice relative to race.”Attorney General Chris Koster, the Democratic nominee for Missouri governor, received an endorsement from the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police and has spent his career in law enforcement. Koster, who was a Republican until 2007, promised that when he’s governor, officers will “have the back of law enforcement officers at every level, in every county in this state, unquestioned.”But even Koster has come under fire for his handling of Ferguson, accused of wanting the officer who shot Michael Brown, Darren Wilson, fired. Koster told The Huffington Post that the allegation was “completely untrue,” and said discussions simply revolved around the timing of Willson’s departure, since it was clear he would not work as an officer in Ferguson again.Koster, who is running against former Navy Seal and political outsider Eric Greitens, noted that “Trump has a lot of support among police,” but said his bid for governor is helped by the fact that he comes from the law enforcement community. Koster also said he has spent more time in Ferguson than any other statewide official, and criticized current Gov. Jay Nixon’s response to the unrest there.“I think that being present was one of the biggest challenges that the administration missed,” Koster said. “No matter what kind of tragedy it is, whether it’s a hurricane or a tornado or even a moment of racial unrest, the governor has got to be there.”Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who was a constant presence in Ferguson during the unrest and is now running for St. Louis mayor, said the belief that Gov. Nixon wasn’t aggressive enough is widely held.“Across the state of Missouri, I think the predominate opinion is that the governor did not crack down enough on protests, and I think that’s unfortunately an attitude that has taken hold,” French said in an interview on the floor of the Board of Aldermen’s room at City Hall. “What folks really have to understand is that the frustration is justified. There is a need for reform and to change how we do policing in our urban communities.”Too many people, French said, “feel like the answer is just to let the police loose and crush this rebellion. And that’s dangerous, when that’s the predominate thought. Because that attitude will only make things worse.”Koster said in his interview that he thought some of the discussion about Ferguson in the Republican primary was unhelpful and played into racial tensions.“I think in the Republican primary, there was a lot of talk that was coded language, that was in a coded way derogatory of the African-American community,” he said. “They talked a lot about lawlessness in Ferguson, and I thought it was an attempt to create a bit of a divide. Ferguson is done. We know what the path forward is, and we should work together to walk that path.” Koster was critical of the choices many officers made during the Ferguson unrest, without being critical of members of law enforcement themselves.“The sight of rifles down on citizens who were no more than 15 or 20 feet in front of the muzzle of a rifle is not a decision that anyone in law enforcement would ever make again,” Koster said.Still, he said the Nixon administration failed to properly support Chief Jon Belmar, who led the original law enforcement response to the protests. (Nixon put the Missouri Highway Patrol in control of the police response in Ferguson the day after Belmar’s St. Louis County Police Department pointed sniper rifles at peaceful protesters and arrested French, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and this reporter on Aug. 13.)Secretary of State Jason Kander ― who assembled a rifle while blindfolded in a recent campaign ad ― is running to replace incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt (R). In an interview after he met with members of the St. Louis branch of the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce, Kander hit Blunt for what he said was an inadequate response to the unrest in Ferguson in 2014.“The fact that Sen. Blunt has spent such a small amount of time in North St. Louis County in the last two years, it’s not just a knock on him politically,” Kander said. “It genuinely makes me question why someone would want to be the senator for his state when something like that happens, and their objective seems to be to ignore it.” Kander is emphasizing the work he did to raise money from the business community to help Ferguson businesses recover from the unrest.“While it’s good that there’s a national conversation about race going on, we still had 72 businesses that were damaged or destroyed in Jennings, Dellwood and Ferguson,” Kander said.Kander, who spoke about issues of generational wealth during his meeting with black business leaders, said his discussions in Ferguson have given him a better understanding of the community.“There are a lot of people who are in public service because at a very early age they felt let down by people in public office, and they grew up in a way that was very difficult,” Kander said. “I’m not one of those people, it’s not my perspective, and it’s important for me to recognize that the first time I ever really felt that way, I was in Afghanistan with the Army and spending time in vehicles with no armor because of a political decision somebody made. But there’s a lot of people in my state whose earliest memories include that emotion of feeling let down by people who were supposed to provide, or at least create, an environment of opportunity. So acknowledging that perspective is really important.”Sonny Dayan, the owner of STL Cordless in Ferguson, said he’s seen a bit of a rightward swing from some people he knows in the wake of Ferguson. Back in August 2014, Dayan spoke with HuffPost about the support he’d received from the community after his business was broken into. He later talked about his decision not to board up his store in expectation of violence around the grand jury decision of whether to indict Wilson in Brown’s death.“It was a terrible incident, but we’re stronger as a community,” Dayan said this week. Dayan was born in Israel and came to the United States 30 years ago. He said he’s concerned about some of Trump’s foreign policies, but declined to say how he’s voting. “I wish there was somebody else, to be honest with you,” he said. But he added that as a naturalized citizen, he appreciates the country’s political system: The situation is only “temporary,” no matter who gets elected.Dayan said his business isn’t as strong as it was before the unrest, although he feels “there is hope; the sun is coming.” But it’s still been tough dealing with the fallout of an event that impacted the state and nation.“I have kind of mixed feelings about it, because I’m proud of the neighborhood that’s associated most with the change, because I’m proud of the change,” Dayan said. “It’s a mixed-feeling situation.”"

Even with little to no knowledge of the city of Ferguson ― he once made the ludicrous claim that Ferguson is one of the most dangerous places in the world ― Trump’s message still resonates with many. “In almost every county in Missouri, if you blocked traffic with a sign that says ‘Black Lives Matter,’ your ass would get run over with no police investigation into the crime,” said Chris King, managing editor of The St. Louis American. “Realistically, it’s a very dispiriting state for progressives or for black people that are trying to protect their lives and trying to organize their government to be more equitable in the enforcement of justice relative to race.”Attorney General Chris Koster, the Democratic nominee for Missouri governor, received an endorsement from the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police and has spent his career in law enforcement. Koster, who was a Republican until 2007, promised that when he’s governor, officers will “have the back of law enforcement officers at every level, in every county in this state, unquestioned.”But even Koster has come under fire for his handling of Ferguson, accused of wanting the officer who shot Michael Brown, Darren Wilson, fired. Koster told The Huffington Post that the allegation was “completely untrue,” and said discussions simply revolved around the timing of Willson’s departure, since it was clear he would not work as an officer in Ferguson again.Koster, who is running against former Navy Seal and political outsider Eric Greitens, noted that “Trump has a lot of support among police,” but said his bid for governor is helped by the fact that he comes from the law enforcement community. Koster also said he has spent more time in Ferguson than any other statewide official, and criticized current Gov. Jay Nixon’s response to the unrest there.“I think that being present was one of the biggest challenges that the administration missed,” Koster said. “No matter what kind of tragedy it is, whether it’s a hurricane or a tornado or even a moment of racial unrest, the governor has got to be there.”Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who was a constant presence in Ferguson during the unrest and is now running for St. Louis mayor, said the belief that Gov. Nixon wasn’t aggressive enough is widely held.“Across the state of Missouri, I think the predominate opinion is that the governor did not crack down enough on protests, and I think that’s unfortunately an attitude that has taken hold,” French said in an interview on the floor of the Board of Aldermen’s room at City Hall. “What folks really have to understand is that the frustration is justified. There is a need for reform and to change how we do policing in our urban communities.”Too many people, French said, “feel like the answer is just to let the police loose and crush this rebellion. And that’s dangerous, when that’s the predominate thought. Because that attitude will only make things worse.”Koster said in his interview that he thought some of the discussion about Ferguson in the Republican primary was unhelpful and played into racial tensions.“I think in the Republican primary, there was a lot of talk that was coded language, that was in a coded way derogatory of the African-American community,” he said. “They talked a lot about lawlessness in Ferguson, and I thought it was an attempt to create a bit of a divide. Ferguson is done. We know what the path forward is, and we should work together to walk that path.” Koster was critical of the choices many officers made during the Ferguson unrest, without being critical of members of law enforcement themselves.“The sight of rifles down on citizens who were no more than 15 or 20 feet in front of the muzzle of a rifle is not a decision that anyone in law enforcement would ever make again,” Koster said.Still, he said the Nixon administration failed to properly support Chief Jon Belmar, who led the original law enforcement response to the protests. (Nixon put the Missouri Highway Patrol in control of the police response in Ferguson the day after Belmar’s St. Louis County Police Department pointed sniper rifles at peaceful protesters and arrested French, Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and this reporter on Aug. 13.)Secretary of State Jason Kander ― who assembled a rifle while blindfolded in a recent campaign ad ― is running to replace incumbent Sen. Roy Blunt (R). In an interview after he met with members of the St. Louis branch of the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce, Kander hit Blunt for what he said was an inadequate response to the unrest in Ferguson in 2014.“The fact that Sen. Blunt has spent such a small amount of time in North St. Louis County in the last two years, it’s not just a knock on him politically,” Kander said. “It genuinely makes me question why someone would want to be the senator for his state when something like that happens, and their objective seems to be to ignore it.” Kander is emphasizing the work he did to raise money from the business community to help Ferguson businesses recover from the unrest.“While it’s good that there’s a national conversation about race going on, we still had 72 businesses that were damaged or destroyed in Jennings, Dellwood and Ferguson,” Kander said.Kander, who spoke about issues of generational wealth during his meeting with black business leaders, said his discussions in Ferguson have given him a better understanding of the community.“There are a lot of people who are in public service because at a very early age they felt let down by people in public office, and they grew up in a way that was very difficult,” Kander said. “I’m not one of those people, it’s not my perspective, and it’s important for me to recognize that the first time I ever really felt that way, I was in Afghanistan with the Army and spending time in vehicles with no armor because of a political decision somebody made. But there’s a lot of people in my state whose earliest memories include that emotion of feeling let down by people who were supposed to provide, or at least create, an environment of opportunity. So acknowledging that perspective is really important.”Sonny Dayan, the owner of STL Cordless in Ferguson, said he’s seen a bit of a rightward swing from some people he knows in the wake of Ferguson. Back in August 2014, Dayan spoke with HuffPost about the support he’d received from the community after his business was broken into. He later talked about his decision not to board up his store in expectation of violence around the grand jury decision of whether to indict Wilson in Brown’s death.“It was a terrible incident, but we’re stronger as a community,” Dayan said this week. Dayan was born in Israel and came to the United States 30 years ago. He said he’s concerned about some of Trump’s foreign policies, but declined to say how he’s voting. “I wish there was somebody else, to be honest with you,” he said. But he added that as a naturalized citizen, he appreciates the country’s political system: The situation is only “temporary,” no matter who gets elected.Dayan said his business isn’t as strong as it was before the unrest, although he feels “there is hope; the sun is coming.” But it’s still been tough dealing with the fallout of an event that impacted the state and nation.“I have kind of mixed feelings about it, because I’m proud of the neighborhood that’s associated most with the change, because I’m proud of the change,” Dayan said. “It’s a mixed-feeling situation.”"

A friend referenced it in passing on social media – and perhaps your friend didn’t tell you where he or she heard that advice. Or you simply noticed increasing buzz surrounding the topic, more momentum to undergo a health screening, to not vaccinate a child, to steam clean –what? In the disorienting collision between the fast and furious Information Age and frighteningly complex, ever-evolving 21st century health care, many are at a loss to determine what’s best for their health. With no way to possibly process all the disparate, frequently changing messages, experts say passionate accounts from public figures – celebrities – cut through much of the noise and communicate clearly, where health providers often don’t. “I think the crux of much of this problem is that U.S. adults have very low health literacy,” says Dr. Shelly Campo, an associate professor of community and behavioral health at the University of Iowa, with expertise in health communication. “We don’t have a lot of background in science and math and health science,” she says – or a strong grasp of other subjects that would better help us make sense of the whirring medical world. “At the same time, we’ve got an unbelievably complicated health system.”So we take shortcuts – often unwittingly, unknowingly and even necessarily. And Americans aren’t alone in doing so, says Steven Hoffman, an associate professor of law at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, Ontario, and associate professor of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.There’s the still widely touted “Katie Couric effect” that led to a bump in Americans seeking colonoscopies immediately after the TV journalist televised her own screening for colon cancer in 2003. Just as singer-songwriter Kylie Minogue’s now decade-old announcement that she’d been diagnosed with breast cancer sharply increased mammogram bookings right afterward in several Australia states. And today, “Whenever Dr. Oz recommends something on his TV show to his 4 million American viewers, people immediately search it on Google and sales of those products skyrocket in stores,” says Hoffman, who has studied why celebrities – who, more often, don’t have MDs – affect people’s health decisions. “There have been studies looking at the effects of Jenny McCarthy – [where] people have cited her as a reason for why they don’t vaccinate their children.” Despite subsequent research debunking a purported link between vaccines and autism, the strong anti-vaccine stance of the model, TV host and actress ​still holds sway.While many have decried McCarthy’s influence in this area, even benign-seeming claims, like reality TV star and then-pregnant Kim Kardashian’s unequivocal rave reviews last year of morning sickness medication Diclegis, have raised eyebrows and concerns among some in the health field. That’s because experts say passionate support and compelling personal narratives may overshadow the nuance involved in individual decision-making, or overstate a case for a particular prevention, treatment or drug. Kardashian corrected her original endorsement of Diclegis after the Food and Drug Administration took issue with the drug’s maker, Duchesnay, for allowing her to tout the drug’s benefits on social media without also mentioning limitations and risks associated with the drug, which she included in a corrected ad.The FDA intervention was a reminder of the powerful potential of celebrities to affect individual health behaviors – even if we say we know better. “People are biologically, psychologically and socially hardwired to follow celebrities’ medical advice,” Hoffman says. “In a sense, everything is against us in trying to protect ourselves from it.” One evolutionary reason for this is the need to make relatively quick decisions in the face of a flurry of information. “We’re looking for heuristics, or shortcuts, in order to be able to make decisions,” he says. “That would be like the economics explanation.”Marketing research finds celebrities transfer their golden glow – their halo – to whatever they endorse, while digging into the sociology literature shows that celebrities’ vast social networks contribute to that considerable influence, Hoffman says. From a psychological standpoint, following celebrity advice limits so-called cognitive dissonance, which might occur when, on the one hand, you adore or identify with this person, while on the other, the celebrity gives rotten health advice that could hurt you. The two don’t compute, and Hoffman says, “could actually create dissonance within our minds and cause psychological stress.”The antidote? First, take off the rosy 3-D glasses. Don’t take it on face that the face you’ve come to know – and maybe even trust – has good health intel to share. Unless, that is, they have it on good authority. “Some celebrities come out and make public service announcements that are really beneficial,” says Janet Schwartz,​ an assistant professor of marketing at the A.B. Freeman School of Business at Tulane University, who is an expert in how consumers make health care decisions. Hoffman gives the example of ex-smoker and model/entrepreneur Christy Turlington doing a television ad with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention against smoking. Others, like actress Glenn Close, have championed an effort to destigmatize mental illness, in step with broader public health efforts to do the same.Conversely, where celebrities seem to be taking the leap on their own – or going further out on a limb than reputable health agencies and providers – experts say that’s an obvious red flag. Because a celebrity may be a well-known familiar voice – like a good friend or somebody at the office – that can lend a health claim “an air of legitimacy and authority that is really unsubstantiated by science,” Schwartz says. Consider the source behind the source – if one exists – and the reason for the message as well. “So whenever a celebrity says, ‘This worked for me, I did this.’ I would first want to know, are they getting paid to say that, second, are they trying to sell products for which they do get a financial benefit and, third, how do they actually know that, and why are they promoting this?” Hoffman says. “When Gwyneth Paltrow talks about the benefits of steam cleaning her vagina, people should immediately ask, ‘How does she know that it helps?’”​More to the point, he says, numbers matter. Where large controlled trials lend credibility, one person’s testimony, beyond being difficult or impossible to prove, doesn’t translate to another’s experience. “What one person reports as being beneficial to them is not generalizable to a population,” he says. “Unless … studied by scientists in rigorous ways, it’s really hard to make any kind of claims that people should trust.” More than anything, experts say, it’s important to return to the basics of medical decision-making. Patients should discuss health concerns and questions with their physicians or other health providers until they get answers that are clear and helpful enough to make an individual decision. “Of course, Dr. Google is probably the first person you turn to,” Schwartz says. Look to reputable sources online, like the CDC, and providers you trust – and get a second opinion on celebrity health claims, just as you might when questioning the advice of a trained health professional. “It’s good to check with multiple sources and see what you’re hearing,” Campo says.

67,POLITICS,GOP Chances Riding On Trump’s Ability To Offer A Sincere Apology,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-debate-apology_us_57fa7514e4b0b6a430332882,Good luck with that.,2016-10-09,GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump’s chances to salvage his campaign likely rest on his ability to offer a sincere apology from this debate stage at Washington University in St. Louis on Sunday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. LOUIS ― Donald Trump takes the stage Sunday night with his entire presidential campaign likely riding on his ability to accomplish two things that he may be incapable of: apologizing, and sounding like he actually means it.“Asking him to show self-awareness, contrition, sincerity and remorse is like asking a turtle to fly,” said Texas GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak. “He is now an extinction-level threat to the party of Lincoln.”“It’s a tall order,” acknowledged Randy Evans, a Republican National Committee member from Georgia who hopes his party mates will give Trump an opportunity to make things right. “I think everybody should take a deep breath, see what the next 48 hours hold.”Just two mornings ago, Trump was positioned to enjoy a boost from the second presidential debate, thanks to his dismal showing in the first debate two weeks earlier. Trump was almost certain to do at least a little better in the “town hall” format, with the opportunity to interact with questioners from the audience rather than exclusively with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.That alone was almost certain to generate media and public perceptions that Trump was the winner of round two, setting up the final debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 19.But that entire scenario disintegrated over the span of a few hours starting late Friday afternoon, when The Washington Post published a leaked recording of Trump from 2005. In it, Trump bragged that his fame permitted him to make uninvited advances on women, including by grabbing them by their genitals. Even Trump supporters acknowledged this constituted sexual assault ― a serious felony punishable with prison time ― although they suggest that perhaps Trump was just bragging and hadn’t actually done it.“How much exaggeration was involved in that, I don’t know,” Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told ABC News on Sunday morning. “I do know there’s a tendency on that part of some men at different times to exaggerate things like this.”Trump over the course of the previous year had already accused undocumented Mexican immigrants of being rapists. He mocked prisoners of war for getting captured. He said a federal judge of Mexican descent was unable to preside fairly over a fraud trial against his Trump University real estate courses. He called for a blanket ban on Muslims from entering the country. He lashed out at the Muslim family of an American soldier killed in Iraq.But Republicans who countenanced all of those episodes decided that this latest ― a 59-year-old man bragging about his ability to grope women with impunity ― was unforgivable. Some two dozen Republican members of Congress withdrew their support from Trump or called on him to drop out. Others gave him one last chance to make things right.“Donald doesn’t have much choice at this point: He needs to throw himself on the mercy of the American people tomorrow night. He needs to take full responsibility for his words and his behavior. He needs to beg their forgiveness, and he needs to pledge to finally change his ways,” Arkansas Sen.

Date - Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5f543ec2240000f409921c3e.jpg?ops=100_100,"ST. LOUIS ― Donald Trump takes the stage Sunday night with his entire presidential campaign likely riding on his ability to accomplish two things that he may be incapable of: apologizing, and sounding like he actually means it.“Asking him to show self-awareness, contrition, sincerity and remorse is like asking a turtle to fly,” said Texas GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak. “He is now an extinction-level threat to the party of Lincoln.”“It’s a tall order,” acknowledged Randy Evans, a Republican National Committee member from Georgia who hopes his party mates will give Trump an opportunity to make things right. “I think everybody should take a deep breath, see what the next 48 hours hold.”Just two mornings ago, Trump was positioned to enjoy a boost from the second presidential debate, thanks to his dismal showing in the first debate two weeks earlier. Trump was almost certain to do at least a little better in the “town hall” format, with the opportunity to interact with questioners from the audience rather than exclusively with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.That alone was almost certain to generate media and public perceptions that Trump was the winner of round two, setting up the final debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 19.But that entire scenario disintegrated over the span of a few hours starting late Friday afternoon, when The Washington Post published a leaked recording of Trump from 2005. In it, Trump bragged that his fame permitted him to make uninvited advances on women, including by grabbing them by their genitals. Even Trump supporters acknowledged this constituted sexual assault ― a serious felony punishable with prison time ― although they suggest that perhaps Trump was just bragging and hadn’t actually done it.“How much exaggeration was involved in that, I don’t know,” Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani told ABC News on Sunday morning. “I do know there’s a tendency on that part of some men at different times to exaggerate things like this.”Trump over the course of the previous year had already accused undocumented Mexican immigrants of being rapists. He mocked prisoners of war for getting captured. He said a federal judge of Mexican descent was unable to preside fairly over a fraud trial against his Trump University real estate courses. He called for a blanket ban on Muslims from entering the country. He lashed out at the Muslim family of an American soldier killed in Iraq.But Republicans who countenanced all of those episodes decided that this latest ― a 59-year-old man bragging about his ability to grope women with impunity ― was unforgivable. Some two dozen Republican members of Congress withdrew their support from Trump or called on him to drop out. Others gave him one last chance to make things right.“Donald doesn’t have much choice at this point: He needs to throw himself on the mercy of the American people tomorrow night. He needs to take full responsibility for his words and his behavior. He needs to beg their forgiveness, and he needs to pledge to finally change his ways,” Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton (R) told an Iowa audience Saturday. “If he doesn’t do those things, if he won’t do those things, then he should step aside and allow the Republican Party to replace him with an elder statesman who will.”For Trump to beg for forgiveness, though, could require him to learn a brand-new behavior at age 70.

He wasn’t at that time, you know, running for office, he wasn’t thinking of office. He’s gone through a very, very intensive process, as you know it is, in running for president,” Giuliani said. “He understands the responsibility is on his shoulders now, which wasn’t there back then.”On CNN, Giuliani said that he didn’t know if Trump “did it to anyone.” (”It” here, remember, is committing sexual assault.)“This is talk,” Giuliani said.Giuliani said that a lot of men talk the way Trump did, and that neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton should “throw stones” because they have “both sinned.” Giuliani said Trump “feels terrible about it,” but perhaps not terrible enough to stop him from lashing out at Clinton over her husband’s infidelities.“I believe he will not bring up Bill Clinton’s personal life,” Giuliani said, but added that Trump might talk about how Hillary Clinton had responded to her husband’s infidelities in the 1990s.Giuliani admitted on ABC’s “This Week” that what Trump was talking about in 2005 would have been sexual assault.“Whether it happened or not, I don’t know,” he said. “I do know there’s a tendency on the part of some men at different times to exaggerate things like this, and I’m not in any way trying to excuse it or condone it.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Chris Christie, turned Trump tower into a “war room” in response, Llamas reported. “They were supposed to do debate prep, but this was all damage control.”The video’s emergence apparently rattled Trump, who was of the mind that it wasn’t going to turn into much of a story. According to Llamas, the Trump team was hard at work crafting a “comeback” narrative to accommodate the GOP nominee’s post-debate spin for Sunday when news of Trump’s remarks hit their tipping point.Llamas went on to report that Trump’s Saturday emergence from his building to greet fans on the street occurred because the reality television mogul needed “a pick-me-up.”The reporter added that “there is no doubt” that Trump plans to bring up Bill Clinton’s past improprieties in Sunday’s debate."

John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who as recently as last week were defending their party’s White House nominee.Even House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who did not unendorse Trump the way many colleagues did, disinvited Trump from a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday.But Trump is not going away, or taking it quietly. In a flurry of tweets and retweets, he hammered Republicans for being offended by the idea of a commander in chief who professed on tape that he likes to grab women “by the pussy.” It was that last tweet that essentially served as a declaration of war on GOP leaders, and if there was any doubt, talking points obtained by reporters confirmed Trump’s intent to burn down the house.What is perhaps the scariest part for Republicans is that Trump may be right, although only partially for the reasons he believes.On the one hand, Trump’s callous and baldly revealed attitude toward women will be toxic for many moderate and independent voters who had a hard time pulling for Hillary Clinton. They almost assure that he will lose.On the other hand, many, many Trump voters do not care what he said about women, and only see abandoning Trump as a betrayal of the grass-roots. They are likely to shun the candidates who were belatedly horrified by Trump, and could take them down along with their orange-tinted hero.For instance, just watch what happened to Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nev.), who is running for Senate in the Silver State, when he renounced Trump. (Hint: boos were involved.)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

She was married.” He went on to discuss his attraction to others.“I just start kissing them,” he said. “And when you’re a star they let you do it.”“Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything,” Trump said.On Saturday afternoon, CNN published a separate report detailing remarks Trump made over the course of several years while appearing on Howard Stern’s radio program.The remarks included discussing the size of his daughter’s breasts and that he once had sex with three women at the same time. Trump was asked if he would have sex with a black woman and responded, “It depends on what your definition of black is.”The remarks were the last straw for some Republicans who have stuck with him through a series of controversial remarks, including calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals,” calling for a ban on Muslim immigrants, attacking a judge of Mexican descent, attacking the Gold Star family of a Muslim soldier killed at war and saying Senator John McCain was not a war hero because he had been a prisoner of war.House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump to a scheduled appearance on Saturday in Wisconsin.

But anybody who is unsure of the answer to that question doesn’t understand Donald Trump or what motivates him. As Giuliani said, echoing Trump over the weekend: Trump’s not going anywhere.His determination to stay in the race draws from a variety of motivations, but each one would be sufficient on its own. Let’s run through them.Running for president, for Trump, has never been about being president. Trump’s camp floated the idea that John Kasich, if he became vice president, could have the domestic policy portfolio. Oh, and also foreign policy.One of Trump’s earliest aides said he told her he wanted to get into double-digits in the polls, finish second and give a speech at the convention. He never thought voters would be crazy enough to nominate him, let alone elect him.Instead, Trump’s end game, according to people close to him, is to build a television network around his politics and his personality. It’s convenient that Breitbart’s Steve Bannon is the CEO of his campaign, and Roger Ailes, the former Fox News boss, is an adviser. The Mercer family, billionaires who are funding Trump’s campaign and could back a network, are sticking by the nominee in the wake of the leaked tape of him boasting about his penchant for sexual assault.In order to launch that network, Trump needs the continued support of his millions of fevered backers, and dropping out would be the quickest way to let them down. “I’ve never withdrawn in my life,” Trump told the Washington Post, framing his decision to stay in as one of courage in the face of fire. And there’s little upside in retreating, because it would do nothing to win him back the support of the Republican establishment. Even if it could, Trump has nothing but contempt for GOP leaders, who to him are a hapless batch of losers he easily mowed down in the primary. Why would he do a favor for a party establishment he despises? Why does he care if Republicans maintain control of the Senate or the House? This is a guy who, if it were up to him, would happily put Peter Thiel on the Supreme Court.For Trump, the greatest risk of dropping out is that it might actually work. If a new candidate took his place and surged to the lead, beating Hillary Clinton on Election Day, it’s hard to imagine a scenario that would be more devastating to Trump’s ego. That’s a far worse scenario than Trump losing to Clinton.In fact, the manner of his impending loss couldn’t be any more perfect for Trump. He was already spiraling downward, threatening to mar his self-image as a winner with a crushing loss ― to a woman, no less. But now, Trump can blame a squishy Republican establishment that abandoned him at the crucial hour over some politically correct bullshit. As long as his supporters buy that nonsensical line, he can rest assured they’ll continue to buy whatever he wants to sell them after the election. And a new poll from Morning Consult, conducted after the explicit audio emerged, found that three-quarters planned to stick by him.“Donald’s sticking in. All his old supporters are there,” said a source close to the GOP nominee. “The only people who have left are the politicians.”Giuliani referenced those millions of backers each time he was quizzed about Trump’s intentions. “He was selected by more Republican voters than anyone has ever been selected in a Republican Primary. He owes them the duty to run,” he told NBC’s Chuck Todd. Giuliani suggested to Fox News’ Chris Wallace that Trump’s supporters will stand by him. “He was selected by millions and millions of Republicans who still very much believe in him, who I think are more willing to forgive maybe than some others,” he said.“I believe he’s going to remain in the race,” Giuliani concluded. “In fact, I know he is.”Sign up to get Ryan Grim’s newsletter, Bad News, in your inbox.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

76,POLITICS,"Cornered Trump Could Go Nuclear At Debate, Defies Calls To Quit Race Over Vulgar Video","Richard Cowan and Steve Holland, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ahead-of-debate-trump-defies-calls-he-quit-over-vulgar-video_us_57faa5a9e4b0e655eab53f92,The Republican nominee is on the warpath.,2016-10-09,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump waves to supporters outside the front door of Trump Tower where he lives in the Manhattan borough of New York, U.S., October 8, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fab01c1b0000e218ef5af6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican Donald Trump on Sunday struck a defiant tone in the face of calls for him to abandon the U.S. presidential race, attacking prominent Republicans and saying he had “tremendous support” despite a storm over his vulgar comments about women.On a day in which Trump was due to debate Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton a month ahead of the Nov. 8 election, Trump took to social media to try to squelch any speculation that he could leave the race.“Tremendous support (except for some Republican leadership”). Thank you,” Trump wrote on Twitter.“So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers - and elections - go down!” Trump tweeted, apparently referring to Republican lawmakers seeking re-election who have withdrawn their support for him over a 2005 video that emerged on Friday.Trump, then a reality TV star, is heard on the video talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman. The video was taped only months after Trump married his third wife, Melania.The controversy has pitched Trump, 70, into the biggest crisis of his 16-month-old campaign and deepened fissures between him and establishment Republicans.The pressure on him will be intense at the 9 p.m. EDT (0100 GMT Monday) debate at Washington University in St. Louis. CNN reported the first questions would be about the video.Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters on Clinton’s campaign plane: “We understand that this is uncharted territory ... to face an opponent that is in the grips of a downward spiral in terms of his own party belatedly walking away from him.”A source close to the campaign of Trump’s vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, dismissed talk among some political analysts the Indiana governor might bolt the ticket in the uproar over Trump’s comments.“Absolutely not,” the source told Reuters.At a Democratic campaign event in Chicago, President Barack Obama weighed in on the controversy, saying Trump had been degrading not only to women, but to minorities, immigrants, people of other faiths, and the disabled.Obama said that “tells you he is insecure.”“He pumps himself up by putting other people down,” Obama said.SUPPORT WOBBLINGWith Republican Party leaders in crisis mode and doubts emerging over Trump’s ability to draw support from crucial undecided voters, there were nonetheless some early signs many of his core supporters would remain loyal.A public opinion poll by POLITICO/Morning Consult, taken just after news broke of the video, found 39 percent of voters thought Trump should withdraw, and 45 percent said he should stay. Of those who said Trump should leave, only 12 percent identified themselves as Republicans.As of Sunday afternoon, at least 160 of the United States’ 332 sitting Republican governors, senators and House of Representatives members had condemned Trump’s remarks, according to a Reuters review of official statements and local news coverage.At least 30 had called for him to withdraw from the race and three other officeholders said he should consider doing so. Eight of those said they were withdrawing their endorsement as well.Those facing a difficult re-election were more likely to speak out. All but six of the 40 Republican officeholders whose races are considered competitive had condemned Trump’s comments on the video, although only three members of that group called for him to drop out.The threat to Trump’s campaign was good news for investors in Mexico’s peso, which surged more than 1.8 percent to 18.955 per dollar before the debate after markets in Asia began Monday trading. If elected, Trump has vowed to slap tariffs on Mexican imports, renegotiate trade deals and build a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants.Any attempt to replace Trump on the ballot would face huge legal and logistical hurdles.The Trump campaign was battling back, circulating “talking points” to a core of high-profile Republicans who promote Trump in the news media. The points sought to undermine establishment Republicans who have abandoned Trump.“They are more concerned with their political future than they are about the future of the country,” said a copy of the talking points, described to Reuters by two sources close to the campaign.A real estate developer making his first run at public office, Trump has made his battle against the establishment a central campaign theme.“Phones have been blowing up for the past 24 hours,” said a prominent Republican political operative in Washington, referring to a heavy volume of calls among party officials and Republican members of Congress.DOWN-BALLOT RACESThe operative, who did not want to be identified, said Trump’s troubles could steer campaign donations away from him and to Republican candidates for Congress and other down-ballot offices.The source said Trump could help himself most during the presidential debate - the second of three before the election - if he addressed the video and an Oct. 1 New York Times report that he took so substantial a tax deduction on a declared $916 million loss in 1995 that he could legally have avoided paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years.Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump adviser, told Sunday talk shows that Trump at the debate might choose to go on the offensive against Clinton by bringing up marital infidelities of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.Republicans have attacked Clinton, 68, over what they say is her role in trying to discredit women who accused her husband of sexual misconduct decades ago.Despite having recovered from a string of setbacks, Trump had an uphill battle to win the White House. Before the video surfaced, a Reuters/Ipsos poll had Clinton leading by 5 points on Friday. The question now is whether Trump’s quest for the presidency has been dealt a lethal blow.(Reporting by Steve Holland in St. Louis and Richard Cowan in Washington; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason in St. Louis, Alana Wise, Susan Heavey, Susan Cornwell, Andy Sullivan, Diane Bartz and Susan Heavey in Washington,; Emily Flitter in New York and Ayesha Rascoe in Chicago; Editing by Alistair Bell and Peter Cooney)Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The interaction is something to behold, and Giuliani, a surrogate for Trump who made the rounds on nearly every political Sunday show, was clearly taken aback, struggling to find the words to defend the Republican nominee. “He’s talking about actions that are sexual assault and he was 59 or 60 years old when he said it,” Tapper told Giuliani. “This wasn’t something that he said when he was 18 years old.”“He’s talking about a feeling of entitlement: Because he’s a star he can go up to women and grab them by the vagina and it’s okay, he won’t get in trouble for it,” Tapper continued. “It’s really offensive on a basic human level. Who did he do that to?”Giuliani agreed that Trump’s comments ― picked up on a hot mic as he sat aboard an “Access Hollywood” bus in 2005 ― were offensive, but dismissed it as talk, and not behavior the reality TV star actually engaged in. “First of all, I don’t know if he did it to anyone,” Giuliani said. “This is talk, and ―uh ― gosh almighty, you know, he who hasn’t sinned throw the first stone here.”Tapper cut him off, refusing to accept that Trump’s crude talk about grabbing women “by the pussy” was normal. “I will gladly tell you, Mr. Mayor, I have never said that,” Tapper said. “I have never done that; I’m happy to throw a stone. I don’t know any man ― I have been in locker rooms, I’ve been a member of a fraternity ― I’ve never heard any man brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it, never.”Again, Giuliani said Trump’s words were being distorted, and that Tapper had “taken it to an extra degree.”“The fact is men talk like that,” Giuliani reasoned. “Not all men, but men do.”“You talk like that?” Tapper said. “He was wrong for doing it. I’m not justifying it,” Giuliani continued, talking over Tapper. “I believe it’s wrong; I know he believes it’s wrong.”So far, 23 Republicans in Congress have revoked their support of Trump since the audio was made public. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It is spread through contaminated water and has a short incubation period, which leads to rapid outbreaks.“Randel is isolated, you must cross water, you must go high in the mountains, cars cannot go, motorcycles cannot go,” said Eli Pierre Celestin, a member of team that fights cholera for the health ministry. “People have started dying.”“There are nurses but no doctors,” he said, concerned that cholera would spread due to lack of hygiene and as ground water moved because of rain and floods.He said there were also outbreaks in Port-a-Piment and Les Anglais, towns at the end of the Tiburon peninsula hardest hit by Matthew this week.

Police identified the assailant as a 39-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.A spokeswoman for the Israel Prisons Service said the attacker had been ordered by a court to start a four-month jail sentence next week after being convicted of assaulting a police officer.In the past year, Palestinians, many acting alone and often with rudimentary weapons, have killed at least 35 Israelis and two visiting Americans in attacks.During that period, at least 220 Palestinians have died in violent incidents in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Of those, 149 were identified by authorities as assailants while others were killed during clashes and protests.Israel says anti-Israeli incitement by Palestinian officials and on social media networks is stoking attacks.Palestinian leaders say assailants are acting out of desperation over the collapse in 2014 of peace talks and the expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied land that Palestinians seek for an independent state."

It is essential to restore peace and stability over a short period of time,” he said, adding the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition was also looking at reforms, and planning to hold talks with opposition parties.Hailemariam said the state of emergency was effective from Oct.8.The violence has put a shadow over a nation where a state-led industrial drive has created one of Africa’s fastest growing economies, but where the government has also faced rising international criticism and popular opposition to its authoritarian approach to development.Last Sunday, at least 55 people were killed in a stampede in Ethiopia’s Oromiya region that was triggered when police used teargas and shot in the air to disperse anti-government protesters at a religious festival.That has added the toll to more than 450 the number of people rights groups and opponents say have been killed in unrest since 2015.

If the death count is confirmed, it would be the deadliest attack in a war that has already had a devastating civilian toll. “We have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the Saudi-led Coalition and are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with U.S. principles, values and interests, including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemen’s tragic conflict,” Price said Saturday. The Obama administration has come under increasing criticism by human rights groups and some members of Congress for providing Saudi Arabia with weapons and logistical and intelligence support for the bombing campaign in Yemen. White House officials have emphasized that the U.S. does not make targeting decisions ― but U.S. assistance has undoubtedly enabled Saudi slaughter of civilians. The White House has been hesitant to condemn Saudi Arabia’s actions in Yemen, but there have been indications of growing discomfort with continuing to support the war. Reuters reported in August that the U.S. was downsizing the number of military personnel and other staffers who were assigned to coordinating the air campaign with Riyadh. And on Saturday, Price said the administration was “deeply disturbed” by reports of the airstrikes on the funeral hall and referred to a “troubling series of attacks striking Yemeni civilians.”The Saudi-led coalition said in a statement it would investigate the incident with help from the U.S. The airstrikes targeted a funeral for the father of Galal al-Rawishan, the interior minister who is allied with the Houthis, a rebel group that took over the Yemeni capital of Sanaa last year and is loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted in 2012. The Saudi-led coalition launched its air campaign, ostensibly targeting Houthis, shortly after. Both sides have been faulted for attacks that kill civilians ― but the United Nations humanitarian coordinator Jamie McGoldrick blamed the Saudi-led coalition for Saturday’s attack.

85,POLITICS,Let's Not Forget That Donald Trump Would Be A Total Disaster On Climate Change,Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-climate-change_us_57f7f882e4b0b6a43031f6b7,"Or, as he would say, the “total, and very expensive, hoax.""",2016-10-09,Donald Trump is all kinds of wrong on climate change.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57f7f90c1b0000e218ef55bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump had a hot mess of a weekend, after the Friday release of a video that caught him talking about how he likes to grope women. While the hot mic moment is threatening to sink the GOP nominee’s campaign, here’s yet another reason we should all be concerned about him: his terrible record on climate change.Trump has called climate change a hoax allegedly created by the Chinese government to destroy American manufacturing. Yet when Hillary Clinton called him out for these comments during the first presidential debate, Trump denied denying climate change ― despite the fact that he has tweeted about it a whole bunch, and the Internet never forgets.He has also said that:he is “not a great believer in man-made climate change”Trump wasn’t directly asked about climate change during the last debate; his only comments were in response to Clinton. However, he offered a slightly less deranged ― but no less dangerous ― answer to written questions last month. Trump said there is “still much that needs to be investigated in the field of ‘climate change,’” and then listed a bunch of things we should “perhaps” worry more about ― clean water, malaria, food production. Those are perfectly acceptable things to worry about, but they are also all issues that climate change would make worse.Trump did at least say that “perhaps we should be focused on developing energy sources and power production that alleviates the need for dependence on fossil fuels,” although he did not specify why we might want to do that.Trump has also bashed wind turbines, tweeting that they are “failing all over the world,” “very costly and unsightly ” and bird-killing machines that need to be stopped.Yet what Trump actually thinks about climate change is likely a little more complicated. In 2009, he and other business leaders signed a letter supporting climate action that was published in The New York Times. And he has sought to build a sea wall to protect his property in Ireland from “global warming and its effects.” (Which is perhaps more indicative of his love of walls than his fear of climate change.)His running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has tried to soften Trump’s denial of climate change. Pence’s latest strategy is to accept that humans can influence the climate, while still suggesting that there’s nothing the United States government can do about it.While Trump and Pence may be taking different approaches to the subject of climate change, both would be disastrous in office. Trump has tapped a well-known climate denier, Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, to lead his transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency ― an agency he plans to abolish, anyway.And he has picked energy lobbyist Mike McKenna to take the lead on the Department of Energy transition. It’s pretty safe to say that whatever work has been done on climate change at those offices over the last eight years would grind to a halt under Trump.Meanwhile, the landmark climate agreement reached in Paris last year was just formally ratified ― and while some hope that enacting the deal early will make it “Trump-proof,” there’s still a lot he could do to muck it up if he slows down domestic action. The GOP nominee has said he would look at “renegotiating” the deal, “or something else.”Perhaps Trump will be asked during Sunday’s debate to elaborate on his views regarding climate change. Most likely, though, if climate change gets billing in the debate, it will be in the form of a one-off question simply asking the candidates whether it’s “real,” rather than an opportunity to propose a detailed policy discussion. It’s unlikely that they would get into the very real consequences we’d see on this issue by electing Trump.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

86,POLITICS,Tim Kaine: Donald Trump's Comments Indicate 'A Pattern Of Sexual Assault',Ryan J.

Reilly - Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c1228202600005e0484ece5.jpeg?ops=100_100,"ST. LOUIS ― Donald Trump’s lewd comments about getting away with groping women because he’s famous reveal “a pattern of sexual assault,” Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said Sunday.In an uncensored 2005 video, Trump, speaking of going after several unnamed women, bragged that “when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab them by the pussy.”“It’s not just words,” Kaine said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday morning. Kaine, speaking the day of the second presidential debate, added that it was up Trump to “take responsibility” for his actions. Kaine said Trump’s 2005 comments raised a lot of questions about his behavior. “If you take that tape as Donald as accurately describing his actions, then yeah, it is a pattern of assaultive behavior,” Kaine said.Kaine said it was likely to come up at the debate in St. Louis on Sunday evening.“I can’t imagine that undecided voters that are part of this town hall will not want to hear him explain why he thought that was acceptable behavior,” Kaine said. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared on a number of television shows on Trump’s behalf on Sunday, where he tried to defend Trump by saying the nominee’s comments about getting away with committing sexual assault on women could have been all talk.“Talk and actions are two different things,” Giuliani said in an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press.” “I don’t know how much he was exaggerating; I don’t know how much is true.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I love accessories. I have a distinctive eye for style.But, I’ve never posted my “OOTD” (”outfit of the day”) on Instagram. I rarely go shopping. I almost never wear heels anymore.So when people call me a ‘fashionista,’ it feels strangely disconnected from my identity.From working in corporate retail for so long, I consider myself a MERCHANT.“A merchant is a businessperson who trades in commodities produced by other people in order to earn a profit.”Being a merchant is the ultimate cool job for a person who loves product design and business. It’s a wonderful marriage of being a creative at heart, and having a knack for numbers and patterns. Depending on the company, the merchant is responsible for the entire lifecycle of all the items in their department. Walk into a bedding section of a store, one person is in charge of making sure you see the most beautiful items, at the best price.Right out of college, I was hired as an assistant merchant at Abercrombie and Fitch. I was taught in their training program that a merchant was like the center of a wheel. All the spokes of the wheel went to the support team functions including planners, allocators, designers, the distribution center... honestly the list was shockingly long. I was told I needed to keep the wheel rolling by constantly communicating with these teams. To develop and sell product, I was the point person. I was 22 and in no position to be any kind of point person in my first job out of college. Luckily, I had a great support team who made sure I didn’t screw it all up.I quickly learned how FUN being a merchant was. How come no one taught me about this job at the school career fairs? And how come, when I told people in the outside world I was a merchant, that they immediately asked “Which store are you at?”Does no one know about this enviable role in the world of retail? When I’m in a store and hear a person say “That’s expensive!” I cringe. My mind races to: “Did you know that fabric had to get made at a mill with cotton that was picked from a field? Then, it was sent to a factory to get cut, sewn, knit, printed. Next it was sent on a boat, train, plane, truck from said factory to a distribution center, and finally, the store. That doesn’t even account for the person who designed it, made sure there was money to buy it, and developed the product with the factory, or the person who made sure it cleared customs, packed it to go out and put it on this shelf?” I lose my breath thinking about how much time, effort and materials go into getting that product to the shelf.If you enjoy business television, a great example of a brilliant merchant is Marcus Lemonis on The Profit. He goes into product based businesses, whether it’s a t-shirt company or a ice cream shop, and invests his smarts and money. He brings down the cost of items, increasing the margins, cleans up process of creation to customer, and overhauls the visual appeal of any space he works on. He’s helping the business run better, getting the wheel to roll better and faster. If you’re a fellow merchant, congrats! If you’re a consumer, next time you purchase products, consider appreciating how much work it took to get that product to you. I bet you’ll enjoy it even more!You can now find Emily teaching others how to follow their creative visions at Stylish and Successful."

She’s right. It’s a good bill — especially for the hotel industry.The proposed law requires third-party booking sites to prominently notify users that they aren’t associated with a hotel’s website before charging their credit cards. A House version of the same bill was introduced earlier this year.Related: Frequently asked questions about hotels.Third-party booking sites often provide legitimate reservation services, and selling a hotel stay through one is not against the law, but hotels don’t like it because they lose money on reservations that aren’t made directly through the hotel. Complicating the issue, some third-party booking sites intentionally mimic hotel websites to charge prices higher than those charged by the actual hotel. And a small percentage of third-party booking sites have committed flat-out fraud, posing as hotels to sell consumers nonexistent reservations. Hotels claim that these practices affect some 15 million hotel bookings a year, creating $1.3 billion worth of what AHLA terms “bad” bookings — involving some flaw, as a result of which hotel guests are dissatisfied or inconvenienced.Just one small problem: I haven’t received any recent complaints about fraudulent third-party bookings, and neither have any other advocates I know. But it’s no secret that hotels want to capture more market share through direct bookings.Recent surveys by the social polling company Winq suggest that consumers worry about an entirely different set of issues — ones that the hotel industry seems to be uninterested in addressing legislatively. For example, almost 7 in 10 people surveyed said they believe that hotel resort fees should be illegal.Even Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy organization based in Santa Monica, Calif., and one of the only consumer groups to support the Stop Online Booking Scams Act, says other issues are more important to hotel guests.“I’d like to see something that does away with these outrageous resort fees,” says John Simpson, the group’s privacy project director. “For consumers, that’s a much more important issue.”Mandatory resort fees, which normally cover amenities that were previously included in the prices of hotel rooms, such as the use of an exercise facility or business center, have been a long-standing irritant for hotel guests. The average resort fee is $19.66 per night, up about 8 percent from the beginning of the year, according to the website Resortfeechecker.com. Since the beginning of 2016, the number of hotels charging a mandatory fee of $30 or more has ballooned from 142 properties to 172.The Truth in Hotel Advertising Act of 2016, introduced earlier this year by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), would prohibit hotels from advertising room rates that don’t include all mandatory fees. The bill also gives the Federal Trade Commission the authority to enforce the prohibition, and state attorneys general the power to bring a civil action in federal court against violators. But faced with the opposition of powerful lodging industry interests that benefit from charging these fees, the fate of that legislation remains uncertain.Of course, the issue of price disclosure is not limited to the hotel industry. In the airline industry, for example, legislators are pushing for clearer disclosure of all taxes, fees and extras. Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently asked the administration to clarify existing regulations and compel airlines to make the comparison process easier. Some airlines, they note, appear to be “taking steps to restrict consumer access” to fare and schedule information.Travelers who shop online for hotels face similar obstacles and routinely complain about prices that aren’t fully disclosed until the final booking screen. There is no legislative effort underway to force transparency on the hotel industry, although guests would certainly benefit from it.Winq surveys also indicate that 89 percent of users want the hotel industry to have a 24-hour refund rule, similar to the one that the Transportation Department mandated for airlines. Andy Abramson, a frequent traveler who runs a communication company in Los Angeles, thinks too many hotel guests find themselves trapped in “reservations jail” after booking a cheap rate online, only to learn that it’s nonrefundable. “When they cancel, the hotel gets to keep their money,” he says.Abramson and other travelers who have contacted me to complain about this issue say the system could be fairer, offering an immediate refund within 24 hours of a reservation, a partial refund after that and a full refund if the room is resold. There’s no planned legislation on lodging-reservation refunds, but I receive plenty of complaints about refund policies that favor the hotel.Bills that would kill resort fees, force properties to disclose all their fees upfront or offer no-questions-asked refunds within 24 hours of making a reservation are unlikely to sail through Congress, as they would cost the hotel industry real money. And so we have the Stop Online Booking Scams Act.Maietta, the AHLA spokeswoman, says the law will do more good than I’m giving it credit for. “It would stop the consumer guessing game of if a hotel site is legitimate,” she says.If the bill passes, it will be a necessary first step in cleaning up the online hotel-reservation business . But there’s more work to be done — much more.After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google. I also have a newsletter and you'll definitely want to order my new, amazingly helpful and subversive book called How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle)."

But not so fast, dear Republican senators and congressmen. Trump may have verbalized his misogyny, sexism and abuse of women into an open microphone, but over the past decades you ― YOU ― have LEGALIZED it. He may talk of “grabbing” sexual organs, but YOU have created laws that legally grab control over women’s bodies. Trump may brag about his power over women; YOU, the Republican legislators (and your backers, the Christian Right and rich businessmen), have made sure women aren’t paid the same as men, don’t have paid maternity leave, or can’t get easy access to birth control.Trump has been called “disgusting” for his remarks. But you, by actually blocking women’s equal rights, you’ve been rewarded for your misogyny with re-election, campaign cash and future lobbying jobs. You think by disowning Trump now that we, the people, are going be grateful to you. But we know that Trump is only the natural result of a Republican culture that has viciously fought the women’s agenda for years. Trump hasn’t destroyed your party; he’s your end game, the grim reaper from the seeds you have sown, showing up now to preside over your demise. Defeating Trump, or pushing him to drop out, is NOT what will make this right for the majority of us Americans. Like any good doctor, we need to remove the cancer from its source, and that source is you.Don’t try to make Mike Pence out to be some sane, better alternative. This guy was behind the legislation to require women who have an abortion to conduct an actual funeral for the fetus! The rest of you have tried to kill Planned Parenthood and many other things that make life a bit easier for women.Trump bragged to Billy Bush about his “grabbing pussy.” But those of you who are the elected officials, who have spent this weekend decrying Trump with your crocodile wails of “shame” and trying to distance yourselves from him, YOU are the ones who’ve been “grabbing” women the legal way by passing laws that, in effect, assault them. It is an assault to pay women less. It is an assault to block day care for all. It is an assault ― a form of apartheid ― when only 20 percent of Congress is women, the majority gender.As far as I’m concerned, there are 54 Trumps in the U.S. Senate and 237 Trumps in the House. You can’t make this look good by removing your endorsement from Trump. Yes, Trump has to go ― but so do you, all of you. Starting with the election on November 8, we need to show up at the polls and remove as many of you as possible. This abuse of women stops now. I believe that most women and many men are going to determine their vote with this one thought, thanks to you and Trump:“YOU’RE EITHER WITH WOMEN, OR YOU’RE AGAINST THEM.” And if you’re against women, you’re over. There’s a fourth wave of feminism afoot now ― and you are going to be its first casualties.Or, as I prefer to see it, its first victory.Thank you for letting the American public see your true (orange) face. I’m glad you “grabbed” our attention and mobIlized the masses against you. The only thing sweeter than seeing the lot of you gone would be a 50-state sweep for Hillary.GOP, RIP."
