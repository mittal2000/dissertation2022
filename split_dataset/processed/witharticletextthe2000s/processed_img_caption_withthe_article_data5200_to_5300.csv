Kim was seated between United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres and International Olympic Committee Chairman Thomas Bach, so the apparent snub likely created a bit of tension. Reuters reported that Pence had planned to stay at the reception briefly because of his appointment with the Americans."
1,LATINO VOICES,Junot Díaz: The African Diaspora 'Doesn’t Look The Way It Looks Without Systematic Rape',Carolina Moreno,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/junot-diazafrican-diaspora-systematic-rape_us_5a7dbbefe4b08dfc9303693f,The author discussed white supremacy and privilege at the University of Missouri.,2018-02-09,"Pulitzer Prize writer Junot Diaz photographed at his MIT office on September 12, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7dd33f2000003900eae6bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Junot Díaz recently gave students at the University of Missouri a lesson on the history of sexual violence.The Pulitzer Prize-winning author, the featured speaker at an MU celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. on Jan. 22, shared his thoughts on white supremacy, privilege and immigration. KBIA, the National Public Radio member station in Columbia, Missouri, posted excerpts from his speech on Tuesday. After opening his talk with a reading of his award-winning novel The Wondrous life of Oscar Wao, the Dominican-born novelist spoke about slavery and the sexual violence that led to the mixing of races.“My work, among many of the things that it wrestles with, wrestles with the kind of, the often invisible and vigorously disavowed, long shadow of enslavement,” Díaz said. “I’m very much interested in how people like me, who are part of the African Diasporic community, and how do we deal with the consequences of the fallout from the calamity that we call slavery.”He continued: “And most specifically, I’m kind of interested in how do bodies like mine that were raped into existence – our community doesn’t look the way it looks without systematic rape – and so how do communities like ours, with this long history of sexual violence and sexual predation, how do we as a consequence of that wrestle with the possibility of intimacy? In other words, where does love reside in bodies that spent centuries being told that they could not partake in love?”Dominican artist Zahira Kelly-Cabrera shared a similar perspective with HuffPost last month in a conversation about how sexual harassment and sexual assault manifests differently for women of color. “The Dominican Republic is where some of the early slave ships arrived in the Americas; it was the place of some of the early indigenous massacres,” Kelly-Cabrera said. “Colonists thought, ‘You’re wearing a little bit less than the women where we’re from, so you deserve to be sexually assaulted.’ And that’s applied to both native and African women.”“That’s how we ended up mixed; it wasn’t some beautiful white and native love stuff,” Kelly-Cabrera said. “It was not ‘Pocahontas.’ It was mass rape toward native women and toward the African-enslaved women that they brought to Latin America and everywhere.” H/T Remezcla"
2,SPORTS,South Korea's Olympic Stadium Will Host Just 4 Events Before It's Torn Down,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/olympic-stadium-pyeongchang_us_5a7cba85e4b08dfc9301c8a7,That's funny because the Pyeongchang Games were meant to be the financially prudent ones.,2018-02-09,"The Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, seen at dawn on Jan. 25, 2018, is the epitome of planned obsolescence.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7cbb3b2100003900600abf.jpeg?ops=crop_45_387_3813_2203%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Pyeongchang, South Korea, built itself a brand-new $109 million stadium to host the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. And after just four ceremonial events ― including Friday’s opening festivities ― Pyeongchang is planning to tear the place down.Ironically, the idea behind tearing down the stadium is to keep it from becoming an immediate white elephant and ever-present reminder of Olympic excess.The Pyeongchang Games were supposed to be an example of modesty, a reminder that the Olympics didn’t have to burden its host with the record-breaking $50 billion price tag that accompanied the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia ― and that helped turn much of the world against the idea of hosting the games.But building a stadium solely to host four ceremonies ― none of which involve actual sports ― feels more like an example of how Pyeongchang fell right into the Olympic trap.This year’s Winter Olympics will cost an estimated $13 billion ― far short of Sochi’s cost, but still roughly twice what Olympic organizers originally estimated. That maintains an ugly streak for the games: Between 1960 and 2012, every Olympics, winter and summer, has exceeded its initial budget projections, according to researchers at the University of Oxford. The median overrun for the Winter Games, the researchers found, was 109 percent, which means Pyeongchang’s doubling of costs is right in line with budget reality.Pyeongchang has already warned the South Korean government that the final cost of the games will be too high. Last year, it threatened to slash its own contribution to the Olympic budget.Those costs rose, as they always do, thanks to largely unnecessary construction projects with little promise of future viability. Organizers built a brand-new ski resort for the Pyeongchang Games, for instance, even though its construction required the partial demolition of a sacred indigenous forest, even though the games have required shuttering other ski resorts, even though there’s little evidence the new site will be used once the Olympics end.Other Pyeongchang venues share similar legacy concerns. Five months ahead of the games, organizers had no plans at all for post-Olympic use of at least three other newly constructed facilities. On the eve of the games, they still don’t have concrete proposals for the future.The public justification for hosting these games, in Pyeongchang and across South Korea, is that the first Winter Olympics to grace the Korean Peninsula won’t just improve relations between the North and South but will also boost interest in winter sports and help transform the area “into an Asian winter sports hub.” But who can really predict the first, and the latter seems unlikely.South Koreans don’t much care for winter sports. In one survey last year, just 35 percent of them reported having any interest in the Olympics, and domestic ticket sales, even for the most popular events, have lagged well behind the normal Olympic pace.Previous Olympics suggest that the games’ ability to boost participation in sports is nearly as big a myth as their supposed economic and tourism benefits. Organizers of the 2012 London Games really pushed the “sparking public enthusiasm for athletics” goal. Surveys in the six years since have shown that participation in various sports has remained at best steady across the city, while a Parliamentary report last year found that rates of physical activity and sporting participation among children have actually declined since the end of the games.Concerns about cost and legacy have largely taken a backseat ahead of the Pyeongchang Games for a variety of reasons. The focus on Russia’s doping scandal has sucked up most of the pre-Olympic oxygen. A norovirus outbreak on the eve of the games and the unavoidable security concerns caused by Pyeongchang’s proximity to the North Korean border have absorbed much of the rest. What diplomatic role the 2018 Winter Olympics will play, now and in the future, on the peninsula and in the world seems to be the biggest potential story of the games.To Pyeongchang’s credit, the city seems ready and the venues complete. There haven’t been any of the major hiccups that typically drive hysteria in the run-up to the Olympics. Indeed, these games feel comparably flawless next to the worries over excessive costs, threats to LGBTQ rights and environmental destruction that surrounded the 2014 Sochi Games; the demolition of poor neighborhoods, the collapsing economy and the lax preparations ahead of Rio de Janeiro’s 2016 Summer Olympics; or the already exorbitant cost increases and environmental problems plaguing Tokyo’s upcoming 2020 Summer Games.All the normal Olympic features are still present in Pyeongchang: the bloated budget, the environmental degradation, the empty infrastructure legacy. A costly new stadium that will open only four times before it’s ultimately destroyed.But excess and destruction have become such hallmarks of the Olympics, these hardly feel like problems anymore."
3,POLITICS,Motorcycle Lane-Splitting: Safe Or Scary?,"Stateline, Editorial Partner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/motorcycle-lane-splitting-safe-or-scary_us_5a7db7efe4b033149e401ce1,"At least 15 states in the past five years have considered legalizing lane-splitting for motorcyclists, but only California has enacted legislation to do so.",2018-02-09,"<p>A motorcyclist splits a lane on Highway 99 in Sacramento, California. Other states could follow California in legalizing lane-splitting.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7db8391e0000d0007ab3c5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jenni BergalEvery morning, commuter Surj Gish hit a major traffic jam as he crossed the Bay Bridge from his Oakland home to his San Francisco job.Sedans and SUVs clogged five lanes of traffic and idled for miles on a trip that could take them an hour or longer. But for Gish it was no problem: He just zipped his motorcycle between lanes, moving past slow-moving vehicles stuck on the bridge.“My trip usually would only take 30 minutes,” said Gish, a digital marketing consultant who now commutes to other parts of the Bay Area. “It radically changed my daily commute.”That maneuver is called lane-splitting, and only California allows it. But a move is afoot to expand lane-splitting to other states, pitting motorcyclists against some law enforcement agencies and safety advocates. Both sides say their approach is safest — for drivers and motorcyclists alike.Supporters of lane-splitting say letting motorcyclists legally share or split lanes with cars and trucks reduces congestion and is safer for bikers, who can avoid being rear-ended by distracted drivers in stop-and-go traffic. Opponents say it’s dangerous for bikers who might be struck by cars that suddenly change lanes, and unnerving for drivers who might be startled by a motorcycle whizzing past them.Over the past five years, legislators have unsuccessfully pushed bills to legalize lane-splitting in at least 15 states, according to AAA. California made it legal in 2016, though it had been common practice there for many years as there was no law prohibiting it.Some measures were pushed by a legislator on behalf of a constituent or motorcyclist groups and didn’t get any traction. Some died because of opposition from AAA clubs or law enforcement agencies or concerns about safety.Many of the measures would have required that lane-splitters travel below a certain speed and not go much faster than the cars around them.Arizona legislators in 2010 passed a bill that would have allowed a one-year lane-splitting pilot program, but it was vetoed by then-Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican. She cited concerns about its impact on safety and whether motorists would have enough time to be educated properly about the changes.This year at least seven states, from Arizona to Massachusetts, are considering lane-splitting bills.In Washington state, the Senate last year passed a bill to legalize lane-splitting at low speeds, but it stalled in the House after the Washington State Patrol and the state Traffic Safety Commission argued the practice is unsafe and would not help reduce motorcycle fatalities or serious injuries.The bill’s sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Tim Sheldon, a tree farmer who is not a motorcyclist, dismissed those fears as overblown and said some of the opposition comes from motorists annoyed that bikers would be getting special treatment.“There is a little bit of envy,” he said. In traffic, “drivers think, ‘Why should someone be moving when I’m not?’ ”Sheldon said he’s not going to push the bill this session, which ends next month, but he plans to reintroduce it next year.“We have such a congestion problem in the Puget Sound,” Sheldon said. “It’s a way to help us with that.”While there isn’t a lot of data on the safety of lane-splitting, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the practice is common in many other countries and worthy of further study “because it offers a means of reducing congestion in addition to possible safety benefits.”The agency calls lane-splitting an option that “can provide an escape route for motorcyclists who would otherwise be trapped or struck from behind.” A 2015 study by the University of California Berkeley found lane-splitting appeared to be a “relatively safe” strategy if it’s done in traffic moving at 50 mph or less and motorcyclists don’t exceed other vehicles’ speed by more than 15 mph.The Berkeley study also concluded that lane-splitting motorcyclists were less likely to suffer head or torso injuries or die in a crash than those who didn’t split.The American Motorcyclist Association, an advocacy group that represents more than 200,000 motorcyclists nationwide, supports lane-splitting and is working to make it legal in other states.“It is very safe as long as you are keeping your speed reasonable compared to the surrounding traffic,” said Nick Haris, a lobbyist for the group. “And it reduces traffic commute times for the rider and other drivers.”Haris said he understands that drivers might be startled if a motorcycle suddenly appears beside them, which is why it’s important for any state that legalizes the practice to issue guidelines for motorcyclists and offer public awareness campaigns for motorists.Gish, the Oakland motorcyclist, agrees with Haris about public education, but he doesn’t buy the argument about drivers being rattled.“If the rider comes up really fast, then it’s the fault of the rider. But if they’re only going 10 miles an hour faster than traffic, then it’s the driver’s fault for not turning their head and looking,” said Gish, who runs a regional magazine for motorcyclists and a lane-splitting advocacy website. “Lack of awareness of the surrounding environment is just bad driving.”AAA opposes lane-splitting, and its clubs have helped defeat proposals in Georgia, Hawaii and Texas, said Richard Romer, the group’s state relations manager. “Motorists who don’t expect to be passed by a vehicle traveling between lanes can side-swipe a motorcycle or turn into its path.”The Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway offices, doesn’t take a position on lane-splitting. But Richard Retting, a traffic safety consultant to the group, called it “a very risky activity.”Retting said he was shocked to learn of the Berkeley study’s finding that, between June 2012 and August 2013, of the motorcyclists involved in nearly 6,000 collisions in California, 17 percent had been lane-splitting.“There’s no compelling reason to allow it other than the most remote escape-route benefit for the motorcyclist,” said Retting, a former motorcyclist.

But they have an alleged harasser in their midst who is trying to quietly slip by: Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas).Farenthold spent $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit by a former female aide three years ago. Details of this settlement weren’t public until early December 2017, at which point the congressman said he would retire at the end of 2018 and would immediately repay the money to the Treasury Department. He never sent the check.By late January, his office said he was “waiting to see what changes the House makes to the Congressional Accountability Act before repaying the funds.” On Tuesday, the House passed a bill to strengthen that law, which provides workplace protections in Capitol Hill offices. But now his office says he’s waiting to see if the Senate passes the bill, if the president signs it, and if this theoretical new law will inspire him to pay up.“He is waiting on the advice of counsel to see what final bill is enacted,” Bob Haueter, Farenthold’s chief of staff, told HuffPost on Wednesday. “Once the final bill is done and the law is changed and is complete and he can see that, he will make a determination of how he proceeds.”By all appearances, this is a case of a GOP congressman ridiculously moving the goalposts to avoid paying back tens of thousands of dollars before he leaves at the end of the year. The House bill has no bearing on Farenthold’s situation ― it is not retroactive ― and there is nothing to prevent him from cutting a check today.He’s not hard up for money, either. The guy is worth millions of dollars. HuffPost asked if Farenthold would repay the $84,000 after he leaves office, in the event the president does not sign a law this year relating to Congress’ sexual harassment policies.“I guess we’ll have to look at that, how it occurs,” said Haueter. “At this point in time, right now, he’s expecting Congress to act.”It’s a wonder that Farenthold is still in Congress at all. Several of his colleagues have recently resigned in disgrace amid allegations of sexual misconduct. At a time when the #MeToo movement is driving powerful, high-profile sexual harassers out of their jobs, it’s hard to imagine someone in the private sector not being punished for the kind of behavior Farenthold has been accused of.His former spokeswoman Lauren Greene said in legal documents that Farenthold told another aide that Greene could “show her nipples whenever she wanted to” and that he had “sexual fantasies” and “wet dreams” about her. She describes the congressman as often being drunk and flirtatious at work, complaining of a sexless marriage and telling her a story about a female lobbyist propositioning him for “a threesome.”Two other Farenthold aides complained in 2016 of a toxic work environment. One described staffers talking about male lobbyists sending them pictures of their genitals and other staffers making lewd comments “about female reporters’ breast size.”“I’ve done nothing wrong,” Farenthold has said. He points to a 2015 finding by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics that there was “not substantial reason” to believe he had violated House rules. But the House Ethics Committee disagreed and began its own investigation in September 2015. The committee has been looking into his behavior ever since, beset by delays because key witnesses wouldn’t come forward.That changed in December 2017, when Greene agreed to cooperate. The ethics committee announced a new investigative subcommittee to look into whether Farenthold sexually harassed other members of his staff, used official money for campaign purposes, and lied or omitted details in previous testimony to the committee. It’s not clear how long this investigation will take or whether it will be done before Farenthold retires.In the meantime, Republican leaders appear fine with Farenthold keeping his job ― and his taxpayer-funded salary ― for the rest of the year. That leaves GOP lawmakers in the awkward position of having to defend Farenthold through the midterm elections. It’s already creating problems for his colleagues trying to tout their newfound zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.“Today is a great day for America,” Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) beamed at a Tuesday press event after the House passed his bill to require lawmakers to personally pay for any sexual harassment settlements. “This is the greatest place I believe that anybody could ever work, whether you’re a member or a staffer. ... We want to ensure that that protection is here for everybody.”Nearly all of the reporters’ questions were about Farenthold.“The legislation that we passed, unfortunately, is not retroactive,” Harper said. “It’s up to each individual member that might have been in that situation to determine whether they will or won’t [repay the government].”Asked if it sat right with him that a Republican colleague hadn’t paid back sexual harassment settlement money, Harper said only, “He said he was going to pay it back. When will he do that? I don’t know.”Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a leading voice in the push to crack down on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill, said part of the reason that Farenthold is seemingly getting away with bad behavior is that the House Ethics Committee needs to be reformed, too.“It’s not a place where you send difficult, thorny member issues,” she said.But another problem is that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn’t demanded that Farenthold repay the $84,000 immediately or compelled him to resign.“They have the ability to force it,” Speier said of GOP leadership. “Blake Farenthold has to be, I think, cajoled, embarrassed, pressured by all of us to pay the money back. We had a situation on the Democratic side, we pressured members to resign, and they did.”Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the speaker has pressed Farenthold to repay the money. “Rep. Farenthold told the speaker he would be paying the settlement back, and we have since repeatedly stated he should pay it back,” Strong said.Chalk it up to Ryan not being firm enough with a member of his caucus or to Farenthold simply not caring. Whatever the reason for the inaction, some lawmakers say Farenthold’s behavior is eroding the dignity of the House itself.“It undermines the integrity of our institution,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). “Why should taxpayers be paying for anyone’s sexual misconduct? He said he would repay it at the end of the week in December? That’s a hell of a long week.”"

That leaves GOP lawmakers in the awkward position of having to defend Farenthold through the midterm elections. It’s already creating problems for his colleagues trying to tout their newfound zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment on Capitol Hill.“Today is a great day for America,” Rep. Gregg Harper (R-Miss.) beamed at a Tuesday press event after the House passed his bill to require lawmakers to personally pay for any sexual harassment settlements. “This is the greatest place I believe that anybody could ever work, whether you’re a member or a staffer. ... We want to ensure that that protection is here for everybody.”Nearly all of the reporters’ questions were about Farenthold.“The legislation that we passed, unfortunately, is not retroactive,” Harper said. “It’s up to each individual member that might have been in that situation to determine whether they will or won’t [repay the government].”Asked if it sat right with him that a Republican colleague hadn’t paid back sexual harassment settlement money, Harper said only, “He said he was going to pay it back. When will he do that? I don’t know.”Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), a leading voice in the push to crack down on sexual harassment on Capitol Hill, said part of the reason that Farenthold is seemingly getting away with bad behavior is that the House Ethics Committee needs to be reformed, too.“It’s not a place where you send difficult, thorny member issues,” she said.But another problem is that House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) hasn’t demanded that Farenthold repay the $84,000 immediately or compelled him to resign.“They have the ability to force it,” Speier said of GOP leadership. “Blake Farenthold has to be, I think, cajoled, embarrassed, pressured by all of us to pay the money back. We had a situation on the Democratic side, we pressured members to resign, and they did.”Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said the speaker has pressed Farenthold to repay the money. “Rep. Farenthold told the speaker he would be paying the settlement back, and we have since repeatedly stated he should pay it back,” Strong said.Chalk it up to Ryan not being firm enough with a member of his caucus or to Farenthold simply not caring. Whatever the reason for the inaction, some lawmakers say Farenthold’s behavior is eroding the dignity of the House itself.“It undermines the integrity of our institution,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). “Why should taxpayers be paying for anyone’s sexual misconduct? He said he would repay it at the end of the week in December? That’s a hell of a long week.”"

Starting April 4, passengers will be able to hop on board a train at London’s St. Pancras International and reach Amsterdam’s Centraal station in just three hours and 41 minutes, while traveling at a speed of about 186 mph. The trains between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands will depart London twice a day, at 8:31 a.m. and 5:31 p.m. They will run nonstop to Brussels, Belgium, in one hour and 48 minutes, shaving 17 minutes off the Eurostar’s current travel time between these two cities. The route will also include a stop in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. One-way fares between the U.K. and the Netherlands along this route will start at about £35 ($48). Tickets will go on sale Feb. 20. Eurostar expects the train route to spark competition with airlines like easyJet and Ryanair, which offer cheap flights between London and Amsterdam. The company said over 4 million passengers use airlines to travel between London and Amsterdam every year. The market was reportedly about the same size when Eurostar launched its route between London and Paris in 1994. “Over the last twenty-three years, the market for travel between London and Paris has more than doubled as customers increasingly choose high speed rail over plane,” the company said in a statement. “As the Netherlands grows in popularity as a key business and tourism hub, the potential for the new service and the overall market is significant.”But there’s one hitch in the company’s current plans: The trip from London to Amsterdam will be direct, but passengers traveling in the opposite direction will have to change trains in Brussels to go through passport and security screening. This is due to continuing negotiations between the U.K. and the Netherlands on enabling passport checks to be conducted in the Netherlands before departure.Eurostar expects an agreement will be in place by the end of 2019 that would allow passengers to travel direct both ways.

I met someone that her life meant more to me than my life. I’ve never had that experience before.”Clooney met the international human rights lawyer when a mutual friend brought her over to the Oscar winner’s Lake Como home in 2013.“I thought she was beautiful, and I thought she was funny and obviously smart,” Clooney, 56, told The Hollywood Reporter, joking that Amal, 40, “probably thought I was old.”They married the next year. In June, the couple welcomed twins, Ella and Alexander.Clooney told The Hollywood Reporter that having kids had “never been part of my DNA.” In fact, he said they never discussed having children while dating.“We didn’t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn’t want them,” he said. “And then, after the wedding, Amal and I were talking and we just felt we’d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we’ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.”"
12,POLITICS,Racist Bullying? Religious School In Texas Argues Courts Can't Intervene.,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-religious-school-racist-bullying_us_5a7391aae4b01ce33eb12c6c,A religious school is being sued after it punished alleged racist harassers with one-day suspensions.,2018-02-09,"A photo of ""KKK origami"" allegedly given to a black student at a Texas school.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7ccb961e0000dc007ab288.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A teenage student and his family have sued a religious private school in Texas after the teen allegedly experienced bullying of a racist nature. The student claims the school did next to nothing to stop the bullying. But the school says its religious doctrine makes it immune from legal repercussions. Legal experts told HuffPost the school’s argument is highly unusual in this context.The school’s counsel filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on these grounds in August. A judge is expected to decide whether to move forward with the lawsuit later this month, per public documents obtained by HuffPost.Maureen Beans and her son, C.R., had a horrible experience at Trinity Episcopal School in Galveston, Texas, according to the lawsuit filed in May.C.R., who attended Trinity for sixth and seventh grade, starting in 2014, was a black student at the overwhelmingly white private school. He claims he was relentlessly bullied, sometimes in ways that appeared racially motivated.In one incident, his three tormentors allegedly gave him pieces of origami designed to resemble hoods worn by Ku Klux Klan members.Throughout this time, school administrators ignored the problem, even after C.R.’s family brought it to their attention, the lawsuit says. Even though the students admitted to the bullying, according to the lawsuit, they were only given one-day suspensions and required to apologize ― consequences the plaintiff deems sorely lacking.Days after the school doled out the punishment, Beans decided to pull her son from Trinity and enroll him elsewhere.Now, in a move that’s raised eyebrows among lawyers and legal experts, the school is trying to get the lawsuit dismissed by invoking the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine.This legal principle, also called the church autonomy doctrine, holds that religious institutions do not need to follow the same laws as non-religious entities, like public schools, if it conflicts with their religious doctrine.It applies in cases where a decision from a civil judge would infringe on the internal religious organization of a group, like how a religious organization can choose to have only male or female clergy members perform specific tasks.Trinity says it disputes the assertions made in the Beans’ lawsuit. But it is also essentially arguing that because it is a religious organization, it is allowed to maintain its own discipline system, which may or may not involve consequences for racist bullying.Experts told HuffPost they are surprised a religious institution would make this argument with regard to racist bullying. Some say this is a step too far.Robert Tuttle, professor of law and religion at George Washington University, said if the law were applied this way, courts would not have been able to intervene, for example, in cases where sexual abuse was reported at Catholic churches.“There is very little reason to think that religious institutions should be immune from the state to the degree that they claim,” Tuttle said. But Trinity Episcopal School is attempting to claim that immunity. “As a religious institution, Trinity has a constitutionally-protected freedom to make decisions regarding the discipline of its students without judicial interference,” the court document states in the school’s motion to dismiss. “The courts cannot second guess those decisions, even in the guise of purportedly ‘secular’ causes of action.”Lawyers for C.R. and his family reject the school’s argument. The family is suing the school and its former head for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, saying the school failed to protect C.R. The parents of the three alleged bullies are also defendants in the suit.The bullying had a deep, scarring effect on the teen, the lawsuit says. C.R. was so traumatized by the alleged bullying that at one point he spray-painted the word “hate” on the walls of his home.C.R.’s grades dropped precipitously. He experienced depression and anxiety, and was unable to attend the four subsequent educational institutions in which he has been enrolled.“This is a simple negligence case ― whenever you send your kid to a school you expect a certain standard of care,” Sounia Senemar, the family’s lawyer, told HuffPost. “They allowed this kid to be bullied, and they are trying to use religion as a shield.”When asked to comment for this story, lawyers for Trinity said in a statement that the school is “committed to upholding standards that reflect our mission in Christ.”“The school has a policy that prohibits any form of bullying or discrimination,” the statement read. “As soon as the school was informed of an issue over a year ago, it addressed it immediately, consistent with its policy.”Multiple experts told HuffPost that Trinity’s tactic will almost certainly not succeed.“The defendant here certainly qualifies as a religious school,” said University of Missouri School of Law Professor Carl Esbeck. “That’s not the problem.”School bullying, however, is “not a matter of internal ecclesiastical governance,” he added. “They argue that it is, but it’s not. And it’s not even close.” Attorneys say they will be closely watching the outcome of this case.“If other religious schools see that this school here was successful in avoiding liability under this legal theory, then they are going to be more likely to invoke it if they face similar lawsuits in the future,” said Alison Tanner, legal fellow for the nonprofit group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

He was wrong. Around noon on Thursday, the trade deadline quickly ramped up into hyper-speed, when Woj himself sent out another bomb stating that the Cleveland Cavaliers were trading away Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and a protected 2018 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. From there, it only got more obscene. To try and process the head-spinning ridiculousness of it all, we decided to just open a group chat and process everything together. For transparency’s sake, Travis is a Washington Wizards fan, Ja’han is a Phoenix Suns fan and Maxwell is a Lakers fan. [1:30 PM]Maxwell Strachan: OK, it’s 1:30 p.m. and the Cleveland Cavaliers have just blown up the NBA.Travis Waldron: I still don’t know what to make of it, other than the NBA is magic. This was supposed to be a slow day!Maxwell Strachan: The memes have begun.Travis Waldron: Only in the NBA ― and only in LeBron World, really ― could we get a game as a dramatic as that Cavs-TimberPups thriller last night ... only to see an entire new Cavs roster tomorrow night.Maxwell Strachan: Travis Waldron: I think the Cavs are better now.Ja’han Jones: I’ve always loved how, despite the animus folks feel toward ‘Bron, none of us can deny the league revolves around him. He’s literally changing folks’ career trajectory with subtweets and dirty looks.Maxwell Strachan: Is it selfish that I want the Cavs to trade everyone else too?Trade the Nets pick for DeAndre and Love for Kemba, just do it.Travis Waldron: Tristan and the Brooklyn pic for DeAndre. Love for ... someone with two hands. Keep J.R., because J.R.Maxwell Strachan: Exactly. I’m loving this Woj tweet from 11 hours ago: Travis Waldron: Tristan and the Brooklyn pick is too much to give for DeAndre, but you get the point.Maxwell Strachan: Doesn’t matter. Lean in to the insanity ― this is the NBA.Travis Waldron: I think Maxwell and I are in agreement that, entertainment value aside, the Cavs are better positioned for the playoffs now. Ja’han?Ja’han Jones: I agree with that. Their previous roster was full of guys we knew but guys who were never *great* fits with their previous organizations.Maxwell Strachan: And they all hated each other!!! Thomas’ final moment with the Cavs was getting totally ignored by LeBron after a game-winner. It’s almost poetic. [1:35 PM]Ja’han Jones: I genuinely aspire toward Isaiah’s self-confidence and self-assuredness.Travis Waldron: They flipped a bunch of parts that weren’t working/didn’t get along/couldn’t trust Kevin Love for three dudes under 25 ... and they kept the Brooklyn pick (so far)! They still royally screwed up the Kyrie trade this summer, but this was about as good as you could do to get out of it. I think this roster is spicy: I’d start Hill > Clarkson, though.Maxwell Strachan: I love it for the Cavs. If LeBron leaves, they aren’t making the finals for another decade anyway, might as well go out in firing. Again, I’d throw out the Brooklyn pick and just give it one more go. They are going to have a decade’s worth of top-10 picks post-LeBron anyway.Travis Waldron: Hold on I have to check Twitter in case Woj is still bombing us.Maxwell Strachan: In 16 tweets, Woj broke the internet.Ja’han Jones: That man’s end-of-the-day unwinding routine has to be CRAZY.Maxwell Strachan: I would be scared to have that power.Travis Waldron: I’m going to regret saying this but my favorite part of this deadline is still that Ernie Grunfeld hasn’t traded a first-round pick for an aging role player who won’t still be in Washington this summer. Day is young, though.Maxwell Strachan: Just want to make sure this makes it into the post.And Travis, no one cares about the Wizards.Ja’han Jones: How do we think Isaiah fits in LA?Travis Waldron: That’s a good question.Maxwell Strachan: He’ll be fun! And if he sucks, LA will move on.[1:40 PM]Travis Waldron: It doesn’t matter this year. The question for me is where he ends up this summer. And I’m sorry but lots of people care about the Wizards. Me, John Wall, maybe Bradley Beal. That’s 2.5.Maxwell Strachan:  The most likely scenario is he sucks less than he did in Cleveland, then the Lakers move on in order to sign ... LEBRON JAMES.Maxwell Strachan: By the way, the Cavs just cleared the way for the Lakers to sign LeBron.Ja’han Jones: LeBron going to the Lakers is both a nightmare and a dream for me. Travis Waldron: This is all a ploy to keep LeBron from signing in LA. “Oh, you want to go to the Lakers. We’ll just give the Lakers the guy you hate the most.”Maxwell Strachan: Strong disagree! Lakers are playing chess. What would LeBron love more than to sign with the Lakers and screw up Thomas’ life once again?Travis Waldron: I like this move for the Lakers. Even LeBron potential aside.Ja’han Jones: I DESPISE the Lakers and wish them nothing but ill, non-injurious will. But the idea of that franchise hanging on the every word of a man they’ve spent a decade loathing brings me some happiness.Travis Waldron: But we have to get back to the central point, which is that LeBron James is quite possibly the most powerful man in the history of pro basketball. The Cavs just flipped their entire roster *with no guarantee that LeBron is going to stay.*Ja’han Jones: For real! Like, after Big O, I think ’Bron is the most influential player in league history when it comes to the business of the league and how players determine their own future.[1:45 PM]Travis Waldron: Right, Big O is up there. But LeBron has now engineered, what, three of the biggest off-the-court, landscape-shifting days in recent NBA history.Maxwell Strachan: It’s fine. They gotta go for it.Travis Waldron: The Decision, I’m Coming Home, and now this?Maxwell Strachan: And the Lakers now are set up to get Paul George and be able to keep Lonzo, Kuzma, Ingram and RandleTravis Waldron: Stop talking about the Lakers.Maxwell Strachan: Everyone will understand if he leaves. The Lakers are the NBA’s team! People hate [Cavaliers owners Dan] Gilbert enough that I think people won’t be mad if LeBron leaves. Or am I wrong?Travis Waldron: We’ve got LeBron James blowing up the entire league and you want to talk about Julius Randle. I went to Kentucky and I don’t even care that much about Julius Randle.Maxwell Strachan: A critical piece of the NBA puzzle! As an aside, Woj mini-alert ...Sorry, I meant Shams.Travis Waldron: Man.Maxwell Strachan: This is the darkest timeline.Ja’han Jones: Damn. What a fall from grace.Travis Waldron: You just disrespected Shams more than Derrick Rose has disrespected his career.Maxwell Strachan: Fun fact: Derrick Rose is the oldest 29-year-old in the world.Travis Waldron: Other than you.Ja’han Jones: That brother has lived three lifetimes, I swear.Maxwell Strachan: I am convinced Shams and Woj were born in the same petri dish.Travis Waldron: Are the Cavs the best team in the East now? I need a live feed on Kyrie.Maxwell Strachan: Let me look at that lineup againIt’s ... not bad?Travis Waldron: Again: I’d start Hill over Clarkson, but Clarkson gives you some late-game flexibility.Maxwell Strachan: You definitely start Hill.Travis Waldron: Nance actually wins the day here. Maxwell Strachan: Him and Jordan Clarkson are about to become famous.Ja’han Jones: I’ve never wavered in my belief that the Cavs are still better than Boston.[1:50 PM]Maxwell Strachan: They certainly will be better on defense with Nance in the mix. Oh my God. Alert.Ja’han Jones: Minnesota is close to home. Might be ... good? Iunno.Maxwell Strachan: Thibs-Rose reunion.Travis Waldron: Just what a young team on the cusp of breaking through needs: Derrick Rose. What could go wrong?Maxwell Strachan: Derrick Rose is about to play 40 minutes a game until he tears his ACL for the 14th time.Travis Waldron: Anyway: The Cavs are going back to the Finals.Maxwell Strachan: Now, yes, I see that. I just can’t believe in the Raptors. And the Celtics rookies are going to go weak in the playoffs.Travis Waldron: But I still don’t think this team is built to challenge Golden State or Houston unless something goes drastically wrong for one of those two.Maxwell Strachan: I love these little updates on deadline day.Travis Waldron: Bruno!Maxwell Strachan: No one is beating Golden State or Houston.Ja’han Jones: After seeing that photo of Demar Derozan with Lil Romeo on their youth team, I just can’t believe in any team he’s on. It’s not fair to him, but that’s where I am.Travis Waldron: [Our curmudgeonly manager] Tommy Craggs [1:52 PM]Maxwell Strachan: I can’t see it ending any other way.Travis Waldron: I can’t wait to see the salt levels on Kyrie’s face if the Cavs knock Boston out of the playoffs.Maxwell Strachan: Travis Waldron: That’s a bad tweet.Maxwell Strachan: We’ve reached “corporate jokes” levels of trending.Travis Waldron: I know you love the brands, Maxwell, but leave them out of this.Maxwell Strachan: The Wolves should grab Deng and Noah too. By the way, there’s no way Thibs will not have run KAT and Wiggins into the ground by the time they are 27.Travis Waldron: It’s going to be so sad when he ruins KAT.Ja’han Jones: I still think Noah is serviceable.Maxwell Strachan: Ja’han. Please take that back.Travis Waldron: Serviceable at what?Ja’han Jones: Lol, he’s a big man with good court vision. In a league where Zaza exists, there’s room for Joakim. HahaMaxwell Strachan: I’m pretty sure Noah is just partying in New York.Travis Waldron: Anyway, I have to make a phone call. Cavs in 7.Maxwell Strachan: IN THE FINALS? Are you kidding me.Travis Waldron: Necessarily ambiguous. Leave it up to the imagination.Maxwell Strachan: Ridiculous, and I love it.Ja’han Jones: There we go! Talk that talk, Travis! I’m still rolling with the Cavs!Travis Waldron: Look, I’m just here for the NBA going fully insane. God bless LeBron.Maxwell Strachan: Travis is trying to end this chat as if something insane isn’t going to happen in the next hour.Travis Waldron: I’ll be back. The NBA is my drug.[2:00 PM]Ja’han Jones: Dear God.Travis Waldron: What, like, that Kendrick Perkins?Ja’han Jones: The Enforcer.Maxwell Strachan: Back from the dead.Travis Waldron: I just learned that as of two days ago, the Canton Charge’s Kendrick Perkins was planning to retire from the G League. Now he’s going to sit on the plane* next to LeBron. What a world.*Not ready to assume he gets to sit on the bench.Maxwell Strachan: I love the NBA. Ja’han Jones: If you get in good with ’Bron, you’re set for LIFE.Travis Waldron: It’s the best thing we, as a country, have.Maxwell Strachan: Knicks get in this!Travis Waldron: Mudiay lives.Maxwell Strachan: This is very Knicks, but I ... I kind of like it. Depending on what they trade him for. Since it’s the Knicks I’m going to assume it’s for Kristaps.[2:05 PM]Maxwell Strachan: Hm.Travis Waldron: Every time I see Woj tweet I get excited and now he wants me to care about Devin Harris. ANNOUNCE DEANDRE.Maxwell Strachan: Is this a good trade? I guess I dig this trade for the Knicks. Trade a serviceable role player for a reclamation project that was drafted near the top of the draft just a couple years ago. (As an aside, from a friend: “i have 10 tabs open and 6 of them are woj tweets.”)Travis Waldron: Who cares.Maxwell Strachan: I’m going to go to my Knicks friends for reactions.Travis Waldron: I don’t care about anything but Tristan for DeAndre.Maxwell Strachan: It’s happening. I believe.Ja’han Jones: I feel for Tristan. Dude never asked to play the five, yet we judge him on his inability to do so. LolMaxwell Strachan: Me: “Knicks just traded McDermott for Emanuel mudiay. Immediate reaction?“ Knicks fan friend: “Why?” I guess that says it all.[2:10 PM]Travis Waldron: “Who are the Knicks.”Maxwell Strachan: To be fair, he’s been rather despondent since Kristaps tore his ACL.Maxwell Strachan: Oh, wait, I like it less now lol.Travis Waldron: You keep telling me about this trade and I forgot that New York or Dallas had NBA teams. @wojespn, announce DeAndre.Maxwell Strachan: Missed this, but good. Ja’han Jones: Astute observation, Joel. Maxwell Strachan: I feel like DeAndre has been on the trading block since the first years of the Obama administration.Ja’han Jones: Literally.Maxwell Strachan: Posted at 10:03 a.m.:Travis Waldron: Damn. We should have known Isaiah was gone last night when he was waving his arms at the top of the key in OT and LeBron just ducked his head and went to the rack. 1 on 3.[2:15 PM]Ja’han Jones: Lol, “I got this one, lil fella.”Maxwell Strachan: I’m so old I remember when LeBron was considered the greatest teammate in the league two years ago. Travis Waldron: When your guy decides to go at Andrew Wiggins and Karl Towns by himself without even looking at you, you gotta see the writing on the wall.Maxwell Strachan: Travis Waldron: My god.Maxwell Strachan: Has anyone ever killed more of the goodwill surrounding them than I.T. in the last, oh, 10 months?Travis Waldron: Isaiah has had a worse past 365 days than the United States.Maxwell Strachan: I.T. has been on the Lakers for like 5 minutes and he’s already ruining everything.Ja’han Jones: My man just won’t let ANYONE tell him he’s better as a bench guy. He needs to take the Lou Williams route. I’m waiting for the Big Baller Brand-Isaiah chat.Travis Waldron: I need a LaVar-Isaiah Facebook show ASAP.[2:20 PM]Maxwell Strachan: Kill me.Travis Waldron: Isaiah is gonna end up in Lithuania with LeMelo and LiAngelo before Easter.Maxwell Strachan: And that would be an optimistic outcome. Is Isaiah Thomas going to be happy backing up 20-year-old rookie Lonzo Ball? (That was a joke.)Travis Waldron: Was it?Maxwell Strachan: I love when Woj sprinkles in a silly little trade like this. Lightens the mood. [2:25 PM]Maxwell Strachan: NOOOOOO.Travis Waldron: Oh, come on.Ja’han Jones: Drat.Maxwell Strachan: Thirty more minutes. I think Woj has one more bomb in him.Travis Waldron: That means ... Oubre for DAJ is happening. I’m going to hate the NBA by the end of this.Ja’han Jones: Where is Kyle Singler going to end up? That’s the real question.Maxwell Strachan: I feel like there will be some automated high-frequency trades in the final 60 seconds. Ja’han always asks the right questions.Ja’han Jones: I know everyone is wondering.[2:30 PM]Maxwell Strachan: Here’s another guy who has had one foot out the door for a half-decade.[2:35 PM]Maxwell Strachan: My friend who doesn’t spend all day on the internet just texted: “Isaiah a laker?” What a tranquil life he leads.Ja’han Jones: Wow, what a blessing.[2:40 PM]Ja’han Jones: I’ve missed a bunch of Cavs games lately. Do either of you brothers know whether Cedi Osman is developing well?Maxwell Strachan: I literally have no idea. I just know LeBron jumped into his embrace last night.Ja’han Jones: This is true. He’s earned the King’s blessing. He’s set.[2:45 PM]Maxwell Strachan: Fifteen minutes left, and it’s quiet. Too quiet.Travis Waldron: Still time for Ernie to ruin everything.Maxwell Strachan: Assuming nothing else happens, who is the biggest winner here? You can say it, it’s fine.Ja’han Jones: Suns. Kept Jared Dudley happy by literally doing nothing.Maxwell Strachan: Wrong. I believe the Lakers won. Going to just step outside my box and say that. Today, we not only obtained a first-round pick, but essentially signed Paul George and LeBron James.Travis Waldron: Short-term, over the next few months, I think Cleveland did a thing that counts as a win, but that’s largely because they did an offseason that was a loss. But I think they’re better positioned to win the East today than they were yesterday. Long-term, the Lakers had a good day.Maxwell Strachan: Thank you Travis. Thank you for speaking truth to power.[2:50 PM]Travis Waldron: I’m ... let’s call it curious ... about what Utah’s process was here.Ja’han Jones: I was going to say Lakers, but I hesitated because I don’t know what ultimately happens with that space they’ve made. Cavs today, potentially Lakers down the road assuming they don’t make all-time bad mistakes in the offseason.Maxwell Strachan: Sheldon Mac is not the last-minute explosion I was hoping for.Travis Waldron: Also, Joe Johnson is a winner for getting people to keep paying him to play basketball. God bless Joseph Johnson.Ja’han Jones: As Bomani Jones says, Joe is a legend at the bank. For real.Maxwell Strachan: It’s official, and it’s weird. Travis Waldron: Joe Johnson is the eighth-highest paid NBA player of all time.Joe Johnson has made $214 million.Maxwell Strachan: Travis shut up for a second and let Ja’han digest this:Ja’han Jones: LORD. Travis Waldron: Joe Johnson has made more money than Chris Bosh or Dwyane Wade. Joe Johnson is not just a legend at the bank, he is a first-ballot Hall of Famer at the bank.Maxwell Strachan: Travis, literally no one cares about Joe Johnson.Travis Waldron: That’s their fault.Maxwell Strachan: Not even Joe Johnson cares about Joe Johnson.Travis Waldron: Joe Johnson is the American Dream.[2:55 PM]Maxwell Strachan: Travis Waldron: That’s so disrespectful.Maxwell Strachan: I like the move for the Suns by the way.Ja’han Jones: I mean, we were playing Isaiah Canaan at point, Mike James before we let him go (Lol), Tyler Ulis, Devin Booker (against his wishes). We literally just need someone who can get the ball across half-court and pass it to Devin.Travis Waldron: Ah yes, Elfrid Payton, the difference between 24 wins and 26.Maxwell Strachan: He’s good!Travis Waldron: Yes, but see, the Suns are not. The Suns are a top-8 League Pass Alert squad, though.Ja’han Jones: We’re in the Bagley/Bamba/Young sweepstakes. If we didn’t win a single game all season except those against the Lakers and Spurs, I’d be elated.Maxwell Strachan: I feel like the NBA has one more trade in it. Three minutes.Travis Waldron: Nah, Woj is already outside smoking.Maxwell Strachan: **Woj closes phone****throws it into a trashcan****lights trashcan on fire**“Game, baby”Travis Waldron: **Shams breaks DeAndre for Tristan**Maxwell Strachan: The greatest rivalry in sports.[3:00 PM]Maxwell Strachan: It’s 3 p.m. Is that it? I think that’s it.Travis Waldron: Verdicts? I still can’t believe the Cavs managed to flip their entire roster in a half-hour.Maxwell Strachan: That was perhaps the greatest hour in NBA Twitter history.We were the real winners today.Travis Waldron: We were. I’m taking the rest of the day off to celebrate.Ja’han Jones: Haha, this has been better than Emojigate.Travis Waldron: That seems like a good place to end it.Maxwell Strachan: Oh wait.Now we’re done."

Coming after years, after decades of authorities’ denial of responsibility,” he said. Turnbull urged Australia’s states and non-government institutions to sign up to contribute funds and other resources to the redress program. “We owe it to the survivors not to waste this moment.” There was, perhaps unintentional, symbolism in Turnbull’s announcement, too. On Thursday, the New South Wales Supreme Court honored the retirement of Justice Peter McClellen, who led the commission’s investigations into the darkest depths of some of Australia’s largest institutions, including the Roman Catholic Church, prominent charities and the military, as well as orphanages and schools. McClellan earned the respect of survivors throughout the inquiry for his tough interrogation of CEOs, religious leaders and government as well as non-government officials. He was also praised for his compassion toward survivors.Opposition Leader Bill Shorten reportedly suggested the government host an event at Parliament House to recognize survivors and thank them for speaking out. Leonie Sheedy, of the survivor group Care Leavers Australasia Network (CLAN), gave her cautious support to Turnbull’s initiative. (Turnbull is a patron of the network.)Leaving the NSW Supreme Court where other survivors turned up to mark McClellan’s impending retirement, Sheedy told HuffPost Australia that Turnbull must demand churches and other institutions participate in the redress program or lose their charity tax exemptions."

The official spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.In reports that appeared to confirm the official’s comments, Syrian state media said the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State had bombed pro-government forces east of the Euphrates river in Deir al-Zor province. One of the state TV outlets reported “dozens of dead and wounded.”No American troops were killed or wounded in the incident, officials said.Some U.S. troops had been embedded at the time with Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), whose headquarters in Syria’s Deir al-Zor province had been a target of the attack.One SDF fighter was wounded, the official said.“We suspect Syrian pro-regime forces were attempting to seize terrain SDF had liberated from Daesh in September 2017,” the official said.The forces were “likely seeking to seize oilfields in Khusham that had been a major source of revenue for Daesh from 2014 to 2017.”Neither U.S. officials nor the U.S.-backed coalition have offered details on the identity of attacking forces. The Syrian army is supported by Iranian-backed militias and Russian forces.Syrian state media said on Thursday the U.S.-led coalition had bombed “popular forces fighting (Islamic State) and the (Syrian Democratic Forces) east of the Euphrates river” in Deir al-Zor, causing casualties.Statements carried by Syrian television stations called it a “new aggression” and “an attempt to support terrorism.”A reporter for the state TV station Ikhbariya said there were “dozens of dead and wounded” as a result of the attacks and described the groups it said had been bombed by the U.S.-led coalition as “local people fighting (Islamic State) and the SDF.”The U.S.-led coalition had alerted Russian officials about the presence of SDF forces in the area far in advance of the thwarted attack, the U.S. official said.“Coalition officials were in regular communication with Russian counterparts before, during and after the thwarted (enemy) attack,” the official said.The coalition said the attack occurred around 8 kilometers (5 miles) “east of the Euphrates River de-confliction line in Khusham”, a town southeast of the provincial capital Deir al-Zor city."

Don Shooter, a Republican, drops his mic after voting no on a resolution that expelled him from the Legislature after he was accused of sexual harassment. Some states are considering proposals that would bar the use of taxpayer money to pay for sexual harassment settlements involving lawmakers.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c644d2000003500eae430.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jen FifieldWhen Pennsylvania state Rep. Thomas Caltagirone was accused of harassing a staff member, the Legislature settled the matter outside of court. The state’s insurance paid out $250,000 in 2015, and no one said a word — even during the next year’s elections, when Caltagirone retained his seat.This secret settlement is one of many involving state lawmakers or legislative aides that have been exposed in the last few months, as a wave of sexual misconduct allegations has flooded the country. And in state after state, the allegations of wrongdoing quietly went away after victims received payouts from public funds.The revelation that legislatures frequently use taxpayer money to protect lawmakers and staff accused of harassment or assault has sparked outrage and prompted reporters to try to tally up the bill.The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette exposed Caltagirone’s settlement in December. California newspapers this month revealed that the state Legislature has spent $290,000 on settling harassment-related claims since 2006. The Detroit News last month revealed that the Michigan Senate spent $269,000 to investigate and settle sexual harassment claims from 2000 to 2007.And the Wisconsin State Journal in December revealed that the state Legislature in 2015 spent $75,000 to settle a claim against a state senator who was accused by a former aide of talking about her breasts and making other sexual comments. The accused — Democrat Spencer Coggs — is now treasurer for the city of Milwaukee.Lawmakers in at least five states — California, Illinois, Iowa, New York and Pennsylvania — have proposed banning the use of public dollars for settlements or payouts related to sexual harassment allegations against state lawmakers.Advocates for taxpayers, such as Pete Sepp, president of the nonprofit National Taxpayers Union, say lawmakers need to be held responsible for their actions.“They are supposed to be answerable to the people who pay the bills,” Sepp said, “and those people are saying right now that this situation is untenable.”But some employment lawyers, such as David Yamada, a law professor and director of the New Workplace Institute at Suffolk University in Boston, say the issue is more complicated than it seems.Holding individual lawmakers, and not the government, responsible for sexual harassment may lessen the incentive for legislatures to offer sexual harassment training and to police their own, Yamada said. And, because some lawmakers may not be able to come up with the money for a settlement, it also may make it less likely that the victim will receive compensation for her claim.“There are better ways to spend public money than to have to spend it to atone for the misdeeds of public servants,” Yamada said. But, he said, “We have to hold public employers liable.”Employer LiabilityLegislatures are often on the hook for the bad behavior of lawmakers because, like other employers, they are responsible under the Civil Rights Act for creating a workplace that is free from harassment and discrimination. Employers that don’t attempt to prevent harassment — and report and investigate claims when they arise — can be held liable.It’s part of an employer’s job to prevent a toxic culture, said Emily Martin, general counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, a nonprofit that provides legal defense for victims of harassment. But Martin said the bills raise an important question about why the state is paying for the transgressions of lawmakers, who do not have a traditional employer-employee relationship.Lawmakers don’t really have managers, other than the public, she said. “In order to really hold that legislator accountable, maybe it makes sense to have them pay for it.”The effort to hunt down secret settlements involving state lawmakers began in November after reporters revealed recent cases in which taxpayer money was used to settle sexual harassment claims against members of Congress, including payouts related to accusations against Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida ($220,000) and John Conyers of Michigan ($27,000), and against Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas ($84,000). Congress is considering a bipartisan bill, like the state bills, that would bar the use of taxpayer money to settle harassment claims.It’s hard for the public to find out about settlements agreed to by state legislatures, and even when the payments are made public, the details of the allegations usually are not. In some states, legislatures aren’t subject to public records laws, and in other states, officials say the law doesn’t apply to these records. It’s also hard to know what records to ask for — sometimes the settlements are paid by state insurance, sometimes by the legislatures’ administrative offices, and sometimes by individual party caucuses.In Pennsylvania, the payout for the claim against Caltagirone, a Democrat, came from a state insurance fund. Caltagirone has consistently denied any allegations against him. He said he is prohibited from talking about the settlement, but that it did not result in any cost to taxpayers that he was aware of. Bill Patton, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania House Democrats, could not confirm that assertion.The Slow RevealIn recent years, settlements agreed to by state legislatures have been revealed as court cases occurred or victims spoke out. They include a $1.75 million settlement in Iowa involving Republican senators; a $400,000 settlement in Kentucky involving a Democratic state representative; and $620,000 for two settlements in New York, one involving a Democratic state assemblyman, and another involving a Senate employee.Illinois state Rep. David McSweeney, a Republican, proposed a ban on the use of public dollars for settlements after revelations of settlements involving members of Congress. McSweeney said he doesn’t know of any Illinois state lawmakers who used taxpayer dollars to settle harassment claims. But more than 200 men and women recently signed a letter saying that harassment in the state Capitol was rampant.Allowing public money to cover lawmakers’ sexual harassment claims encourages bad behavior, McSweeney said, adding that his proposal would help prevent it.“God forbid, if someone does this behavior,” he said, “you are going to be exposed, and you are to be punished.”Most of the proposals would cover state lawmakers but not all state employees, even though plenty of settlements have involved the latter.The amount spent on harassment and discrimination settlements, including sexual harassment and many other forms of discrimination, for all state employees in California was $25 million in the last three years; in Florida, $11 million since 1992; in New York, $10 million in the last nine years.And in Pennsylvania, the state spent $900,000 on a single payout in 2016, after a longtime employee accused a midlevel manager in the Revenue Department of harassing her, sexually assaulting her, and making racial slurs, including references to slavery, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Minna Kotkin, a law professor and director of the Employment Law Clinic at Brooklyn Law School in New York, questions why there isn’t also a movement to ban the use of public money to settle claims involving employees who aren’t elected officials.She pointed out that police brutality cases often raise the same questions about employee and employer responsibility, and there aren’t proposals to make individual officers pay in those cases, either.The proposal in Iowa, unlike in other states, would require all state employees to pay to settle claims against them. All 20 Senate Democrats and an independent senator introduced the bill.Some victims file claims against employers, not individuals, because it helps ensure that they will be compensated for any damages. The government can easily cut a check to compensate the victim for a lawmaker’s actions, Yamada said, while the individual lawmaker may not have the financial resources to do so.In Pennsylvania, state Rep. Leanne Krueger-Braneky, a Democrat, said her proposal would ensure the victim is made whole by requiring the state to pay the settlement amount, and then requiring the lawmaker to reimburse the state.The bill also would allow the state to tap into lawmakers’ pensions to settle claims, Krueger-Braneky said.“My goal is this language is strong enough that no legislator engages in harassment activity ever again,” she said. “But if it happens there will be a clear, nonpolitical way to address it and a real cost to the legislator.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

The pop and R&B artist traces the highs and lows of a romantic relationship on his new visual EP, “Get Lost.” HuffPost got a first look at the EP’s third video, “Inevitably,” which sees Palmer cozying up to YouTube personality and model Max Emerson on the streets of Los Angeles. Palmer told HuffPost he and director Ryan Bartley wanted to “tell a story that was compelling and felt true, while still being a bit heightened” through the seven interconnected videos of “Get Lost,” which will be released in full next month. The new EP is the follow-up to Palmer’s 2014 EP, “Stranger Than Fiction,” and is considerably more danceable than its predecessor. “I grew up loving Mariah Carey, Babyface, Michael and Janet Jackson, and I’m currently really inspired by Years & Years, MNEK and Disclosure,” said Palmer, who described his sound as “very melodic and vocal-driven pop, with an R&B influence.”“I feel like genres are more melded together than ever, so it’s been fun to draw from so many different influences on this project,” he said.As a gay black artist, Palmer said he’ll continue to incorporate queer themes into his work, but added, “I have learned that trying to represent an entire community of people is a losing game.”“There will always be people that don’t enjoy my music or don’t relate to the story we’re trying to tell in the videos, and that’s OK,” he said.“While I hope lots of people connect to the songs and videos, my goal is always to make something that I’m proud of and can stand behind, and I certainly feel that with this project.”“Get Lost” will be released in full March 9."

The amount of livable space, less than 10 square metres per person in many cases, is far below even bare minimum international standards.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c6ea82000003400eae442.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Irwin LoyThis article originally appeared on IRINnews.org, a news agency specialised in reporting humanitarian crises.Tens of thousands of vulnerable people living in rickety homes in Bangladesh’s Rohingya refugee camps will be threatened by landslides and floods as the monsoon season nears, according to officials in the densely packed settlements.Data released by aid groups shows that floods could submerge one third of the land in the cramped Kutupalong-Balukhali mega-camp, which is now home to more than half a million Rohingya refugees.Using drone images, historical rainfall data and interviews with local residents, researchers have estimated the risks of floods and sudden “landslide failure” throughout the complex warren of interconnected streams and sloping hills. The risk analysis, released in late January, estimates that more than 86,000 people live in high-danger flood areas, while more than 23,000 live along steep, unstable hillsides that could crumble with continuous heavy rainfall.Aid groups and Bangladeshi authorities say stabilising the most at-risk homes in the camps is a top priority ahead of the monsoon season, which typically begins in late May. The current dry season offers only a small window of opportunity before the rains set in – and some fear time is running out.More than 688,000 Rohingya surged into Bangladesh after a military crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine State in August 2017. Overwhelmed by the influx, Bangladeshi authorities ushered most of the new arrivals to a giant mega-camp sprawled between existing refugee settlements, then home to roughly 100,000 people.At the time, local NGOs and aid groups warned of the risks of amassing large numbers of people on unstable land. But, over the ensuing weeks, the camp exploded in size as Rohingya settled in, carving homes into the surrounding hillsides or digging in to low-lying land near rivers and streams.Many Rohingya arriving in the camps pieced together their makeshift homes from tarpaulin sheets and scraps of bamboo.In December, IRIN reported on early plans to prepare for the looming cyclone and rainy seasons. Aid workers warned that much of the infrastructure built over the past weeks could be swept away by a powerful storm or the monsoon rains.”It’s going to be a disaster within a disaster; we’re going to have to restart,” said Graham Eastmond, who coordinates aid groups working on organising shelter in the camps. “The monsoons themselves are going to create a whole different landscape to what exists now.”See: A disaster within a disaster: cyclone fears in fragile Rohingya campsThe new risk analysis estimates that floods and landslides could damage one quarter of washrooms and latrines in the main mega-camp and nearly half of the current sources of tube-well water. Other essential services hastily put in place during the influx are also at risk: makeshift classrooms for children, nutrition centres, and almost one third of health clinics – a particular concern given the already high risk of disease outbreaks in the cramped settlements.Aid groups also warn that heavy floods and landslides could wash away roads and pathways, cutting off large parts of the camp not submerged by the rainfall.The priority now, according to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, is to upgrade as many of the Rohingya homes as possible with stronger bamboo and better building techniques. Authorities are also looking into the logistics of moving the most at-risk homes. But this involves major work to level off steep hillsides and find useable new land – extremely difficult when space is at such a high premium. Already, aid groups working in education say the threat of monsoon season could see the permanent closure of dozens of learning centres in flood-prone areas, shrinking classroom space for 10,000 children.With the monsoon season fast approaching, aid officials are stepping up warnings that the window of opportunity to prepare is rapidly closing.“We are running out of time,” said Zia Choudhury, Bangladesh country director for the NGO CARE.Interested in quality independent humanitarian news?

19,POLITICS,We’re About To Find Out Whether House Democrats Mean What They Say On DACA,Matt Fuller and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-daca-nancy-pelosi_us_5a7c94a9e4b08dfc93016ebf,Democratic leaders are sending mixed messages on whether to oppose the budget deal.,2018-02-08,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has said that she personally opposes the spending bill.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c94da1e000038007ab21e.jpeg?cache=3PKiUtsZUO&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With the Senate expected to easily pass a bipartisan spending deal, and House Republicans generally falling in line, the big question on Thursday ― just hours before a government shutdown ― has become House Democrats.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was coy Thursday morning, telling reporters that she personally wouldn’t support the bill, but that she still felt it was a good deal for Democrats.“I’m just telling people why I’m voting the way I’m voting,” Pelosi said at a press conference.But a couple of hours later, after Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) once again refused to give Pelosi the assurances she’s demanded for an open process on an immigration bill, Democrats seemed to change their mind about not whipping against the spending deal.“Unlike in the Senate, there is no agreement that the House will even consider legislation to protect DREAMers. By leaving this vital issue unresolved, this package leaves DREAMers isolated, without a path to resolution in the House,” a Democratic whip notice said.Just because leaders are urging a no vote, however, doesn’t mean they’re truly pushing Democrats to vote down the spending bill. One senior Democratic aide said Pelosi’s tepid opposition has been signal enough for some Democrats that, even with that whip notice, there will be no repercussions for voting yes on the bill.“We still know this is a good bill for Democrats,” the aide said.At the moment, the Democratic whip operation seems to be less about pushing for a certain outcome and more about figuring out where their caucus stands.In a letter to her Democratic colleagues Thursday afternoon, Pelosi laid out the reasons why she opposed the bill and added that Ryan’s refusal to move forward in a bipartisan way on immigration “demeans the dignity of the House of Representatives.” However, she did not explicitly urge her caucus to vote against the budget legislation.“The Republicans do not have the votes to pass this caps bill on their own,” Pelosi wrote. “House Democrats have a voice here and we must be heard.”On their side, House Republicans still expect a healthy number of defections, possibly into the high double digits, but many Republicans appear to be falling in line. Even people whom you might expect to vote no ― for example, Freedom Caucus member Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) and former Freedom Caucus member Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) ― were sounding noncommittal either way on Thursday.How much leverage Democrats have in this showdown will depend greatly on how many votes Republicans can put up. If there are 40 Democratic yes votes no matter what leadership says, and there are only around 60 Republican no votes, Democratic leadership will have a tough time in any effort to extract a firmer promise from Speaker Ryan on immigration. And if there are around 100 Democrats who want to vote yes, then leadership is just posturing to save face with progressives and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which still thinks Democrats should get a firm promise on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program before they give Republicans any votes.In part to give a voice to that wing of her party, Pelosi launched a marathon speech Wednesday in support of Dreamers that set a record for the longest continuous remarks on the House floor. The California Democrat spoke for just over eight hours, urging Republicans to bring a bill to the floor that would address DACA.But some Democrats were dismayed that Pelosi, who is known for maintaining unwavering control over her caucus, did not go far enough in opposing the spending legislation.“I say to everybody: Don’t collude with this administration,” Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), a leading voice on immigration among his Democratic colleagues, pleaded Thursday on the House floor. “Vote against the budget.”It’s clear there will be a solid bloc of Democrats voting against the budget deal, which would provide $80 billion for defense and $63 billion for non-defense above the spending caps this year, and another $85 billion more for defense and $68 billion more for non-defense in the following year. In total, there would be about $300 billion more than allowed under the spending caps that Congress set for itself in 2011. The agreement would also provide $140 billion in war funding and $20 billion more for other emergency spending.A vote is likely Thursday afternoon in the Senate, where the bill should pass handily. The House would then vote later Thursday evening or potentially in the early morning hours of Friday, depending on time agreements in the Senate and how long it takes to formally get the bill to the House. With government funding set to expire at midnight, any hiccup could cause a shutdown, but leaders still seemed confident earlier in the day.When Ryan was asked about the prospects for passage on Thursday morning, he said, “I feel good.”"

The U.S. designated both men as foreign terrorists, and sanctioned Kotey in 2017.American authorities were informed last month that the militia might have apprehended Kotey and Elsheikh, according to the Times. The men reportedly provided valuable information to military interrogators about ISIS leadership and structure. Counterterrorism officials believe ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remains at large, despite rumors of his death.The lead executioner in the “Beatles” cell, Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John,” was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2015. Aine Davis, the fourth member, was detained in Turkey in 2015 and convicted on terror charges last year. All four members of the group lived in West London before moving to Syria.They are reported to have detained, tortured and killed dozens of hostages, including American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, as well as British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, in 2014. Their gruesome propaganda videos of victims’ slayings have circulated around the world.The detention of Kotey and Elsheikh will end a yearslong manhunt by British intelligence and security agencies, as well as a U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force, the CIA and the FBI."

The trans icon opens up about her personal journey in the latest episode of Katie Couric’s podcast, recalling how she came to terms with her gender identity before hitting it big.“It wasn’t a struggle for me, it was a struggle for everybody else,” the “Orange Is the New Black” star said of her childhood in Alabama. “I was always feminine. Everyone was telling me I was a boy, and I knew I was a girl. Up until that time, I didn’t think that there was a difference between boys and girls.”A turning point came, she said, when she was briefly sent to “reparative” therapy in grade school because of her gender expression. “I internalized a tremendous amount of transphobia,” she told Couric. “It wasn’t until I moved to New York and met real trans people that I was able to accept trans people and accept myself.” She then quipped, “The irony of my life is that before I transitioned, kids called me a girl, and after I transitioned, people called me a man.” Things took a serious turn in the interview when Cox discussed the setbacks members of the transgender community have experienced under President Donald Trump. “Trans people are under attack right now in this country. ... Our lives are on the line,” she said, pointing to the controversial “bathroom bills” that have been implemented in a number of states as well as Trump’s efforts to ban trans recruits from the U.S. military. “It’s an intersectional issue,” she continued. “It gets complicated, because it’s not just a gender thing. It’s a race thing, it’s a class thing ... all of those things are diminishing our lives.” Listen to Cox’s full interview with Couric below. "

It also includes the $2 billion Saudi Arabia recently said it would deposit in Yemen’s Central Bank to shore up a flagging currency.But the plan rejects calls by the U.N. to lift an on-off blockade of Hodeidah port, a vital lifeline for civilians in the rebel-held north: it proposes reducing the overall flow of cargo into the city and stepping up imports into coalition-controlled areas.Exact details of how (and if) the plan is intended to help hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Yemeni civilians – especially in rebel-controlled areas – are not yet clear. However, IRIN can reveal the lengths Riyadh has gone to in preparing and promoting it. The press release journalists received announcing the plan came neither from the coalition itself nor from Saudi aid officials. It came, along with an invitation to visit Yemen, straight from a British PR agency.U.K.- and U.S.-based consultants and PR firms, including U.S. defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, were also involved in helping to write and promote YCHO, which is tagged as “counter-terrorism” on a website funded by the kingdom’s U.S. embassy.All of this has fed suspicions that rather than a genuine attempt to help the people of Yemen, the plan is really intended more to gloss over the Hodeidah issue and improve Saudi Arabia’s battered image, or at least a bit of both.From PowerPoint to press releaseTwo high-placed sources in the U.N. told IRIN they first learned the particulars of YCHO in a PowerPoint presentation – at the time a “work in progress,” according to one of the sources.A PDF of the presentation, obtained exclusively by IRIN and marked “confidential for discussion,” lists one “Nahas, Nicholas [USA]” as the author.Nahas appears to be an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, which has 35 job listings in Riyadh on its website, including “military planner”, a role that requires the applicant to: “Provide military and planning advice and expertise to support the coordination of Joint counter threat operations executed by coalition member nations and facilitate resourcing to enable operations.”IRIN tried emailing and calling Nahas, as well as several Booz Allen Hamilton spokespeople, but none replied. A switchboard operator at the company’s Abu Dhabi office said Nahas was not currently in.Following the initial PowerPoint presentation (and, IRIN understands, high-level discussions with U.N. representatives, donors, and diplomats), press releases – including detailed maps and infographics – were sent to journalists by Pagefield Global Counsel, one of several successors to disgraced U.K. firm Bell Pottinger (Pagefield employs over 20 former Bell Pottinger staff).IRIN tried to contact the Pagefield associate partner who sent the emails and was involved in arranging a recent press trip to Yemen, but again there was no response.Metadata in the press release suggests the involvement of another firm as it lists “Madison Clough” as the author. A woman of the same name is a senior account executive at Qorvis MSLGROUP, one of several PR firms and subcontractors retained by Saudi Arabia to represent it in the United States. Clough, again, did not reply to IRIN’s emailed request for comment.MSLGROUP’s services to Saudi Arabia include web and social media content and over 60 contacts with US-based journalists on Yemen in the six months to 1 October 2017. The firm, a subsidiary of French PR giant Publicis, booked U.S. revenue of more than $6 million from the Saudi Arabian embassy over a 12-month period up to September 2017.The promotionMSLGROUP’s involvement with Saudi Arabia and the new plan is hardly a secret: it is visible on the bottom of YCHO’s website, yemenplan.org, in a text that reads: “This is distributed by Qorvis MSLGROUP on behalf of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.”The company also runs a website for Saudi Arabia’s embassy in the United States, where a press release on the plan can be seen tagged as “counter-terrorism”.In addition to the press releases, the PowerPoint presentation, and the website, the Embassy of Saudi Arabia last week delivered a package containing information on the plan to the offices of major INGOs in the U.K. as well as to members of the U.K. parliament.In the package was a list of YCHO accounts: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Gmail.At the time of publication, YCHO’s Twitter account had about 10,000 followers. But analyst Marc Owen Jones, a lecturer in Gulf history at the University of Exeter who has researched bot-usage, told IRIN the majority are likely to be fake, intended to inflate the credibility and popularity of the account.“Previous studies have shown the use of Twitter bots and fake followers to be particularly common in Saudi Arabia,” he said. “On certain days, up to 50 percent of the tweets using the hashtag #Saudi have come from fake (bot) accounts.”According to an IRIN tally, almost half of YCHO’s followers have less than 10 followers themselves, while some 1,000 followers were accounts created on the same day in 2016 – signs that a significant number of bots or fakes are inflating YCHO’s popularity.The charm offensive organised by Pagefield included a short trip to Yemen for select journalists. A recent CNN report shows boxes of aid being unloaded from a truck. They’re labelled “Kingdom of Saudi Arabia” and bear the logo of the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre. Similar scenes can be scene on clips on the YCHO website.“Yemen has always been poor and has long relied on aid from its prosperous northern neighbour,” the accompanying text reads. In a separate short film from Yemen, CNN says the Saudi military flew its team into the country.True to formSaudi Arabia has a long history of using foreign PR and consultancy firms to develop economic policy, curry favour in Western capitals and – critics argue – cover up abuses. It is even said to be the fastest growing market for consultants.Not long after U.K. firm McKinsey & Co authored a December 2015 document about moving Saudi Arabia beyond its dependence on oil, the Saudi cabinet ratified a very similar plan for economic reform called “Vision 2030.”In 2016, MSLGROUP distributed an article by Saudi foreign minister Adel bin Ahmed al-Jubeir justifying the execution of 47 people in one day – including Shia religious leader Nimr al-Nimr – as “fighting against terrorism.”McKinsey (which told IRIN it “has not been involved in any work” on YCHO) and MSLGROUP are only two of a constellation of firms contracted by the kingdom. However, spending on lobbying and advisory services beyond the scope of the demanding US transparency rules is not publicly available.Late last year, the Financial Times reported that Riyadh planned to set up PR “hubs” in Europe and Asia to improve its global image. One human rights analyst on the Gulf told IRIN there are so many PR firms working for Saudi Arabia and its neighbours that keeping track is “like playing whack-a-mole.”“Damage control”Saudi Arabia and its allies – including forces siding with the internationally recognised (but deposed) President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi – have been battling Houthi rebels since March 2015 in a bloody war that has killed nearly 6,000 civilians and left millions close to starvation.All parties to the war have been accused of causing horrific suffering – with the Houthis blamed for detaining and torturing opponents, using banned landmines, and blocking and confiscating aid, especially in the besieged city of Taiz.But the Saudi-led coalition has something the Houthis don’t – control of the seas – and it has come under heavy criticism for slowing and sometimes completely blocking both humanitarian and commercial imports. In November, it closed all of Yemen’s major entry points, ostensibly in response to a Houthi rocket shot at Riyadh. Condemnation was quick, with humanitarians warning that famine was imminent.Even U.S. President Donald Trump – whose administration has so far been a steadfast ally of Saudi Arabia –weighed in (albeit after several weeks of closures), calling on the Saudis to lift the blockade “immediately.”Entry is now being allowed into all of Yemen’s ports, but only on a temporary basis at Hodeidah, the Red Sea port in Houthi-controlled territory that handles the majority of the country’s imports and that humanitarians insist cannot be substituted.Since the November closures, leading aid figures have become increasingly outspoken about the responsibility the coalition bears for Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe, with Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, saying in early November that he believed the shuttering of ports was “illegal collective punishment.”It is against this backdrop that Saudi Arabia introduced the YCHO plan.Farea al-Muslimi, chairman and co-founder of the Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies think tank, told IRIN it was no surprise Saudi Arabia has pulled in outside help to prepare and promote it.“They have always relied on these PR companies,” he said. But “no matter how creative they are, no matter how much money they spend [on aid], it is a drop in the sea of a terrible reality… until this war is over, every PR move remains [nothing more than] a costly damage control process.”What the timing revealsSaudi Arabia’s use of external advisors for economic and military strategy is well documented, but aid and humanitarian matters are more typically the domain of the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The YCHO plan is not only the product of a commercial engagement but – in retaining control of Yemen’s points of entry – it appears to run against the advice of the U.N. and the ICRC who have both called for unfettered civilian cargo traffic and country-wide humanitarian access.Saudi Arabia does have a history of “bomb it, fix it” – less than a year into the war, shortly after the launch of a newcentre to coordinate its humanitarian efforts worldwide, the kingdom donated $274 million towards the UN’s appeal for Yemen. Since 2015, it says it has given over $8 billion in various types of support to Yemen. Its humanitarian donations recorded in the UN’s tracking system since 2015 are $865 million, of a total from all donors of $6.28 billion.Previous large Saudi donations have been met with some consternation, but most aid agencies have ended up accepting the money as long as they are not told where or how to spend it. This may be the case again, but not without a degree of internal grumbling, even if most in the humanitarian community are unready to speak on the record.One aid worker familiar with the YCHO plan told IRIN they believed the PR onslaught, timed within a few days of the UN’s Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen, was no coincidence.“There was a lot of pressure on the U.K. and U.S. governments who were in turn putting pressure on [Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners] to say enough is enough,” the source said. “That may have been a driver for this plan.”The Sana’a Center’s al-Muslimi said the plan was obviously an attempt to garner good press, and one that didn’t “come out of the ether.”“It comes out of extreme pressure on the Saudis and their allies in Yemen,” he added. “It tells you how much there is to hide: terrible tragedies.”IRIN submitted written questions to YCHO and Saudi authorities for comment but did not hear back by the time of publication.Interested in quality independent humanitarian news?

IRIN Middle East Editor Annie Slemrod explores what this means for the tens of thousands of people now facing an uncertain future.After escaping torture in Sudan, after walking 11 hours through the Egyptian desert, and after handing almost all his money to men with guns who blocked his way, Adam slipped through an opening in a border fence and laid down on the sand.The respite didn’t last long.The 24-year-old told every Israeli official he met – first soldiers, then officials at a detention centre – that he was seeking safe haven.It didn’t go down well, as Adam recounts calmly from his Tel Aviv kitchen table.“I told them, ‘I’m a refugee.’ They said, ‘We don’t have a place for refugees here.’”“I asked for the UN… They said, ‘here in Israel we don’t have the UN.’”“I said, ‘so let me go back.’ They said, ‘no.’”Little did he know it would go so badly that four years later he would be labelled an infiltrator and that, as an unmarried, childless male with no official refugee status, he would be high on the list for deportation.Adam, who told IRIN he was tortured in prison in Sudan for refusing to fight in the military, has fallen foul of a new Israeli government plan to rid the country of the 38,000 African asylum seekers inside its borders.A new policyThe government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Tel Aviv has been overrun by “illegal infiltrators” who, it maintains, are largely responsible for driving up poverty and crime in working class southern parts of the city.Starting the first of April, the government says it will give the asylum seekers – more than 90 percent are from Sudan and Eritrea – the choice between prison and “voluntary” deportation. Those who agree to leave will be given $3,500 (this sum will decrease after 1 April) and reportedly then be sent to Rwanda or Uganda, although both governments have denied entering into agreements with Israel.Asylum seekers began making the trek to Israel in the mid-2000s. Between then and 2014, when the country fortified its border with Egypt, Israel’s policy towards new arrivals has changed often.It gave them visas – renewable every few months – that read, “this permit is not a work permit,” but opted not to fine employers who hire them. It sent men to indefinite detention in a series of centres, until the high court limited this to a year in 2015. It has also paid asylum seekers to leave the country – reportedly via secret deals with Rwanda and Uganda (believed to be the destinations in this latest push).Forced deportations haven’t been officially announced, but at least one of Netanyahu’s ministers has said they’re on the table.When he announced the new policy at a January cabinet meeting, Netanyahu spoke of the “plight of the long-time residents” and said his new deportation plan was aimed at, “restoring quiet – the sense of personal security and law and order – to the residents of south Tel Aviv, and also those of many other neighbourhoods.”Welcome to the medinaSouth Tel Aviv has become a hive of controversy – and a useful rhetorical tool for politicians – because the government and some locals (but not all) blame poverty and deteriorating conditions on the influx of African asylum seekers, even though one official report suggests state neglect was largely to blame.Most did not choose this city anyway. With a dark sense of humour, and a bit of profanity, Adam explains what his one-way ticket to the Central Bus Station in the south of Tel Aviv was like.After being apprehended at the border – an incident that involved running from a searchlight, losing his shoes, and an act of kindness when a soldier gave him his own boots – Adam was told he couldn’t claim status as a refugee but could stay in Israel and work a while, in what officials kept calling the “medina,” city in Arabic.He didn’t speak much of that language, but after weeks in detention he heard his name called a few times: “Adam-medina,” “Adam-medina.” Loaded onto a bus with other African asylum seekers, he eventually figured out what medina meant and that he was going to a city that turned out to be Tel Aviv.Unlike some of his fellow passengers, he already feared his prospects were bleak. “We didn’t speak Hebrew; we didn’t have any experience,” he remembers. “People were so happy getting on the bus.”“I said to them, ‘Why are you happy? This medina is going to be messed up [in more colourful language]. It’s not going to be easy.’”Adam took one look at Tel Aviv, saw men sleeping rough in a park, and got on the first bus out of there. But eventually he came back and found work as an electrician.Over time, many asylum seekers found jobs and places to stay near the bus station in south Tel Aviv. Nowadays, shop signs in Tigriniya (the language spoken in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia] compete for space in the area alongside those in Hebrew; barbershop and salons have sprung up to cater to a black clientele; coffee shops display posters of Eritrean musicians.Teklit Michael, a 29-year-old Eritrean activist (and middle-distance runner) who fled his country in 2007, says he came to Israel “to be safe from detention, torture, imprisonment,” but never truly felt at home.He recounts episodes of discrimination: “When you get on the bus and no one wants to sit next to you… when you cook at a restaurant and people say, ‘I don’t want to… eat what he made.’” Refugee statusAs Adam learnt upon arrival in 2013, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, doesn’t process asylum claims in Israel. The government has handled refugee status determination since 2009, and until 2013 it was almost impossible for Eritreans and Sudanese to even submit applications.When applying for refugee status did become an option, it was still extremely difficult and bureaucratic.“I thought, if you can apply you can at least prove that you tried,” said Anwar Suliman, a Sudanese asylum seeker who IRIN profiled in this 2017 film and interviewed again for this feature.He, like Teklit and many others, is still waiting for an answer.Adam never filled out the refugee status determination form – what everyone calls the RSD.Why? “They told me in the beginning they had no place for me.”Plus, he says he knew a lot of people who filled out the form and it amounted to nothing.The statistics bear this out – as of mid-2017, more than 12,200 people had filed asylum claims; more than 7,400 had received no reply. Only 10 Eritreans and one Sudanese – 11 people total – have been granted refugee status since 2009, even though Israel is a signatory to the refugee convention. One more Eritrean man is said to have been granted status this week, although IRIN could not independently confirm the report.Fighting backDespite utter mistrust in the system and frustration over the miniscule recognition rate, those RSDs have suddenly begun to feel like some sort of protection.That’s because it is childless men who never applied or were rejected who Israel says it will send away first, although later phases of the policy could see others deported.IRIN visited Anwar at his home near another central bus station, but not in Tel Aviv – after detention in a desert centre called Holot he was told not to return to the city.He has been the face – and name – of lawsuits; he has encouraged his fellow activists to speak out; and he has learned Hebrew and English.Now, he says, “we’ve struggled enough. We did everything by the law; we protested; we spoke to the international media, the local media; we did everything.”“I think now is the time for the Israeli citizens’ to [join us in the] struggle.”Some have heeded his call.There have been protests (including some by residents of south Tel Aviv) against the proposed deportations, promises by rabbis to hide asylum seekers (should it come to that), and a letter from a group of pilots at Israel’s national airline, El Al, saying they would refuse to fly asylum seekers if they were forcibly deported.Condemnation from human rights organisations and international Jewish groups perhaps led Rwandan President Paul Kagame, after a recent meeting with Netanyahu, to issue a statement saying he “would only accept a process that fully complies with international law.”At local NGOs that serve the asylum seeker community, activists say they will do everything they can to put a stop to the new policy. Dror Sadot of the Tel Aviv based NGO Hotline for Refugees and Migrants told IRIN that there is “a lot of panic” about the possible deportations, and that “now is our time to do everything we can.”Adi Drori-Avraham, spokeswoman for ASSAF – which provides psychosocial support for asylum seekers who are especially vulnerable (torture victims, single mothers) – says her organisation will keep doing what it has always done.“We had an Eritrean woman, who is a single woman with three kids, sitting on a chair in her office, sobbing with her head between her hands, asking, ‘Are we going to have to hide?’ It’s a horrible situation, basically the stuff of nightmares.”Deported to what?In a recent cabinet meeting, Netanyahu reportedly called the notion that Rwanda is unsafe “a joke.”But asylum seekers who have taken Israel’s “voluntary” flights to Rwanda in the past have told researchers they arrived to find no support, only a night or two of hotel accommodation, and no legal right to remain there.With $3,500 in their pockets, they were easy targets for robbery and trafficking to other countries.They felt they had little choice but to leave Rwanda and chance it through dangerous countries like Libya, and, according to UNHCR, “along they way they suffered abuse, torture, and extortion.”These reports back up stories every asylum seeker IRIN spoke to in Tel Aviv had heard (from friends or friends of friends who took Israel up on the offer of cash), and everyone had also seen the video of three Eritrean refugeeswho were voluntarily sent to Rwanda, attempted to make it to Libya, and were killed by so-called Islamic State.“[Rwanda and Uganda] are not our countries… nobody wants to go there,” says Teklit. “What is waiting for them is human trafficking to other countries, torture, other horrible things.”Teklit says he can only describe how he feels as “desperate”, but calmly says he will choose prison if forced and must remain composed because “the good guys are always the winners, not the bad guys”.Anwar feels the same: “100 percent I will go to prison. This is a crazy decision [to have to make]. But it’s the best I have.”Adam has a different take. He knows the risks – he knows he’ll be a sitting duck – but he reckons if he is deported it could help those still in Israel. If he’s kicked out of a place “that doesn’t feel like your home… maybe people will start paying attention… one day the people here will feel something.”Changing hearts and mindsOn a recent Friday night at the Eritrean women’s centre in south Tel Aviv where Teklit works – women and children are celebrating a move to new offices with a coffee ceremony and snacks.In one corner is an odd-looking pile of plastic heads with hair, which made more sense when Teklit explains that hairdressing, along with cleaning, is one of the few avenues of employment for women from Eritrea.Behind the chitchat and selfies, in another room, a group of Eritrean and Ethiopian asylum seekers quietly fills out RSDs – with the help of volunteers, as the forms can only be filled out in English, Hebrew, and Arabic.The Israeli government says this won’t make a difference, and insists that the deportation exemption only applies to those who had open applications as of the first of this year.So why are they still giving it a shot? “Maybe it makes them feel better,” offers one volunteer.Because of the recent move, the centre’s walls are nearly bare, but for a painting of one black hand and one white, linked together.

Repeat offenders could be fined up to 10,000 kroner ($1,644).The proposal specifically mentions burqas, niqabs and balaclavas as examples of potential violations. The niqab and burqa are just two of the many styles of covering that Muslim women may wear as part of their spiritual practice. The niqab is a face veil that leaves the area around the eyes clear. The burqa covers the face completely, leaving a mesh or net screen for women to see through.The Danish government’s proposal pointed out that face coverings that have a “recognizable” purpose, such as winter clothing, sports gear or masks for festivities, are excluded from the ban. The new proposal will be assessed by nongovernmental human rights organizations, then presented to Parliament this spring. Since the ban has the support of the right-wing, nationalist Danish People’s Party, the country’s second-largest party, it is likely to pass, AFP reports.Despite the precautions the government is trying to take against full-face veils, it’s unclear how many women actually wear these religious garments in Denmark today. A 2009 study from the University of Copenhagen found that between 100 and 200 women wear niqabs in Denmark.“I don’t think there are many who wear the burqa here in Denmark. But if you do, you should be punished with a fine,” Poulsen told a local news agency, according to AFP.Özlem Cekic, one of Denmark’s first female Muslim politicians, told HuffPost that she believes the majority of Muslims in Denmark don’t wear the niqab or burqa. She thinks the government’s proposal is more of a “symbolic stance.”“I will never be able to understand why some women choose to wear a niqab or burqa, but I don’t believe in criminalizing opinions,” Cekic told HuffPost. “Women wearing a niqab or burqa will never decrease the freedom of Danes or be a threat to the national security.”Lamia El Amri, chair of the international advocacy group European Forum of Muslim Women, told HuffPost that she’s noticed a “dangerous rise” in Islamophobic political rhetoric across Europe. Politicians and parties have been framing Muslim women and their religious beliefs as antagonistic to European societies, Amri said, which causes these women to be further marginalized.Anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment has been rising in Denmark and other European countries in recent years. In particular, Muslim women’s right to wear veils in public has become a contentious issue. France banned people from wearing the niqab in public places in 2011 ― the first European country to take that step. Last year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld a similar ban in Belgium, saying that the ban was “necessary in a democratic society.”Amri doesn’t think a generally applicable ban on full-face veils in public is needed to protect public safety or public order. In practice, she said these laws tend to lead to increased discrimination and physical violence against women wearing veils in public spaces. “At the same time, we can see that nothing or very little has been done by these governments in ... protecting women against Islamophobic hate crimes,” Amri, a resident of Sweden, told HuffPost. “We would be happy to see governments addressing real problems and security issues that Muslim women face in their everyday life.”Georgina Siklossy, a press officer for the European Network Against Racism who lives in Belgium, had a similar response to bans against full-face veils across Europe.“It is counter-productive to add an obstacle to women who already suffer many inequalities because they are women, Muslim, from an ethnic minority background, and sometimes living in poor socio-economic conditions,” Siklossy told HuffPost.

26,POLITICS,She Dropped Everything To Come Fight For Immigration Reform. She's Still Waiting.,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/undocumented-immigrants-reform-washington_us_5a7b713ae4b0c6726e0ef9c0,"As Congress dithers, undocumented young people are staying in Washington to urge lawmakers to help them.",2018-02-08,"Undocumented activists, including 19-year-old Arlin, call for legal protections on Capitol Hill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b720c1e00002c007ab05f.jpeg?cache=G3t2CYDB2o&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Last September, Karla Aguirre left her family and her South Carolina hometown and boarded a flight to Washington, D.C., to fight for her right to remain in the United States. It was supposed to be a short trip — there was bipartisan support in Congress for measures to protect undocumented immigrants like her. But more than four months later, she’s still here.“There’s no reason for me to go back home where things are going to be exactly the same,” Aguirre, 22, said. “The point of us being here is to make a change. ... This is my work, to make sure that my family is OK.”Aguirre is one of hundreds of undocumented young people who have uprooted their lives to advocate for a bill that would grant them legal status and a path to citizenship. In the nation’s capital, they sleep in churches, houses and, less often, hotels. They spend their days preparing to go to the Capitol, visiting lawmakers’ offices and sharing their stories in hopes of rallying support. They spend their nights hanging out and talking, often too tired to do much else. Their form of fun is chanting, Aguirre said.Many of these young activists hoped to be home by now. President Donald Trump declared an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in September, setting in motion a process that will eventually cause nearly 700,000 undocumented young people to lose two-year work permits and deportation protections unless Congress steps in. Trump set a “deadline” of March 5, at which time large numbers of DACA recipients will begin to lose their protections each day, although thousands already have. Because of a court ruling, DACA recipients can currently apply for an individual renewal, but the Trump administration is fighting to stop them. Democrats promised to push for renewed protections by the end of December, and then again in January, and they’re still promising now, but there haven’t been votes on a DACA bill in either the House or the Senate, which are both controlled by Republicans. Trump offered a framework last month that the White House said would give a path to citizenship to 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants, but he also demanded expansive border security resources, a wall, more ease in deporting children and asylum-seekers, and unrelated cuts to legal immigration. Democrats and even some Republicans shot down the idea. Trump isn’t budging — he said on Tuesday that he would “love to see a shutdown” of the government over it.That means activists like Aguirre can’t go home yet. She is now working for United We Dream, an advocacy group led by undocumented youth. The group has been holding training sessions for roughly 300 undocumented young people from around the country each week ― they come to Washington with their own funds or the help of donors ― to teach them how to share their stories and push for reform. They then go back home and encourage others to do the same. When undocumented immigrants make visits to lawmakers’ offices, Aguirre is often on the first floor of the building, ready to help if anything goes awry.Immigration advocates strongly believe that personal stories are more effective than appeals to lawmakers’ political interests in pushing them to embrace reform. But personal stories can be difficult for undocumented immigrants to share, given the trauma that led many of them to the U.S. and the history of keeping quiet about their immigration status. Aguirre came to the U.S. with her family when she was 6 years old, trying to escape poverty and violence in Mexico. She first received DACA protections in 2013, and her current permit expires in 2019.Aguirre attended a semester of college but wasn’t able to finish a degree because of the cost. Although some states offer lower in-state tuition at public universities to undocumented immigrants who grew up there, South Carolina does not. Initially, she didn’t see herself reflected in the Dreamer narrative, which in the past focused largely on young people in graduation caps and gowns or holding upscale jobs. She wants lawmakers to know that undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children all deserve help ― as do their families.Arlin, a 19-year-old DACA recipient who asked that her last name be withheld because of safety concerns, also feels the narrative about Dreamers needs to be more inclusive. She left Mexico at age 3 and grew up in a small town in North Carolina. Arlin graduated from high school last June but isn’t attending college because even with scholarships, it’s too expensive. (North Carolina also bars undocumented students from receiving in-state tuition.)Arlin arrived in Washington in November for a United We Dream training and, like Aguirre, decided to devote herself to the cause full-time. She came back later in the month and has been here since, other than a few brief breaks for holidays and after the last shutdown. She is involved in many of the office visits, where undocumented young people try to talk to lawmakers in person. When they can’t, they sometimes refuse to leave until they’re kicked out. Some people argue these office takeovers don’t work, Aguirre said, but she supports the tactic. They only do it, she said, if they can’t get politicians to talk to the people who have traveled far to be there. The young activists have been helped through the ups and downs of the past months by the sense of community among those in D.C. People who were born all over the world and grew up all over the U.S. are here in Washington for the same goal. Arlin has been inspired by hearing from people who graduated from college or landed their dream jobs, and dismayed by the stories from people living near the border who are afraid to go to the hospital because it’s past a checkpoint. She has heard about friends’ families and then met them in person. Fellow undocumented advocates now feel like her family, too. When Senate Democrats voted last month to reopen the government without renewing DACA protections, many undocumented young people watched from the gallery in tears. But Arlin said she reminded them that they are powerful.“We’re undocumented folks ― we weren’t supposed to make it this far,” she said. “We have people who have graduated college, we have people with jobs, we have people in Washington, D.C., in the Capitol, being undocumented, being unafraid and just shouting out their stories.”"
27,POLITICS,What The White House Won't Say About Rob Porter's Exit,Paige Lavender,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-porter-white-house_us_5a7cbf87e4b0c6726e1136f1,Things are still pretty unclear.,2018-02-08,"White House chief of staff John Kelly walks with White House staff secretary Rob Porter on Nov. 29, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7cbfb9210000c300600ac3.jpeg?cache=cdh6f35Y4W&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are still a lot of unanswered questions about Rob Porter’s departure from the White House amid allegations of abuse made by his two ex-wives.White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah failed to offer much clarity during a press briefing Thursday. Here are some questions still worth asking about President Donald Trump’s former staff secretary.How much did White House chief of staff John Kelly know? When did he know it?Shah didn’t offer many details when asked if Kelly knew about the allegations of abuse made by Porter’s ex-wives.“This is part of an ongoing investigation,” Shah said. “We trust the background check process, and the chief of staff does not get detailed updates about what may or may not have been alleged.”Politico reported Wednesday that Kelly did know about the allegations, saying he was aware of a protective order against Porter that prevented him from getting full security clearance. CNN also reported that Kelly ― who on Wednesday praised Porter as “a man of true integrity” ― and other White House officials knew about the allegations months before Porter resigned.Shah would not “get into specifics” of who knew what and when, but said Kelly “had not seen images” released by Colbie Holderness, Porter’s first wife, until they were published Wednesday. The images show Holderness with a black eye, which she said was a result of Porter punching her in the face during a vacation in Florence, Italy, in 2005. Did Porter resign or was he terminated?Shah said Porter “offered his resignation,” signaling he voluntarily left the White House, but also that he “was terminated,” signaling he was fired. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that Porter resigned, but Shah indicated Porter may have been asked to leave.This kind of confusion has surrounded other departures from Trump’s White House, including that of former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman.How close was Porter’s background check to being completed?Shah repeatedly said allegations against Porter were part of an “ongoing investigation.” But he didn’t offer much clarity about the status of the background check clearance process that was still taking place more than a year into Porter’s White House tenure. He did confirm that Porter was operating on an interim security clearance before he resigned. How much has Hope Hicks been involved?Shah said Hicks, the White House communications director who has been romantically linked with Porter, “did recuse herself from some matters” concerning the White House’s response to Porter’s exit. He did not deny that Hicks was involved in drafting the White House’s initial statement on Porter, which CNN reported Wednesday.Hicks did not get Trump’s approval on the White House’s initial statement, in which Kelly called him “a friend, a confidante and a trusted professional,” Vanity Fair reported Thursday.

With her high-octane action film “Peppermint” in the pipeline, as well as the coming of age film “Love Simon” out next month, the actress is slowly, yet surely returning to the spotlight after years of only sporadically appearing in projects.Garner is now set to star in a new eight-episode half-hour comedy series for HBO titled “Camping,” which comes from the minds of “Girls” creators Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner, the network announced Thursday. The series description reads:Walt’s 45th birthday was supposed to be a delightful weekend back to nature, at least according to his obsessively organized and aggressively controlling wife Kathryn (Garner). But when the camping trip gathers Kathryn’s meek sister, holier than thou ex-best friend and a free-spirited Tagalong in one place, it becomes a weekend of tested marriages and woman on woman crime that won’t soon be forgotten. Plus, bears.This will be Garner’s first leading live-action role on TV since starring for five seasons in ABC’s “Alias,” for which she won a Golden Globe. She recently lent her voice to Netflix’s animated children’s series, “Llama, Llama.” Based on the British series of the same name created by Julia Davis, “Camping” will see Garner play Kathryn, which Konner and Dunham describe as a “messy, tough and provocative, and really, really fun” role. Her character is “a controlling LA mom who is far less cheerful than her Lululemons imply. Kathryn controls the proceedings with an iron grip until she’s faced with a woman who undoes all her best-laid plans.”Production reportedly is intended to kick off in Los Angeles this spring, while no other casting has been announced yet. “We love Jennifer’s restraint and comedic timing, and we can’t wait for the warmth and intelligence she’ll bring to our central character, Kathryn. It’s truly a dream to have her first on our call sheet,” Konner and Dunham said in a statement. “Now we just have to write her some stunts.”Amen. "

And she is on fire. “Bitch. Shrill. Strident. Emotional,” Clark ticked off some of the words that were used to describe her in the media, and even in court, when she prosecuted the O.J. Simpson trial in the early 1990s.“All of it is demeaning, all of it is minimizing, all of it is a way to shrink a woman into what is basically a child,” she told a packed audience at a women’s conference here on Wednesday. “Anytime a woman raises her voice and shows her power, they find a way to minimize it.”For her part, Clark said she walked out of that courtroom, devastated by the verdict, and never went back. She’s now in the middle of writing her eighth novel. Her new TV series, “Marcia Clark Investigates the First 48,” debuts on A&E next month.Decades ago, no one seemed to notice the biased way Clark was treated, even as her looks, demeanor, private life and “likability” were dissected by the press. Even as Judge Lance Ito cautioned the jury not to be distracted by the length of Clark’s skirt. Finally, with the release of the FX series “The People v. OJ Simpson” in 2016, a new generation woke up and realized that Clark ― who was widely reviled back then ― got a raw deal. Clark said she was shocked at the change in mindset. HuffPost caught up with her for a few minutes after her talk at the 2018 Makers Conference on Wednesday. (Makers is also owned by HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.)During the trial, a lot of us didn’t see the sexism. You saw it. You must’ve been so frustrated.I was aware of sexism. Going into the profession, in the law, women were far outnumbered. At the DAs office, too. On the 18th floor, there were four bathrooms and three of them were for men. Still I was able to succeed. I managed. I didn’t have to confront sexism on a regular basis. I didn’t have to think that much about it.Until the Simpson trial.I wind up in a courtroom full of men who are so profoundly sexist, it was shocking. And so it was a bit of a wake-up call for me.  What have your thoughts been watching the reconsideration of your treatment unfold? I never thought it would happen. Never. The sexism at the trial wasn’t really something that anyone remarked on. Some did, but they were lone voices in the wilderness. Until voices join together in a chorus, nobody hears them. Particularly women.So it really was not something I thought anyone would ever care about or notice. And then they did. That year after the FX series came out was a mind-blower for me on every level.Talking to reporters who were outraged by what they’d seen. Who were disbelieving. The younger ones in particular. The millennials. That age group was like, “What the fuck?” [Laughs]It was refreshing. It was across the board. The men and the women had the same reaction, which was amazing. I thought, OK, we really have moved forward. There really has been progress. There’s a whole generation that looks at that and says, “What bullshit.” You really seem empowered. It seems like I’m seeing Marcia Clark, unleashed. Today, especially, when you said your message for men afraid to interact with women was “boo-fucking-hoo.” Do you feel more emboldened and empowered by the changing climate?I think I’ve always been who I am. I kind of didn’t hold back in court, either. It got to a certain point in the trial when I realized he [Judge Ito] was not going to get any better. There was no appeasing him. Then Marcia Clark unleashed in that courtroom. I definitely resorted to my own voice.I’m still just being me. I think all of us are, but maybe are feeling more empowered to speak out. To say, “This is not OK.” To say, I don’t want to support abusers in Hollywood just because they make money. I don’t want to hide a CEO’s sexual misconduct just because he makes money. In that sense, we have all found a voice that we were afraid to have before.We talked about changing culture. Is there a changing culture in the criminal justice system around domestic violence?Absolutely. So that’s the silver lining of the Simpson case. It really shined a light on domestic violence and the connection between domestic violence and murder. It exposed the thinking that domestic violence is somehow a private affair, a family matter, not a crime. That really exposed that lie.  Do you think the trial would’ve gone differently now?I wouldn’t argue it differently. The case is the case. What will skew it again, if a case like that comes up again, is race. I don’t feel we are post-racial. Many of the problems existing then still exist today. As long as that divide exists, we will come up again and again against the same biases and problems that skewed this trial.Here’s the perfect example: Trayvon Martin. I don’t how that jury found [shooter George Zimmerman] not guilty. How could they? It was a white jury. The notion that Trayvon was a thug, that kind of language [the defense] used, found real purchase with that jury, when it shouldn’t have. He was a kid. Zimmerman targeted him, no question, initiated the fight and then pulled out a gun.I was outraged by that verdict. It goes both ways. I’m encouraged by Black Lives Matter. We need more of this. A lot has changed for women. What’s left to change?Women are speaking out, they’re finding their voice. They’re finding each other, which is the most important thing. The marches are a really important way to connect with other women and see our power when we come together.We also need to see the real changes that can make women’s lives truly equal: Glass ceilings need to be broken, maternity leave needs to be a matter of course, childcare needs to be provided. These are the kinds of things we have to put in place. Now that we have spoken, let’s do it.Did you march?Of course. I didn’t wear the hat, there was one too few hats. That’s OK, I’m not really good in hats, anyway."

America’s secret scourge: kids getting stuck in claw machines.This time, the victim was a Florida boy who was lured into the grip of a claw machine Wednesday night at the Beef ‘O’ Brady’s in Titusville, according to Florida Today.The boy, identified only as Mason, decided that he really, really wanted a stuffed animal he saw inside the arcade game’s cage. Instead of paying to snatch it using the claw, Mason, who looked to be about 4 or 5, climbed up into the machine.“He went in, but obviously he couldn’t come back out the same way,” Titusville Fire and Emergency Services battalion chief Greg Sutton said, according to the Orlando Sentinel.Mason wasn’t trapped in the claw machine’s evil clutch for long. Lucky for the little boy, off-duty firefighter Lt. Jeremy House was also dining in the restaurant.House “told the mother to call 911, knowing our guys are so close by and that they could handle the situation,” Sutton told ABC News.Responding firefighters were able to rescue Mason within five minutes of their arrival. “Once we understood the mechanism and how it worked, it was pretty easy to get those pins removed and the door open the rest of the way,” Sutton said. The fire department reported the rescue on its local Facebook page.There was also minimal damage to the claw machine.Turns out the potentially frightening experience was worth it in the end: Mason got a toy football and more.“He came out with some toys,” Sutton told Florida Today. “He did end up with what he was after.”"

But according to new DNA analysis of his remains, he — and at least some of the first modern settlers of Britain — had dark skin and dark, curly hair.“It really shows us that these imaginary racial categories that we have are really very modern constructions, or very recent constructions, that really are not applicable to the past at all,” Tom Booth, an archaeologist at London’s Natural History Museum who was involved in the analysis, told The Guardian this week of the Cheddar Man findings.Cheddar Man’s 10,000-year-old skeleton was discovered near the village of Cheddar in Somerset, England, in 1903. Researchers now say he was part of a group of hunter-gatherer immigrants from continental Europe who’d settled in Britain shortly after the last ice age. Today’s white Britons are descendants of that immigrant population — one that, until recently, had been assumed to be fair-skinned.But, by sequencing Cheddar Man’s entire genome and reconstructing his face using cutting-edge techniques, scientists at the Natural History Museum and University College London have proved the assumption wrong.“Cheddar Man had blue eyes, dark colored curly hair and ‘dark to black’ skin pigmentation. Previously, many had assumed that he had reduced skin pigmentation,” the researchers said in a news release Wednesday. “The discovery suggests that the lighter pigmentation now considered to be a defining feature of northern Europe is a far more recent phenomenon,” they added.The researchers, who extracted bone powder from Cheddar Man’s ancient skull to conduct the DNA analysis, said their study offers insights into the origins of the Stone Age man. His ancestors, they said, left Africa and moved to the Middle East before heading to Europe and, finally, Britain.About 10 percent of white Britons today can trace their ancestry to this ancient population, the researchers noted.Scientists involved in the research said they weren’t entirely surprised by the findings. “It might surprise the public, but not ancient DNA geneticists,” Mark Thomas, a University College London scientist, told National Geographic. Other recent genetic research, Thomas explained, shows that Europeans from Spain, Hungary and Luxembourg who lived during the same era as Cheddar Man also were dark-skinned. Questions remain, however, as to when and why Britons started to develop lighter skin. Some experts have suggested that ancient humans in more temperate regions were exposed to less sunlight, and therefore evolved to have lighter skin, which absorbs more ultraviolet radiation ― necessary for the production of vitamin D.“In my view, that’s the most robust theory for skin pigmentation,” Thomas told National Geographic. “But it doesn’t explain eye pigmentation. There are other processes that go on. It could be sexual selection. It could even be something else we don’t yet understand.”"

Matt, 28, and Becca, 27, will also compete separately for the U.S. women’s and men’s teams.Although the U.S. curling team is only ranked eighth in the world, Matt Hamilton believes he and his sis have a good chance in their opening match on Thursday against fourth-ranked Russia.They face off against married curlers Anastasia Bryzgalova and Alexander Krushelnitskiy, but Matt suggests the connection he has with Becca is stronger than the bond between their competitors.“I can’t divorce my sister,” he told Reuters. Matt started curling 16 years ago, and Becca took up the sport two years later.“He brought me into the game, so I guess what better partner can I find than someone that brought me up?” she told Inside Edition.“She couldn’t find a better partner,” Matt quipped.“I probably could,” his sister shot back.Snappy patter like that may help the Hamiltons catch the attention of American TV viewers typically more interested in figure skating or ski jumping.Matt describes the sport ― in which people push a 44-pound “stone” across the ice with a “broom” ― as a mix of shuffleboard, chess and bowling. “Oh, and Swiffering your floor,” he told Inside Edition.Curling is the longest Winter Olympic contest: The first match starts before Friday’s opening ceremonies and the last game ends just hours before the Olympic torch is extinguished.That means the Hamiltons will be spending a lot of time together in South Korea, which suits Becca just fine.“I think it’s kind of come full circle now that Matt kind of got me into curling and has taught me a lot of things along the way,” she told NBC Sports. “So to be doing it at this level is a pretty surreal experience.”"

Cattrall told Piers Morgan in October that Parker “could have been nicer about it.”“I don’t know what her issue is,” Cattrall said. Parker said last week she was “heartbroken” by the remarks.“It was a professional experience, but it became personal because it was years and years of our lives,” Parker said on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen” recently. “I’m hoping that that sort of eclipses anything that’s been recently spoken.”Here’s to happier times."

The report says that one man with a psychosocial disability had been in solitary confinement in a maximum security unit for 19 years.“People with disabilities, particularly psychosocial or cognitive disabilities, are dramatically overrepresented in the criminal justice system in Australia ― 18 percent of the country’s population, but almost 50 percent of people entering prison,” Human Rights Watch said in the report.“However, prisons fail to adequately identify people with disabilities and are ill-equipped to meet their needs, often lacking the most basic services.”Sen. Rachel Siewert of the Greens party called for swift action: “We already know that many people with disability are wrongfully detained in our prison system, so to hear about this utterly harrowing abuse and neglect highlights the need for a royal commission and for reform.”HRW interviewed 275 people, including prison staff, medical professionals and 136 current or recent prisoners, from 14 facilities in the states of Queensland and Western Australia. It found that in most of the prisons, toilet facilities were not adequate for people with physical disabilities, who often had to wait long stretches for help to use a bathroom or take a shower.“I can’t get my chair in. I have to pee in a bottle,” one man said.“I have to wear a nappy every day. I don’t feel like a man; I feel like my dignity is taken away,” said another.Of the 136 former or current prisoners interviewed, 41 said they had suffered physical violence. Thirty-two reported sexual violence at the hands of fellow inmates or prison staff. HRW reported the case of one man with a disability who was raped “on numerous occasions” by another prisoner who was meant to be his ‘prison carer,’ an inmate paid by the facility to help look after people with disabilities.“In all 14 prisons visited, Human Rights Watch found that prisoners with disabilities are viewed as easy targets and, as a result, are at serious risk of violence and abuse, including bullying and harassment, and verbal, physical, and sexual violence,” the report said. “It is terrifying,” Siewert said, “to hear that prisoners were appointed to look after other inmates with high support needs and that in one prison six out of eight ‘carers’ were convicted sex offenders. This is despicable and not a standard we would accept out in the community, and it has culminated in rape and sexual abuse of vulnerable people. It is time for the government to urgently address this issue.”One man with a psychosocial disability, who was raped in prison and spent significant time in solitary confinement, said he contemplated suicide.“I feel hopeless; life isn’t worth living and I’d be happier if I was dead. It has led me to self-harm; the physical pain doesn’t hurt as much as the emotional pain,” he said. “My self-harm increased after the rape. I put razor blades and glass in my penis. I wouldn’t do this if I had activities and therapeutic interventions.”Another man, who has a cognitive disability, said he was raped, then threatened by guards when he tried to report his rape. He was then punished by fellow prisoners for attempting to report the incident.“I was sexually assaulted [by other prisoners]…. I know at least one of them raped me, but I kind of blacked out. I was bleeding, I still bleed sometimes. I reported it the same day to two of the supers [superintendents], I filled out the medical request form,” the prisoner said.“They told me if I report it, I would go to the DU [detention unit] for six months. So I ripped up the form in front of them. Then, when I went back to the unit, I got bashed up by some of the guys, not the ones who assaulted me…. They beat me up, stomped on me. Called me a dog [traitor].” The HRW report included multiple reports of disabled inmates being subjected to long periods of solitary confinement. HRW said one prisoner with a psychosocial disability, named in the report only as Mary, spent 28 days in solitary confinement and was abused by prison staff during that time.“After a week, when she was granted access to daily exercise, she was placed in handcuffs connected to a body belt that restricted her movement. During exercise time, correctional officers mocked her, whistled at her like a dog, and told her to crawl on her hands and knees. During her time in solitary confinement, Mary did not have access to a toilet and was forced to use cardboard urine test containers,” HRW said.HRW called on state and territory governments ― which are responsible for the prisons ― to immediately end the use of solitary confinement as punishment for prisoners with disabilities and to provide “reasonable accommodations” for disabilities and adequate access to support and mental health services.Queensland Corrective Services Commissioner Peter Martin told the Courier Mail newspaper that “multiple” investigations were underway into the state’s prison system following the cases cited by HRW. “It’s a taking of some extreme examples ... but in no way do I believe they are endemic of the state of prisons in Queensland.”Western Australia’s independent Inspector of Prisons, Neil Morgan, told The Australian newspaper that his state too would investigate the claims. “But the most fundamental issue is inadequate screening of prisoners for disability, and a lack of records.” On a national level, HRW called on the federal government to launch an inquiry into the use of solitary confinement, as well as commissioning studies to map the number of disabled prisoners in Australia’s prison system.Sen. Jordon Steele-John, also of the Greens party, the third-largest in Parliament, called Wednesday for a royal commission, a parliamentary investigative body, to be established to report on the prison system.“How many cases of systemic abuse, violence and neglect do we have to hear before the government commits to a royal commission into this issue?”he said. “These abuses are occurring in a pervasive manner across the country as we speak.

Last fall, the RNC vehemently pushed Democrats to return their donations from Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, a major donor to Democratic lawmakers, in response to his sexual abuse allegations.Asked whether the RNC would do the same with Wynn’s money, chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said on Fox News last week that the allegations were “troubling,” but the party would only return his donations “if he is found of any wrongdoing.”An RNC spokesman told HuffPost on Wednesday that the party’s position had not changed, pointing to a tweet from Wall Street Journal reporter Rebecca Ballhaus.Wynn currently faces investigations from the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, and from his own company’s board.The RNC’s defense of not giving back Wynn’s donations is similar to how it explained its support for other Republicans accused of sexual misconduct, namely Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore and President Donald Trump. In each case, the RNC justified its financial aid because the men had denied the sexual harassment and assault allegations.While announcing his resignation in a statement Tuesday night, Wynn continued to dismiss the allegations against him, claiming that he had become “the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,” and arguing that “a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts.”In the Wall Street Journal investigation, dozens of current and former employees detailed a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct,” including one case in which Wynn reportedly paid a manicurist a $7.5 million settlement, after he pressured her into sex."
37,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi Holds The Floor More Than 8 Hours To Demand Immigration Promise,Elise Foley and Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-dreamers_us_5a7b2cb0e4b044b382185e63,The Democrat says she won't support a budget deal until the House speaker commits to holding a vote for Dreamers.,2018-02-07,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is pushing for House Speaker Paul Ryan to promise a vote on legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b2cdf2000004d00eae24d.jpeg?cache=HTtkrGa4P3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calf.) spoke on the House floor for more than eight hours Wednesday, adamant she would not support an emerging long-term budget deal unless House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) commits to allow a vote on legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants. Such an announcement would be similar to the one Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made last month that helped reopen the government.“If a Dream Act were brought to the floor, it would pass immediately, with strong bipartisan support,” Pelosi said Wednesday in a speech on the House floor. “The Republican moral cowardice must end.”“Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support,” Pelosi added later in a statement.Her speech set a record for the longest continuous remarks on the House floor. The record had been previously set in 1909, when a lawmaker spoke for five hours and 15 minutes, according to the House Historian’s Office.Pelosi wrapped up her speech around 6:10 p.m., about eight hours and five minutes after she started. Top Senate leaders are working to finalize a two-year budget deal that would boost defense spending sought by President Donald Trump as well as some domestic spending sought by Democrats. The House, meanwhile, passed a short-term bill on Tuesday that would extend funding for the government until March 23, but it is expected to be altered in the Senate ahead of a Thursday deadline.As Pelosi delivered her speech in the House, McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) announced they had reached a budget deal, which Senate Democrats are expected to support because the Republican leader promised an upcoming immigration vote. But its fate is uncertain in the House, where fiscal hawks oppose a spending increase and most Democrats want Dreamer protections to be part of the deal.Trump put nearly 700,000 undocumented young people at risk of losing deportation protection and work permits when he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in September. He told Congress it had until March, when DACA recipients will begin to lose protections in larger numbers, to pass a bill to help them. Pelosi shared personal stories of many so-called Dreamers, the term for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, on Wednesday and read aloud their words about wanting to remain in the U.S. The California Democrat delivered extended remarks, according to her rights as minority leader, which allow her to speak without a time limit on the House floor.She and other Democrats have been calling for a vote on the Dream Act, a bill that would grant legal status to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children, including DACA recipients. But Ryan, who controls the House floor, hasn’t allowed for a vote on the Dream Act or other bipartisan bills to help Dreamers. “I don’t know when we’ll have another opportunity that matches today for us to just get a simple commitment from the speaker of the House that he will give us a vote,” she said. “There’s no guarantee. We’ll have the debate. People will weigh in. They will make their voices heard. Congress again will work its will.”McConnell said on Tuesday that after Congress approves funding on Thursday, the Senate will have an open process for considering immigration legislation, allowing all members to present their ideas. But Ryan said he’ll only allow the House to vote on an immigration bill that Trump will sign.“We’re not going to bring immigration legislation through that the president doesn’t support,” Ryan told reporters at a Tuesday news conference.Trump said he would support a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers but is demanding measures that Democrats and even some Republicans oppose. Democrats have said they would support border security in exchange for Dreamer protections ― some of them even saying they would allow for Trump’s wall ― but draw the line on measures that would hurt asylum-seekers, including children. Democrats also oppose Trump’s demands to dramatically reduce legal immigration options by ending the diversity visa lottery and phasing out types of family-based green cards. Some Republicans also oppose cuts to legal immigration. Many advocates believe the best chance for Dreamer protections is for Congress to pass what it can and then send it to the president, versus conforming to his demands that tank a deal. Pelosi said Republicans who have put forward proposals have shown courage and Ryan should respect the fact that a large number of elected representatives want a vote. “The speaker of the House is saying we don’t matter here, the members of the House,” she said. “We don’t count in this consideration. Because maybe we just don’t have the courage to do what we need to do. I believe we do.”Calling for a vote isn’t enough, Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) argued Wednesday on MSNBC, hours into Pelosi’s speech. He said Democrats should continue to demand that Dreamer protections be a part of the spending deal rather than giving away leverage.“If Democrats join with Republicans on this deal and lift the caps, what you will have is a collusion with Donald Trump to deport Dreamers,” he said on “MTP Daily.” “And I hope that does not happen.” This story has been updated with additional comments from lawmakers, and with details about the record of speaking on the House floor. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated the term Dreamers refers to undocumented immigrants. In fact, it refers to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children."
38,MEDIA,Tronc Is Keeping Ross Levinsohn Aboard After Probe Into 'Frat House' Behavior,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tronc-ross-levinsohn-la-times_us_5a7b1fe8e4b06505b4ea36da,"An independent investigation found ""no wrongdoing,"" the company said.",2018-02-07,"Ross Levinsohn will return to Tronc with the title of CEO of Tribune Interactive, a newly formed digital arm of the company.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b20332000003900eae229.jpeg?cache=xj822vFKhJ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the same day that Tronc officially announced a deal to sell the newly unionized Los Angeles Times, the media company said it had made another key decision: to bring back the paper’s ex-publisher, Ross Levinsohn, following an investigation into past alleged “frat house” behavior. His misdeeds reportedly drove a couple of sexual harassment lawsuits and included a sneering comment about leaving a Hollywood Reporter luncheon on account of all the “ladies and fags.”Tronc’s CEO pronounced the company “pleased.” The women and gay people at Tronc may feel otherwise. The company told investors Wednesday that it was reinstating the former chief executive and publisher of the LA Times after an investigation by an outside law firm found “no wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Levinsohn,” who was placed on a leave of absence during the inquiry. He will return as CEO of Tribune Interactive, a newly formed digital arm of Tronc. “We are pleased that Ross will be back to work,” Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn said in a statement. “We have great confidence in him and the team to deliver value for our shareholders through growing digital audiences for our award-winning journalism, new creative content and product initiatives, and growing digital and diversified revenue streams.”Tronc placed Levinsohn on leave after NPR’s David Folkenflik published a lengthy investigation last month into his behavior prior to joining the Times in August. After reviewing court documents and financial filings and interviewing 26 people who knew the executive, Folkenflik reported that:Levinsohn was sued in separate sexual harassment lawsuits as an executive at two different corporations. By his own sworn testimony, Levinsohn admitted to rating the relative “hotness” of his female colleagues in office banter as a vice president at a digital media company. He also testified that he speculated about whether a woman who worked for him there was a stripper on the side.When he learned of the pending story, Levinsohn himself called NPR CEO Jarl Mohn and “threatened to hire legal counsel,” Folkenflik tweeted in January.More than 180 Times employees, meanwhile, had signed a letter calling for Levinsohn to be fired. He has “lost credibility as the leader of one of the country’s top newspapers,” the staffers wrote. Levinsohn was placed on leave one day after NPR’s report. At the time, Dearborn, the Tronc CEO, told staffers, “We will not hesitate to take further action, if appropriate, once the review is complete.”Helping Levinsohn to run Tribune Interactive will be Mickie Rosen and Lewis D’Vorkin, who have been named president and chief content officer of the division, respectively. Both Rosen and D’Vorkin served in high-powered positions at the Times during Tronc’s rocky time in control of the paper ― Rosen as president and D’Vorkin as editor-in-chief. Levinsohn and Rosen, in particular, appear to be something of a package deal. He has a non-solicitation clause in his contract that, in the event of his departure from the company, prevents him from hiring away any other Tronc people for a certain period of time — with the exception of Rosen.D’Vorkin’s short run at the helm of the Times proved especially contentious, as he became obsessed with leaks to outside reporters and started to hire editors who Times employees worried were part of a non-union shadow operation. Tronc ultimately promoted D’Vorkin away from the paper and replaced him with Jim Kirk, who’d previously held the title of interim editor-in-chief. Tronc did not return a request for additional information about the investigation into Levinsohn."

It is the second-largest release since civil war engulfed the young nation four years ago. “This is the first time so many young women have been involved in a release like this in South Sudan,” said David Shearer, head of the U.N. mission in the country. “Children should not be carrying guns and killing each other. They should be playing, learning, having fun with friends, protected and cherished by the adults around them.” More than 19,000 children have been lured into combat since the war erupted in late 2013, according to UNICEF. Armed groups, including those loyal to the government, continue to recruit child soldiers in high numbers, despite numerous ceasefires and promises from South Sudanese leaders to stop arming kids.HRW interviewed dozens of current and former child soldiers in late 2017. Many described being abducted at gunpoint, detained in crowded containers for weeks at a time, beaten, underfed and forced to fight. Militants coerced some boys into killing their family members, and raping women.“[My captors] told me to go near the road and if I heard the sound of a car coming, I went and reported it. Then they would come and take the car, they’d shoot at it, they’d burn it,” said 15-year-old Victor, one of the boys freed Wednesday. “The people inside ― sometimes they would run, other times they would die,” he told World Vision, which is helping to coordinate the releases.The unrest in South Sudan has amplified the recruitment of child soldiers in the country, which had declined prior to the conflict. Rebels recruited thousands of kids to fight in the Sudanese Civil War between the central Sudanese government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. Gradual peace negotiations freed some 4,000 child soldiers by 2012."

And the U.S. is inadequately prepared to counter that threat, he said.Speaking to Fox News from Colombia on Tuesday, Tillerson said the U.S. has seen “certain behaviors” from Russia that could imply meddling ahead of multiple international elections, including the U.S. midterms.“Really, I think it’s just important to continue to say to Russia, ‘Look, if you think we don’t see what you’re doing, we do see it and you need to stop. If you don’t, you’re just going to continue to invite consequences for yourself,’” Tillerson said.He said the U.S. is no more prepared now than it was before the 2016 presidential election to prevent Russian interference.“I don’t know that I would say we are better prepared, because the Russians will adapt as well,” Tillerson said. “The point is, if it’s their intention to interfere, they are going to find ways to do that. We can take steps we can take but this is something that, once they decide they are going to do it, it’s very difficult to pre-empt it. Tillerson’s comments come on the heels of a January report by Senate Democrats detailing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts ― spanning decades ― to undermine democracy in the U.S. and Europe.The report, released by Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned that the Kremlin will likely attempt to interfere in the 2018 and 2020 U.S. elections, and urged President Donald Trump and his administration to take immediate action to counter these efforts.“It is imperative that the American people better understand the true scope and scale of Putin’s pattern of undermining democracy in Russia and across Europe,” said the committee’s ranking member, Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), in a statement. “This threat existed long before President Trump took office, and unless he takes action now, it will continue long after his administration.”CIA Director Mike Pompeo also warned last month that Russia will almost certainly attempt to influence the 2018 midterm elections. “I have every expectation that they will continue to try and do that,” Pompeo told the BBC.He added, however, that he was “confident that America will be able to have a free and fair election [and] that we will push back in a way that is sufficiently robust that the impact they have on our election won’t be great.”U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, said in a report last year that they had “high confidence” that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin used “an influence campaign” to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate [Democratic nominee Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency,” the report said.Trump, however, asserted in November that he doesn’t believe Russia interfered in the election ― because Putin said so. “Every time [Putin] sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that,’ and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump said.Last week, the White House chose not to impose new sanctions on Russia for its alleged 2016 meddling. The threat of sanctions was sufficient as a “deterrent,” it claimed. "
41,POLITICS,Party Leaders Close In On Bipartisan Spending Deal But Face Bipartisan Opposition,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bipartisan-deal-criticism-caps-house-cromnibus_us_5a7a3777e4b0d0ef3c0a6a2a,Liberals and conservatives both hate a deal that doesn't even exist yet.,2018-02-07,It looks like House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is nearing a spending deal to avoid another government shutdown.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7a38922000003800eae0b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As leaders from both parties closed in on a bipartisan agreement to raise overall spending caps, keep the government funded and potentially raise the debt ceiling, the most ardent Republicans and Democrats were trying to sink the deal Tuesday before it was even struck.House Republicans passed yet another stopgap spending bill Tuesday night ― this time, one that would fund the Pentagon until October and other programs for six weeks ― by a vote of 245-182, with 228 Republicans and 17 Democrats voting yes, and eight Republicans and 174 Democrats opposed. Without a deal, the government is headed for another shutdown on Friday.But the House measure isn’t expected to go anywhere in the Senate. The idea wasn’t so much to “jam” the Senate as it was to softly volley over legislation allowing lawmakers to strip the extended military funding and send it back to the House with a deal to significantly increase spending caps for two years ― adding more than $80 billion for defense per year, and $60 billion per year for non-defense programs ― while also possibly raising the debt ceiling.That’s a deal House conservatives would hate. “With those kind of spending numbers?” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) responded when asked if he would vote for the deal. Meadows made it clear he wouldn’t support it, and he estimated that Republicans would need at least 90 Democratic votes to get such a bill passed in the House.When asked why Republicans would trust House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to come up with that many votes, Meadows said we were using the wrong term.“Republicans?” he asked incredulously, refusing to acknowledge them as party colleagues.When the question was narrowed to just Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Meadows said he guessed Ryan had a deal because it seems to be happening.Meadows was hardly the only conservative to speak against the tentative deal. Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) suggested headlines for HuffPost to make it clear he opposed the legislation. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) said he hoped at least 200 Republicans would vote against such a deal. And Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) suggested that Congress couldn’t afford these caps increases.“We’re broke!” Perry said.But the most liberal Democrats were just as animated Tuesday. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), perhaps the strongest immigration advocate in Congress, said that if Pelosi made such a deal, it would be “a complete betrayal.”“That would be tantamount to me, tomorrow, walking away and saying you can close down every Planned Parenthood facility in the country,” Gutierrez said, adding that he may never go to another Democratic Caucus breakfast if Pelosi cut a deal on spending caps without an agreement on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for so-called Dreamers.Other Democrats signaled reservations about accepting a spending cap deal without DACA, but most who spoke to HuffPost tried to remain open to the idea. Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) said he would have to see what the deal looks like.“I think DACA is not only a moral issue but an economic issue for our country,” Crowley said. When pressed on whether he needed movement on DACA to vote yes, he repeated that he’d wait to see what the deal looked like.Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said he might oppose a deal on spending caps on the merits of increasing defense spending by so much, and he suggested he wanted action on DACA but was noncommittal ― as were John Lewis (D-Ga.), John Larson (D-Conn.) and Mark Takano (D-Calif.).Aides reported Tuesday night that, while they were close to a deal, they were still negotiating ― and the sudden shifts from the bases in the GOP conference and the Democratic Caucus may give leaders extra pause. But the prospect of no deal was just as perilous for lawmakers, as the Senate would still reject the House-passed “cromnibus” ― a portmanteau of “CR,” shorthand for “continuing resolution,” and “omnibus” ― and either send back the bill as another six-week continuing resolution for spending on all government programs or send nothing back at all.If they did send back a clean, temporary extension, that bill could still face trouble in the House, as conservatives and some defense hawks have already staked out the position that yet another stopgap bill is unacceptable for the military.So the clearest path toward preventing another government shutdown is still for Republican and Democratic leaders to find an agreement on the spending caps ― a deal that is certain to draw opposition from factions of both parties.For Democrats, the prospects of a shutdown appeared less precarious Tuesday after President Donald Trump said he’d “love to see a shutdown” if Congress couldn’t agree on immigration. For many Republicans, still believing they got the better end of the last lapse in funding less than three weeks ago, there’s little reason the GOP should agree to such large increases in government spending on the non-defense side. Many Republicans believe if Senate Democrats block the House-passed bill to keep the government open and fund the military until October, it would come back to hurt them in tough races this November.But there were still some centrist lawmakers in both chambers who liked the broad outlines of the deal and hoped it would come together quickly.As Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday, “I think most people are not in loving-shutting-the-government-down mode.”"

On Monday, Jauregui, who identifies as bisexual, retweeted a series of images that showed people who suggested they’d react with physical and sexual violence if their sons told them they were gay. “This is such a disgusting display of toxic masculinity and a deep ignorance of the expression of human sexuality,” she wrote. “It is a spectrum that has no shame.” Jauregui’s tweet began a dialogue with fans and supporters, many of whom shared their own experiences coming to terms with their sexuality.After one fan shared the particularly heart-wrenching experience of being told by a classmate to die as she was putting up Pride Club posters, Jauregui noted:Appropriately, she capped off the conversation with a retweeted gif of Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl LII halftime performance, along with the lyrics of Mother Monster’s LGBTQ-inclusive hit, “Born This Way.” Jauregui has emerged as a staunch LGBTQ rights advocate in recent months. In June, she appeared on Halsey’s hit, “Strangers,” a haunting track that’s been billed as “a love song for the LGBTQ community.”The star first addressed her sexuality in an open letter that Billboard published in 2016. Identifying herself as a “bisexual Cuban-American woman,” she went on to denounce the rampant misogyny that defined much of President Donald Trump’s campaign. In March, she advised her LGBTQ fans to “stay true to themselves” in spite of the Trump administration’s discriminatory rhetoric, telling HuffPost, “When you feel comfortable enough or when you find that person that makes you feel comfortable enough, just go into it and embrace it. Don’t allow yourself to be hard on yourself or feel like you’re crazy or wrong.” "

States spent tens of thousands to keep parks open but never got all their money back.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b160b2000003500eae20e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Rebecca BeitschWhen Utah shelled out nearly $2 million to keep its national parks open during the federal government’s two-week shutdown in 2013, state leaders thought the federal government would pay them back all the money once it reopened. It didn’t.The states of Arizona, Colorado, New York, South Dakota and Tennessee also got stiffed — despite efforts by their congressional delegations to get all the money returned.“We still haven’t been paid back,” said Utah state Rep. Ken Ivory, a Republican who years later sponsored a measure to encourage the federal government to pay back the state after the 2013 shutdown. “It was about $2 million, and they paid us about $1 million and then forgot about us.”In January, Congress’ inaction on a spending bill forced another brief shutdown. Arizona wired nearly $188,000 to the Department of the Interior to keep the Grand Canyon open for a week, though ultimately just one day’s worth of the money was needed. Similarly New York agreed to spend about $65,000 a day to keep the Statue of Liberty alight.As Congress stares down yet another deadline Thursday, state leaders once again may have to decide whether to open their own wallets to protect their local tourism industries.Despite the uncertainty of being reimbursed, some of them undoubtedly will grit their teeth and pay up.“It has a tremendous economic impact in terms of tourism and revenue, and we are willing to do what it takes to keep the gates open,” said Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican.The federal government reimburses states for money they spend during shutdowns on state-administered federal programs, such as Medicaid.But in 2013, states signed special donation agreements with the National Park Service. Under the deals, any unused money would be returned to the states. To get all of their money back, however, states would have to rely on Congress to authorize repayment.Nevertheless, in 2013 when Utah tapped into state park money and wired it to the federal government, it was “with the understanding, we thought, that that money would be refunded once the federal government came back into operation,” said Fred Hayes, director of Utah’s Division of Parks and Recreation.Utah paid nearly $1.7 million in 2013 to keep open its five national parks in the state’s tourism-reliant southern region. The federal government paid back the state about $666,000.When the balance hadn’t been reimbursed two years later, the states’ congressional delegations sponsored legislation that would have returned a total of $2 million to the six states that made payments to keep parks open.“It’s only fair and right for the state to be reimbursed for picking up the federal government’s slack,” Republican U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said at the time. Neither bill got out of committee.But Ptak, the Arizona governor’s spokesman, said recently that the state didn’t hesitate to send money during last month’s brief shutdown and has been coordinating with the park service regarding the possibility of another one. Arizona wired $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open in 2013; just $186,000 in unused money was returned.The sentiment is similar in Utah, which didn’t send anything for the January shutdown. State leaders say they don’t regret spending state dollars in 2013, though, and would do so again.“You can worry yourself to death, but that’s not going to make the money come back,” Hayes said. “Small businesses in these gateway communities are all mom and pop operations, not franchises that can just move money around.”“Pop is making the coffee, and mom is serving it. So to tell those folks ‘Sorry, we can’t help you’ is not an option.”Bryce Canyon City, Utah, located just outside Bryce Canyon National Park, was one of the communities helped by the state’s spending. The economy of the town of 200 full-time residents is centered on Ruby’s Inn, established in 1916, and descendants of the founding hotelier essentially run the town.The mayor, Shiloh Syrett, is Ruby’s great-grandson and is also related to each of the five members of the City Council. He’s also an accountant at the hotel, which employs 300 to 400 workers during the tourist season. A big dip in visitors could mean layoffs.“Most of our tourism is foreign-based, so people pay a lot of money to get over here and go to Bryce Canyon National Park, so that can be devastating for them,” Syrett said. “I definitely feel like the state’s looking out for their best interests because tourism is a big part of state revenue. I’m sure they’d do it again if they had to.”Ivory, the Utah state representative, said states have little choice.“I don’t know if it’s shutdown fatigue, it’s more like shutdown PTSD,” Ivory said. “As the federal government shuts down they can sit idly by and think it’s just numbers, but for us, it’s our neighbors.”Stateline home pageSign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research "

Wade decision of 1973 that the 14th Amendment gave women a constitutional right to an abortion.The language in West Virginia’s bill is the same as Tennessee used in a 2014 amendment removing the right to abortion from its constitution. Opponents of that measure challenged the state’s method of vote counting, but an appeals court last month upheld its passage, the Tennesseean reported.This isn’t the only legislative act under review that could change abortion laws in West Virginia, which currently has only one abortion clinic. A bill that the state’s House of Delegates is reviewing would eliminate Medicaid funding for abortions except for cases where the pregnancy jeopardizes the life of the mother.That bill, which was introduced last month, follows months of scrutiny by conservative lawmakers over Medicaid funding of abortions in the state. The state’s number of Medicaid-funded abortions more than tripled over the last five years, West Virginia Metro News reported, while abortions nationwide are otherwise at their lowest rate since Roe v. Wade.Critics of the bill have stressed that those who are too poor to afford an abortion without state help are also too poor to raise a child.Marquita L. Hutchens, rector of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Charleston, West Virginia, urged lawmakers to turn their attention toward fighting unemployment, low education and drug addition instead.“Help the young who don’t want and can’t care for a child that is thrown into their lives,” Hutchens told lawmakers, according to The Associated Press. “Help them get the time to become educated, to become good citizens of West Virginia, to stay in West Virginia so that they can find good jobs and be productive in their states. Do not beat the poor into the ground, but build them up.”Elsewhere in the country, a bill Mississippi lawmakers are pushing would ban abortions at 15 weeks, which would be the earliest ban nationwide. The state currently bans most abortions after 20 weeks."

Jeff Kruse (R) repeatedly groped women ― sometimes while on the Senate floor or in the governor’s office ― despite repeated warnings, according to an independent investigation.The 51-page report, compiled by employment law attorney Dian Rubanoff and released Tuesday, found Kruse subjected two female lawmakers and many other women to unwanted touching and “lingering” hugs.The 66-year-old Republican legislator engaged in a “longstanding pattern ... of unwelcome physical contact” toward women in the workplace, including State Sens. Sara Gelser (D) and Elizabeth Steiner Hayward (D).“The evidence ... shows that he has engaged in a pattern of placing his hands on women in the workplace below their waists, or touching his head to their heads, whereas the evidence indicates that he does not do this with males in the workplace,” according to the report.Gelser accused Kruse of once placing “both his hands on the front of her shoulders with the palm of each hand resting on or near her breasts” while on the Senate floor in 2016, according to the report. On another occasion, Gelser told Rubanoff that Kruse “wrapped his left arm around her shoulder with his fingers extending down toward her breast, and placed his right hand on her thigh with his fingers under the hem of her skirt.”Members of the state legislature’s counsel and human resources department advised Kruse in 2016 to stop hugging his female colleagues and “keep an an arms’ length distance from them,” according the report. But Kruse’s inappropriate behavior only escalated. Steiner Hayward repeatedly told Kruse in 2016 and 2017 that his physical contact with her was unwelcome, according to the report. After Steiner Hayward rejected Kruse’s attempt to kiss her hand during an October 2017 meeting in her office, Kruse defended his behavior.“I’m just a hugger,” Kruse allegedly told Steiner Hayward. “It’s not as if I want to have sex with you. ... I don’t see why this is such a big deal.”Kruse also engaged in “offensive behavior” toward two law students who were assigned to his office in 2017, and “cupped” the buttocks of a young female lobbyist at an event at the governor’s office, according to the report. One law student told Rubanoff that Kruse often called her “little girl” and “sexy.” When another staff member flirted with her, Kruse said, “You are pretty, so that can happen,” according to the report.“My behavior has not changed as fast as it should have,” Kruse told Rubanoff when asked about his interactions with Steiner Hayward. “It was not lack of respect for her ― just falling back into old patterns. When you have been doing something for 67 years it’s not easy to change.”A representative for Kruse did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.Gov. Kate Brown (D), state House Speaker Tina Kotek (D) and several Republican state legislators have called on Kruse to resign in light of the allegations.“Senator Kruse’s behavior is not acceptable in the Capitol or any workplace, and he should step down,” Brown said Wednesday in a statement to HuffPost. “The legislature must immediately take steps to ensure that every person who walks into Oregon’s Capitol is safe and respected.”The first public accusations of sexual harassment against Kruse were reported in October, as the #MeToo movement gained momentum. Gelser told The Oregonian that Kruse had sexually harassed her for years, and accused him of touching her breast and thigh at the State Capitol.Kruse acknowledged that he gave Gelser side hugs but said he didn’t find his actions to be inappropriate, according to The News-Review, a publication covering Oregon’s Douglas County. “I have never done anything that I believe anybody could portray as being sexual,” Kruse told The Oregonian in October.Rubanoff wrote in her report that she was “concerned” that Kruse could “fall back into old patterns” if he were permitted to continue his work as a state legislator.“I am also concerned about the message that will be sent to women in the workplace regarding the futility of coming forward if there are not meaningful consequences for [Kruse],” she wrote.The report is set to be considered by the Senate Conduct Committee during a public hearing on the investigation on Feb. 22.Read the full report on the Kruse investigation below:"

The previous record dates back to at least 1909 when a Missouri representative named Champ Clark spoke for 5 hours and 15 minutes against a tariff overhaul, the historian’s office said.In her marathon speech ― which wrapped up around 6:10 p.m., about eight hours and five minutes after she started ― Pelosi called on lawmakers to pass the Dream Act, a bill that would grant legal status to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children ― often called Dreamers.“If a Dream Act were brought to the floor, it would pass immediately, with strong bipartisan support,” Pelosi said. “The Republican moral cowardice must end.”“Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support,” Pelosi said in her speech."

It was supported by leaders from across the nation and from different streams of evangelicalism, including Dr. Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission; Jen Hatmaker, the progressive Christian author; and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.An online version of the letter had received more than 1,400 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.World Relief president Scott Arbeiter reflected on the “Christian calling” to care for the vulnerable and welcome the stranger during a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill.“We believe that our national well-being and compassion for the immigrant and refugee are not mutually exclusive,” Arbeiter said. “We’re... dedicated to prayers for our leaders that they would find wisdom and compassion tethered together. And in that they would lead us into a just and compassionate and a wise legislative answer. The time is now.”“As Christians, as evangelicals, we stand ready to continue and even increase our commitment to serving the vulnerable as these laws mature,” he added.The letter avoided expressing support for specific proposals or legislation. Instead, it lists four groups that are of particular concern to these evangelicals: recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (also known as Dreamers), refugees, persecuted Christians, and Americans who are waiting to be reunified with close family members living overseas.Many of the religious leaders at the conference spoke in particular about the plight of DACA recipients, sharing stories about Dreamers who are part of their congregations or church networks. Dr. Eric Costanzo, senior pastor of Oklahoma’s South Tulsa Baptist Church, said during the conference that his church has for years been very “homogenized in our whiteness.” But it has recently diversified and become a spiritual home for many immigrants, refugees and Dreamers.“We’re at a time right now where it probably seems like many evangelicals and evangelical churches are trying to keep immigrants and refugees at an arm’s length,” Costanzo said during the conference. “And I’m here to say that that’s not true for all evangelicals. And it’s certainly not true for all evangelical churches.”Costanzo then spoke about the important roles that Dreamers play in American evangelical congregations.“The Dreamers are being used as leverage and the clock is ticking,” he said. “I believe history will judge us on this. If we fail to do right by these young people, our children and grandchildren will ask us why.”In January, the White House proposed a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, in exchange for $25 billion for border security, including funding for Trump’s border wall.Trump also wants to phase out the diversity visa lottery and policies that allow Americans to sponsor certain family members for green cards.Democrats and even some Republicans in Congress have expressed opposition to the measures Trump has proposed, particularly those that would drastically reduce options for legal immigration.If a solution isn’t found, DACA recipients could start losing their protection against deportation in large numbers as early as March.Last year, World Relief organized a similar letter decrying Trump’s initial executive order on immigration. The organization, which functions as the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, is one of the nine voluntary agencies that work with the federal government to help resettle refugees. The organization reports that fewer than 30,000 refugees were admitted into the U.S. in 2017, compared to more than 99,000 in 2016.In October, Trump dropped the refugee admission quota to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year, an all-time low for the United States’ refugee resettlement program. These cuts come at a time when an unprecedented 65 million people are displaced worldwide, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.Trump initially indicated that he would prioritize Christian refugees. In January, World Relief estimated that the number of Christian refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2017 was about 63 percent lower than the number admitted in 2016. In addition, about 80 percent fewer Muslim refugees were admitted during that time.Jenny Yang, vice president of advocacy and policy for World Relief, pointed out that the Trump administration’s stated desire to help persecuted Christians around the world is “not bearing out in our current refugee resettlement policies.”“We’re grateful that President Trump recognizes the importance of providing a path to citizenship for Dreamers, but also believe our country can be stronger if we enshrine our values of freedom and democracy in how we welcome the world’s persecuted, as well as treat vulnerable immigrants already here,” she said.Evangelical leaders and institutions have expressed support for immigrants and refugees in the past, but national surveys indicate that rank-and-file white evangelical Protestants are split about these issues. A Pew Research Center survey found that about 76 percent of white evangelicals were in favor of the travel ban in February 2017. They were also the religious group most likely to oppose granting legal status to Dreamers (34 percent) and favor substantially expanding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border (65 percent).Yang suggested that part of the problem may be in the polling, since Pew does not separate out the views of evangelicals of color. She believes this group’s views on immigration differ starkly from those of their white peers. “I think the church is growing more diverse, but evangelicals of color are not getting attention in terms of their views on immigrants, because they’re perceived to not have political influence,” she said. “I think what the letter today represents is a convergence of opinion, from evangelical leaders across the spectrum, that care for refugees and immigrants is a core part of our Christian faith.”Ruth Velasquez is the co-founder of Voices of Christian Dreamers, an informal network of Christian DACA recipients. Since Trump’s September announcement about the impending end of DACA, Velasquez said, she’s lived in constant fear about losing her job and access to health care and being separated from her family.Velasquez co-created Voices of Christian Dreamers to help fellow evangelicals understand the effect that immigration laws have on evangelical church communities. “Immigration deals with human dignity and family unity. Therefore it’s a Biblical matter and should be of concern to the church,” she said during Wednesday’s press conference. “Jesus calls us to love our neighbor. He didn’t say to love our neighbor because they can contribute to the economy or because they have a college degree or because it was not their fault. He simply said to love your neighbor.”“My prayer,” she said, “is that the church will welcome the stranger, the vulnerable, just as Jesus did.”"

It was supported by leaders from across the nation and from different streams of evangelicalism, including Dr. Russell Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission; Jen Hatmaker, the progressive Christian author; and Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference.An online version of the letter had received more than 1,400 signatures by Wednesday afternoon.World Relief president Scott Arbeiter reflected on the “Christian calling” to care for the vulnerable and welcome the stranger during a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill.“We believe that our national well-being and compassion for the immigrant and refugee are not mutually exclusive,” Arbeiter said. “We’re... dedicated to prayers for our leaders that they would find wisdom and compassion tethered together. And in that they would lead us into a just and compassionate and a wise legislative answer. The time is now.”“As Christians, as evangelicals, we stand ready to continue and even increase our commitment to serving the vulnerable as these laws mature,” he added.The letter avoided expressing support for specific proposals or legislation. Instead, it lists four groups that are of particular concern to these evangelicals: recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (also known as Dreamers), refugees, persecuted Christians, and Americans who are waiting to be reunified with close family members living overseas.Many of the religious leaders at the conference spoke in particular about the plight of DACA recipients, sharing stories about Dreamers who are part of their congregations or church networks. Dr. Eric Costanzo, senior pastor of Oklahoma’s South Tulsa Baptist Church, said during the conference that his church has for years been very “homogenized in our whiteness.” But it has recently diversified and become a spiritual home for many immigrants, refugees and Dreamers.“We’re at a time right now where it probably seems like many evangelicals and evangelical churches are trying to keep immigrants and refugees at an arm’s length,” Costanzo said during the conference. “And I’m here to say that that’s not true for all evangelicals. And it’s certainly not true for all evangelical churches.”Costanzo then spoke about the important roles that Dreamers play in American evangelical congregations.“The Dreamers are being used as leverage and the clock is ticking,” he said. “I believe history will judge us on this. If we fail to do right by these young people, our children and grandchildren will ask us why.”In January, the White House proposed a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, in exchange for $25 billion for border security, including funding for Trump’s border wall.Trump also wants to phase out the diversity visa lottery and policies that allow Americans to sponsor certain family members for green cards.Democrats and even some Republicans in Congress have expressed opposition to the measures Trump has proposed, particularly those that would drastically reduce options for legal immigration.If a solution isn’t found, DACA recipients could start losing their protection against deportation in large numbers as early as March.Last year, World Relief organized a similar letter decrying Trump’s initial executive order on immigration. The organization, which functions as the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, is one of the nine voluntary agencies that work with the federal government to help resettle refugees. The organization reports that fewer than 30,000 refugees were admitted into the U.S. in 2017, compared to more than 99,000 in 2016.In October, Trump dropped the refugee admission quota to 45,000 for the 2018 fiscal year, an all-time low for the United States’ refugee resettlement program. These cuts come at a time when an unprecedented 65 million people are displaced worldwide, according to the United Nations’ refugee agency.Trump initially indicated that he would prioritize Christian refugees. In January, World Relief estimated that the number of Christian refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2017 was about 63 percent lower than the number admitted in 2016. In addition, about 80 percent fewer Muslim refugees were admitted during that time.Jenny Yang, vice president of advocacy and policy for World Relief, pointed out that the Trump administration’s stated desire to help persecuted Christians around the world is “not bearing out in our current refugee resettlement policies.”“We’re grateful that President Trump recognizes the importance of providing a path to citizenship for Dreamers, but also believe our country can be stronger if we enshrine our values of freedom and democracy in how we welcome the world’s persecuted, as well as treat vulnerable immigrants already here,” she said.Evangelical leaders and institutions have expressed support for immigrants and refugees in the past, but national surveys indicate that rank-and-file white evangelical Protestants are split about these issues.

She was an amazing woman and it was a true honor,” Duff, 30, wrote on Instagram. The caption accompanied a photo of Duff made up to look like the actress who was hideously murdered by members of the Manson Family cult in 1969.“It doesn’t matter who it is acting in it – it’s just tasteless,” Debra Tate told People Wednesday. “It’s classless how everyone is rushing to release something for the 50th anniversary of this horrific event.”Duff’s film has no ties to Quentin Tarantino’s untitled project on Charles Manson, which is set to be released on the 50th anniversary of Sharon Tate’s murder next year. Manson, the leader of the Manson Family cult, died in November.Sharon Tate, who was the wife of director Roman Polanski, was stabbed to death in her home by members of the cult when she was 26 years old. She was pregnant at the time of her gruesome death and was due to give birth in two weeks.According to Deadline, the plot of the psychological horror film stems from a quote attributed to Tate from a year before her death. She reportedly told an interviewer that she had a premonition in a dream that she and her boyfriend at the time, Jay Sebring, were going to have their throats slit.Debra Tate, who was 16 at the time of her sister’s death, told People that this quote is a fabrication.“I know for a fact she did not have a premonition — awake or in a dream — that she and Jay would have their throat cut,” Debra Tate said. “I checked with all of her living friends. None of her friends had any knowledge of this. Tacky, tacky, tacky.”"

Patty Murray and other Democrats said Trump's ""tip pool"" proposal runs counter to the Labor Department's mission.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b0e881e00002c007aaf9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democrats on Capitol Hill are urging the Labor Department to ditch a contentious proposal that would make it easier for restaurant owners to redistribute or keep their employees’ tips.In a letter Tuesday to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, 24 Senate Democrats said the agency needed to bail on the measure because officials “concealed evidence from the public” projecting a significant loss in money for millions of tipped employees across the country.The Labor Department “is forcing through a regulation that would take money out of the pockets of low-wage workers and, even worse, it covered up the potentially catastrophic impacts from workers and advocates,” the senators wrote.They called it “a stark example of how far the Trump Administration is willing to go to appease business interests at the expense of working families.”Last week, Bloomberg BNA’s Ben Penn reported that Labor Department leaders had suppressed an internal analysis showing workers could lose billions of dollars in tips if the agency enacted the rule as proposed. The officials directed staffers to tweak their methodology so that the projections wouldn’t be so alarming, according to Penn.The revelations have whipped up Democratic opposition to a proposal that was already controversial and appears to have little support outside of the restaurant industry.In 2011, the Labor Department under then-President Barack Obama instituted a regulation limiting the scenarios in which restaurants can force employees to share their tips with colleagues. The proposal from Trump’s Labor Department would do away with that rule so that management could do as it pleases with servers’ and bartenders’ tips so long as they are paid a full minimum wage before gratuities.The restaurant lobby says it wants the Trump administration to change the law so that restaurants can run “tip pools,” having servers and bartenders share their gratuities with back-of-the-house workers like cooks and dishwashers, who normally don’t get tips. But the way officials crafted the new proposal, there’s nothing to stop a restaurant owner from keeping a portion or all of a worker’s tips without distributing them to the other workers.When federal agencies release a major rule like this one, they typically put out a study showing what its economic effects would be. The Labor Department did not do that in this case. Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate labor committee who spearheaded Tuesday’s letter, said she requested an analysis when the Labor Department released the proposal late last year but still hasn’t heard anything back.The Labor Department has already carried out a 60-day comment period on the proposal, allowing stakeholders and members of the public to weigh in on the policy. The comments posted on the regulations.gov website ― many of them clearly copy-and-pasted form letters ― appear to overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Under the normal protocol, officials would now consider those comments as they tweaked the proposal before finalizing it. In their letter Tuesday, the Democrats said the proposal runs counter to the Labor Department’s very own mission statement: “To foster, promote and develop the welfare of wage earners.”"

It’s unknown if Kelly took any action at the time, but on Wednesday he reportedly urged Porter not to resign and wrote a glowing review of the alleged abuser.Porter’s resignation followed reports from The Daily Mail and The Intercept in which his two former spouses discussed the physical, mental and emotional abuse they said they suffered at his hands.Colbie Holderness, Porter’s first wife, alleged that he punched her in a 2005 incident.“He threw me down on the bed and punched me in the face,” Holderness told The Intercept. “I think he was shocked that he had lost control to that extent.”Porter’s second ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby, was granted the protective order against him in 2010 because she said he would “not leave their apartment.” Willoughby alleged that Porter forcibly pulled her out of a shower and yelled at her that same year.Still on Wednesday, Kelly said in a statement, “Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can’t say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidante, and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him.”White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, who has been romantically involved with Porter, helped draft Kelly’s statement, according to CNN.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also offered praise.This article has been updated to include CNN’s report that Hope Hicks helped draft Kelly’s statement about Porter."

At least that’s how Arie Luyendyk Jr., the current star of “The Bachelor,” seems to feel. Not that Arie doesn’t believe in ambition at all, at least for himself. Even the casual “Bachelor” fan knows all about the years the race car driver spent traveling the world to pursue his dream of one day winning a competition. And if women have ambition, that’s actually a plus in the abstract sense, as he explained to 26-year-old “Bachelor” contestant Jacqueline Trumbull, who plans to pursue a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, when the latest episode aired on Monday night. Throughout their one-on-one date, he seemed awestruck by her intellect. “I think at the beginning, I was like, ‘she’s far too intelligent for me,’” Arie told Jacqueline over dinner. “I was intimidated by you… I just hope I would know how to interest you.”And when she expressed that she plans to spend the next six years in school to complete her Ph.D., he also professed not to want to derail her plans. But instead of offering the possibility that maybe ― horror of horrors! ― he would consider making changes in his own life in order to support her dreams, Arie implied repeatedly that their relationship probably wasn’t going to work out. (Jacqueline got the rose this week, but as discerning viewers, we can only assume she won’t last much longer.) “I would never want you to give up your dreams to pursue a relationship with me,” he said, dangling the rose in front of her. “But I know that I feel really deeply for you and I wanna see where this goes.”“Do our lives fit right now? Maybe not,” he then told the camera. “I feel like there’s more to find out about her. And so for me, I don’t really see her ambitions and dreams as a hindrance; it would just be another obstacle that we have to get through together.” Of course, Arie can want whatever he wants out of a relationship ― and, as “Bachelor” viewers have repeatedly heard, he wants a woman with a flexible schedule, not six years of higher education ahead of her. He even offered a woeful tale of a past dating tragedy, about a previous partner who sidelined her own aspirations to support his racing career. His tone is regretful ― “It wasn’t only a burden for her, but it was a burden for me because I felt like I wasn’t doing her justice,” he told Jacqueline ― but he doesn’t suggest that he should have tried to compromise or support his ex more. (Instead, apparently, he set her free.) Now, as the show lead, he is particularly empowered to choose a woman who is more amenable to bending to his lifestyle. If that’s what he really wants, he has every right to go for it.And yet. Despite the fact that women now outnumber men on college campuses, make up nearly 47 percent of the U.S. workforce, and are waiting longer than ever to get married, a gendered double standard remains when it comes to the way ambition plays into romantic love. Arie comes off as magnanimous in this episode for not openly recoiling at Jacqueline’s plans, and for denying that her ambitions are “a hindrance” to their relationship. But he can’t deny that he still sees them as “an obstacle,” rather than a desirable quality in a partner. And as Jacqueline’s weepy relief at not being booted off the show on her first one-on-one date indicates, straight women are still conditioned to see this lack of open scoffing at their ambition as a gift. On HuffPost’s “Here To Make Friends” podcast, we discussed this dynamic with “Mouthing Off” host and “Bachelor” alum Olivia Caridi, and DJ and “Your Favorite Thing Podcast with Wells & Brandi” co-host Brandi Cyrus: Claire Fallon: There’s a stereotype that smart men are fine dating less intelligent women, but smart women want a guy who’s even smarter than them. Some women want to be the alpha in their relationship.Emma Gray: Yeah, that is true.Brandi Cyrus: Me!Claire: Some women want a guy that is just gonna be chill and goofy and relaxed.Brandi: I don’t understand that either. And this whole time, they’re sitting here at dinner I was just like, “I can’t even believe this is being talked about right now.” And she’s so upset and emotional about it! How can he sit there and say, “Yeah, I gotta send you home because you’re too smart and you’re gonna give up your career for me”?The whole conversation to me was so crazy, and I couldn’t believe that he would assume that she would even be thinking about, “Oh yeah, if I win, I’m gonna turn down my six-year education that I’ve worked so hard for my whole life.”Claire: Well, obviously, that’s what would have to happen, because he needs a wife. And he needs his wife to live in Scottsdale, which is a lot to ask of anyone.Emma: The bounds of this conversation were just so crazy. And then it left her in the position of almost apologizing for the fact that she has ambition and intelligence.Brandi: And if I were her, I would have been upset that he’s known this the whole time ― he’s known since the beginning; clearly, they’ve already talked about her education and how much longer she has. You’ve kept me around this long to go on this date and tell me, “Oh, I don’t know if I can be with somebody with that kind of ambition.”Claire: Right, so basically she has six years of a Ph.D. program left. Emma: She works at Mt. Sinai in New York City! That is one of the best hospitals in the country. This is a fuckin’ smart woman.Olivia Caridi: [Arie] should be saying, “Please adopt me. Let me marry you.”Brandi: She’s too good for the show. No offense, Olivia. [Laughs]Claire: But this is also when we learn that he’s been in a relationship. Arie’s like, “Look, I’ve been in a relationship where I held someone back because she had dreams, but she felt like she needed to be by my side and supporting me.”Emma: It was such a burden for him.Brandi: Clearly. Barf.Claire: But at no point does it come up or seem to enter his mind that he could have at any point supported her dreams or even made compromises in the relationship. He’s just kind of annoyed that she had dreams that burdened him with guilt. So the options are: Date someone who has no needs outside of Arie, or date someone who has other dreams, force her to put them on the back burner and then set her free to pursue them.Brandi: Or date someone young enough to not have dreams yet and be willing to just be with him. Olivia: This weed farm [that contestant Bekah Martinez went to work on] is sounding better and better. Emma: Arie’s a real estate agent ― he could sell real estate in New York City! Olivia: He’d probably be more successful here!Claire: But how is he gonna see his parents literally every day?Brandi: Let’s talk about this, though. I feel like ― at least in the seasons I’ve seen ― everyone that goes on as the bachelor or the bachelorette, whoever they end up with moves. I feel like when you go on and you’re the one, it is expected.Emma: Especially if you’re a man.Brandi: But Bryan moved for Rachel, Jordan moved for Jojo. Claire: A lot of bachelorettes have moved in the past. But they’ve been a little more insistent in recent years. But I mean, come on, [Arie’s] life is so pathetic. It’s like, you really need someone to fit into your life selling real estate in Scottsdale, eating dinner with your parents every day? Wouldn’t you clutch at the opportunity to move to New York and try something new and support a smart woman? No, obviously not. But don’t worry, he doesn’t see her ambitions as a hindrance.Emma: Just an obstacle. Claire: Just an obstacle they’d have to get through.Emma: I was like, “Do you know what the meaning of the term obstacle is?”Olivia: Nope. He’s a joke.Claire: He’s just like, “I don’t want to say that they’d be an obstacle, but they would be an obstacle.” Just cuz you said it in two different words doesn’t mean you get credit. He wants to be so feminist, but his desires are so retrogressive.

54,BUSINESS,Solar Jobs Fell For The First Time In 7 Years In 2017. Now Trump Could Make It Worse.,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/solar-jobs-2017_us_5a78aa42e4b0d3df1d1438f0,The new tariffs the White House announced last month are likely to make things worse for the industry.,2018-02-07,"Andres Quiroz, an installer for Stellar Solar, carries a solar panel during installation at a home in Encinitas, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a78ab301d00003b6b6add8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of jobs in the solar industry decreased last year for the first time since 2010, and the Trump administration’s new import fees on solar panels are set to worsen the decline, according to a report released Wednesday. The industry’s job growth dipped 4 percent, a decrease of nearly 10,000 jobs, the Solar Foundation’s annual census found. Solar companies saw record-setting growth in 2016, and a slight drop was expected in 2017. But new tariffs imposed last month on the cheap, imported solar panels that fueled the solar boom are now expected to cause hiring to sputter. “It’s very likely there will be a slowdown in job growth, perhaps more job declines into 2018 and in 2019 as well,” Ed Gilliland, senior director at the Solar Foundation, told HuffPost. The findings mark a dramatic downturn for an industry that, just two years ago, created one in every 50 new jobs in the United States. In 2016, the industry employed 260,077 people, roughly 53 percent of whom were at companies that install solar panels. That number fell to 250,271 last year, though installation still made up 52 percent of jobs. Part of the reason for the decline is that few companies expected the Republican-controlled Congress to renew the federal investment tax credit at the end of 2015. That prompted a rush to build solar projects while the financial benefits were still in place, and, given the months it takes to develop and construct solar farms, the boom carried over into 2016.Cheap solar panels made overseas helped the solar industry grow 168 percent since 2010. But fears over new trade restrictions on those panels loomed large in 2017.In April, Suniva, a Georgia-based manufacturer owned by a Chinese company, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission after declaring bankruptcy, arguing that it was impossible to compete with imported prices. In May, SolarWorld, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel marker, joined the complaint. The companies requested that the Trump administration impose tariffs on panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the price of solar cells from about 33 cents to more than 78 cents per watt. Manufacturing made up the second-largest chunk of solar jobs since 2010, comprising roughly 15 percent of employment in both 2016 and 2017. The sector also suffered about 2 percent fewer job losses between 2016 and 2017 than installers. In August, a group of 27 solar manufacturers warned the International Trade Commission that tariffs “endanger[ed] manufacturing jobs at our factories,” and urged the agency to reject Suniva’s request.  “We have been building our companies to meet demand from a large and growing domestic solar market. That market is now under threat,” the companies wrote in an open letter. “As true U.S. solar manufacturers, and on behalf of our 5,700 workers, we ask that you not grant Suniva’s request for global safeguard measures.”But on Jan. 22, President Donald Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported panels, decreasing by 5 percent per year over four years. The fee was in line with what the International Trade Commission recommended in October, a proposal Suniva called “disappointing” because it was not as aggressive as what the company requested. Still, Suniva and SolarWorld executives “applauded” Trump in a joint statement, and urged him to increase the first-year tariff to 50 percent.Roughly half of all solar equipment used in the U.S. this year is expected to come from overseas. The new fees are forecast to send solar installations plummeting by 11 percent over the next five years, according to GTM Research, a renewable energy market data firm. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projected solar deployments to drop by 5 percent over seven years, owing to a predicted uptick in construction after the four-year tariff expires. But the previous rate of job growth is unlikely bounce back, as solar companies seek new ways to cut costs as panel prices rise. “There will be a recovery in how much solar is built and deployed. However, that won’t necessarily translate into jobs in the same way it has in the past,” Hugh Bromley, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told HuffPost. “The U.S. solar industry is begging for some labor efficiencies to be found to drive costs down to where they need to be to be competitive.” The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said the tariffs would lead to 23,000 job losses this year alone in both the solar installation and manufacturing sectors.“The tariff decision was unfortunate, we were disappointed in it, and it will have an unnecessary negative effect on solar deployment and employment,” Daniel Whitten, a spokesman for the SEIA, told HuffPost. “But in the years ahead solar is going to resume its place as the leading new source of electricity in this country. It’s just unfortunate that it’s been perhaps delayed by this tariff decision.” The Solar Foundation conducted its survey of 2,389 solar businesses ― some of which included various outposts of the same company ― in October and November, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ methodology to make 59,300 phone calls and send 35,000 emails. At this point, the White House’s impending decision on the trade case hung over the industry, and the survey responses reflect the uncertainty over the ruling, Gilliland said.Even in anticipation of the decision, the survey projected a 5.2 percent increase in jobs in 2018 to a record 263,293, with a 6.2 percent spike in installation and a 1 percent manufacturing bump.It’s unclear how much the tariffs will affect those outlooks in 2018, given that many projects have already purchased their building materials. But Gilliland said the fees could hurt all sectors.“If the prices go up instead of down, which could happen because of the trade case, then we very likely could see a fall off in installation jobs, and potentially even a falloff in manufacturing jobs as their installers are using less of the manufactured goods,” he said.It’s not all gloomy for the industry, however. Solar jobs increased in the District of Columbia and 29 states in 2017, including Utah, Minnesota, Arizona, Colorado, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Tennessee. States and cities emerged as vital counterbalances over the past year after Trump announced plans in June to withdraw from the Paris climate accord and proposed slashing funding for renewable energy.In July, mayors from 1,481 cities representing 148 million people and 41.8 percent of electricity use across the U.S. signed a pledge to go 100 percent renewable by 2035. California vowed to get 50 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030, and could now hit that target a decade early. New York set the same goal, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans last month to divest a $5 billion stake in fossil fuels from the city’s five pension funds and sue oil companies for damages related to sea-level rise.“What we’re seeing is many of the states are still setting renewable portfolio standards and setting goals for renewable energy,” Gilliland said. “So there’s very strong momentum toward renewable energy.”  Those regional policies caused diversity to increase in some parts of the solar workforce, and fall in others. Black representation climbed nearly 1 percent in 2017, largely due to the growth of jobs in areas with large black populations, such as the District of Columbia and several Southeastern states. But employment of Hispanics and Asians dipped 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, as states like California, Texas and Hawaii saw jobs contract in 2017. The number of women employed in solar fell 1.1 percent as jobs decreased in the sales and distribution sector, where most women in the industry work. The majority of Americans understand global warming is happening, and that humans are causing it, though partisan divides remain stark over how to address greenhouse gas emissions. Solar energy nonetheless enjoys sweeping support, with nine out of 10 U.S. adults in favor of expanding its use, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center poll. Solar capacity around the world is still on track to multiply 14 times over by 2040, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance study found last year.  “Overall the people and the country are very positive toward solar,” Gilliland said. “The long-term outlook is still very strong. But we will feel some headwinds over the next year.” "
55,BUSINESS,Solar Jobs Fell For The First Time In 7 Years In 2017. Now Trump Could Make It Worse.,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/solar-jobs-2017_us_5a78aa42e4b0d3df1d1438f0,The new tariffs the White House announced last month are likely to make things worse for the industry.,2018-02-07,Solar installation jobs made up the vast majority of employment in the industry. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a78abde1d00003b6b6add91.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The number of jobs in the solar industry decreased last year for the first time since 2010, and the Trump administration’s new import fees on solar panels are set to worsen the decline, according to a report released Wednesday. The industry’s job growth dipped 4 percent, a decrease of nearly 10,000 jobs, the Solar Foundation’s annual census found. Solar companies saw record-setting growth in 2016, and a slight drop was expected in 2017. But new tariffs imposed last month on the cheap, imported solar panels that fueled the solar boom are now expected to cause hiring to sputter. “It’s very likely there will be a slowdown in job growth, perhaps more job declines into 2018 and in 2019 as well,” Ed Gilliland, senior director at the Solar Foundation, told HuffPost. The findings mark a dramatic downturn for an industry that, just two years ago, created one in every 50 new jobs in the United States. In 2016, the industry employed 260,077 people, roughly 53 percent of whom were at companies that install solar panels. That number fell to 250,271 last year, though installation still made up 52 percent of jobs. Part of the reason for the decline is that few companies expected the Republican-controlled Congress to renew the federal investment tax credit at the end of 2015. That prompted a rush to build solar projects while the financial benefits were still in place, and, given the months it takes to develop and construct solar farms, the boom carried over into 2016.Cheap solar panels made overseas helped the solar industry grow 168 percent since 2010. But fears over new trade restrictions on those panels loomed large in 2017.In April, Suniva, a Georgia-based manufacturer owned by a Chinese company, filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission after declaring bankruptcy, arguing that it was impossible to compete with imported prices. In May, SolarWorld, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel marker, joined the complaint. The companies requested that the Trump administration impose tariffs on panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the price of solar cells from about 33 cents to more than 78 cents per watt. Manufacturing made up the second-largest chunk of solar jobs since 2010, comprising roughly 15 percent of employment in both 2016 and 2017. The sector also suffered about 2 percent fewer job losses between 2016 and 2017 than installers. In August, a group of 27 solar manufacturers warned the International Trade Commission that tariffs “endanger[ed] manufacturing jobs at our factories,” and urged the agency to reject Suniva’s request.  “We have been building our companies to meet demand from a large and growing domestic solar market. That market is now under threat,” the companies wrote in an open letter. “As true U.S. solar manufacturers, and on behalf of our 5,700 workers, we ask that you not grant Suniva’s request for global safeguard measures.”But on Jan. 22, President Donald Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported panels, decreasing by 5 percent per year over four years. The fee was in line with what the International Trade Commission recommended in October, a proposal Suniva called “disappointing” because it was not as aggressive as what the company requested. Still, Suniva and SolarWorld executives “applauded” Trump in a joint statement, and urged him to increase the first-year tariff to 50 percent.Roughly half of all solar equipment used in the U.S. this year is expected to come from overseas. The new fees are forecast to send solar installations plummeting by 11 percent over the next five years, according to GTM Research, a renewable energy market data firm. Bloomberg New Energy Finance projected solar deployments to drop by 5 percent over seven years, owing to a predicted uptick in construction after the four-year tariff expires. But the previous rate of job growth is unlikely bounce back, as solar companies seek new ways to cut costs as panel prices rise. “There will be a recovery in how much solar is built and deployed. However, that won’t necessarily translate into jobs in the same way it has in the past,” Hugh Bromley, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told HuffPost. “The U.S. solar industry is begging for some labor efficiencies to be found to drive costs down to where they need to be to be competitive.” The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said the tariffs would lead to 23,000 job losses this year alone in both the solar installation and manufacturing sectors.“The tariff decision was unfortunate, we were disappointed in it, and it will have an unnecessary negative effect on solar deployment and employment,” Daniel Whitten, a spokesman for the SEIA, told HuffPost. “But in the years ahead solar is going to resume its place as the leading new source of electricity in this country.

The Lansing State Journal reported on Tuesday that the sheriff’s office said “there are new people coming forward” with complaints against the former U.S. Olympic coach. The department said it could not comment about the details of the complaints as the investigation was ongoing. Neither Geddert nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Geddert was the head coach for the women’s gymnastics team during the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 London Olympics. He owned two training centers where Nassar worked and was reportedly very close with the disgraced physician, who has been accused by over 265 women of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar repeatedly molested many young girls at Geddert’s training center Twistars. USA Gymnastics suspended Geddert in January amid Nassar’s highly publicized sentencing hearings. A few hours later, Geddert announced his retirement. Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Additionally, he is serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.During Nassar’s sentencing hearings, dozens of survivors accused Geddert of being physically and verbally abusive, with some saying he must have known about Nassar’s abuse. “My mother once told me ‘If a boyfriend ever treats you the way John does, leave him,’” survivor Annie Labrie said during her victim impact statement. At least one athlete said in her victim impact statement that Geddert walked into the room while Nassar was molesting her.Geddert and Nassar first began working together at the Great Lakes Gymnastics Club. Later, in 1996, Geddert brought Nassar on to work at the gym he currently owns, Twistars USA Gymnastics Club. Geddert was competitive and was borderline abusive, verbally and physically, to gymnasts, according to Outside the Lines. “John’s very good at emotional manipulation. He can make you feel like nothing very quickly,” former office manager at Twistars, Priscilla Kintigh, told Outside the Lines. “Larry was the one to calm the girls down when they had a practice with John.” "

Mike Revis, 27, defeated his Republican opponent in a special election Tuesday by 3 percentage points. The 97th District in Jefferson County went for Trump in the presidential election by 28 points. The area is historically Democratic but has recently tilted Republican. In other words, the district has swung 31 percentage points toward Democrats since Trump won last year. “Rep.-elect Mike Revis’s victory tonight will undoubtedly send another shockwave through the GOP as we continue to run the best candidates focused on addressing local issues and improving their neighbors’ quality of life,” said Jessica Post, executive director of a group dedicated to electing Democrats at the state level. “The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee continues to be impressed by our dedicated and talented slate of candidates, who have stepped up to run in these precedent-setting special elections.”Revis is a procurement manager at Anheuser-Busch Inbev. He ran against Republican David Linton, 59, who stressed his opposition to abortion rights and his support for the Second Amendment.In addition to the 35 state legislative seats Democrats have picked up, they have also flipped the governorship in New Jersey and a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama. Republicans, meanwhile, have flipped four state legislative seats from blue to red during Trump’s tenure. Last month, Democrats also picked up a seat in Wisconsin’s state Senate, where Democrat Patty Schachtner defeated her opponent by 11 percentage points, taking a seat Republicans had held since 2001. The district was solidly red: Trump won by 17 percentage points in 2016, and Republican Mitt Romney won it in 2012. The Republican incumbent state senator won her re-election race in 2016 by 26 points. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) called the results a “wake-up call” for his party, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Republicans certainly needed to “pay attention” to the results. "
59,POLITICS,Don't Worry About Trump The Fascist. Trump The Inept Will Save Us.,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-fascist-inept_us_5a7a2bade4b06505b4e8ffb8,Or so his critics keep hoping.,2018-02-07,That's the good news for those who fear Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7a2d5d2100003900600692.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― First, the dark clouds for those worried about fascism in America: President Donald Trump has adopted a phrase used in Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany to attack the free press. He has reportedly demanded loyalty to himself, rather than to the Constitution, from top law enforcement officials. Most recently, he called political opponents “treasonous” for failing to applaud him ― a tactic also used by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.Now, the silver lining, according to some of his fiercest critics: Trump has neither the cunning nor the self-discipline to set himself up as a truly authoritarian leader.“He’s too incompetent to be a successful fascist,” said Eliot Cohen, a top State Department official under President George W. Bush, who nonetheless called Trump’s latest remarks “extraordinarily reckless.”Trump made the “treason” comments at a Monday speech in Cincinnati, where he was supposed to be taking credit for the strong economy. He appeared to go off script to complain about the Democrats who did not clap for him at his State of the Union speech last week.“They were like death and un-American. Un-American,” he said, and then playing to the audience, added: “Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”Treason is a specific crime defined in the Constitution and the U.S. criminal code as levying war against the nation or giving aid and comfort to the enemy. It is punishable by death.The White Office scrambled Tuesday to downplay Trump’s comment, with press officers explaining that his remark was “tongue in cheek” and then trying to shift the blame to the Democrats for allegedly wanting the country to do badly just so it would reflect poorly on Trump.“The president was clearly joking with his comments,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at Tuesday’s daily press briefing.But since becoming president, Trump has not just flung the word “treason” at congressional Democrats who didn’t applaud him enough. In a Wall Street Journal interview last month, he described the FBI agent who had expressed critical views of him in text messages in 2016 the same way. “That is a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act,” Trump said.Those accusations follow Trump’s labeling the news media as “the enemy of the American People.” That turn of phrase was used in Adolf Hitler’s Germany and Josef Stalin’s Russia to attack critics, often with fatal results.Since he took office, Trump has also demanded personal “loyalty” from top FBI and Justice Department officials – a dramatic abandonment of the modern idea that those agencies should operate with a degree of independence.This leadership style, critics say, is more in line with that of a mafia don or a dictator than the president of the United States.“We’re dealing with someone with clear authoritarian tendencies,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor and expert on Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. While the United States of today is a very different country than Italy of the 1920s and there is no fascist movement here per se, she suggested that Trump’s behaviors are reminiscent of Mussolini’s.“He clearly would like to rule by executive fiat,” Ben-Ghiat said of the American president. “He attacks those sectors of society who deal with facts, like the press and the judiciary.”Republicans who support Trump argue that his opponents are taking his words too literally.“Pure Trumpism. Nothing to worry about,” said one top Republican National Committee member, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the president candidly.“He obviously gets into trouble when he goes off script,” said a GOP consultant, who similarly spoke on condition of anonymity. “He doesn’t understand how government works. He has a limited vocabulary. He doesn’t do nuance.”The consultant added that he doubted Trump would be able to change his behavior much, at this point in his life. “It’s hard to get someone 71 years old to change. It’s like trying to convince a dog to fly.”Plus, “he’s not someone who admits mistakes,” the consultant said. “Combine that with a lack of knowledge of history and a limited vocabulary, and you run into problems.”One British historian agrees that Trump’s opponents are overreacting to what he acknowledges are the president’s “fascist impulses.”“Trump will be removed either after two years or six years, and that will be the end of Trumpism,” said Roger Griffin of Oxford Brookes University. “I wish people would talk less about Trump than the glories of the American constitution that prevents him from acting like a tin-pot dictator.”Making inflammatory comments is not the same thing as acting on them, Griffin added. “It will be a bad day for American democracy when Trump actually proposes making not clapping treasonous and the judiciary allows it,” he said. “Then we can start worrying.”But to Cohen, who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, ignoring Trump’s provocations carries its own risks. “By destroying norms, he’s opening the door for others who would be better at being fascists,” Cohen said.And Robert Paxton, a Columbia University historian and author of The Anatomy of Fascism, said that while he agrees Trump is too incompetent to become a true authoritarian ― the president has proven unable to mobilize Congress to support most of his professed priorities, for example ― he could still do great damage to the country on a whim.“If he wants to conduct a military strike, he doesn’t need to mobilize anybody,” Paxton said. “I don’t take total reassurance from his incompetence.”"

Could it provide Trump cover to end the Mueller probe?,2018-02-07,"Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has been calling the FBI the ""shadow government.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a79f2d81d00003b6b6adfa1.jpeg?cache=1OMmAFQKFE&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Here’s an extraordinary claim that Fox News viewers have been hearing in recent days: The second-in-command at the Justice Department, the Republican law enforcement veteran whom President Donald Trump tapped to become deputy attorney general, threatened the Republican members of Congress investigating his department. He might be guilty of a crime.Big, if true.Gregg Jarrett ― a Fox News legal analyst who has recently taken to calling the FBI “America’s secret police” and the “shadow government” while calling Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation “illegitimate and corrupt” ― has recently begun telling Fox News viewers that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein threatened members of Congress.Jarrett has claimed that a “highly reliable congressional source” told him that Rosenstein “used the power of his office to threaten members of Congress” by threatening to subpoena their texts and emails during a Jan. 10 meeting with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and others.A dubious claim from a cable news analyst isn’t normally worth dwelling on. But with the Fox News-addicted president indicating he wants Rosenstein gone and Mueller’s special counsel investigation, which Rosenstein oversees, ended, Jarrett’s claim could wind up in the presidential Twitter feed at any moment. It might even give Trump the excuse he wants to fire Rosenstein, the Republican the president has previously suggested he believes is a Democrat.In an environment where most of Trump’s supporters already buy into the notion that the FBI is biased against Trump, Jarrett’s allegations against Rosenstein ― along with attacks from Fox host Sean Hannity and members of Congress ― could continue to sour public opinion of Rosenstein, who was well respected on both sides of the aisle before Trump made him deputy attorney general on April 26. He is in control of the Russia investigation, from which Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself.A recent survey showed that of Trump voters who had heard about Nunes’ memo alleging misconduct at the highest levels of the Justice Department and the FBI, 56 percent said they got at least some of their information from cable TV, and 95 percent of that group said they watched Fox News. Jarrett’s allegation about Rosenstein has been repeated on Gateway Pundit, World Net Daily and other right-wing sites. Conservative blogs like Hot Air and RedState, on the other hand, have treated Jarrett’s reporting with a great deal of skepticism. The president’s oldest son has promoted it on his Twitter feed.The Justice Department would not comment on Jarrett’s allegations against Rosenstein. Sessions, who has gently defended the Justice Department as a whole as it has come under attack from his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, said last week that Rosenstein represents the “kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.”It’s certainly possible that Rosenstein mentioned members’ texts and emails. But it’s tough to imagine a scenario in which the deputy attorney general would actually threaten to subpoena the text messages of members of Congress who were investigating the Justice Department. At the time of the reported meeting on Jan. 10, members of Congress were zeroing in on text messages exchanged by two FBI employees who were having an affair. Lawmakers, focused on the idea that the “deep state” was out to get Trump, would later investigate “secret society” texts that were obviously a joke. Nunes doesn’t seem interested in clarifying or shooting down incendiary reports being aired during Fox News’ prime-time block. Nunes appeared on Hannity on Monday night, claiming that the Hillary Clinton campaign had “colluded with the Russians.” A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to a request for comment.The airing Fox News has given to Jarrett’s initially single-sourced claim about the deputy attorney general raises a broader issue with Fox News’ coverage of the Justice Department, which suffered a big blow when Bret Baier falsely reported on a “likely indictment” of Clinton just ahead of the 2016 election. (Baier subsequently apologized.)These days, the most explosive and unsubstantiated claims getting aired on Fox News aren’t coming from its national security reporters, such as Catherine Herridge. Instead, they’re coming from figures like Jarrett and Fox News contributor Sara Carter, who appears to be in close contact with the House Intelligence Committee and currently posts her stories on SaraACarter.com. Neither typically appears on the programs Fox News considers hard news.Last week, after the release of the Nunes memo, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) accused Rosenstein and other Justice Department officials of treason. So if Republicans really are accusing the deputy attorney general of the United States of committing a criminal act during a meeting with them, it’s pretty clear the knives are out for Rosenstein ― even if they’re really dull.Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

A summary of Cornell University’s Interfraternity Council’s findings, posted to the school’s website, now reads that “the Review Board did not have evidence and therefore did not find that any individual associated with the chapter had in fact acted on such encouragement or that the contest had actually occurred,” noting that the summary had previously “mischaracterized the findings of the Review Board, including the role of the chapter.”Previously:A Cornell University fraternity conducted a game in which new members competed to have sex with the most women ― and additional points were granted in the event of a tie to the contestant who had intercourse with a woman weighing the most, a school investigation revealed recently.The university’s Fraternity and Sorority Review Board placed Zeta Beta Tau, which called its contest a “pig roast,” on probation for two years because of its misconduct last spring. The ruling also mandated that it hire a “live-in advisor” and receive ongoing education on sexual violence. Most of the chapter will also have to attend two events during Cornell’s Sexual Assault Awareness Week in April.Ryan Lombardi, vice president for student and campus life, said in a statement the school emailed to HuffPost on Wednesday that ZBT’s actions were “abhorrent to me and antithetical to our values as a community.”“Behavior that degrades and dehumanizes women contributes to a climate and culture of tolerance for sexual violence,” he said. “While sanctions have been levied against this fraternity by the Fraternity and Sorority Review Board, the campus community will be watching to see whether the members of ZBT ― as individuals and as a group ― live up to their public pledge to demonstrate ‘through our actions that this inexcusable behavior will not be tolerated.’”ZBT’s Cornell chapter said on Facebook Saturday that the activities “were neither chapter sanctioned activities, nor ones that brothers were aware of. We, too, are in disbelief and even more so that these alleged actions may have been taken by those whom we called brothers.”The post says the chapter will review its membership and expel anyone not meeting its standards.“The allegations described are contrary to the values that Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity espouses and works in direct conflict with the beliefs and mission of the Kappa Chapter,” it wrote. “Our chapter has worked closely with the Zeta Beta Tau International Headquarters to draft and execute an action plan that addresses this alleged behavior.”"
66,POLITICS,San Francisco Could Become The First U.S. City With Safe Injection Sites For Drug Users,Antonia Blumberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-safe-injection-sites_us_5a7b4494e4b0c6726e0ea459,"The facilities could open as soon as this summer, city officials say.",2018-02-07,"Safe injection sites already exist in Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b45051e00002c007ab01d.jpeg?cache=GIyyKb8XI5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"San Francisco is planning to open two safe injection sites this summer, which city health officials say could help get drug users off the streets into enclosed, supervised centers.Similar facilities already exist in Canada, Australia and several European countries. And Philadelphia officials in January announced their support for a safe injection sites program. But the San Francisco sites, poised to open as soon as July, would become the first of their kind in the United States.A task force comprised of public health officials, doctors and advocates has been working since last year to make the sites a reality. Now, city officials say they are just months away from opening the first two safe injection sites of what may some day be a city-wide phenomenon.Barbara Garcia, director of San Francisco’s Department of Public Health, said two nonprofits already operating needle exchange programs will be selected to open the safe injection sites at their facilities, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday. Garcia said the sites would likely open close to July 1, the start of the city’s fiscal year, and would be privately funded to avoid liability on the city’s part.Intravenous drug use is illegal under state and federal law.The streets of San Francisco, particularly in parts of the Tenderloin, South of Market, and Mission neighborhoods, are often littered with discarded needles. It’s common to see people openly shooting up on sidewalks, in public parks and at public transit system locations. In just one month last year, city officials collected more than 13,000 discarded syringes in the streets, according to The Associated Press. That was up from roughly 2,900 in the same month of the previous year.It’s unclear what led to the spike in discarded syringes, though heroin use has been on the rise in San Francisco and throughout the U.S. in recent years. Health officials have warned that the syringes could create a public health crisis, putting passersby at risk of contracting blood-borne diseases like hepatitis and HIV. Other efforts ― including a longstanding needle exchange program and several large kiosks installed by public health officials for needle drops ― have aimed to reduce the waste. But officials say the safe injection sites are the next step in curbing the problem.“The intent is not to promote or encourage drug use,” London Breed, president of the Board of Supervisors and a vocal supporter of the safe injection site plan, told the Chronicle last year. “The intent is to provide a site that’s not out on the streets, where people more than likely will just throw their needles on the ground.”Officials say they believe 85 percent of the city’s roughly 22,000 intravenous drug users would use the sites, according to the Chronicle.A majority of San Francisco residents are in favor of the project. A poll conducted for the Chamber of Commerce in January found that 67 percent of voters in the city support the plan to open safe injection sites. Still, the sites could face legal obstacles, and legislation to protect the facilities and those associated with them from prosecution has stalled in the state Senate. But Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener said the plan should move forward regardless.“I’m fully supportive of the city moving forward, just like we did with needle exchange before it was technically legal,” Wiener told the Chronicle. “We need to do everything in our power to keep people healthy, to get people off the streets so they’re injecting in a safe space indoors instead of on people’s doorsteps or in public parks, and to make sure we can intervene quickly if they overdose.”"
67,POLITICS,Everything You Should Know About The Stock Market,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stock-market-matters_us_5a7b4964e4b044b38218a49e,"The market matters, for the wrong reasons.",2018-02-07,Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Feb. 6 during a wild day of market swings.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7b4a87210000390060085c.jpeg?cache=KdNGFZ4DlF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Anyone who studies The Wealth Of Nations hoping to glean insights on the mysteries and mechanics of the stock market will be disappointed. Adam Smith didn’t discuss stock exchanges anywhere in the 1,100-plus pages of his foundational capitalist treatise. Nor did Karl Marx feel compelled to include the stock market among the damning contradictions and irrationalities of the capitalist system documented in Das Kapital. The bestselling economics textbook ever written ― Paul Samuelson’s adventurously titled Economics ― devotes just five of its 608 pages to the stock market, drawing the unhelpful conclusion: “Anyone who can accurately predict the future course of business will prosper, but there is no such person.”Yet nothing captivates Americans like the stock market. We gape at the great fortunes won and lost on the exchanges, and broadcast the Dow Jones’ minor movements on the nightly news. This week’s wild swings in the market have alternately thrilled and alarmed us.The stock market is a good story ― one of the best. But it doesn’t mean what most people think it does. The stock market is not an important measure of national well-being, productive capacity or material wealth. It isn’t even a reliable gauge for the health of specific companies, and is only tangentially related to helping them raise capital. The most iconic contemporary capitalist institution is, in truth, inessential to the operation of capitalism itself. The stock market, in the words of the late British economist John Maynard Keynes, is merely “the outcome of the mass psychology of a large number of ignorant individuals.”The basics: A stock exchange is where people go to buy and sell shares of corporations. Buying stock gives you an ownership stake in a company, but this stake itself has no inherent value. It doesn’t entitle you to proceeds from the firm’s earnings, or provide you with a stream of revenue. The stock is worth whatever you can get somebody else to pay for it. Companies issue stock to raise money for personnel, equipment, research and everything else that goes into providing goods and services. But after the stock is issued, its price is no longer directly involved in corporate finance. A company doesn’t see any additional revenue when its stock price increases, or lose cash when it falls. Stock prices are determined by bidders in the stock market ― whatever a willing buyer and seller agree on ― and the profits and losses on stock accrue to those speculators.We like to think that stock prices are closely connected to events in the real world, and that the values the market assigns are the concrete, reliable assessments of experts. As the market has rocketed this way and that this week, the commentariat has scrambled into action to explain the deeper meaning. Money magazine attributed Monday’s sell-off to new inflation data. MarketWatch told its readers to keep their eye on the yield curve of Treasury bonds. The Guardian, with a bit more precision, explained that investors expect higher interest rates from the Fed. But none of this is really true. When Keynes bemoaned the ignorance of stock traders more than 80 years ago, he wasn’t insulting their education. He was pointing out that any precise value judgments about a company’s future prospects require knowledge of the future ― something nobody possesses. A fall in oil prices might signal a profit boost for a shipping company, but not if political instability disrupts its trade route. The meaning and value of each new piece of data that traders evaluate is dependent on a flood of unknowable future data.The point is that stock traders don’t respond to new information, they respond to each other. When they bid on stock prices, traders aren’t stating their beliefs about the “true” value of a company, but making inferences about how to play the reactions of other traders, who, in turn, are doing the same thing. When corporate earnings come in unexpectedly high, traders expect the stock to go up and bid accordingly. It has very little to do with a company’s long-term or even near-term prospects. It’s just what people do.This means that the value of a company’s stock, while based on an enormous amount of information, is inherently unstable and essentially arbitrary. At the moment, a lot of people believe that the stock market is “overvalued” ― although this idea itself wrongly assumes there is some “real” stock market value that the market has pulled away from. Years of low interest rates from the Federal Reserve have discouraged people from buying interest-bearing bonds and spurred purchases of stock instead. When the GOP cut corporate taxes, it created the prospect of companies paying out dividends to shareholders or buying back stock to drive up the price. The Fed is now steadily raising interest rates, and plenty of stock experts think traders have gotten a little carried away with tax-cut enthusiasm. And so, while the economic data is pretty good, there is a consensus in some quarters that the market is due for dip.This doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the real world, so more cautious economic analysts like Neil Irwin at The New York Times urge their readers to focus not on stock price swings, but on economic “fundamentals” ― things like employment, wages and interest rates ― in assessing the country’s economic prospects. And if the stock market were, in fact, nothing more than a lightly regulated casino, this would be the end of the story. But over the past half-century, we have instead imbued the stock market with an almost cosmic significance. We use stock prices to evaluate the performance of corporate executives. Business schools teach aspiring young men and women that “shareholder value” is the only appropriate pursuit for corporate leaders. Because the business world believes stock prices reflect deep metaphysical truths about the state of commerce, big movements in the stock market do, in fact, affect real-world decisions about trade. Even if its revenues are strong, a company might pull back on major investments in the face of a declining stock market, worried about pessimism over corporate prospects in general. Bankers looking at a stock slump might decide to withhold loans from perfectly responsible businesses. Even if it’s an ideal time to upgrade its equipment or expand its operations, a company might decide to be tight-fisted about expenses to prove its fiscal discipline to shareholders when the stock price is low.Most alarming, we have made the financial security of the elderly almost completely dependent on stock market values by making 401k plans and mutual funds the flagship operations of our retirement system. The value of your nest egg is dependent not on your thrift or prudence, but on when you happen to invest, and when you need to cash out. But even with that, only about half of all Americans own stock, either directly or indirectly through retirement accounts. And the vast majority of stocks ― over 86 percent, according to People’s Policy Project President Matt Bruenig ― are owned by the richest 10 percent of households. To the extent that the strange casino of the stock market does, in fact, create wealth, it almost exclusively circulates it among the rich.The idea of using proceeds from business wealth to secure the well-being of society at large is, however, a good one. Instead of tying wealth to the speculative whims of the stock market, we might bind it directly to the productive activities of business. Instead of having individuals save for retirement by purchasing stock, we could have companies that are turning a profit pay a special dividend into a public fund. We could even call it a tax."

Anthony Weiner’s contacts with the promise of more to come. The most popular theory is that the leak was perpetrated by a rogue FBI agent.You can see the appeal of such a narrative to the modern conspiracist mindset: some lone G-man, defying the Trotskyist takeover of the bureau and owning the libs by revealing some phone numbers.Unfortunately for them, it’s bullshit. The contacts that were released are actually from the original Guccifer hack of longtime Clinton family confidant Sidney Blumenthal in 2013. This specific list has been online since at least August 2016. The list features phone numbers and email addresses for names like George Soros, John Podesta and Hillary Clinton, some of our right-wing keyboard warriors’ favorite recurring characters. The tweet below appears to be the first claim that these contacts originated with Weiner:People quickly jumped on it as a sign of ... something. The website Squawker.com seemed particularly confident that this list came from Weiner, though it gave no indication of why, writing:It’s important to note that we are not trying to “witch hunt” anyone, and this information is not meant for you to do the same. We are not interested in doxxing these individuals, rather we are interested in reporting on the doxxing list that was released, potentially by a rogue FBI agent. This laptop is under FBI surveillance and the reason we know this is because they found emails sent between him and Hillary Clinton back when the email scandal was all anyone ever talked about. Who else but someone in the FBI would have released this? We aren’t saying that it’s definitely a member of the FBI, but who else could possibly be responsible? Twitter, of course, ran with it.Reddit, too, was gleeful over this supposed triumph.Some of the users pointed to the fact that the contact list had already been discussed on 4chan. While 4chan did revel in the supposed Weiner leak Tuesday night, the site was equally delighted in 2016, when the exact same contact list popped up in a thread.That discussion was archived in full by automated 4chan crawler Holla Forums, but we’ve included a few choice bits below.(For those blissfully unaware, the users in the middle are expressing their delight with the leak.)Not everyone was immediately swayed. In both the Reddit and 4chan discussions, people point to the fact that the list seems identical to the one released by Guccifer in 2016. But those few glimmers of reason are vastly outnumbered by the celebrations of yet another supposed triumph over the left.The original file, which was posted on the site Cryptome, and the one currently being passed around are, to repeat, identical. So unless Weiner and Blumenthal knew all the same people (likely) and absolutely no one else (nearly impossible), it appears that, somehow, right-wing internet conspiracy theorists got this one wrong. Reader, we’re as shocked as you. "

71,POLITICS,Trump's Climate-Denying Coal Lobbyist Nominee Inches Closer To EPA’s No. 2 Job,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/andrew-wheeler-epa_us_5a78dc2ce4b0164659c73e97,Andrew Wheeler's confirmation would be a testament to how extreme other nominees have been.,2018-02-06,"Andrew Wheeler, nominated to be EPA deputy administrator, appeared before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on Nov. 8.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a791ed62d00004900943d37.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Andrew Wheeler, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be Environmental Protection Agency deputy administrator, appeared poised and polished at his Senate confirmation hearing in November. He couched his objections to widely accepted climate science in ambiguous legalese, and kept his cool when, at the same hearing, Kathleen Hartnett-White, the president’s pick for the Council on Environmental Quality, flamed out, stammering over questions of basic science. On Saturday, the White House announced plans to pull Hartnett-White’s nomination amid waning Republican support. But on Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted 11 to 10 along party lines to advance Wheeler’s nomination, putting him one step from the EPA’s No. 2 job.The restraint that steeled Wheeler’s nomination seems likely to clear the way for his confirmation. Unlike other Trump nominees whose outrageous opinions or lack of qualifications put them on the political fringe, Wheeler boasts both the Beltway aesthetic and the experience needed to become a powerful EPA operator. His confirmation, critics fear, will speed the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental and public health protections, and make a lasting, if quieter, impact. “It’s very alarming and distressing,” Mary Anne Hitt, a campaign director at the Sierra Club, told HuffPost. “He is right up there with the list of the most extreme people that Trump has nominated for any agency.”Wheeler, a coal lobbyist and former legislative aide to Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), is widely seen as having the relationships and finesse needed to avoid legal potholes while driving the EPA’s deregulatory agenda. He knows how to work the system from within, having spent four years working at the EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He said the right things to woo critics at his confirmation hearing, calling EPA staffers “the most dedicated and hard-working employees in the federal government.” “The mission of the EPA to protect human health and the environment is critical to our country and its citizens and something that I take very seriously and I know you do, too,” Wheeler said.The EPA did not respond to HuffPost’s request to interview Wheeler, and directed questions about his nomination to the Senate committee. Faegre Baker Daniels, the law firm where Wheeler currently works, directed HuffPost to the EPA. “Andrew will bring extraordinary credentials to EPA that will greatly assist the Agency as we work to implement our agenda,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said when Wheeler was nominated in October. “He has spent his entire career working to improve environmental outcomes for Americans across the country and understands the importance of providing regularity certainty for our country.”Wheeler won approval from the Senate panel last year, but his nomination never came to the full chamber for a final confirmation vote. His nomination was returned to the committee as a matter of procedure when the new legislative session began last month. If Wheeler has anything stacked against him, it could be a 2016 Facebook post he wrote calling Trump a “bully” who “hasn’t been that successful” in business and who “has more baggage then all the other Republican candidates combined.” The remarks, surfaced in October by The Washington Post, gained new relevance this month after reporters unearthed two 2016 radio interviews in which Pruitt called Trump a “bully” and an “empty vessel” on “the Constitution and rule of law.”On Wednesday morning, The Intercept published a report detailing fundraisers Wheeler held for Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Inhofe in May. The Sierra Club called on the Senate panel to delay the vote and open an investigation. But that didn’t deter Republicans, who held the vote on schedule, even as many federal employees delayed morning activities by two hours because of snow. “He’ll do a good job and I’m glad he’s going to be confirmed,” Inhofe said after Wednesday’s vote.Wheeler is likely to be confirmed in the full Senate, where the GOP holds a narrow majority. No Republicans publicly oppose him, and Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) ― who generally vote with the GOP on fossil fuel issues ― are likely to vote for Wheeler. Neither senator responded to requests for comment on Monday.To boot, Democrats have already spent political capital to upend more egregious environmental nominations. Those include Hartnett-White ― who credited coal with abolishing slavery and suggested increased carbon dioxide emissions were good for the planet ― and Michael Dourson, whose consultancy was described in 2014 by InsideClimate News as the “one-stop science shop” favored by the chemical and tobacco industries seeking affirmative research. Pruitt picked Dourson to lead the EPA’s chemical safety division, but withdraw the nomination in December after two Republican senators said they would not vote for him. Democrats seem more at ease with Wheeler’s nomination. No Democrat raised concerns about Wheeler last week during Pruitt’s first Senate hearing since taking office, though no Democrat voted for Wheeler on Wednesday. The choice of Wheeler is itself a naked gift to the coal industry, which has yielded outsized influence over the Trump White House. Wheeler lobbied on behalf of coal mining giant Murray Energy as recently as last year, disclosure filings show.“This is the swamp,” Sen. Jeff Merkley said at Wednesday’s hearing. “This does not serve the American people. And we should reject this nomination.”The company’s bombastic chief executive, Bob Murray, already has played a major role in shaping Trump administration energy and environmental policies. Last month, Murray’s so-called “action plan,” became public. The proposals include a federal bailout of coal-fired plants, repeal of the Clean Power Plan and reopening of the 2009 EPA “endangerment finding” that determined carbon dioxide pollution poses a risk to public health.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in a break with the White House, rejected the bailout plan. Pruitt announced his repeal of the Clean Power Plan, a suite of rules to reduce emissions from power plants, in October. But the administration’s decision on the so-called endangerment finding is up in the air. Despite calls from ardent climate-change deniers to reopen the finding, overturning the conclusion would require disproving the science behind human-caused climate change in court ― an extremely unlikely prospect. Pruitt said last week that he had not yet decided whether to challenge the finding.Wheeler could be the man to lead that assault. In October, Pruitt railed against the endangerment finding for citing the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In what appeared to be a dog whistle to nationalists, he claimed the endangerment finding “represents, and this is the first time in history this has ever occurred, this agency took work product of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and adopted it, transferred it to this agency and used that as the basis, underpinnings, of the endangerment finding.”In reality, the technical support document on the endangerment finding references more than 100 published scientific studies and cites peer-reviewed syntheses of climate research by the White House’s Global Change Research Program, the National Research Council of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and the U.N.’s IPCC.But the criticism echoes Wheeler’s own suggestions. In March 2010, he accused the IPCC of blurring “the lines between science and advocacy” and functioning “more as a political body than a scientific body.” He suggested the EPA could “reconsider its endangerment finding without almost exclusively relying upon the IPCC,” according to remarks posted to his website.“I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but what’s not completely understood is what the impact is,” Wheeler said at his confirmation hearing when aggressively questioned about the findings of the federal government’s latest climate report. Wheeler’s Senate career gives pause to environmentalists, too. Inhofe, who serves on the Senate panel voting on his nomination, is one of the most ardent climate-change deniers in Congress. In 2015, the Oklahoma Republican brought a snowball to the Senate floor in a comically flamboyant attempt to prove climate change is a hoax. Inhofe is a close ally of Pruitt, who is said to be considering a bid for his seat when the 83-year-old senator retires. Pruitt’s ambitions raise the prospect that Wheeler could, as The New Republic pointed out, become the next EPA administrator. “Andrew Wheeler’s nomination is very much in keeping with the Trump administration’s agenda of fossil fuel exploitation and climate inaction,” Michael Mann, a climatologist at Penn State University and co-author of a book on climate change denialism, told HuffPost. “The environmental community’s celebration of the failed nomination of climate-change denier Kathleen Hartnett-White to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality may be short-lived.”This article has been updated with Wednesday’s approval of Wheeler’s nomination by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

73,POLITICS,Some On Trump's Legal Team Want Him To Refuse An Interview With Mueller: Report,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-lawyers-trump-mueller_us_5a7901d0e4b0164659c75439,Some of the president's attorneys are afraid he'd make a misstep.,2018-02-06,"John Dowd, Trump's top personal attorney, has reportedly warned the president against agreeing to an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7904de2d00001f00943d22.jpeg?cache=EcrVvFaEG3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Several of President Donald Trump’s lawyers have advised him to refuse an interview request with special counsel Robert Mueller as part of the ongoing inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, The New York Times reported on Monday.At least two members of Trump’s legal team, John Dowd and Jay Sekulow, have reportedly expressed concerns over an investigators’ interview of the president. The lawyers, as well as several White House aides, fear that the president might contradict himself or make a false statement to investigators, which is a federal crime, the Times writes, citing four people familiar with the White House’s thinking.HuffPost has reached out to the White House for comment.Earlier this year, several news outlets reported that Mueller had told Trump’s lawyers he would move to interview the president, although no formal request had been submitted. His legal team was considering how such an encounter would take place, according to NBC News, including the format, the topics of the interview and who would conduct it.Were Trump to refuse the request, Mueller has the power to issue a subpoena to compel him to testify before a grand jury, although such a move would likely set off an intense legal battle.The special counsel’s office has conducted a series of interviews with high-profile members of Trump’s inner circle in recent weeks, including several former campaign officials. Mueller’s team spoke to Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January, and the president’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, has been cooperating with investigators for months.Trump’s many lawyers have frequently butted heads about the approach to the Mueller investigation, as they represent a slew of different interests when it comes to Trump the president and Trump the individual. Dowd and Sekulow are paid directly by Trump to defend his interests, while White House special counsel Ty Cobb and White House counsel Don McGahn are tasked with defending the executive branch itself.The reports about the lawyers’ thinking comes just weeks after the president said he was “looking forward” to speaking with Mueller under oath and that he would like to do so “as soon as possible.” Trump made the comments to a pool of reporters at the White House as he was preparing to leave for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 24.Cobb immediately moved to downplay the comments in a statement at the time, saying they were made off-the-cuff.“He’s ready to meet with them, but he’ll be guided by the advice of his personal counsel,” Cobb said.The Times reported Monday that Cobb was one of the few aides in the West Wing who thought the president should cooperate with Mueller. The Times also noted the lawyer had repeatedly told Trump the inquiry would end soon. But those interviewed by the outlet said such assurances were simply a strategy to keep the president from slamming the investigation on Twitter."

The Papua New Guinea (PNG) Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that the arrangement breached the country’s constitution and ordered the detention center to close. In 2017 the Australian government agreed to pay $70 million in compensation to about 1,900 asylum seekers detained on Manus over the years but simply moved the detainees ― all men ― to new facilities after the old center was shut down.Although those deemed to be legitimate refugees are allowed to settle in the PNG community as normal residents, those found to not be refugees are held in a separate, newly built facility called Hillside House and have been pressured to return to their home countries, which include Iran, Somalia and Sudan. Most of the men on Manus have been found to be legitimate refugees by agencies including the United Nations, but some have had their claims for refugee status rejected.Many of the would-be refugees have been deported or returned home already, after being tempted by $20,000 (about $16,000 U.S.) packages from the Australian government. Last week, a number of Hillside House residents received a grim letter from the PNG Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority, saying that the government wants to deport them but that a pre-deportation assessment found these asylum seekers would face mortal danger if they returned to their home countries.“This included an assessment of whether there is a real risk that you will be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary deprivation of life or the imposition of the death penalty,” the letter obtained by HuffPost stated.“The assessment found that there is a real risk of one or more of these events and therefore the Government of Papua New Guinea will not remove you to your home country.”The letter said that, despite this, “you do not have a right to remain in Papua New Guinea and your removal and detention orders remain in effect.” “It’s essentially putting people who need protection into limbo or detention forever,” Natasha Blucher, detention advocacy manager at the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre. “The men detained in Hillside have limited rights to movement. There is no solution. The men who received these letters are at their wits’ end. Where can they go?”Blucher said many of the men would be persecuted and targeted if they returned home.“It has been acknowledged they’d face torture and death if they go home. They can’t stay in PNG. They’re not allowed to go to Australia. This has heaped a lot of distress onto people. It’s dangerous when you take already hopeless people and tell them there’s no solution in the foreseeable future,” she said.“It’s something Australia could have absolutely foreseen yet failed to plan. It’s another example showing this entire system is a disaster.”The Australian government says it no longer bears any responsibility for the asylum seekers, despite the asylum boats having been on a course for Australia and having been detained in Australian waters. The Department of Home Affairs, which has jurisdiction over immigration, issued a one-line response to HuffPost: “This is a matter for the PNG Government.”Dr. Maria O’Sullivan, senior lecturer at Monash University’s law school and deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law, told HuffPost that, although fear of torture or death was not in itself a basis to claim refugee status, most developed nations offered protection for non-refugees with such fears.“Many countries are party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which means they can’t return someone to torture. The thorny issue is that Nauru and PNG are developing countries that have only recently relatively signed up to these conventions,” she said.“PNG can’t send them back, but they don’t have to give them a status that allows them to stay. When you’re recognized as a refugee, you’re allowed certain rights to education, work, social security and more. It’s a big issue in refugee law worldwide, you won’t get sent back but you don’t have any status.”O’Sullivan claimed the PNG government was attempting to encourage the non-refugees to go back to their home countries, regardless of the potential danger.“The policy wants them to voluntarily return home. The government is giving them one choice, staying in PNG in this uncertain status,” she said.“You could argue it is in itself a breach of human rights to not give someone permanent status.”"

It’s a big issue in refugee law worldwide, you won’t get sent back but you don’t have any status.”O’Sullivan claimed the PNG government was attempting to encourage the non-refugees to go back to their home countries, regardless of the potential danger.“The policy wants them to voluntarily return home. The government is giving them one choice, staying in PNG in this uncertain status,” she said.“You could argue it is in itself a breach of human rights to not give someone permanent status.”"

FEMA last month said it would continue to provide water, meals and other basic needs after earlier reports that it was going to halt aid.The House committee’s announcement follows an earlier controversy involving contractor Whitefish Energy Holdings, a small Montana firm hired to restore the island’s power despite a lack of experience. Governor Ricardo Rossello later canceled that deal.After winning the October 2017 FEMA contract, Tribute delivered just 50,000 meals to the U.S. territory and was terminated for cause 20 days later, said Representative Elijah Cummings, the committee’s top Democrat.“It is unclear why FEMA or any agency would have proceeded with a contract worth $156 million in light of this company’s poor contracting history and these explicit warnings,” he wrote, citing documents obtained by panel Democrats.Cummings and fellow Democrat Stacey Plaskett called on the panel’s Republican chairman, Trey Gowdy, to subpoena FEMA for documents on the company and its alleged failure to deliver millions of meals.Gowdy’s spokeswoman Amanda Gonzalez said that sending a subpoena was premature but that the panel would continue to review hurricane recovery efforts.FEMA said it could not comment on Tribute, but that at the time the contract was terminated food distribution in Puerto Rico “was not affected.”Agency spokeswoman Jenny Burke said meals continue to be provided on the island and that “there are sufficient commodities both in Puerto Rico and on the mainland to continue to meet identified needs for current or future disasters.”A website for Brown shows her other companies include beauty, fashion, interior design and health and wellness businesses."

Trump at the time was still with his first wife, Ivana, and Brinkley was dating musician Billy Joel. “My phone rings and this guy goes, ‘Hey, Christie, it’s The Donald.’ I say, ‘Hi, Billy,’ because I was dating Billy [Joel] at the time,” the supermodel told Porter, as reported by the Sunday Times.“But the voice goes, ‘No, no. It’s The Donald!’ So I say, ‘What’s up?’ And he says, ‘I hear you’re leaving for Aspen tomorrow. I am too. I’d like to give you a ride on my private jet.’” Brinkley said she turned down the offer.“So I reply, ‘Thank you, but I have already arranged my flights.’ ‘So cancel them!’ was his response, and I say, ‘No, thank you. I’m going with friends,’” the supermodel said. “I knew he was married, and there he was asking me to go on his plane. He was kind of flirty about it. He was out chasing skirts.” Brinkley also revealed that she’s had dinner with Trump before.“I’ve always found him smarmy, as in, ’Watch out, part the waves, the rich people are coming, everything is gold, solid 24-carat gold, the best, the greatest, nobody else has more gold on anything in their house than me,” Brinkley said. ”‘Did you bring a brush? Let’s gold-leaf it!’” Brinkley revealed the story now because, as she told the magazine, “I’m done being discreet.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 20 women. He has repeatedly denied the allegations, and the White House says the accusers are lying.Former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, reportedly had an affair with Trump back in 2006, when he was married to his third wife, Melania Trump. Clifford confirmed the affair in a 2011 interview with InTouch magazine. Trump representatives issued a statement in January denying the affair. "

Shaub, who served under President Barack Obama and for six months under President Donald Trump, was replying to a tweet from investor/Kremlin critic Bill Browder about former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus: Shaub told Browder that the conversation brought another Bill to mind: Shaub’s tweet drew a response from Alex Winter, the actor and filmmaker best known for his excellent portrayal of “that other famous Bill” in the 1989 film and its 1991 sequel:Shaub quickly apologized for being bogus, heinous and most non-triumphant: Winter, for his part, reassured Shaub that all was still excellent between them. Shaub seemed relieved: There is reportedly a third film in the franchise in development, tentatively titled “Bill and Ted Face The Music,” that would reunite Winter with Keanu Reeves and revive their iconic characters, per Digital Spy.

After a cesarean section at 36 weeks brought baby Penelope into the world, the new mom began six months of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, according to her GoFundMe page. Then she learned she had brain and lung cancer as well. The prognosis wasn’t good, and doctors told her to make a will and provisions for her daughter. “After what seemed like a unbelievably long and exhausting battle we were told by the doctors here in the UK that nothing more could be done for her,” Helen Sproates, Nuttall’s mom, wrote on the GoFundMe page. “She was put on palliative care and we were told she had just a few months to live.” But after doing some research, Sproates located a clinic in Germany that offered immunotherapy, a treatment method that uses the body’s own immune system to help fight cancer. Unfortunately, each treatment cost nearly $98,000 ― and Nuttall needed six. Fortunately, Kate Winslet came across Nuttall’s story last year while researching clinics in Germany for her own mother, who was suffering from ovarian cancer. “My heart sank,” Winslet said when she phoned in to “This Morning” as a surprise for Nuttall. “I saw how much money she needed to raise ... and I just thought I can’t have this happen.” “My own mother was very, very unwell, and I just thought my mum would be incredibly proud if I could do this for somebody else,” the actress said as her voice broke. Winslet’s mother died in May of last year. So she teamed up with Nuttall’s mom to raise funds, and eventually she called in DiCaprio, her close friend and former co-star. “I phoned Leo and I said, ‘Do you think we could do a charity dinner or something?’” Winslet told People magazine. “And he said, ‘Let’s go one better. Come with me to St. Tropez, to my big fundraiser for the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation,’ which is back in July, ‘and we will auction off a dinner with Jack and Rose.’” The “Titanic” stars auctioned off three dinners with themselves and raised over $1.35 million for treatment, according to People.Nuttall, who spoke to Winslet directly for the first time on Monday’s show, told the actress that she couldn’t be more grateful for her help. “I just want to say thank you so much for all your hard work and [helping] me being able to have my treatment that I really did need,” Nuttall said before she began crying. “You saved my life and I just want you to know that.” Though the initial round of treatment was a success, Nuttall isn’t totally out of the woods yet. “Gemma needs further urgent specialist cancer treatment in Germany. Without it, she will die,” Winslet said in a statement provided to Us Weekly on Monday. “We are all so thrilled that we were able to send Gemma off to the Hallwang for her first round of treatment. I will continue to assist with her costs, but we do still badly need your donations.” Winslet added, “Join me in supporting this 28-year-old mum! Let’s truly do our best to keep her alive for her 3-year-old daughter, Penelope, who loves and needs her Mummy so much.” "

Hello, droids.David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators of “Game of Thrones,” are going to write and produce a “Star Wars” film series, StarWars.com announced Tuesday.The series will take place in a galaxy far, far away, but will not be tied to the trilogy being developed by “The Last Jedi” filmmaker Rian Johnson or the episodic Skywalker saga.“David and Dan are some of the best storytellers working today,” Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said in the announcement. “Their command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology will break new ground and boldly push Star Wars in ways I find incredibly exciting.”“In the summer of 1977 we traveled to a galaxy far, far away, and we’ve been dreaming of it ever since,” Benioff and Weiss said in a joint statement. “We are honored by the opportunity, a little terrified by the responsibility, and so excited to get started as soon as the final season of Game of Thrones is complete.”Though some may be excited about the news, people on Twitter were a bit skeptical.Many fans were concerned that tropes from the popular HBO show, such as incest and rape, would seep into the “Star Wars” universe.In July, HBO also announced that Benioff and Weiss were going to work on its upcoming Civil War drama “Confederate,” a show whose premise immediately sparked criticism. This prompted others on Twitter to question the decision to have them write and produce the new “Star Wars” series.Some Twitter users were disappointed that a woman or a person of color wasn’t chosen for the role, especially since Kennedy has mentioned in the past that she would like to see a woman direct a “Star Wars” movie (though the announcement did not say whether Benioff and Weiss would direct the series they will create).There is no release date as of yet, which we’re sure is making both Jon Snow and Kylo Ren incredibly sad."

We’ll go with another shutdown.”Lawmakers in both parties have said they hope to avoid another government shutdown like the one that occurred after talks broke down last month. Without an agreement to extend funding, the government would shut down Friday. At the same time, lawmakers are working on a deal to help young undocumented immigrants, which Trump insists must include border security funding and cuts to legal immigration, something both Democrats and some Republicans have said is a non-starter.But the White House has not typically taken the position that the debate should be tied to government funding. In January, the White House bashed Senate Democrats for opposing a government spending bill when it left out immigration measures. This time around, it’s not clear Democrats are willing to make the same move ― but Trump is now suggesting he will. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), who was attending the roundtable and represents a district that is home to many government workers, told Trump: “We don’t need a government shutdown over this. I think both sides have learned that the shutdown was bad.” She added that she believes there is bipartisan support for a deal. “Barbara, we are not getting the support of the Democrats. I mean, you can say what you want. We are not getting the support of the Democrats,” Trump said in response. “They are not supporting us.”Among Trump’s demands is his signature campaign promise: a border wall. “We need the wall. We’re going to get the wall,” he said Tuesday. Later Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders clarified Trump’s comments, saying that he wants Democrats “to do their jobs.”“We are not advocating for the shutdown,” she said.On Monday, Trump blamed Democrats for not coming up with a legislative solution for so-called Dreamers. In a tweet, he claimed that Democrats “seem not to care about DACA,” referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump ended.Democrats and Republicans have proposed multiple bipartisan bills to help Dreamers, often paired with border security measures. The White House has rejected all of them and says it wants its own framework, even though it faces bipartisan opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that the upper chamber will move forward with discussing immigration only after government funding has been approved. He said it will be an open debate to determine what can get past the 60-vote threshold for passage. “Whoever gets to 60 wins,” McConnell told reporters.DACA recipients are set to begin losing their two-year work permits and deportation protections in greater numbers on March 6 if Congress does nothing due to the way Trump rescinded the program. They are currently able to apply for renewal under a court order ― one the administration is fighting ― but it typically takes months for applications to be processed.White House chief of staff John Kelly said earlier on Tuesday that he does not believe Trump can “extend” that March “deadline,” and would advise the president against signing a bill to temporarily maintain DACA. This post has been updated with comment from Sanders and more background on the immigration negotiations. Elise Foley contributed reporting. "

The neurological disorder is often ignored, as many of the thousands of children affected live in Uganda’s remote north, a land at peace but struggling with the legacy of long years of civil war. It’s partly because of the area’s remoteness that the causes of the syndrome remain a mystery. Though limited in its spread, nodding syndrome is devastating to the tiny communities that are affected. Scientists first recorded cases of nodding syndrome in Tanzania in the 1960s, but it is not clear whether that outbreak is related to the one in Uganda. (Neighboring South Sudan has also reported cases, but the ongoing conflict there makes the extent difficult to assess.)Photographer Sumy Sadurni and I had come to find out more about what was behind a strange syndrome that has left thousands of children crippled and in pain. And joining Johnson on motorbikes was the only way to reach the remote farms at the end of narrow tracks.“I bring them the anti-convulsion drugs,” Johnson shouts, as clouds of orange dust rise high into the air. Without these pills, the children would soon die from the intense seizures. Nodding syndrome has no known cure.Joe Otoo, a 59-year old volunteer health worker, claims to be the first person to report Ugandan cases of the disease.It was 1998, and northern Uganda was in the grip of a brutal insurgency. Tumango was at the epicenter of an army crackdown against the Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group also known as the LRA.As the land burned, nodding syndrome developed amid the nearly 2 million people forced into crowded government-run camps.“I was called to Tumango because of odd reports [that] three children were sick,” Otoo said, recalling his visit to a scattered collection of thatch huts to investigate. “When food was brought for children, they began to nod their heads, then sleep,” he said, copying how the seizures looked by banging his head forward. “It was a strange disease, something no one had seen before.”The smell of food triggered the seizures, with a child’s head slowly nodding forward, then growing in intensity. The nodding eventually develops into an uncontrolled seizure. Epilepsy was well known, but the traditional treatments of crushed roots used to calm patients proved useless against this new problem.The unexplained condition now affects about 3,300 children in northern Uganda, with around 5,200 with epilepsy that resembles nodding syndrome.Otoo opens his ledger of cases: page after page, each with hundreds of names.Dozens have died, many from complications related to the seizures. They include Otoo’s son, Oroma Ronald, who fell sick at 8 and died a decade later during a seizure.“He started nodding, too,” he said, running his hands over the faded photograph of his child. “It made me sad, because I knew what it meant for him.”Many scientists, and the Ugandan government, believe nodding syndrome may be connected to parasitic worms spread by the black fly. These parasites cause the disease known as river blindness, which is a known threat to millions of people in more than 20 countries, mostly in tropical regions of Africa.Last year a team of U.S. scientists published a study suggesting that nodding syndrome might be an auto-immune response to the parasite, NPR reported.Distrust of the government, however, has led some to question those conclusions. Locals have noted that river blindness was a problem long before nodding syndrome was identified, across a much wider geographic area. They wonder why nodding syndrome would suddenly appear in such a specific location in East Africa.“We have always had black fly, so why has it made the children suffer from nodding here?” asked one parent, who was fearful of publicly challenging the government’s official line blaming black fly. “In the end, all we care about is the health of our child.”Some skeptics have blamed poisoned food in the camps, or they believe it’s due to fallout from explosions during the fighting. Others see the nodding children as spirits of those never buried in the massacres of the war.Of the three cases Otoo recorded in 1998, two have since died. But the third, a woman called Abalo Monica, has survived.We left Otoo behind and went to find her. After an hour of driving, we turned down the thinnest of tracks, weaving between mango trees and sunflower plants that towered above us.Monica, now in her early 20s, was sitting outside her home, a thatch hut she shares with her smiling, year-old son Otema.“It was as though invisible hands had grabbed me,” Monica said, recalling the first seizures and intense hallucinations she suffered from the syndrome. “I dreamed that men came out the termite mounds, calling out my name over and over. ‘Monica! Monica!’ But I refused to join them.”Today, she still has fits, but drugs keep the worst symptoms at bay. Johnson is worried, however. Funding for the care he provides is at risk of being cut, as a U.S.-based charity that supports the only care center for the children is struggling to raise cash. Supporters are trying to ensure Johnson’s lifesaving work continues.“Without this help, the children will die,” he said.This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them.

Tumango was at the epicenter of an army crackdown against the Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group also known as the LRA.As the land burned, nodding syndrome developed amid the nearly 2 million people forced into crowded government-run camps.“I was called to Tumango because of odd reports [that] three children were sick,” Otoo said, recalling his visit to a scattered collection of thatch huts to investigate. “When food was brought for children, they began to nod their heads, then sleep,” he said, copying how the seizures looked by banging his head forward. “It was a strange disease, something no one had seen before.”The smell of food triggered the seizures, with a child’s head slowly nodding forward, then growing in intensity. The nodding eventually develops into an uncontrolled seizure. Epilepsy was well known, but the traditional treatments of crushed roots used to calm patients proved useless against this new problem.The unexplained condition now affects about 3,300 children in northern Uganda, with around 5,200 with epilepsy that resembles nodding syndrome.Otoo opens his ledger of cases: page after page, each with hundreds of names.Dozens have died, many from complications related to the seizures. They include Otoo’s son, Oroma Ronald, who fell sick at 8 and died a decade later during a seizure.“He started nodding, too,” he said, running his hands over the faded photograph of his child. “It made me sad, because I knew what it meant for him.”Many scientists, and the Ugandan government, believe nodding syndrome may be connected to parasitic worms spread by the black fly. These parasites cause the disease known as river blindness, which is a known threat to millions of people in more than 20 countries, mostly in tropical regions of Africa.Last year a team of U.S. scientists published a study suggesting that nodding syndrome might be an auto-immune response to the parasite, NPR reported.Distrust of the government, however, has led some to question those conclusions. Locals have noted that river blindness was a problem long before nodding syndrome was identified, across a much wider geographic area. They wonder why nodding syndrome would suddenly appear in such a specific location in East Africa.“We have always had black fly, so why has it made the children suffer from nodding here?” asked one parent, who was fearful of publicly challenging the government’s official line blaming black fly. “In the end, all we care about is the health of our child.”Some skeptics have blamed poisoned food in the camps, or they believe it’s due to fallout from explosions during the fighting. Others see the nodding children as spirits of those never buried in the massacres of the war.Of the three cases Otoo recorded in 1998, two have since died. But the third, a woman called Abalo Monica, has survived.We left Otoo behind and went to find her. After an hour of driving, we turned down the thinnest of tracks, weaving between mango trees and sunflower plants that towered above us.Monica, now in her early 20s, was sitting outside her home, a thatch hut she shares with her smiling, year-old son Otema.“It was as though invisible hands had grabbed me,” Monica said, recalling the first seizures and intense hallucinations she suffered from the syndrome. “I dreamed that men came out the termite mounds, calling out my name over and over. ‘Monica! Monica!’ But I refused to join them.”Today, she still has fits, but drugs keep the worst symptoms at bay. Johnson is worried, however. Funding for the care he provides is at risk of being cut, as a U.S.-based charity that supports the only care center for the children is struggling to raise cash. Supporters are trying to ensure Johnson’s lifesaving work continues.“Without this help, the children will die,” he said.This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a79e0e61600004500139f44.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"YouTube star Kian Lawley has been fired from the upcoming film adaptation of “The Hate U Give” after a recently resurfaced video shows him making racist remarks. “Due to the controversy surrounding his past comments and behavior, Kian Lawley will no longer appear in ‘The Hate U Give.’ The studio plans to recast the role of Chris and reshoot scenes as needed,” a Twentieth Century Fox Films spokesperson told Variety. In a 12-second bleeped video on YouTube that made the internet rounds last month, Lawley is heard using a racist slur and other racially offensive comments. “We’re all black drinking purple Kool-Aid and eating Kentucky fried motherfucking chicken,” he says in the clip. Lawley was set to star as the boyfriend of Amandla Stenberg’s character in the adaptation of the beloved and critically acclaimed young-adult novel written by Angela Thomas. “The Hate U Give” centers around the story of a 16-year-old girl who feels torn between the worlds of her poor and mostly black neighborhood, and the suburban prep school she attends. She later witnesses the murder of her childhood friend at the hands of a police officer. Issa Rae, Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, Algee Smith, Lamar Johnson, and Common are also attached to the project. Lawley has formally apologized for the video, and said he agrees with the studio’s decision to drop him from the film. “Words have power and can do damage. I own mine and I am sorry. I respect Fox’s decision to recast this role for ‘The Hate U Give’ as it is an important story, and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved considering the actions of my past,” Lawley told Variety in a statement. “I understand the impact and I have grown and learned since then. From now on I plan to use my voice for positive change.” Earlier in the week, he addressed the controversy on social media, where he’s amassed more than 6 million followers. Thomas, barraged by Lawley fans on social media, also responded to the recasting, writing, “the past two weeks have been hell for me, but I’m the enemy. Y’all. I’ve been trying. You just don’t know.” The author explained that she’s been “hurt severely” and there is a “ton of pain” associated with the uproar. Fans of the author have since come to her defense, attempting to shift the narrative to a celebration of Thomas’ breakout novel. The hashtag #AngieThomasAppreciationDay is now trending on social media. A representative for Twentieth Century Fox Films did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. "
88,POLITICS,Activists Barnstorm Red States To Get Medicaid Expansion On The Ballot,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/activists-barnstorm-red-states-for-medicaid-expansion_us_5a6b95fae4b01fbbefb1bca7,"Maine voters resoundingly approved Medicaid expansion last year. Idaho, Nebraska and Utah could be next.",2018-02-06,"Reclaim Idaho is traveling across the Gem State in its ""Medicaid Mobile"" to gather signatures to put Medicaid expansion before voters this November.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6b96a71d000026006acf0f.jpeg?cache=XSZQs9ZvEw&ops=crop_71_62_482_248%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Two guys from the tiny town of Sandpoint, Idaho, are trying to do what their political leaders won’t: Provide health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income Idahoans.Through a political action committee they founded called Reclaim Idaho, Luke Mayville and Garrett Strizich, both 32, are traveling the state collecting signatures to put the question of whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act before the voters.“If I can, I want to make a difference where I grew up, because where I grew up has been overtaken by similar kinds of politics that seem to be taking over the country,” Mayville told HuffPost. “So I want to do something to push back against that.” The Idaho effort is one of several in conservative-leaning states seeking to duplicate what activists in Maine achieved last November through a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid in that state. Advocates in Nebraska and Utah also are working to gather signatures to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and a retiree in Missouri has taken up the cause for a long-shot bid to do so as well.These campaigns to expand health coverage using funding the Affordable Care Act provides come at a time when President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress are busy rolling back other parts of the 2010 law and implementing changes to Medicaid policy that make it harder for low-income people to get and keep health benefits.“Maine really motivated myself to look into the ballot route,” Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld said. He and other Nebraska legislators have tried advancing Medicaid expansion through legislative channels for years, and are trying again this year.But Morfeld said he’s also working with private organizations to get the issue on the ballot this November. The Nebraska legislature consists of a single chamber and is technically nonpartisan, but Morfeld, a Democrat, is effectively in the minority.Expanding Medicaid could benefit 90,000 Nebraskans, Morfeld said. They have to gather signatures representing 10 percent of the state’s registered voters ― about 120,000 people ― and submit them by July 6, according to Nebraska law.The Affordable Care Act called for Medicaid to become available to anyone with an income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person. A 2012 Supreme Court ruling made this policy optional for states, however, and 18 states have declined to participate. Nationwide, almost 2.5 million people who would qualify for Medicaid under this policy are uninsured, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.In Idaho, Mayville, Strizich and his wife, Emily Strizich, are traveling around the state in a camper van the Strizichs bought last year for $1,500, which they’ve decorated with the campaign’s name and dubbed the “Medicaid Mobile.” Mayville and Garrett Strizich each grew up in Sandpoint, a town with fewer than 8,000 residents that sits about an hour south of the Canadian border and an hour or so east of Washington state. Sandpoint is known to some as the birthplace of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. The Strizichs live in Moscow, Idaho, where Garrett is in medical school and Emily is an occupational therapist who primarily works with low-income children with disabilities. Mayville currently resides in New York City, where he teaches political philosophy at Columbia University, and travels back to Idaho regularly.They’ve raised about $10,000, along with contributions of gasoline and supplies for their barnstorming campaign, mostly from the residents of their hometown, Mayville said.Idaho is a conservative state, but Mayville is optimistic the campaign can succeed at extending health coverage to as many as 78,000 Idahoans. “Our kind of philosophy all along has been that it’s actually a kind of Republican elite and activist class that is really against these programs, whereas the broader base of voters is not,” he said.Reclaim Idaho has a tough task ahead just to give voters a chance to decide. They must collect signatures from 6 percent of the state’s registered voters, or about 56,000 people. They must also meet that percentage threshold in 18 of 35 state legislative districts. The deadline to submit signatures is May 1.Mayville and the Strizichs, for now, are pretty much on their own, though they hope to gain the support of other organizations. The Utah effort has been able to gather wider backing because advocates have been pushing for Medicaid expansion since the Supreme Court ruling almost six years ago, said RyLee Curtis, the campaign manager for Utah Decides Healthcare.“Our coalition grew over the years. We got more businesses and chambers of commerce on board, and that drew the attention of our funders,” Curtis said.One advantage the Utah ballot push has over Idaho’s is that Medicaid expansion has been the subject of a public debate in the state for several years already. Utah’s state Senate passed a privatized version of Medicaid expansion in 2016 with the support of Gov. Gary Herbert (R), but the bill died in the state House. Medicaid expansion could provide coverage to an estimated 120,000 Utahns.“You’re seeing a frustration from Utah voters in that we want to see good policies go forward, and the Utah legislature is not reflecting or acting in a way that Utah voters want to see them act on these issues,” Curtis said. There hasn’t been a ballot initiative presented to Utah voters since the 1990s, but there could be as many as five this November, she said.Utah Decides Healthcare has until April 15 to collect about 113,000 signatures, which represents 10 percent of the number of Utahns who voted in the 2016 presidential election. As in Idaho, the signatures must come from all over the state; in Utah, that means meeting the 10 percent threshold in 26 of 29 state Senate districts, Curtis said. “It’s going to be close, but it’s not so close that we’re nervous about it,” she said.A key player in the Maine and Utah ballot campaigns will decide soon whether to join the fights in Idaho and Nebraska. The Fairness Project, a labor-backed organization that successfully promoted the Maine Medicaid initiative last year and minimum-wage-increase initiatives in five states in 2016, sees expanding health care as a priority, executive director Jonathan Schleifer said.“There’s no better way to improve people’s lives,” Schleifer said.The Fairness Project serves as a support system for these statewide ballot initiatives, conducting public opinion research, helping with signature-gathering, providing data modeling and other means of assistance. But the group is choosy about where to devote its resources and only wants to support campaigns that will actually result in the change they’re seeking.“We’re not interested in principled wins or principled losses. We want to see the impact,” Schleifer said.“We’ve had early conservations in Idaho and Nebraska. We are optimistic that we’re going to be able to advance Medicaid on the ballot in both of those states and we think that if we do, we will be able to expand Medicaid,” Schleifer said. The Missouri effort is too much of a long shot, he said, and he doesn’t expect to see ballot campaigns in any other states this year.“As we look at the current landscape and current political environment, progressive groups are all rightfully playing defense, holding the line fighting for immigrants, fighting for LGBTQ rights,” Schleifer said. “We see a unique opportunity to go on offense.”"
