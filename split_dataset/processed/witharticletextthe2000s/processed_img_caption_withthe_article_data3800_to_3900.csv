There had been some speculation that he would not sign it, given his calls for a friendlier relationship with Russia, his dismissal of U.S. intelligence officials’ conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, and the multiple investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia last year.Russia denies that it attempted to influence the U.S. election and says that Crimea, with a large population of ethnic Russians, is part of Russia.In response to the bill, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the removal of 755 U.S. diplomats and staff and the seizure of two U.S. diplomatic facilities on Sunday.Trump’s tweet on Thursday, in which he appeared to blame Congress for Russia’s actions, echoed a similarly critical statement about the bill he made on Wednesday.In announcing that he had signed the bill, which also includes sanctions for Iran and North Korea, Trump claimed that parts of it were “unconstitutional” and said the legislation “encroaches on the executive branch’s authority to negotiate.”The bill specifically limits Trump’s ability to lift the sanctions. But Trump proclaimed that he could “make far better deals,” citing his business background.“I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars,” he said in a statement. “That is a big part of the reason I was elected. As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress.”Trump has frequently taken aim at the GOP-controlled Congress for not doing enough to advance his agenda.Last month, as Senate Republicans’ failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Trump launched personal attacks and threats against GOP lawmakers critical of the legislation. Following the health care bill’s demise, he again blamed Congress, though he did little himself to help Republican lawmakers pass the bill.Trump’s Thursday morning tweets came after some political observers hoped that his new chief of staff, John Kelly, would help rein Trump in and moderate his unfiltered Twitter rants."

Neal Milch, Laundrylux’s CEO, said that job will be waiting for Hurant after he is released from prison.“He’s a good guy,” said Milch told reporters after the hearing. “My reaction is that Jeffrey wants to move on with his life and he will.”Hurant had agreed not to appeal any prison term of two years or less, and Easy Rent agreed not to challenge any fine of up to $10 million.Hurant was arrested in August 2015, along with six Rentboy.com employees. Prosecutors dropped the charges against those employees six months later.The case had angered some gay rights advocates as well as advocacy groups for sex workers, who questioned why prosecutors decided to go after a business that had operated openly for nearly two decades."

Vaccine hesitancy is a major public health concern that needs to be highlighted.Given increasing parental decisions not to vaccinate their children, investigators from the U.S. wanted to understand what the effect of small reductions in vaccine coverage on measles cases were. Nathan Lo, from the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, estimated the disease burden and economic costs associated with declines in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination rate.“Routine childhood vaccination is declining in some regions of the United States due to vaccine hesitancy, which risks the resurgence of many infectious diseases with public health and economic consequences,” the authors wrote in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.The study set out to find the number of measles cases in U.S. children. From there, researchers used vaccine data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to simulate county-wide MMR vaccine coverage for children ages 2 to 11. They then used a mathematical model to estimate the impact of decreasing vaccination rates, taking into consideration the infectiousness of the disease while simulating situations in which measles is introduced by a traveller into the U.S. They calculated the number of cases that would be expected if the MMR vaccination coverage was to decline. The researchers repeated this process thousands of times, changing the variables and scenarios each time for each state. The model was checked for its accuracy using data on measles cases from England and Wales.At baseline, MMR vaccine coverage was at 93 percent, and the prevalence of non-medical exemptions was at 2 percent. This would yield 48 measles cases annually in this age group across the U.S. However, if vaccine coverage dropped by 5 percent, the estimated number of measles cases would increase to 150, a threefold increase. This could cost the public sector $2.1 million. That’s $20,000 per case of measles. Still, the researchers warned that results of the study may be underestimated! The study did not take into account other variables, such as cost of illness, parental time off work, hospitalization, or other societal factors.Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor University in Texas, added: “I think our study is a wake-up call for what we can expect in the coming months and years as vaccine coverage rates continue to decline in the 18 states that now allow non-medical or philosophical belief exemptions.”While childhood vaccination rates remain high in the U.S., there are areas where non-medical exemption policies are translating into decreased immunization coverage. Currently, 18 out of 50 states allow non-medical personal belief exemptions to childhood vaccinations. Moreover, all but two states offer non-medical exemptions on religious or philosophical grounds. Given the trends in declining vaccine coverage, researchers predict that preventing non-medical personal belief exemptions would bring the annual number of cases down to 38. This, they say, would be “an effective strategy to mitigate annual measles cases and costs.”The study’s conclusion was supported by a recent study that examined the association between vaccine coverage and measles outbreaks in Denver, Colorado. This study found that making non-medical vaccine exemption requirements more stringent (therefore, reducing non-medical exemptions) would reduce measles cases and economic consequences.Plummeting vaccination rates have prompted several countries around the world to adopt firm policies. In Australia, the “No Jab, No Pay” bill mandates that only parents of children (less than 20 years of age) who are fully immunized or are on a recognized catch-up schedule can receive the Child Care Benefit, the Child Care Rebate, and the Family Tax Benefit. “No Jab, No Pay” came after the 2012 whooping cough epidemic in Australia. That same year, measles, a disease mostly eliminated through vaccines, returned.In Germany, kindergartens are obligated to inform authorities if parents fail to prove they have sought vaccination advice from a doctor. The measure is part of a government effort to improve vaccination rates.In France, parents will be legally obligated to vaccinate their children starting in 2018. French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said that it was “unacceptable that children are still dying of measles” in a country where some of the earliest vaccines were pioneered.This move follows a similar initiative in Italy, where parents are required to show proof of vaccinations to gain admission into preschools. Parents, whose children are of mandatory school age, could face fines of up to 500 euros ($588) for noncompliance.Measles is an extremely contagious and potentially fatal disease that can spread very easily, particularly to those who are not immune. It can spread through direct contact, via a cough or sneeze, or by way of contact with shared objects and surfaces. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. but, in the past few years, outbreaks have started occurring annually. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), measles cases have ranged from a low of 55 (2012) to a high of 667 (2014). The CDC also noted that in the majority of these measles cases, people who had not been vaccinated were those who became infected.Measles is highly contagious and 90 percent of people not immune will get infected by someone who has it in close proximity. Therefore, there is an ethical argument to be made that everyone who can get vaccinated should get vaccinated – not only to protect themselves but to protect those who can’t, through means of herd immunity."

But it comes to center on the gut-wrenching reports of one real-life clash between civilians and police. On July 26, 1967, three young black men were shot to death at the Algiers Motel on Woodward Avenue: Aubrey Pollard, 19, Fred Temple, 18, and Carl Cooper, 17. Three white police officers faced charges relating to the killings, and alleged psychological torture, but none were convicted. The film is earning praise for its portrayal of a “hair-trigger historical nightmare” providing us “protection against forgetting.” “Detroit,” which hits theaters nationwide Aug. 4, is perhaps the most visible singular effort to reflect on what happened in Michigan that summer, but it’s not the only one. Cultural institutions led by the Detroit Historical Museum ― as part of its “Looking Back to Move Forward” initiative ― have worked to present accounts of the week of violence and social upheaval that boiled over on July 23, 1967, through visual and written means, both creative and strictly factual.Scholars have pointed to a culmination of institutionalized racism and tensions with a mostly white police force to explain the 1967 violence that broke out in what is still one of the most racially segregated metropolitan areas in the U.S. The simplest illustration of that conflict is seen in the debate over whether to call it a “riot” or something else. One exhibition, titled “Say It Loud: Art, History, Rebellion,” doesn’t worry over its terminology ― ’67 was a rebellion, period. Detroit’s Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History presents events leading up to that tense summer through powerful photographs and works by over 40 artists.The Wright museum also linked up with the Detroit Institute of the Arts to put on a similarly styled exhibition, titled “The Art of Rebellion: Black Art of the Civil Rights Movement,” grouping paintings, sculpture and photographs created mainly during the ’60s and ’70s by over 30 artists. Again, the word “rebellion” was chosen purposefully, curator Valerie Mercer told HuffPost, because such events “don’t really come out of the blue, although they may appear to,” she said.“It’s the result of changes not happening, and people get really fed up. It seems to me the term gives agency to the people ― ‘rebellion’ does. ‘Riots’ are what it’s called to people who are not a part of those communities.” One of the DIA’s works directly addresses the incident depicted in the film “Detroit.” Titled “1967: Death in the Algiers Motel and Beyond,” Rita Dickerson’s painting memorializes the three victims in the style of collage, the motel where they died looming just beyond their faces on a somber black backdrop. Other works come from artist groups like New York City’s Spiral and its Black Arts Movement, which operated in the early and later ’60s, respectively. One strikingly kaleidoscopic image, a figure woven out of vivid reds, pinks, yellows and blues titled “Revolutionary,” was born out of Chicago’s AfriCOBRA, founded in 1968.Across the street, the Detroit Historical Museum unveiled an exhibition over two years in the making, titled “Detroit 67: Perspectives.” A massive oral history project currently encompassing approximately 460 stories adds a human layer to a chronology beginning 100 years prior to the summer of 1967. An accompanying website allows those outside Detroit to peruse the personal-history collection, which houses interviews with people who were: working at a hot dog stand at Tiger Stadium at the time, knocking on doors as a Jehovah’s Witness, and dodging sniper bullets as a black rookie cop until the National Guard could return fire with a tank.“[T]he anger, the uproar of the people, it just broke my heart, and overwhelmed the community. It simmered and smoked for days, many days, it seemed,” Dwight Stackhouse, the Jehovah’s Witness, told an interviewer. Felton Rogers, the police officer, said he probably wouldn’t use the label “riot,” but maybe “insurrection” or “disturbance.” A white housewife and foster parent, Joann Castle, recalled reading news reports inciting fear of black people in the city and watching some of her neighbors flee. In the months and years before, others remembered a walkout at a high school over what the majority-black students saw as mistreatment and conflict between Detroit police and citizens.Before entering the full exhibition, however, there is the question of nomenclature. Five choices greet visitors: “uprising,” “riot,” “rebellion,” “civil disturbance” or “revolution.”“Hopefully, when people are confronted with this, they’ll want to know more, and they’ll want to engage in a conversation that people in Detroit still don’t want to have,” the project’s manager, Billy Winkel, told HuffPost. “I should clarify ― [people in] Metro Detroit. Detroiters are more than willing to talk about what took place because it’s still affecting them. Suburbanites, when they left, they said, ‘Oh, this wasn’t our fault.

Both theater companies will screen “Brave,” “The Princess and the Frog” and “Tangled.” Additionally, El Capitan Theatre will feature “Moana,” and AMC will show “Mulan” and “Beauty and the Beast.” The marathon will begin September 8 and end in late October. According to Oh My Disney, 304 AMC locations will participate. Though Disney hasn’t indicated how the movies were chosen, it’s notable that the company has not included other classics like “Cinderella,” “Sleeping Beauty” and “The Little Mermaid” in its lineup and has focused on its more empowering characters, including two ― the protagonists of “Moana” and “Brave” (below) ― whose storylines do not involve romantic relationships.The Disney princesses made news earlier this month when several of the women who voiced them came together for the Disney fan club’s D23 Expo. A handful of the princesses from past movies will appear in “Wreck-It Ralph 2: Ralph Breaks the Internet” to accompany Vanellope von Schweetz (played by Sarah Silverman).

The confiscated goods have a value of more than $8 million, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.“The NY law, which prohibits the purchase and sale of ivory and rhino horn and increases penalties for wildlife traffickers, has led to increased confiscations and prosecutions — as have state laws in other ivory markets and the federal ban,” the council says in a blog post.New York has been one of the top markets for elephant ivory in the U.S., WABC News reported.

According to Time, Guterres warned that women around the world are facing “new assaults on their safety and dignity.” He did not name any specific governments or groups, but he spoke of “challenges that arise from violent extremism, human rights violations, xenophobia and other threats.” The speech appeared to be aimed at President Donald Trump and his proposed refugee and immigrant ban, as well as extremist group ISIS and Russia’s recent legislation decriminalizing domestic violence. Guterres also acknowledged men’s role in making the world a safer place for women. “Our world needs more women leaders,” he said. “And our world needs more men standing up for gender equality.”Executive director of U.N. Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, spoke after Guterres, and commented on the economic consequences of discrimination against women. “[Women] are the under-the-radar and under-valued cogs in the bigger wheels of the formal economy,” she said. “Advancing women’s equality in total could bring a potential boost of 28 trillion U.S. dollars to global annual GDP by 2025.”Their comments come less than a week after International Women’s Day and the Day Without A Woman, where women worldwide went on strike, rallied and wore red in solidarity.

12,THE WORLDPOST,Syrian Government Blocks Lifesaving Aid For Hundreds Of Thousands Of People,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-humanitarian-aid-report_us_58c6be76e4b0d1078ca847cc,A new report lays out why many are still not getting crucial humanitarian assistance.,2017-03-14,"Three years ago, activists were protesting outside U.N. headquarters in New York over the holdups in delivering humanitarian aid to Syrian people.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c80d882700003800749dd6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the war in Syria drags into its seventh year, civilians remain stuck in the crosshairs. President Bashar Assad harms his own people in ways that are sometimes overt and brutish, such as barrel-bombing entire neighborhoods in large cities like Aleppo. Other tactics are less violent, but they are just as destructive.A Physicians for Human Rights study, released on Tuesday, found that Syrian authorities arbitrarily restrict vital United Nations humanitarian access to suffering civilians.“Millions of Syrians are trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, often surrounded by landmines and snipers, with no access to food, medical supplies, or services ― the vast majority imprisoned by Syrian government forces,” said the report titled “Access Denied.”The government not only systematically blocks entrance to areas that it controls, but also arbitrarily places limits on the amount of aid that can be delivered, according to the study. As a result, people are dying from starvation and lack of medical care. Physicians for Human Rights combed through U.N. reports from 2016 to determine how many people actually received aid each month compared to how many people the various humanitarian agencies requested access to, researcher Elise Baker told The Huffington Post.“We wanted to add a narrative around the data the U.N. is already providing. It’s still so clear that this aid is not sufficient,” said Baker, the author of the report.Take the Ezzadine family from Madaya, Syria. Their 11-year-old son, Yaman, was dying from meningitis, a curable disease, because he had zero access to medical care in the city under siege by the Assad regime. Several other family members also contracted the illness. They survived only because they were finally evacuated to Damascus.The conditions in Madaya drew international outrage early last year after photos emerged of emaciated residents suffering from malnutrition and starvation.The Assad government finally agreed to a new two-step approval process for U.N. aid deliveries in April 2016, the report said. And that helped. Last year, 131 U.N. convoys provided aid to more than 1 million people in besieged and hard-to-reach areas across Syria, according to the report.But there are still major gaps in aid delivery, the study said. From May through December 2016, the Syrian government was refusing the U.N. access to one-third of the people in those areas on average.“That left, on average, nearly 340,000 people without any hope of humanitarian aid each month, many for months on end,” the report said.“You might have access approved but it’s not actually being completed,” Baker explained. “We really need to change the conversation and stop pretending like this new process is sufficient.”Yaman Ezzadine is but one example of how the Assad government’s actions are harming children. Last year was the deadliest year on record for Syrian children since the war began in 2011, according to a UNICEF report released Monday. Almost 6 million children now depend on humanitarian aid, a twelve-fold increase from 2012.Outraged by what’s happening in Syria? The Huffington Post put together a list of ways to support the innocent people suffering."

He has talked of rampant crime created by “Moroccan scum” and urged for closing borders to stop terror. Polls show many Dutch voters ― including those whose support has put Wilders’ Party for Freedom in a close race to win the vote ― fear that Dutch society is in danger. Around half of the Dutch view non-Western immigration as threatening to their way of life, according to an Ipsos survey released last month.Wilders has capitalized on these attitudes through appeals to “make the Netherlands ours again,” and calls to ban immigration from predominantly Muslim countries. His rhetoric has both played to voters’ fears and mainstreamed his far-right populist narrative that “we need to save Western civilization” from Islam ― moving other parties to adopt his rhetoric. In January, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte even wrote an open letter criticizing people who don’t adapt to Dutch customs and telling them to “act normal or go away.” But Wilders and his ilk have created a public perception that doesn’t align with reality. The politician has described the refugee crisis in Europe as an “Islamic invasion.” In 2016, however, there were two-thirds fewer asylum claims in the Netherlands than the government expected ― 31,000 compared to initial estimates of over 90,000.Polls also show that Dutch people believe they have a far greater Muslim population than they actually do, falsely assuming that around 19 percent of the country is Muslim. In fact, just 6 percent of the Netherlands’ population is Muslim ― despite years of guest worker programs from Turkey and Morocco that have created immigration ties.The Netherlands breaks down its immigration statistics into different categories, one of which is non-Western immigrants, who as of 2015 make up about 12 percent of its population of 17 million people. Non-Western immigrants include those from Turkey, as well as all from Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and a number of Asian nations. Concerns around issues of integration and immigration in the Netherlands are not entirely baseless. But while non-Western immigrants are overrepresented in crime figures, according to a 2016 study from the Netherlands Institute for Social Research, these numbers are falling. Unemployment for non-Western immigrants is also almost three times as high as for the native Dutch population, a gap the study says is partly caused by discrimination. The study shows, however, that education levels among non-Western immigrations have been on the rise since 2008, and language proficiency has increased as well.Although issues of immigration and integration are prominent in the Dutch campaign, they are not the only reason that voters have turned away from establishment parties. Like many European nations, the Netherlands underwent a period of unpopular austerity measures after the global financial crisis. These policies hit lower and middle class workers the hardest, fueling resentment of the European Union and the Dutch political class.While anti-EU and anti-elite sentiments remain, the economy is now doing better. Unemployment is at a five-year low, and the economy has a higher growth rate than both the EU average and the United States. And despite all the talk of streets becoming unsafe, crime has been falling for years. Around a third of Dutch jail cells are empty, which has led to the government renting out the space to other states. Unlike France, Belgium and a host of other countries, the Netherlands has also not suffered any major terror attacks inspired or directed by the Islamic State. Despite these trends, Wilders has been able to convince a significant portion of the electorate that the nation is under siege, threatened by immigration, Islam and the EU. This is a stark change for the Netherlands, which has long promoted itself as an accepting and tolerant nation. Although debates around immigration, the economy and integration are normal for states, the Dutch election has shown how successful Wilders and the far right have become in framing these discussions.Due to the country’s multiparty system, Wilders has a slim chance of actually governing even if he does manage to win the Dutch election, and he has also seen his poll numbers fall in recent days. But some of his policies and his narrative of a nation in decline have already caught on, despite all facts that contradict them."

Kilby, commander of the Carrier Strike Group 1, told reporters, referring to South Korea as the Republic of Korea.North Korea said the arrival of the U.S. strike group in the seas off the east of the Korean peninsula was part of a “reckless scheme” to attack it.“If they infringe on the DPRK’s sovereignty and dignity even a bit, its army will launch merciless ultra-precision strikes from ground, air, sea and underwater,” the North’s state news agency KCNA said.North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.“On March 11 alone, many enemy carrier-based aircraft flew along a course near territorial air and waters of the DPRK to stage drills of dropping bombs and making surprise attacks on the ground targets of its army,” KCNA said.Last week, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles into the sea off Japan in response to annual U.S.-South Korea military drills, which the North sees as preparation for war.The murder in Malaysia last month of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s estranged half-brother has added to a sense of urgency to efforts to handle North Korea.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to make his first visit to South Korea on Friday.Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said President Donald Trump’s administration was re-evaluating its North Korea strategy and “all options are on the table.”CHINESE OPPOSITIONCompounding regional tension, China is vehemently opposed to the deployment in South Koreaof an advanced U.S. anti-missile system.The United States and South Korea say the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system is for defense against North Korea, but China fears its powerful radar can probe deep into its territory and compromise its security.The United States began to deploy the system a week ago, a day after North Korea launched its latest four missile tests.South Korean and U.S. troops began the large-scale joint drills, which are billed as defensive in nature, on March 1.The exercise last year involved about 17,000 American troops and more than 300,000 South Koreans. South Korea has said this year’s exercise would be of a similar scale.The United States has also started to deploy “Gray Eagle” attack drones to South Korea, a U.S. military spokesman said on Monday.China says the exercises do nothing to ease tension.Last week, it called on North Korea to stop its weapons tests and for South Korea and the United States to stop their drills.“We hope the relevant side can respect the security concerns of countries in the region, can take a responsible attitude and do more to benefit the easing of tension, rather than irritating each other,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing, referring to the United States.(Additional reporting by Hyunyoung Yi, Ben Blanchrd in BEIJING; Writing by James Pearson; Editing by Robert Birsel and Clarence Fernandez)"

Right now, there are really two kinds of research. One is basic research, fundamental inquiry about how to make democracies and non-democratic states work. And on the other hand, you have research in public policy that addresses very specific types of policy questions.It’s not that either of those are bad by any stretch. The problem is that the bridge between those two is very narrow, and there’s not a lot of support between them.So what’s missing? What type of political science research or work needs more study and attention?Our own research [for example] addresses basic questions about persuasion in democratic politics, but does so in a way that is intended to help members of Congress do a better job of representing their constituents. Who shows up? How do citizens become informed about politics? Who changes their minds and why?What ends up happening is quite a bit of the basic research gets done without an orientation toward its potential policy implications, and a lot of policy work gets done at too much of a distance from what we know about the basic mechanisms and institutions of politics. Researchers don’t spend a lot of time trying to draw the connections out.Did your research answer that question about how members of Congress can better represent their constituents? So we did experiments pairing real sitting members of Congress with their constituents in [electronic] town halls that we ourselves designed.We found that if we can prompt people to think about themselves in their roles as citizens along with other citizens, then they answer questions as if the question is “What should we do together?” ― [as opposed to] a lot of standard public opinion polling that isolates people and prompts people to answer a question in terms of “what do I want.”[The town halls we designed] prompted more of a republican (with a small ‘r’) government, where people were engaged substantively on the issues to inform democratic practice.A lot of that has been crowded out of political life as the country has grown and congressional districts have grown and the complexity of the problems we are facing has grown. It’s harder to get to this level of direct interaction between elected officials and their constituents. Members will meet with their constituents occasionally ― in Washington, in their districts or in town halls. But town halls [tend to] primarily be about constituents airing out grievances or rallying support.And the difference between that emphasis can be profound in how people behave. Their expressions of opinions, their rationale, their tolerance with disagreement and their willingness to learn all shift.But there’s still politics in politics. How would having more “bridging” research actually help make it less divisive?Recently a lot of the applied political science work has been done primarily in the areas of campaigns and elections. We’ve learned a lot in political science about how to persuade people and how to motivate people to vote. And a fair bit of that research has rolled out into campaigns and elections. It undergirds the strategies that elected officials and candidates use to win their campaigns.Part of what we’re calling for is to use that knowledge also in the service of government ― so not just for getting into power, but for using that power. How do you do a better job of representing your constituents while you’re in office?

The Constitution guarantees the right to address the government for redress of grievances.

19,POLITICS,House Democrats On Record-Breaking Fundraising Pace,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-democrats-dccc-february-2017_us_58c764e0e4b081a56deee921,February is not usually a huge fundraising month. And yet ...,2017-03-14,House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has her eye on dozens of now-GOP congressional seats that could be vulnerable in the midterm election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c7710b2700003800749c91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee brought in more money this February than they have in any other previous February, continuing a record-breaking fundraising pace that is keeping up with Republicans and their own unprecedented totals.While the National Republican Congressional Committee took in $10.5 million this February ― topping the GOP high of $8.3 million in February 2003 ― Democrats were just behind the NRCC with $9.8 million last month. That is almost double the DCCC’s previous February record of $5.1 million in 2015, and Democratic aides suggested their total is actually more impressive given the Republican control of Congress and the White House.For comparison, these aides point out, the DCCC was out-raising the NRCC in February of 2009 by a much larger percentage (though the dollar-to-dollar gap is less significant: Republicans raised $2 million in February 2009 and the DCCC raised $3.5 million).Still, Democrats also argue that a significant chunk of their fundraising for this month ― $6.4 million ― is coming from small-dollar donors. Online donations are also up by 300 percent from February 2015, when the DCCC raised $1.5 million. Republicans did not release details of their breakdown, but Democratic aides suggested much of the GOP’s success is attributable to high-dollar fundraisers with Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who shipped over $4.4 million to the NRCC in February.The record pace from both Republicans and Democrats could portend a number of high-dollar midterm races, as Democrats try to take back the House in a backlash to President Donald Trump and the GOP’s aggressive agenda. Democrats have already released a list of 59 Republican seats they have their eyes on, including 23 in districts that presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016.While many of those targeted seats may be more of a dream than a reality, Democrats see the early fundraising numbers as another indication of a potential political movement that has jammed congressional phone lines and produced overflow crowds for GOP town halls.“The DCCC’s record-breaking fundraising is a reflection of the groundswell of early support and energy behind House Democrats,” DCCC Spokesman Tyler Law said in a press release. “Such strong support from our donors ― including massive growth in our grass-roots base ― will continue to benefit our committee and our candidates as we work to maximize gains on an expanded battlefield.”"

Perhaps you thought they might’ve done so in order to recreate the images of such esteemed artists.Nope. They traveled to each location so that Schubert could photograph Schmidt in der Beek painting the patterns on his shirts and sweaters.The fruits of their labor have been compiled into the hilarious book “Und im Sommer tu ich Malen” (which translates to “And in Summer, I do Painting”), published by Edition Taube.Schubert told The Huffington Post that the duo came up with the off-the-cuff idea in 2009, shortly after they met hiking the Zillertal Alps in Austria. Both had gone on the hike with the intention of creating art, so Schubert just happened to have his medium format camera on hand and Schmidt in der Beek had his canvases and easel.Yet, once Schmidt in der Beek sat down to paint and looked on at the vast landscape, his artistic intuition went in a completely different direction.“Confronted with the immenseness of the mountains and the littleness of Hank’s canvasses, Hank decided to paint what’s nearest to him instead of what’s afield and giant,” Schubert told HuffPost.In other words, he painted the pattern on his shirt, and Schubert captured it with his camera.The results of their first encounter — and a four-week adventure throughout Europe — take the form of an amusing project that celebrates the joy of creating art while poking fun at the pretentiousness of it, as well.And the very fabric of the idea is undeniably funny:"
21,POLITICS,Steve King’s Anti-Immigrant Comments Aren’t New. But His Support In The White House Is.,Dana Liebelson and Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-king-donald-trump-immigration_us_58c807e0e4b0428c7f1347da,Donald Trump's team has echoed the congressman's apocalyptic arguments.,2017-03-14,"Rep. Steve King is interviewed by NBC News in the rotunda of Russell Building on Jan. 3, the first day of the 115th Congress.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c80a372c00002100fee496.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has been widely condemned this week after tweeting on Sunday that “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” Some Republicans, including the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), rebuked the congressman. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights leader, called the tweet “racist.”But King had a few supporters ― former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, for example, was happy with his comments ― and he didn’t apologize. Instead, he defended his stance, tweeting on Monday a riff on President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan: “Let’s Make Western Civilization Great Again!” This was not terribly surprising, as King has been making similar arguments — and attracting support from white nationalists — for years.The only difference is that there are now people in the White House who share some of his views. Trump, White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon, policy advisers Steve Miller and Sebastian Gorka, and national security official Michael Anton have echoed King’s apocalyptic anti-immigration arguments, and they’re advancing policies for which he has long advocated.Neither King’s office nor the White House responded to requests for comment.Bannon used his position as executive chair of Breitbart News to advance an anti-immigrant message. King was a repeat guest on the “Breitbart News Daily” radio show, and Bannon introduced the lawmaker as “a mentor to me.” On multiple episodes of the show, Bannon compared the refugee crisis to The Camp of the Saints, a French novel from the 1970s that is popular with white nationalists. King recommended the book on Monday during an interview with “The Jan Mickelson Show” on WHO Radio in Des Moines, Iowa. Its message is identical to that of King’s tweet: Nonwhite immigrants are invaders who will lead to the end of Western civilization.Bannon also used the Breitbart platform to call the refugee crisis a “Muslim invasion” that “didn’t just happen by happenstance.” He asked radio guests whether the U.S. and Europe should shut down mosques, deport undocumented immigrants and slow legal immigration. Bannon’s major concern, as he told it, was: “Does the West have the will to win? Do they have the will to exist? Are we in a mode of self-surrender?”Under Bannon, Breitbart also promoted right-wing nationalists in the U.S. and abroad. (Bannon called the site a “platform for the alt-right,” a phrase often used as a euphemism for white nationalism.) One far-right leader who received especially fawning coverage from the site was Geert Wilders, a Dutch politician who King praised in his tweet on Sunday. Wilders has his own author page on Breitbart, where he has claimed Islam “is primarily a totalitarian political ideology aiming for world domination.” He also attended a Breitbart “Gays for Trump” bash thrown by Milo Yiannopoulos, who was the site’s tech editor at the time. Bannon and other members of the Trump administration have eagerly promoted King’s policy priorities. King boasted in January that John Kelly, Trump’s secretary of homeland security, visited his office and discussed national security in front of a model border wall. And after promising to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. during his campaign, one of Trump’s first actions as president was to enact a temporary ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries ― a policy that King argued he has the legal authority to enact and that Wilders has also backed.Miller, Trump’s senior policy adviser, pushed for and and defended the travel ban. He worked closely with white nationalist Richard Spencer as a student, Mother Jones reported last year. (Miller has denied this, telling Mother Jones that he has “absolutely no relationship with Mr. Spencer” and “completely repudiate[s] his views.”) Miller also reportedly denounced multiculturalism.While writing under a pseudonym, national security official Anton argued last year that diversity is a “source of weakness” and that Islam is “incompatible with the modern West.” He also defended a group that invoked anti-Semitic stereotypes as “unfairly maligned.” Anton called The Huffington Post’s story on those passages “completely outrageous but sadly typical of the slander culture perfected by the modern Left.” He did not immediately respond to a request for comment on King’s views. Gorka, another Trump adviser and former Breitbart News national security editor, has also cited Europe as a warning to the United States. “If you look at Sweden, if you look at what’s occurred in France, Germany, the U.K., all of that put together is more than enough justification to explain, for example, our executive order on migration and refugee status,” he said last month. Gorka was born in Britain to Hungarian parents, and previously worked in Hungarian politics with former members of the anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant party Jobbik. He now denies he knew the political background of the Hungarian politicians he formed a political party with.Trump himself has praised King — and is helping turn some of his ideas into policy. They appeared together in Iowa in 2014 so that Trump could endorse King for Congress. King called Trump a friend and noted they share a “common cause” — the rule of law, which King connected to securing the border. Trump, in return, referred to King as “a special guy” and “a smart person with really the right views on almost everything.” Trump has even echoed King’s ideas about European migration. “It’s terrible what they have done to some of these countries. They’re going to destroy ― I mean, they are destroying Europe,” he said last May on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” He also argued last year that Muslims have trouble assimilating into the United States.“It’s almost, I won’t say nonexistent, but it gets to be pretty close,” he said during an interview with Fox News. “I’m talking about second and third generation. They come, they don’t ― for some reason, there’s no real assimilation.” King, the president and Trump’s team are wrong about Muslim immigrants and assimilation. Although many American Muslims are relatively recent immigrants, they are highly assimilated into American society, according to two Pew Research Center surveys of thousands of Muslims. “U.S. Muslims — 81 percent of whom are immigrants or children of immigrants — are the most socially liberal and religiously tolerant in the world and becoming more so with each passing year,” David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, wrote last year. “Muslim Americans are quickly adopting the views of other Americans.”After sidestepping a question on Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that President Trump disagreed with King’s tweet.“This is not a point of view he shares,” Spicer said. “He believes he is the president for all Americans.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Here is Trump, at the beginning of his presidential term, in the midst of the need to do something with health care reform, pinned by campaign promises and like-minded Congressional majorities looking to move swiftly on the matter. Obama also faced the same pressures to get a bill over the goal line. Health care reform was one of his most notable campaign pledges and it took a hard-won Senate super-majority ― which only finally came about with the defection from the GOP of Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Penn.) and the eventual arrival of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), coupled with Democratic domination in the House.It is, perhaps, a very narrow comparison, but it sits there waiting to be made. Right now, Trump faces the same urgency, the same complications, and the same uncertainty about what can be wrought after the various interests of an often fractious pack of lawmakers are balanced and consensus reached. But there’s one notable absence from today’s proceedings. Where, pray tell, is the political peanut gallery calling on Trump to make his offering at the holy temple of bipartisanship?It’s worth pointing out because during the Obama era, the demand that he remain true to bipartisanship was constant. The entire notion of presidential “leadership,” during Obama’s tenure, was entirely contingent upon his willingness to break with those that had voted him into office and deliver policies that they would almost certainly despise, like deep and immiserating cuts to earned benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare.If Obama wasn’t trying to reach some sort of across-the-aisle grand bargain, then he was failing, in the eyes of pundits. And whenever Obama managed to deliver on middle-of-the-road policies, well ― those same pundits moved the goalposts. Journalist and political commentator Greg Sargent called it “the centrist dodge,” and it, too, was a constant feature of the Obama era.During the long and tortuous legislative process that eventually brought us the Affordable Care Act, the bipartisanship police pulled double-shifts on their beat, raising a hue and cry whenever it looked like developments weren’t going to yield the optimal center-right health care package. The media practically fulminated against the so-called “public option,” dismissing the strong and consistent public support for it out of hand. Whenever it seemed like the Democrats might have to take a parliamentary short-cut ― like the brief flirtation with “deem and pass,” the Beltway press erupted in a chorus of disapproval. The commentariat’s benchmark for what constituted a properly legislated health care reform bill was probably best articulated by the late Washington Post journalist David Broder, who suggested that anything that managed to accrue less than 70 votes in the Senate could not possibly be deemed legitimate.Of course, in making these specific demands, the media’s bipartisanship fanboys had a pretty powerful ally ― Obama himself, who seemed to feel an otherworldly compulsion to chase the favor of Beltway pundits.During the run-up to the passage of Obamacare, the 44th president was solicitous, almost to a fault, of bipartisan involvement, beginning with the fact that his own policy vision was essentially cribbed wholesale from former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential candidate. But Obama didn’t necessarily demand to be the sole solutioneer on the health care innovation mission. In fact, the whole reason the legislative process was so long and tortuous was because Obama encouraged other ideas and spent a considerable amount of time trying to win the votes of Republicans.That’s how, alongside Obama’s own plan, the late Sen. Bob Bennett (R-Utah) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) were permitted to develop their own plan simultaneously. Also receiving blessings was Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and his bipartisan “Gang Of Six,” which ultimately failed to do much more beyond filling the Montana senator’s coffers with the money of health care lobbyists. Along the way, Obama bent over backward trying to win the approval of Republicans like Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and then-Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) ― to no avail. The only thing these sops to bipartisanship earned Obama was the extra stress of watching Republican Scott Brown win a Massachusetts Senate seat, which briefly imperiled the entire effort. And even after Brown arrived in D.C., Obama wouldn’t give up hope on winning over some GOP legislators. It wasn’t until his February 2010 Health Care Summit at Blair House wrapped up, having failed to break the impasse, that a weary White House accepted that the administration would be going it alone.Obama was probably taking these actions because he had, perhaps foolishly, promised to establish a “new tone” in Washington, D.C., and reach out to Republicans on policy matters. His urge to satisfy the High Priests of Bipartisanship brought the Obama administration to some of its most dangerous points, such as the near-disastrous legitimization of policy bargaining over the debt ceiling, as well as the folly of the Budget Control Act ― including its doomed-to-fail super committee and the budget sequestration that was the consequence of that failure. In fact, it was Obama himself who gave Broder his 70-votes-or-bust ammunition when he said he’d “rather have 70 votes in the Senate for a bill that gives him 85 percent of what he wants rather than a 100 percent satisfactory bill that passes 52 to 48.”Trump has never really promised bipartisanship to anybody. That alone might explain why there hasn’t been a similar call from pundits. Well, that and the fact that the former reality show personality has given little indication that flattering pundits is one of his concerns. This is probably the best feature of Trump’s presidency; his complete disregard for pursuing a path that never made any of his policies more effective, all for the sake of pleasing a gaggle of wags who never gave him credit for the effort.Still, it’s interesting that no one is exactly beating those drums, during the Trump era, if only because the worst features of his presidency ― his ignorance, extremism, and serial norm-breaking practically begs the bipartisanship scolds to get off their fainting couches and wag a finger or two. It’s the sort of environment you’d expect institutionalists to loudly make their case, even if those institutions are largely superficial.But one thing that those who insisted on a push-to-the-center during the Obamacare legislative process can arguably hang their hats on is the fact that this push was probably what the process ultimately needed. No, he did not win over any Republicans to vote for the Affordable Care Act ― but the Democratic caucus Obama needed to win over was far from homogenous. Ultimately, to get enough votes to the Affordable Care Act signed into law, Obama had to satisfy former Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich), Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman and then-Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.). (After which, he still had to take Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) up in Air Force One to convince him to not abandon the bill over all of these concessions.)And this is something else that Trump suddenly has in common with Obama ― assuming that regular order in the Senate is going to hold, the only way Congressional Republicans can advance their repeal-and-replace goals is to do so partially, using budget reconciliation. But this move would merely zero out the funding mechanisms for the Affordable Care Act ― it wouldn’t “replace” the bill for the long term, and over the short term, it could create a market of notable uncertainty for insurers and hospitals.Trump would need Democratic votes to advance his replacement plan any further than that. So there’s never been a better time for that choir of Bipartisan Angels to strike up a chorus. And yet, the only voice to take up the song is Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), who is suggesting that Trump take an entirely different approach. “If you don’t get both parties together, nothing is sustainable,” he told “Meet The Press” Chuck Todd Sunday.Kasich, of course, has ulterior motives, having brought the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion to Ohio. Nevertheless, in the current alignment, Kasich is right ― no meaningful replacement for the Affordable Care Act is getting passed without Democratic votes. And if the old Beltway ways still matter to anyone, well, we’re much further away from that mythical 70 vote threshold.This is not to say that the drive for bipartisanship in outcomes is always preferable. It’s still very possible for 70 senators in this town to cock things up pretty badly. And bipartisan majorities are more apt than not to form a consensus around some really terrible ideas. But there’s no other direction for Trump to go in at the moment where health care is concerned. It’s either pass a bill with Democrat Senate votes or do nothing ― and doing nothing comes with risks. Maybe Trump reckons that the changes wrought through budget reconciliation will force Democrats’ hand. But maybe Democrats will simply opt to leave Trump on the hook for any unintended consequences.Knowing that, it sure seems weird that the people who spent the past eight years going blue in the face, insisting that Obama had to “lead” by constantly reaching for bipartisan compromise, even when he didn’t need to, have gone curiously silent now.Maybe all “bipartisanship” ever meant was that Democrats had to do all the compromising, and not the reverse. I suppose it’s not surprising.POSTSCRIPT: In a case of either lousy or impeccable timing, the first big shout for a bipartisan approach to Trump’s dilemma came in while this piece was being edited. Newsmax editor and Trump confidant Christopher Ruddy advises his friend to “ditch [the] freedom caucus” and “seek [a] bipartisan plan.” Referring to the plan of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as a “political death wish,” Ruddy outlines a seven-point plan that he imagines can achieve bipartisan support, that blends expanded Medicaid, tort reform, and health savings accounts.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.

24,POLITICS,Coal Country Republicans Set to Cut Mine Safety Inspections,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/coal-country-republicans-state-mine-inspections_us_58c85cade4b022994fa2eeca,They must have a lot of faith that Trump will keep miners safe.,2017-03-14,"Miners' boots sit atop their lockers before the start of an afternoon shift at a coal mine near Gilbert, West Virginia.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c8601a1d000037037ce6e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republican legislators in Kentucky and West Virginia seem to have a newfound respect for the federal government and its regulatory abilities. In fact, they trust Washington so much that they’re willing to relinquish much of their own oversight of coal mine safety to the feds.A bill approved by Kentucky lawmakers Tuesday would cut back the number of state inspections of coal mines per year. It would allow the state’s Department of Natural Resources to substitute some of those safety inspections with what’s known as safety analyses. Conveniently for coal operators, the analyses do not pose the threat of citations and fines.The measure also slashes the number of required electrical inspections from two to one.“It’s really infuriating. It really decimates the mine safety agency,” said Tony Oppegard, a mine safety expert and Kentucky-based lawyer who represents miners.Noting that the Kentucky statehouse is under full GOP control for the first time in decades, Oppegard added, “I’m kind of surprised they didn’t just eliminate all inspections.”Leave that to West Virginia.Under a proposal introduced there over the weekend, the state’s inspections of coal mines would henceforth be considered “compliance visits.” As the Charleston Gazette-Mail’s Ken Ward Jr. explains, a state official on such a visit could not issue any citations unless there was an immediate danger. The proposal “essentially eliminates any meaningful role for the state” in enforcing mine safety laws, Ward writes.The Kentucky measure is headed to the desk of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who’s expected to sign it. The West Virginia bill is only now under consideration by a Senate committee. As in Kentucky, Republicans control both chambers of the West Virginia statehouse. The state’s governor, Jim Justice, is a billionaire coal operator and a Democrat.The backers of those proposals argue that state inspections can afford to be cut in part because federal officials do their own inspections. Under federal law, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which is part of the Labor Department, inspects every active coal mine at least four times each year.But Kentucky and West Virginia have long had their own safety programs as well, under the rationale that the states share an obligation to protect miners and prevent disasters like the one at Upper Big Branch, which claimed 29 West Virginia miners in 2010. Advocates like Oppegard argue that the state inspections are essential to keeping mines safe, since federal officials alone don’t have all the resources and legal powers necessary to adequately monitor all the nation’s mines.If anything, federal policing of the coal industry will probably be scaled back under the Trump administration. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have been rapidly peeling back all manner of regulations on businesses, including coal companies. Trump’s new commerce secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, owned the Sago mine in West Virginia in 2006 when an explosion there cost the lives of 12 miners.Although the White House has not yet installed a new head of mine safety, Trump had complained on the campaign trail that mining regulations were too onerous. Coal operators could barely survive, he lamented. “I have friends that own the mines,” he said at a campaign event in Pennsylvania. “I mean, they can’t live.”"
25,POLITICS,Texas Senate Gives OK To Bill Curbing Transgender Bathroom Access,"Jon Herskovitz, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-senate-gives-ok-to-bill-curbing-transgender-bathroom-access_us_58c8768fe4b01c029d773af7,The bill would require people to use restrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate.,2017-03-14,"Visitors stand in the rotunda of the Texas State Capitol as the state senate debates the #SB6 bathroom bill in Austin, Texas, U.S., March 14, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c879151d00001d107ce754.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Texas Senate on Tuesday preliminarily approved a Republican-backed bill that would restrict access to public bathrooms by transgender people over criticism from Democrats who said it was unnecessary, discriminatory and economically destructive.In a 21-10 vote almost along party lines, the Republican-dominated Senate gave preliminary approval to the Texas Privacy Act.The bill would require people to use restrooms that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, not the gender with which they identify.Its backers said it is a common-sense approach to provide safety and keep sexual predators out of bathrooms.After final approval, seen as a formality and expected on Wednesday, the bill goes to the Republican-controlled House, where analysts say its chances of passage are slim due to concern about the legislation’s potential economic impact.Allowing transgender people to use public bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity rather than their birth gender has become the latest flashpoint in the long U.S. battle over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights.“It is about a privacy issue for us women, for boys, for girls,” the bill’s sponsor, Republican Senator Lois Kolkhorst, told the body.Democratic Senator John Whitmire said the bill was fatally flawed and would force transgenderpeople like a bald transgender man with a beard to use a woman’s bathroom. He added that there are some 30 statutes in Texas law that punish sexual predators.“We don’t need your bill to prosecute them,” he said in Senate debate.The bill is similar to one enacted last year in North Carolina. That law prompted economic boycotts and the loss of sporting events that were estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars.In January, the Texas Association of Business released a study which said that if the legislation were enacted, it could cost Texas as much as $8.5 billion in the state’s gross domestic product and the loss of more than 185,000 jobs in the first year alone.Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Tea Party Christian who is a prominent backer of the Texas bill, has challenged the survey.Nearly 70 businesses, including some of the state’s biggest employers such as American Airlines Group Inc, sent a letter to Republican leaders this month asking them to reject the bill on the grounds that it would “legalize discrimination.”"

Sixty-five percent of those who say the unemployment rate is ‘not so good’ or ‘poor’ say that Trump deserves little or none of the blame, while 61 percent who say the rate is ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ say Trump deserves little or none of the credit….Democrats polled still have a rosier view of the current numbers ― 40 percent say the unemployment rate is good or excellent, compared to 33 percent of Republicans who say the same. Opinions are far more sharply split along the lines of the 2016 election, with 52 percent of voters who supported Hillary Clinton, but just 27 percent of those who backed Trump, saying the current numbers are good.” [HuffPost] Few are confident in the official unemployment rate - More from the survey: “Just 29 percent of Americans polled say they’re confident that the currently reported 4.7 percent unemployment rate is correct. Forty percent say they’re not confident, and another 31 percent say they’re unsure ― a finding that tracks with the public’s widespread distrust of most major institutions. Among those who lack confidence, 82 percent believe that the real unemployment rate is actually higher. Democrats are somewhat less likely than Republicans to say they trust the latest numbers, although the difference pales in comparison to the partisan splits seen on other issues….That’s a shift from a previous survey taken during the Obama administration. While few Americans then were inclined to believe the official numbers either, a Politico-Harvard poll taken in September showed that Democrats were the most likely to express faith in the government’s data.” INITIAL REACTIONS ARE DIVIDED ON REPUBLICANS’ NEW HEALTH CARE BILL - HuffPollster: “Initial public reactions to the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act are divided, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds, with a narrow plurality of Americans saying the proposal would mark a step down. While 27 percent of Americans expect the new health care bill, if it passes, would be better than the current law, 32 percent think it would be worse, and 13 percent that it would be about the same. Another 28 percent aren’t sure….While a majority of Americans believe Trump backs the bill, just 11 percent say that Republicans in Congress are united in support of it. Fifty-eight percent are aware that some Republicans are opposed. Nevertheless, with much about the Republican proposal still up in the air, public opinion divides largely, if not universally, along partisan lines. Democrats are 43 percentage points likelier than Republicans, at 68 percent to 25 percent, to favor the current health care law.” [HuffPost] One reason for the partisan split - With relatively little information about the bill’s effects at hand ― CBO estimates weren’t available at the time the survey was fielded ― many respondents may have looked to partisan cues to guide their opinions. Such cues were present in the survey, which identified the current law as “President Obama’s health care law,” and the proposal under consideration as being recently released by “Republican leaders in the House of Representatives.”How the divides break down along other demographic lines - Older Americans, many of whom would see their insurance rates rise under the new plan, are among the most supportive, largely because they’re also the most likely to be Republican ― 38 percent of those over age 65, and 30 percent of those aged 45-64 think the new bill would be an improvement, compared to about a fifth of those under 45. There’s less variation across income levels, although Americans in households making under $50,000 annually are less likely expect the bill to be an improvement than in wealthier households.TRUMP’S NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER ON IMMIGRATION? MOSTLY THE SAME AS THE OLD ONE, AMERICANS SAY - HuffPollster: “President Donald Trump’s revised executive order on immigration strikes a plurality of the public as being largely the same as his initial order, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey finds….Forty-three percent of Americans say the order is not very different from the old executive order, while 24 percent say it’s better and 7 percent that it’s worse. Trump voters, who overwhelmingly backed the plan to begin with, are the most likely to consider it an improvement, with 46 percent saying the new order is better and 36 percent that it’s not much different. In contrast, two-thirds of Hillary Clinton voters see the new order as largely unchanged from the previous version, with just 18 percent considering it an improvement.” [HuffPost] Americans’ attitudes toward refugees are complicated.

Catherine Cortez Masto said ""racist rhetoric"" is feeding hate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c80e991d00001d107ce507.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) said Tuesday that “racist” comments like the ones made by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) are having consequences across the country, feeding hate unlike anything she’s ever seen. King came under fire this week when he tweeted an apparent endorsement for white nationalism while expressing support for Geert Wilders, a candidate for prime minister in the Netherlands. “Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies,” King said.Cortez Masto, the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate, called King’s comments “offensive.”When pressed on the limited condemnation by Republicans, Cortez Masto urged her colleagues and others in positions of power to speak out against King more.“Words have consequences and anybody in a position, and has a platform, and abuses that position is concerning,” Cortez Masto told a small group of Hispanic reporters on Tuesday.Cortez Masto said a Mexican consulate in her home state was recently vandalized ― a swastika spray-painted on it. And similar incidents happened to synagogues and elementary schools in Nevada. “I’ve never seen that before until now,” she said, citing her eight years as attorney general in the state. “Whether it’s the rhetoric coming out from the Trump administration, or people affiliated with that administration, or members of Congress who are continuing down this path of this racist rhetoric, it is having consequences. And anybody hearing it should step up and call it for what it is and hold it accountable so that people know that we’re not going to stand for it. And we are going to protect those who will be at the receiving end of that discriminatory racist rhetoric.”King doubled down on his comments on Monday, saying his “somebody else’s babies” comment was in response to what he considers a push for illegal immigration. “I want us to be looking at that, promoting the birth rate in America, restoring the rule of law, putting an end to illegal immigration and recognizing we need to be a country that’s pulled together on similar values,” he told CNN on Monday. “I’d like to see an America that’s just so homogenous that we look a lot the same from that perspective.”A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) issued a brief statement via email after King’s comments dominated the new cycle on Monday.“The speaker clearly disagrees and believes America’s long history of inclusiveness is one of its great strengths.”"
29,POLITICS,Defunding Planned Parenthood Would Leave Poor And Rural Women Without Care: CBO,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/defunding-planned-parenthood-cbo_us_58c80d75e4b0598c6699e0ab,The GOP's health care bill would likely lead to a spike in unplanned births.,2017-03-14,"Supporters of Planned Parenthood rally outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Detroit on Feb. 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c81ac91400001f0006f66a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― By defunding Planned Parenthood, the Republican plan to replace Obamacare would lead to 15 percent of low-income and rural women losing access to any kind of family planning services, the Congressional Budget Office predicted on Monday.The GOP’s American Health Care Act bars Medicaid from reimbursing Planned Parenthood for health services provided to low-income women because some of Planned Parenthood’s clinics offer abortions. This would force more than half of its 2.5 million patients to look for birth control and family planning services elsewhere. In rural areas where there simply aren’t other options, many women will be left without care. The CBO report explains:To the extent that there would be reductions in access to care under the legislation, they would affect services that help women avert pregnancies. The people most likely to experience reduced access to care would probably reside in areas without other health care clinics or medical practitioners who serve low-income populations. CBO projects that about 15 percent of those people would lose access to care.The CBO estimates that in addition to leaving 24 million Americans uninsured, the GOP plan would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by $178 million in 2017. The program accounts for three-quarters of all public dollars spent on family planning and pays for nearly half of U.S. births.As The Huffington Post reported last week, the Republican health care plan would likely lead to a spike in unintended pregnancies and unplanned births by slashing women’s access to family planning services. This policy change would be a huge departure from Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, which drove unintended pregnancies down 18 percent and led to a record low abortion rate in the United States by making birth control essentially free for millions of women.“We’ve made tremendous gains in this country thanks to expanded access to reproductive health care and birth control,” said Dana Singiser, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood. “We are at a 30 year low in unintended pregnancies, and a historic low in teen pregnancies. Now is not the time to roll that progress back.”House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) says federally qualified community health centers outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics and therefore can absorb all of the provider’s patients. “They’re in virtually every community, providing the same kinds of services,” he insisted at a recent town hall meeting.But that’s not even true in his own district: In Wisconsin’s Racine and Walworth counties,​​ where nearly half of Ryan’s constituents live, there are two Planned Parenthood clinics and zero federally qualified community health centers offering family planning services.Some Republicans in Congress have warned that defunding Planned Parenthood will torpedo the GOP’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) already said they cannot support the plan if it slashes women’s access to health care, and Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) recently expressed concerns that the move would be too politically risky.“I think we should also separate out the Planned Parenthood issue from the broader health care issue,” he said. “I think health care reform is controversial and complex enough without Planned Parenthood. Why put it in? It makes this whole exercise more difficult.”"

Steve Daines (R-Mont.) found fault with House Republicans’ Obamacare replacement law on Monday after a report by the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that it would cause 24 million people to lose their insurance.“We need to do better,” Daines said in a statement to The Missoulian about the CBO report. “I want to see costs and premiums go down to make health care more affordable for Montana families.”Daines’ biggest worry about the non-partisan CBO analysis of the replacement law, known as the American Health Care Act, is that it did not show insurance premiums going down, the Montana senator told The Huffington Post.“I was concerned about the fact that the premiums are not going down,” Daines said. “If premiums go down, we’ll improve accessibility and improve coverage.”The critical comments from Daines, who is not up for reelection until 2020, speaks to the breadth of Republican dissatisfaction with the American Health Care Act. The law has drawn fire from both the conservative House Freedom Caucus and like-minded senators for not going far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act, as well as from more moderate Republican senators for rolling back too much of the original reform law’s coverage gains.In addition to Daines, Republican Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Dean Heller (Nev.) have all voiced concerns about how House Republicans’ replacement law would affect insurance coverage, affordability or other factors. Heller faces a tough reelection battle in 2018."

33,POLITICS,Republicans May Be Ready To Redefine Success On Obamacare,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republicans-obamacare-bill-house_us_58c86a53e4b09e52f55457bd,Call it a win if they manage to pass their repeal-and-replace bill in the House.,2017-03-14,Speaker Paul Ryan may have to settle for much less than repeal-and-replace.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c86af61d00001d107ce719.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With the GOP bill facing opposition from House conservatives, and a dismal Congressional Budget Office score stirring opposition from moderates and the Senate, Republicans seem to be scaling back the goals for their Obamacare repeal-and-replace.Instead of actually overhauling the Affordable Care Act, Republicans may now just be trying to pass a bill in the House ― with the recognition that the Senate will never agree to a House-passed plan and that rowdy House conservatives may never accept a Senate bill.“The focus of House leadership has been more about getting a bill out of the House that is unchanged and in keeping with the Better Way plan, instead of truly seeing to potential roadblocks that exist in the House and Senate,” one GOP House member told The Huffington Post on Tuesday.The lawmaker predicted that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and the White House would move the bill further to the right in an effort to get reluctant conservatives onboard. Such a move would open up the measure to more moderate objections, with centrist Republicans already expressing discomfort over projections that 24 million people would lose health insurance and provisions that phase out the Medicaid expansion. Still, conservatives have made it clear they won’t support the bill as is, so giving in to demands from the House Freedom Caucus may be the only way forward.Or there may be no way forward.President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that it’s in the political interest of Republicans to just let the Obamacare exchanges collapse. “Let it be a disaster, because we can blame that on the Dems,” Trump told governors two weeks ago, summing up a thought he’s expressed repeatedly.If Trump and some Republicans now think their best course of action is to do nothing and continue blaming problems with the health care system on Democrats, then perhaps the best cover they can offer their members is to move a GOP bill out of the House, watch it die in the Senate, and then spend the next two years blaming Senate Democrats in states that Trump won.In that scenario, voters fail to recognize that Republicans have the power to pass this bill without a single Democratic vote, and the ire over Obamacare doesn’t dissipate even though voters have seen the GOP alternative.If moderates knew that the House legislation would never go into effect, it might allow them to support the bill. It would become just another messaging vote.House Republican aides are already starting to blame the Senate for intransigence.“The question people should be looking at is whether Republican senators like Tom Cotton and Rand Paul are actually interested in repealing Obamacare, or whether they’re sabotaging this to preserve the Medicaid expansion in their states,” one senior House GOP aide told HuffPost on Tuesday. “These senators masquerading with conservative objections are too afraid to admit they want to keep Obamacare.”Arkansas (Cotton’s state) and Kentucky (Paul’s state) have been two of the biggest winners from the Medicaid expansion, so passing a bill that is projected to make $880 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade may not be in the interests of their constituents. But standing up for Obamacare, after Republicans have railed against the 2010 health care law for years, is basically political suicide. If the repeal-and-replace legislation simply went away, however, with senators opposing the plan because it’s insufficiently conservative, then expansion states like Arkansas and Kentucky would never feel the effects of the Republican plan.Again, House aides were happy to level the charge.One GOP leadership aide noted that Trump had backed the House legislation. “So,” the aide said, “senators who have spent the last couple of weeks grandstanding against this reality are going to need to decide whether they want to get serious and get this done, or be the ones responsible for keeping Obamacare in place. That’s the choice.”But that assumes the House can get this legislation out of their chamber. Even with conservative concessions, there will likely be a number of hardline Republicans who won’t support the basic structure of the bill. And with the CBO’s cheerless score ― and perhaps some more conservative changes ― moderates will have little incentive to vote for the House bill.You can easily name about a dozen conservatives who have come out strongly against the legislation and appear unwilling to support the bill even with changes. They include Reps. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Dave Brat (R-Va.), Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Steve King (R-Iowa), Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) and Ted Yoho (R-Fla.).Then there are a handful of more moderate members who look apt to vote against the bill or have already said they won’t support it. Put on that list Reps. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.), Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), John Katko (R-N.Y.), Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), and Rob Wittman (R-Va.).The defection of those lawmakers would be enough to sink the GOP bill in the House. And there are other House members who have expressed reservations.Which is all to say that even under the best circumstances, even if Trump gets actively behind the health care plan and pressures reluctant lawmakers, this is a tough sell.If Ryan and other GOP leaders can just get the bill out of the House, that would be a win for them, which is an amazing recalibration of expectations. Not so long ago, Republicans were promising the swift repeal of Obamacare and its replacement with a better plan that would be cheaper for everyone and expand coverage. Those promises seem to have fallen by the wayside. And in their place is another messaging vote."
34,POLITICS,GOP Health Bill Could Let Companies Pressure Workers To Give Genetic Test Results,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-health-bill-could-end-up-pressuring-employees-to-share-genetic-testing-results_us_58c731c5e4b0428c7f12a5e3,Your employer-based insurance premium could be higher if you decline.,2017-03-14,"Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) thinks opponents of the bill ""are spreading false information in a desperate attempt to deny employees the choice to participate in a voluntary program that can reduce health insurance costs and encourage healthy lifestyle choices,"" her spokeswoman said.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c735841d00001d107ce337.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Imagine your employer wants you to submit to genetic testing as part of a “workplace wellness” program. The testing is completely voluntary, your employer says. If you’re concerned about your privacy, no one can force you to take part.There’s just one catch: Declining to provide genetic testing results will cost you thousands of dollars each year in higher health insurance premiums. In that case, how voluntary would the program feel?Such a futuristic-seeming scenario may not be far off if a proposal moving through the GOP-controlled House becomes law. A Republican bill that made it out of committee last week would enable companies to withhold financial benefits from employees who don’t take part in genetic testing as part of a workplace wellness program. The committee measure passed, 22-17, on a party-line vote with all Democrats opposed. There is no equivalent bill yet in the Republican-controlled Senate, but such a proposal could become part of the health care overhaul now consuming Capitol Hill as Republicans try to repeal and “replace” the Affordable Care Act.If it finds its way into health care reform, the measure would provide employers with a carve-out from nondiscrimination and privacy laws when it comes to workplace wellness programs. Under current law, genetic testing can be part of a wellness program, but an employer can’t make it a condition of benefits.The GOP measure would allow that. It doesn’t mean your employer could force you to undergo such testing and share the results ― but your employer could essentially withhold money if you don’t. Dozens of health and privacy advocacy groups have come out against the bill.The risk of disclosure can extend beyond the worker’s health. In one case cited by the Labor Department, a job candidate was rejected after disclosing screening results that showed he carried a single genetic mutation for Gaucher’s disease, which meant only that he could pass the mutation on to a son. A spokeswoman for Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said the bill would not change the fact that employees could choose whether or not to participate in such a program.“Those who are opposed to the bill are spreading false information in a desperate attempt to deny employees the choice to participate in a voluntary program that can reduce health insurance costs and encourage healthy lifestyle choices,” she said. “We believe working families should be empowered with that choice, and so did the Obama administration. It is another sad reminder of just how extreme the Democrat Party and their liberal allies are becoming.”As The Huffington Post’s Jonathan Cohn has reported, workplace wellness programs have become a popular way for companies to try to save money on employee health care costs. In a typical program, a worker might provide her employer with a basic health screening ― cholesterol level, body-mass index ― as well as a rundown of her habits ― how much she exercises, whether she smokes, etc. In some cases, an employee might even agree to losing a certain amount of weight or hitting a blood pressure target. The idea behind those programs is to nudge employees toward a healthier lifestyle and prevent them from getting sick; that, in turn, would keep employers’ insurance costs down. In return for taking part, the employee gets anything from a small gift card to thousands of dollars in health care savings a year. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 83 percent of large employers offered wellness programs last year, and 42 percent of them came with financial incentives. Most programs had a maximum reward of a few hundred bucks. Setting aside whether or not these programs actually work, the money at stake raises the question of how voluntary they are. So far, the law has come clearly down on the side of businesses. Under President Barack Obama, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission set rules allowing companies to dangle incentives worth 30 percent of a worker’s insurance premium, deeming such arrangements voluntary. The implications of the bill were first reported by Stat reporter Sharon Begley. Jennifer Mathis, director of policy at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law in Washington, D.C., told Begley that the bill would “completely take away the protections of existing laws” ― namely, the genetic information protections in the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. The language of the new bill states that workplace wellness programs “shall be considered to be in compliance” with the relevant provisions of those laws.“While the information returned to employers would not include workers’ names,” Begley noted, “it’s not difficult, especially in a small company, to match a genetic profile with the individual.” Such arrangements would also put test results in the hands of the third-party firms that operate the wellness programs. House Republicans said the change would give employers “the legal certainty they need” to implement workplace wellness programs. They have dubbed the bill the “Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act.”Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the committee’s ranking Democrat, told HuffPost in a statement that the Republican bill would “coerce” workers into forking over sensitive medical and genetic information to their employers, “undermining key workplace civil rights.” “This is yet another policy proposal that will disproportionately harm sicker and older people, as well as those who have disabilities that may not be readily noticeable,” Scott said. “Information disclosed in these programs could also result in discrimination in employment.”"

Currently limited bus service in New York City should resume regularly scheduled service by Wednesday morning. In Staten Island, a pair of ponies were among those seen frolicking in the snow after escaping from a stable, DNAinfo reported. The animals were eventually collared by local police officers.Governors declared states of emergency in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Thousands of schools across the affected region were closed Tuesday, including all public schools in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.Strong winds resulted in coastal flooding in parts of New Jersey and Delaware. The tide reached 7.8 feet in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Tuesday morning, just shy of the 8-foot threshold where major flooding can occur, AP reported.The storm prompted airlines to cancel more than 6,000 flights this week, according to the airline-tracking website FlightAware. Amtrak suspended all Northeast Regional train service between New York and Boston.New York City’s subway continued to operate underground, while aboveground service was suspended at 4 a.m. Tuesday.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked residents to stay off the roads Tuesday, urging people to use mass transit if travel is absolutely necessary.“There’s no reason to be on the roads,” Cuomo tweeted. “It’s dangerous.”However, NYC tourists still hoping to catch a Broadway performance got some good news. Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, announced Tuesday that all Broadway shows would continue as scheduled that evening. “The show must go on,” St. Martin said.In Boston, where 5 to 8 inches of snow were expected, the MBTA offered reduced service while operating on a severe weather schedule. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) tweeted that state offices for non-emergency executive branch employees would be closed Tuesday. City officials said Boston schools would remain closed on Wednesday.By early afternoon, the storm had unloaded over a foot of snow on areas in Connecticut and Rhode Island. At around 2 p.m., Bradley International Airport, located 15 miles north of Hartford, Connecticut, recorded its second highest March snowfall total at 14.7 inches, according to the NWS.With 14.9 inches falling by 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Albany ranked it as one of top 10 biggest March snowstorms on record, the NWS reported. Winter storm Stella brought a new 24-hour snowfall record by 8 p.m. in Binghamton, New York, with 28.8 inches of snow in just one day.Thundersnow was reported in some areas, including parts of New York and Massachusetts. The NWS encouraged those who observed the unusual weather phenomenon to stay indoors.Roughly 1 to 3 inches of snow covered Washington, D.C., by early Tuesday before precipitation tapered off, the Weather Channel reported.

He was clearing snow off the tracks.As of Tuesday afternoon, blizzard warnings issued by the National Weather Service remained in effect for areas of western Massachusetts and northern New York and Connecticut. Temperatures across the region were predicted to be as low as 15 to 30 degrees below normal, threatening icy conditions for the Wednesday morning commute.The NWS forecast Tuesday evening that temperatures across most of the eastern third of the country would remain 10 to 25 degrees below average in the coming days. While heavy snows are expected to taper off, parts of northern New England may continue to see light snow into Thursday morning. Tara Silvetti, 38, spent Tuesday snowed in at home with her fiance and two teenage sons in Berwick, Pennsylvania, roughly 40 miles southwest of Scranton. By 3 p.m., Silvetti said, she measured at least 2 feet of snow.“[My sons] have never experienced anything like this before,” Silvetti told The Huffington Post.Silvetti said her family stocked up on groceries and fuel in the days leading up to the storm, but she was still shocked by how much snow actually fell.“Even a week or so ago, we were having mild temperatures,” she said. “My kids were wearing shorts. It felt like spring was coming. ... We thought this [weather] was all over with.”The powerful nor’easter emerged in the wake of a mild winter and record warm February. It was forecast to dump a total of 1 to 2 feet in the tri-state area, and wind gusts were expected to be as high as 50 miles per hour Tuesday.By 8:30 a.m., the weather service had lifted blizzard warnings for New York City, Long Island, coastal Connecticut and portions of New Jersey. Around 3 p.m., New York City had roughly 7 inches of snow, the Weather Channel reported.“Mother Nature is an unpredictable lady this morning,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) told “CBS This Morning” on Tuesday. “The storm actually has shifted. It shifted west. There’s less snowfall in New York City. ... There’s actually more in the Hudson Valley and western part of the state.”Cuomo added that New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were “basically closed.”The governor tweeted around 4:30 p.m. that the region’s Metro-North rail service would resume hourly service at 6 p.m. and run until 11 p.m. on the Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines. Currently limited bus service in New York City should resume regularly scheduled service by Wednesday morning. In Staten Island, a pair of ponies were among those seen frolicking in the snow after escaping from a stable, DNAinfo reported. The animals were eventually collared by local police officers.Governors declared states of emergency in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Thousands of schools across the affected region were closed Tuesday, including all public schools in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia.Strong winds resulted in coastal flooding in parts of New Jersey and Delaware. The tide reached 7.8 feet in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Tuesday morning, just shy of the 8-foot threshold where major flooding can occur, AP reported.The storm prompted airlines to cancel more than 6,000 flights this week, according to the airline-tracking website FlightAware. Amtrak suspended all Northeast Regional train service between New York and Boston.New York City’s subway continued to operate underground, while aboveground service was suspended at 4 a.m. Tuesday.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked residents to stay off the roads Tuesday, urging people to use mass transit if travel is absolutely necessary.“There’s no reason to be on the roads,” Cuomo tweeted. “It’s dangerous.”However, NYC tourists still hoping to catch a Broadway performance got some good news. Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, announced Tuesday that all Broadway shows would continue as scheduled that evening. “The show must go on,” St. Martin said.In Boston, where 5 to 8 inches of snow were expected, the MBTA offered reduced service while operating on a severe weather schedule. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) tweeted that state offices for non-emergency executive branch employees would be closed Tuesday. City officials said Boston schools would remain closed on Wednesday.By early afternoon, the storm had unloaded over a foot of snow on areas in Connecticut and Rhode Island. At around 2 p.m., Bradley International Airport, located 15 miles north of Hartford, Connecticut, recorded its second highest March snowfall total at 14.7 inches, according to the NWS.With 14.9 inches falling by 6 p.m. on Tuesday, Albany ranked it as one of top 10 biggest March snowstorms on record, the NWS reported. Winter storm Stella brought a new 24-hour snowfall record by 8 p.m. in Binghamton, New York, with 28.8 inches of snow in just one day.Thundersnow was reported in some areas, including parts of New York and Massachusetts. The NWS encouraged those who observed the unusual weather phenomenon to stay indoors.Roughly 1 to 3 inches of snow covered Washington, D.C., by early Tuesday before precipitation tapered off, the Weather Channel reported. Local government offices opened two hours late, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bower tweeted.Washington Metro trains ran less frequently, but were expected to continue running throughout normal hours of operation.The NWS ended weather advisories inside the Beltway by 2 p.m., though light flurries were forecast to continue into the evening. Snowfall accumulation totaled 10 inches in Frederick County, Maryland, less than 50 miles northwest of Washington.President Donald Trump met with D.C. public officials Monday night to discuss preparations for the impending storm.Just before 4 p.m. Tuesday, employees at Bacio’s Pizzeria, in Washington’s northeast neighborhood of Bloomingdale, could be found scraping snow from outdoor tabletops and preparing to open the Italian eatery for business. Lulu Lovano, the restaurant’s manager, told HuffPost that while the storm came as a bit of a surprise, it was not enough to keep him from opening.“We were definitely expecting more [snow] than this,” he said.Nina Golgowski, Chris D’Angelo, Lydia O’Connor and Rebecca Shapiro contributed reporting.This is a developing story and will be updated."

Steve King's chairmanship of a subcommittee for his white nationalist remarks.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c833721400001f0006f6fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is calling on House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republican leaders to remove Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) as chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Rights in the wake of the Iowa congressman’s white nationalist comments.Pelosi first called for King to be stripped of the powerful position after King praised Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders on Sunday for understanding that “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.”King subsequently refused to apologize for the remarks, saying Monday that, “If you go down the road a few generations, or maybe centuries, with the inter-marriage, I’d like to see an America that is just so homogenous that we look a lot the same.” Also on Monday, King told a radio show that “the Hispanics and the blacks will be fighting each other before” they overtake the white population in size.Pelosi reiterated her calls for his removal after it became clear he was unrepentant, she said in a Tuesday statement.“When Republican Congressman Steve King made his latest disgusting and racist statements, I called on Speaker Ryan and the Republican leadership to immediately strip his chairmanship of the Constitution Subcommittee,” Pelosi said. “Since then, Congressman Steve King has doubled down on his statements, so I am doubling down on mine.”Ryan’s office is not commenting on Pelosi’s demands, referring The Huffington Post to Ryan’s previous comments stating that he “clearly disagrees [with King] and believes America’s long history of inclusiveness is one its great strengths.”“We’ll get back to you on this just as soon as Nancy Pelosi responds to the grotesque sexual comment a member of her caucus made about a senior female White House aide. The hypocrisy is striking,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan.Strong was referring to a sexist joke that Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) made about White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.As chairman of the subcommittee, which is under the Judiciary Committee, King sets the panel’s agenda. Top committee posts are typically assigned based on members’ seniority, but committee and subcommittee chairs have been ousted due to their behavior in the past.Since he first made the white nationalist comments on Sunday, King has drawn criticism from elected officials in both parties, including Ryan.“This is not a point of view that [President Donald Trump] shares. He believes he’s the president for all Americans,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at his Tuesday news conference, referring to King’s remarks.Many of Trump’s advisers, however, including Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Michael Anton and Stephen Miller, share King’s apparent belief that the immigration of people of color somehow corrupts America’s essence. In his Monday radio interview, King even cited the book, The Camp of the Saints, a rabidly racist French novel from the 1970s that is a favorite of Bannon’s."

I’ll leave it to them to issue their report, but I think he feels very confident that [what] will ultimately come of this will vindicate him.”The House Intelligence Committee gave the Department of Justice until Monday to provide evidence of the claim, but on Monday afternoon, the DOJ said it needed more time.Since March 4, when Trump first tweeted the claim, which appeared to originate from right-wing conspiracy theories, Obama as well as several top intelligence officials have denied it, saying there was no such surveillance ordered. Meanwhile, Spicer and other administration officials have struggled to defend the claim, repeatedly insisting that there is proof but providing none. Even Vice President Mike Pence could not support it last week, merely saying that “the president’s tweet speaks for itself.”At Monday’s press briefing, Spicer got into an argument with reporters, stating that there was “an abundance of reports” to support Trump’s claim and then asserting that Trump didn’t actually mean what he tweeted.“He doesn’t think President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally,” Spicer said, even though Trump specifically referred to Obama in the tweets.Spicer went on to argue about the semantics of Trump’s tweets, using air quotes to signify that Trump did not necessarily mean wiretapping because he tweeted “wire tapping” with quotation marks. Yet last week, Spicer said that he would “let the tweet speak for itself,” in response to questions about the claim.In defending the claim, Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday suggested that there could be broader methods of surveillance used, such as “microwaves that turn into cameras.” She later clarified that she was talking about “surveilling generally,” telling CNN that “I am not Inspector Gadget.”"

On March 10, Planned Parenthood’s Great Plains clinic tweeted out a photo of a letter Sen. Fitzgerald wrote to the women’s health organization. “It is with great dismay that I received your letter that a donation was made in my ‘honor’ to your heinous organization,” Sen. Fitzgerald wrote.The state senator went on to liken Planned Parenthood ― an international nonprofit organization that provides healthcare to millions of women and men ― to a Nazi concentration camp. “This is as bad ― or worse ― as having one’s name associated with Dachau,” Sen. Fitzgerald wrote, referring to the first Nazi concentration camp created in 1933. “Shame on your organization and shame on anyone that would attempt to blacken my name in this manner.”In an interview with The Kansas City Star on Monday, Sen. Fitzgerald stood by his original comments.“It was either send them that or ignore it,” Sen. Fitzgerald told The Star. “I figured, I don’t want my name associated as a donation to Planned Parenthood, in my name, to go on un-denounced by me.”When asked if Sen. Fitzgerald was implying that Planned Parenthood is actually worse than the Nazis, the state senator replied: “Oh, yeah,” adding that the Nazis “ought to be incensed by the comparison.” Many Twitter users were understandably very upset with Sen. Fitzgerald’s comments. Spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Great Plains told The Star that they’ve see an uptick in donations in Sen. Fitzgerald’s name since they tweeted his letter. “It’s this kind of inflammatory language that adds to the shame and stigma of safe legal abortion,” Lee-Gilmore said. “The state of Kansas has much bigger issues to be dealing with, and this is just an unacceptable attack on women’s right to choose.”Head over to The Kansas City Star to read the rest of Sen.

As a 9/11 widow who has fought for more than 15 years for truth, justice, accountability, and transparency with regard to the murder of my husband, Ron, I have a considerable interest in your upcoming meeting with the Deputy Crown Prince.First, foremost, and for good reason, I fear that the Deputy Crown Prince will not be forthright with you about his Kingdom’s role in the 9/11 attacks and global terrorism.Indeed, many in the Kingdom refuse to tell the truth about their continued, long-standing, and well-documented clandestine, logistical and financial support of radical Islamist terrorist groups that target and kill innocent Americans.For example, last summer when the infamous 2002 Joint Inquiry of Congress’ 28 pages were finally released, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir claimed that the Saudis were exonerated and that the matter surrounding the Saudi role in the 9/11 attacks was “now finished.” In reality, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its role in facilitating the 9/11 attacks is far from over. And, in truth, the 28 pages prove to be quite illuminating, devastating and damning towards that end:On page 415: “While in the United States, some of the September 11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support and assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi Government.… [A]t least two of those individuals were alleged by some to be Saudi intelligence officers.”On page 417: One of the individuals identified in the pages as a financial supporter of two of the 9/11 hijackers, Osama Bassnan, later received a “significant amount of cash” from “a member of the Saudi Royal Family” during a 2002 trip to Houston.On page 418: “Another Saudi national with close ties to the Saudi Royal Family, [deleted], is the subject of FBI counterterrorism investigations.”On pages 418 and 419: Detained al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaida had in his phone book the unlisted number for the security company that managed the Colorado residence of the then-Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar bin Sultan.On page 421: “a [deleted], dated July 2, 2002, [indicates] ‘incontrovertible evidence that there is support for these terrorists inside the Saudi Government.’”On page 426: Bassnan’s wife was receiving money “from Princess Haifa Bint Sultan,” the wife of the Saudi ambassador. (Her correct name is actually Princess Haifa bin Faisal.)On page 436: The general counsel of the U.S. Treasury Department, David Aufhauser, testified that “offices [of the Saudi charity al-Haramain] have significant contacts with extremists, Islamic extremists.” CIA officials also testified “that they were making progress on their investigations of al-Haramain.… [T]he head of the central office is complicit in supporting terrorism, and it also raised questions about [then-Saudi Interior Minister] Prince Nayef.”Fortunately, as you know President Trump, JASTA (Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act) was enacted into law―overriding President Obama’s veto―on September 28, 2016 and the 9/11 Families were given the right to hold the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia accountable in a court of law for its alleged role in the 9/11 attacks. Thanks to discovery and subpoena power, the 9/11 families hope to unearth and reveal a panoply of compelling information surrounding the Saudi role in the 9/11 attacks. Suffice it to say, we do not believe the Saudis should be considered an ally of America.Unsurprisingly, the Saudis continue to wage war against the 9/11 families and JASTA by paying millions to their 14 powerful, insider Washington DC lobbying firms, like the Podesta Group, to repeal JASTA and rob us of our day in court.In addition, some of the Saudi’s key legislative supporters who threaten to repeal JASTA are Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain. Sadly, McCain and Graham choose to protect the Saudis rather than American victims of terrorism.Quite horrifically, one of the Saudi lobbyists — Qorvis — was recently caught trying to dupe, manipulate, and pit U.S. veterans against the 9/11 families. According to media reports, Qorvis offered vets an all expense paid trip to Washington (staying at the Trump Hotel) to lobby against JASTA without telling the vets that it was Saudi money funding their trip. Given that many of these vets had joined the military in the wake of 9/11, the discovery that they were now being duped into “working” for the enemy they enlisted and risked their lives to fight against, was extremely upsetting. Pitting American veterans against American victims is the lowest of the low—yet, there seems to be no lengths that the Saudis will not go. Which brings me to my last point—the Saudi Aramco IPO on Wall Street. Mr. President, my husband was burnt to death on September 11th. The remains I received included his two arms, a few fingers, and his wedding band.Thousands of innocent people were brutally slaughtered and turned to ash in broad daylight on that horrific day, now more than 15 years ago. The notion that the Saudis — whom the 9/11 families are currently trying to hold accountable in a court of law for their role in the murder of our loved ones ― want to return to the scene of their own alleged crime to make billions of dollars is immoral and simply untenable.As my fellow 9/11 widows and I have repeatedly said — not over our husbands’ dead bodies.President Trump, you have structured your campaign and current policies around being for America First. The 9/11 families certainly hope that you remain steadfast in your belief that Americans must be protected, supported, and heard, first and foremost above all others — particularly those like the Saudis who fund radical Islamic terrorists that target and kill Americans."
41,POLITICS,Rolling Back The Clean Power Plan Is A Losing Proposition For America,"Sam Adams, ContributorDirector, United States, World Resources Institute and Former ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rolling-back-the-clean-power-plan-is-a-losing-proposition_us_58c82b6be4b02bfb77583c78,"Why put the brakes on a good thing? Over the last decade, America’s economy has grown rapidly, while its emissions have dropped",2017-03-14,"The coal-fired Castle Gate Power Plant outside Helper, Utah. The plant was closed in the Spring of 2015 in anticipation of new EPA regulations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c8433c140000200006f75d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why put the brakes on a good thing?Over the last decade, America’s economy has grown rapidly, while its emissions have dropped [2]. The shift is good for people’s health, business and national security.Yet, the Trump administration is now expected to release [3] an executive order that would direct the EPA to roll back key protections provided under the Clean Power Plan, one of the cornerstones of the country’s climate strategy. This move flies in the face of common sense. It will hurt America’s security and economy. It also won’t bring back lost jobs in the coal industry, and instead, pours cold water on the country’s shift to renewable energy.The president has not indicated that he has a replacement for the Clean Power Plan. Instead, he will just leave the country’s climate strategy twisting in the wind. Following are reasons why this approach is a losing proposition for America:Rolling Back the Clean Power Plan Will Jeopardize Climate Security and Harm People’s HealthThe Clean Power Plan is designed to reduce emissions from the power sector 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. According to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) most recent Annual Energy Outlook, this will reduce emissions of climate pollution by 350 million metric tons per year [4] in 2030, the equivalent of taking 74 million cars [5] off the road. Analysis by Synapse shows that the program can deliver these reductions while saving customers [6] an average of $17 per month nationwide, so long as states leverage the opportunity the rule provides to tailor their compliance programs.Rolling back the Clean Power Plan will also take a toll on human health as Americans suffer from dirtier air. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finds that the rule would provide health benefits of $14-$34 billion per year by 2030, outweighing costs by a factor of 4 to 1.However, it is important to go beyond those top-level statistics to understand what really is at stake here. According to analysis EPA released with the rule, each year [7] the Clean Power Plan would avoid:Up to 3,600 premature deaths;Rolling Back the Clean Power Plan Will Not Bring Back the Coal IndustrySo, what is the administration hoping to gain at the expense of those lost lives and sick children? President Trump has suggested that his regulatory rollback will somehow save [8] the coal industry, but this statement is divorced from the reality facing America’s coal communities. It is undeniably true that coal employment has fallen considerably in recent decades, and that the communities left behind deserve our attention and need economic development. However, solving these challenges requires a real, honest discourse grounded in facts.That discourse must begin with the acknowledgment that the main drivers of change in the coal industry have been increased productivity and low natural gas prices. Consider that even with recent production declines, the nation produces nearly 50 percent more coal [9] than we did in 1940 [10], but employs one-eighth [11] the number of miners. The underlying shift to less labor-intensive methods of mining coal means that the industry will never see employment levels comparable to where they were decades ago.As the Analysis Group [12] shows, low natural gas prices have driven recent production declines. Pressure from natural gas will likely continue; EIA reports [13] that the electricity industry is planning to build 37 gigawatts (GW) of new natural gas capacity in the coming years, the equivalent to about 70 mid-sized power plants. Coal production is not expected to substantially increase above current levels even if the Clean Power Plan is rolled back.It could also stifle the country’s clean energy revolution and diminish job growth in this burgeoning market. Already, about 2.7 million Americans [14] work in wind, solar and energy efficiency, while only 160,000 work in coal. Solar created one out of every 50 [15] new U.S. jobs in 2016, while wind turbine technicians are expected to be the fastest-growing occupation [16] over the next 10 years. These industries create jobs for hard-working Americans across the country, and set the stage for exporting clean energy products abroad.Rolling Back the Clean Power Plan Would Create Investment UncertaintyPower companies are expected to invest more than a trillion dollars [17] in new electricity generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the coming years as they modernize aging generating facilities and grid systems. These investments will have a lifetime measured in decades. Rolling back regulations like the Clean Power Plan would reduce the long-term certainty for power companies, which is bad for shareholders and consumers alike.The science is clear, and the threat climate change poses to the American way of life becomes more apparent with each passing day through increased droughts, flooding and extreme weather. The power sector will need to decarbonize to protect vulnerable communities. Therefore, power companies should continue making smart investments in low-carbon resources regardless of what happens with the Clean Power Plan.Many companies already realize that this strategy is good for business and good for ratepayers. This is why Xcel is moving forward with their steel-for-fuel strategy to replace fossil fuel plants with wind turbines while delivering hundreds of millions of dollars [18] in fuel savings for customers. It is also why Berkshire Hathaway’s utilities division has proposed [19] doubling its investment in renewable energy. Even the historically coal-heavy American Electric Power plans to add 8 GW [20] of wind and solar by 2034, saying that investing in zero-emitting and lower-carbon resources “makes economic sense for our customers [21].”The Clean Power Plan clearly offers multiple benefits to the U.S economy and its people. The plan was developed through lengthy and highly deliberative consultation. It offers reasonable guidance and important signals to power suppliers that would help provide cleaner air and more clean energy.

This month they’ll begin their first mission, traversing a deep current that originates in Antarctica and flows through the Southern Ocean.”Voters appear to still be hurt by the overruling. NERC’s Facebook page boasts just one star, with dozens of people expressing disapproval of how the vote was handled."

Although his strategy predates Trump’s entry into politics, Wilders has certainly incorporated a bit of Trump into his campaign ― promising to make “The Netherlands Ours Again.” Whenever there is a terror attack or political scandal linked to Islamic militants, Wilders is also quick to capitalize on it through tweets to his 797,000 followers, vilifying Muslims or calling for closed borders.He can even drive news cycles in other countries: He once posted a manipulated image of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with blood on her hands after a terrorist drove a truck into a crowd last December in Berlin.

I publish any sort of book. I am looking for a book that will sell five hundred thousand copies.""",2017-03-13,F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) in an undated photograph.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c69e5f1e00002a0077f657.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The publishing industry may currently seem awash in celebrity-penned fantasy novels, short fiction by movie stars and problematic screeds by problematic provocateurs with hefty social media followings ― but a newly published short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald suggests that viewing publishers as greedy and exploitative is nothing new.In “The I.O.U.,” a man relates the saga of a nonfiction work he published. Written by one of his previously successful authors, Dr. Harden, a “psychic-research man,” the new book promises to be even more lucrative thanks to its tear-jerking subject. Harden’s nephew, Cosgrove Harden, had been killed in World War I, and his uncle’s work recounts “his psychic communion through various mediums with this nephew.”The publisher touts Harden’s intellectual bona fides and praises the book’s sensitivity and nobility.His book was neither callous nor credulous. There was a fundamental seriousness underlying his attitude. For example, he had mentioned in his book that a young man named Wilkins had come to his door claiming that the deceased had owed him three dollars and eighty cents. He had asked Dr. Harden to find out what the deceased wanted done about it. This Dr. Harden had steadfastly refused to do. He considered that such a request was comparable to praying to the saints about a lost umbrella.Unfortunately for the businessman, salivating over the sale of “huge crates” that had been shipped “to a thousand points of the literate compass,” a dramatic wrench is thrown into the works. Fitzgerald shows him scrambling to protect his profits, at the expense of editorial integrity.Readers would expect nothing less, of course, given Fitzgerald’s introduction of the man:I would rather bring out a book that had an advance sale of five hundred thousand copies than have discovered Samuel Butler, Theodore Dreiser, and James Branch Cabell in one year. So would you if you were a publisher.(In case we’re not clear, it’s the role of publisher, not the individual man, that is corrupt.)Fitzgerald wrote “The I.O.U.” in 1920, at the age of 23. Originally intended for Harper’s Bazaar, the manuscript wound up back with the author after he requested time to make revisions. He never sent it on for publication.Though the story mocks publishing for mercenary motives, Anne Margaret Daniel, the editor of an upcoming collection of lost Fitzgerald stories, noted that “[s]hort stories were Fitzgerald’s bread and butter,” adding that he “was acutely aware of how much he could make, quickly, with stories.” Given his famously enormous living expenses, this was probably a wise strategy.Read the full story at The New Yorker."
47,POLITICS,GOP's 'Act Of Mercy' Could Result In 24 Million People Losing Health Care,Amanda Terkel and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/act-of-mercy-gop-health-care-replacement-congressional-budget-office_us_58c70af7e4b0598c6698f7e9,"A 64-year-old who makes $26,500 could face a 700 percent jump in premiums.",2017-03-13,"Donald Trump, in a Nov. 11, 2016, interview with ""60 Minutes,"" said of the health care plan, ""Everybody's got to be covered.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c71c9b270000ee64749bf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As they seek to replace Obamacare with a conservative alternative, Republicans are discovering that finding the right sales pitch on health care can be an incredibly delicate task. For weeks now, the party has touted its plan as a compassionate salve to the woes of Obamacare ― without acknowledging that there are serious trade-offs in return. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has gone so far as to call the bill an “act of mercy.”On Monday, the actual costs of that act were outlined by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and it did not resemble mercy. Under the Republican plan, repealing the Affordable Care Act could result in 24 million people losing health care coverage over the next decade. Older Americans would have to pay significantly more for insurance. A single 64-year-old who makes $26,500, for example, could face a 700 percent jump in premiums (from $1,700 now to $14,600 under the GOP bill).Ryan tried to seize the parts of the CBO score that confirm his ideological vision ― mainly the deficit reduction and decreased spending on Medicaid. But as a practical political matter, the study is unambiguously damaging, if only for how dramatically different its projections are from the GOP’s health care promises. That’s especially true for President Donald Trump.For example, Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” shortly after being elected that “everybody’s got to be covered” while conceding that such a proclamation was “an un-Republican thing” for him to say. Later, he explained that the way to do it would be that “the government’s going to pay for it.” And just a few months back, Trump promised that he would provide “insurance for everyone.”The CBO report suggests that the bill the president is now endorsing would fall far short. Instead of the government paying for coverage, it would spend $337 billion less over 10 years in large part because it would no longer be paying for states to expand Medicaid access to low-income individuals. Instead of everyone getting coverage, 14 million people would stand to lose insurance in the first year if the GOP legislation is enacted. Trump also pledged, during a GOP primary debate and long thereafter, that health care under his presidency was “going to be inexpensive” and “much better for the people at the bottom, people that don’t have any money.” The bill that now has his name attached to it would do none of this, according to the CBO. Lower-income people would get less funding help to purchase insurance than those with higher incomes. The Medicaid expansion would be rolled back. And while premiums would go down over time, it would be because those with expensive premiums would simply forgo insurance entirely. In fact, in the first year, the CBO estimated, premiums would be up to 20 percent higher.Trump also vowed not to cut Medicaid and told Dr. Mehmet Oz on “The Dr. Oz Show” in September that he would expand coverage for the indigent through the government program. The CBO made it clear that federal expenditures on Medicaid would be reduced by $880 billion over 10 years ― a prospect that has upset even some Republican governors who have seen the benefits of the expansion in their own states. On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price promised that “nobody will be worse off financially” under the GOP plan ― another pledge that the CBO shot down Monday. In addition to certain segments of the population having to pay more for insurance ― most significantly older, lower-income Americans ― people without coverage would likely face steep medical bills that they would have to pay without the help of insurance. Speaking outside the White House shortly after the CBO score was released, Price said he “strenuously” disagreed with its findings, arguing that the organization failed to take into account reforms that would follow the passage of this bill. What he failed to mention is that many of those reforms would require Democratic votes in the U.S. Senate (something that Trump will struggle to get) and that the head of the CBO, Keith Hall, was appointed to his post in 2015 on the recommendation of then-Rep. Price.Want more updates from Amanda Terkel? Sign up for her newsletter, Piping Hot Truth, here."

It’s a question of theirs,” Spicer said.But Spicer did not mention that the original CBO analysis of Obamacare was based on assumptions that states would be eager to set up insurance exchanges and accept an expansion of Medicaid for their poorer residents, particularly since the federal government was paying for all of it.However, Republicans opposed to that law and opposed to Obama personally blocked both of those efforts in a number of states, leading to far fewer people being enrolled through those programs."

Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is up for re-election. (Feinstein hasn’t said whether she’ll seek a fifth full term in office.) According to the report, the former Republican governor was considering running as an independent. Schwarzenegger addressed the speculation in a Facebook post on Sunday. “I’m deeply flattered by all of the people who have approached me about running for Senate, but my mission right now is to bring sanity to Washington through redistricting reform like we passed here in California,” he wrote. “Gerrymandering has completely broken our political system and I believe my best platform to help repair it is from the outside, by campaigning for independent redistricting commissions.” Schwarzenegger, who returned to acting after leaving office in 2011, took over as host of NBC’s “Celebrity Apprentice” after President Donald Trump left the show during his 2016 campaign. Trump has since blamed Schwarzenegger for the program’s sagging ratings, even asking attendees at the National Prayer Breakfast in February to keep the show’s success in their thoughts. “I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings,” he said.Schwarzenegger, who also criticized Trump during the presidential campaign, replied by suggesting he and the president switch jobs.“Why don’t we switch jobs?” he said in a video posted to Twitter. “You take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job. And then people can finally sleep comfortably again.” In early March, Schwarzenegger said he would not return to host the show’s next season, citing Trump’s involvement.“Under the circumstances, I don’t want to do it again,” he said.

The storm will come to an end overnight into early Wednesday morning,” the NWS advised. As of Monday afternoon, areas just northwest of New York City are expected to get the most snow. West Milford, New Jersey, could see up to 25 inches. New York City is expected to get at least 11 inches of snow, and could potentially be blanketed by as many as 23 inches. In addition to heavy snow, the NWS warns that parts of Long Island and southeastern Connecticut are at particular risk of damaging winds, with gusts expected to reach speeds of up to 60 mph. Those same areas are also facing coastal flood warnings and advisories.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged people to avoid any unnecessary travel, adding that road closures, delays and cancellations are to be expected. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio echoed that plea, asking the public on Monday to “keep roads clear for Sanitation crews and first responders.” To assist this, public schools will be closed on Tuesday.New Yorkers should also brace for temperatures that forecasters say could dip into the 20s, de Blasio said.A full list of emergency items recommended for both homes and vehicles ― including batteries, first aid kits, flashlights, matches, extra blankets and shovels ― can be found at Ready.gov.The website also cautions that accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from gas-powered furnaces and other power sources during outages are highest during colder months.“Never use a generator, grill, camp stove or other gasoline, propane, natural gas or charcoal-burning devices inside a home, garage, basement, crawlspace or any partially enclosed area,” the site reads, adding that it’s important to install carbon monoxide detectors in homes. Pipes should also be insulated and faucets allowed to drip to prevent freezing. Homeowners should also know how to shut off water valves in case a pipe bursts.Fire should not be used to warm up frozen pipes. Instead, the Red Cross advises opening the affected faucets and aiming hair dryers or portable space heaters at the pipes. You can also try wrapping the pipes in heating pads or towels soaked in hot water. If this doesn’t work, contact a licensed plumber or your city’s office of emergency management.Lastly, don’t forget to take any pets and livestock into sheltered areas. It’s also vital to ensure they have non-frozen drinking water.Stay safe!"

Higher temperatures intensify air pollution and respiratory illness. Changing weather patterns lead to drought and then famine, while increasing rains in other areas will create the breeding ground for disease and pandemics. While the policy changes needed to blunt climate change are surely substantial, the cost of ignoring the science behind climate change will be felt through its harmful effects on our health. Recently, the CDC cancelled its Climate and Health Summit out of fear of retribution from the Trump administration. Working with Al Gore and others, Harvard worked to revive the meeting, which was held in Atlanta on February 16. This meeting reminded us that universities have a unique responsibility that we ensure a platform for key scientific issues that have a meaningful effect on people’s health. Climate change is one such critical issue.A century ago, one in three children died before age five. That number has been cut by 90 percent because of global investments in public health. Climate change, unchecked, puts these gains, and lives, at risk. Weather shifts from climate change will change the availability and reduce the nutritional content of food. The levels of protein and crucial micronutrients in key staple crops will drop, exposing billions of the world’s poorest people to worsening malnutrition. The gains we have made in saving the lives of children are fragile – and unlikely to withstand the challenges created by climate change unless we act now.The effects of climate change on health will not stop with agriculture. Burning fossil fuels release a wide array of air pollutants that are a leading cause of asthma, heart disease, and strokes in our country and around the globe. Children are particularly vulnerable, and so are the elderly. The increasing number of heat waves is dangerous, but the interaction between high temperatures and air pollution becomes especially deadly.The changing climate will likely shift the geographical range of insects that carry disease, including ticks carrying Lyme disease and mosquitos which carry malaria. The increasing number of infectious disease outbreaks such as Ebola and Zika appear to be linked, at least in part, to ongoing environmental shifts that exacerbate climate change. It is not hard to imagine that if we alter an ecosystem where we and other species live in equilibrium, there will be meaningful consequences.Transitioning to energy sources that reduce carbon pollution will help the U.S. meet its commitments under the recent Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, importantly, will also benefit the health of all Americans. In a nation where our government already pays for the health care of our elderly and many of our children, reducing health burdens not only saves lives, but it can also be fiscally responsible. Our colleagues at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health recently found that the health savings to the American people from the Environmental Protection Agency’s new carbon standards will far outweigh the cost to industry within five years.As these changes unfold, universities have a unique obligation, through research, education, and better communication, to understand and explain the impact of climate change on health and find ways to mitigate it. This research, at Harvard and at universities across our country, is dependent on a long-standing agreement between universities and the American people: universities will work on the most pressing issues facing our nation, and our citizens, through their government, will support that research. That agreement faces a serious challenge today from politicians skeptical about the science of climate change and the value of scientific investment. Yet it is more important than ever to renew our commitment to funding research on climate change and especially, its impact on health. Universities must commit to producing unbiased, high-quality data to guide decision- and policy-making, and the government should keep its commitment to supporting that work. Finally, it is essential that universities engage more effectively with the public regarding what the science tells us about the impact of climate change on health. Sharing data openly and transparently is crucial to helping policy-makers reach / agree on the best decisions.This is a critical moment for our nation. Climate change is upon us. We can no longer think of it as an issue of temperature changes or sea level rises alone. We must remember that we will feel the effects of climate change most acutely on our health. We still have the time to mitigate these effects by focusing on reducing carbon pollution and slowing the warming of the planet. If we do, we will reap the benefits in terms of longer and healthier lives. And our children will be the biggest beneficiaries."

Or, they know me as the founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America. But few know me as Padma, an immigrant. I was four years old when I came here and joined my mother, a nurse who’d left me back in India two years prior. Despite the stigma of divorce, she ended an abusive marriage and with exactly $100 in her pocket, she arrived here in America. It was the 1970s. Inspired by the feminist movement, my mother wanted me to have a better life than she had: one with equal opportunity. She sculpted the mist, in the way those who have no other choice do, willing a life into existence. I love this country for allowing that to be possible. America has shaped our dreams, our values, and our insecurities for three generations: for my mother, myself, and now my daughter. But what if my mom and I had been turned away? What makes America great is our culture of inclusion. We’re a superpower because we’ve managed to take the best of each immigrant culture and create our own uniquely, American culture. For all its faults and felonies, our country has been admired the world over, as a beacon of hope, because of our tradition of welcoming people, from all walks of life — until now.Forty years after my mother arrived, our nation is now again in a state of emergency. Rights and freedoms we’ve taken for granted, are now being eroded and repealed daily in Washington. We’re squandering our goodwill and reputation, both globally and at home. What happened to “Give me your tired, your poor/your huddled masses”? What happened to that American dream? I am alarmed by the hatred in our political rhetoric and by the recent rise of violence against our communities of color. But for several — and far too many — years, I have also been horrified, by videos and reports of our young Black and Latino boys and men, bludgeoned to death in the prime of their lives by the very system, we were told would protect us. Our system seems to really be two systems: one for the white male establishment and another, for those of us, “unlucky” enough to be born brown, black, gay, female, trans, or just somehow different. Now I’m a mother. I too want my daughter to have something different. I want my daughter Krishna to live in a country whose policies aren’t governed by fear but by compassion. We tell our kids to share, play fair, that everyone is equal in the sandbox. Shouldn’t our policies reflect this too?Tearing undocumented parents from their children helps no one. Giving refuge to a displaced Syrian family doesn’t diminish our families’ safety. Instead, it teaches all our children the very American principles of empathy and tolerance. I don’t have to be Muslim or Mexican to be offended by Muslim bans or I.C.E. raids. As Americans, we should all be offended. We shouldn’t have to walk in someone else’s shoes, to see that those shoes must hurt terribly.All my life I have tried not to feel powerless. In January, I protested for the first time at the Women’s March, holding all the while my daughter’s hand. And this past weekend, I joined the People’s Power Resistance Training. We cannot forget that we are all powerful and we must exercise our power now.Now is not the time to close our eyes, and hope that this too shall pass without much harm. We must do more than just march. We must consistently resist discrimination of any kind. We must not tolerate the intolerance. We must use our power to say: enough is enough. Because to do nothing is a crime against our nation. The time for any of us to be silent is over.We owe it to those suffragettes in Seneca Falls, those who marched for equal rights, to those who refused to sit at the back of the bus, to those beaten by Billy clubs. We owe it to our fallen soldiers to preserve what they fought so hard to defend. Democracy is an ever-evolving organism. We must not let it devolve.Yes we are brown, and we too are American. And yes we are Muslim. We are Hindus, and Jews. And over half of us are women. And we deserve equal pay. We deserve the right to choose what we can do with our bodies.  We too are the United States of America. Let us remember who we are.

Trump preaches ‘America first’, characterizes the European Union as a ‘vehicle of German interests’, has accused Merkel of ""ruining Germany"" with her open-door refugee policy, and says he will start off by trusting her as much as he does Russian President Vladimir Putin. Merkel champions multilateral cooperation, has maintained an often-tempestuous European solidarity through a series of severe crises, has held together international sanctions on Russia, and told Trump that any ""close cooperation"" with Germany must be based on ''values of democracy, freedom, respect for the rule of law and human dignity, regardless of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political belief."" It would be easy to say “Let the fireworks begin.” Yet both Trump and Merkel have an interest in making their relationship work. And despite their differences, each values the art of the deal. Trump's deal-making is already legend. But Merkel is no slouch either. Just ask Greece. Merkel has kept financial assistance flowing to the highly-indebted country and has pledged to ''do what it takes'' to keep Greece in the eurozone, while at the same time holding out further debt relief unless Athens implements painful economic reforms. The deal is not popular and is under strain. But it is holding.The migration crisis is another example of Merkel deal-making. After over 1 million refugees and migrants entered Europe in 2015, Merkel struck a deal with Turkish President Erdogan, who accepted even more migrants and shut down the refugee stream to Europe in exchange for German support for visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and a revival of Ankara’s EU membership talks. Recent tensions between Berlin and Ankara with Erdogan underscore the precarious nature of this bargain as well. But the deal still stands. Merkel is likely to approach Trump in similar results-oriented manner. A new German-American bargain will turn on three issues. The first is security. The fight against ISIS, one of Trump's top priorities, is also high on Merkel's agenda. Like other European countries, Germany has come under terrorist attack and is exposed to the risk posed by radicalized fighters returning from Syria. Without U.S. support, Germany is vulnerable; Berlin relies on U.S. intelligence to uncover terror plots. But Berlin is also contributing to the fight. It is a member of the anti-ISIS coalition in Syria and Iraq and has contributed airplanes and ships providing logistic support. Merkel is also likely to react positively to Trump's call for Germany to step up its defense. She has already boosted German defense spending, and German forces are now in Lithuania leading a NATO effort to reassure eastern allies nervous about Moscow. The second issue is the economy. Trump has railed against Germany's large trade surplus in goods with the United States. But that deficit, while still sizable, declined by $10 billion last year, and is partially offset by America's trade surplus in services with Germany. Moreover, 4,000 German companies have invested $224 billion in the U.S. and directly employ 700,000 U.S. workers. And 40 percent of all jobs created by German companies in the U.S. are in manufacturing, compared with 9 percent in the economy as a whole. A big trade deal with the European Union is unlikely in the near term, but sector-by-sector deals could boost U.S. and European corporate competitiveness in the face of Chinese restrictions and efforts to subvert basic market economy principles. Russia is likely to be the most difficult issue. A Trumpian pivot to Moscow would leave Merkel isolated, undermine her efforts to maintain EU sanctions on Russia, and challenge her efforts to implement the Minsk roadmap addressing Russia's aggression in Ukraine. But the swirl of controversy surrounding Trump campaign contact with Moscow makes such an abrupt pivot difficult. In this situation, Trump may be amenable to Merkel's approach. She has been strong in criticizing Russian aggression and taken steps to reassure worried NATO allies, yet has sought to avoid an open breach with Moscow and signaled that cooperation is possible on other issues. A new Merkel-Trump bargain will be difficult to achieve and perhaps even more difficult to implement. Still, Merkel, like Trump, has always been underestimated by her critics. And through three terms as Chancellor she has learned her own art of the deal.

Japan, which will hold the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and South Korea, where the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games will be held, are further examples of the growing influence of a group of Asian countries in the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Taken together, this indicates that “the time of Asia” in the Olympic movement has indeed arrived, as IOC president Thomas Bach recently said.But East Asia is not all of Asia. An Indian bid for the Olympic Games, for instance, seems unrealistic in the near future. And southeast and Central Asian countries’ bids to host the 2000 or 2008 Summer Olympics have also been unsuccessful.Iran is the anomaly; until the Islamic Revolution in 1979, it was considered a very serious candidate for hosting Olympic Summer Games. Some other countries in West Asia and the Middle East, such as Qatar (the host of the controversial 2022 FIFA World Cup and an unsuccessful bidder for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics), have recently gained a noteworthy influence in sports affairs as a result of their financial wealth.Many of these developments go back to the 1970s. This period saw a large-scale reconfiguration of Olympic sport in Asia and demands to give Asian countries more influence at the IOC. But it was the Seventh Asian Games (Tehran 1974), a regional sporting event and training platform for the Olympics held under the patronage of the IOC, that accelerated the “rise” of the above-mentioned Asian countries in the Olympic movement.The ‘two Chinas’ problemThe struggle for legitimacy between China and Taiwan is the background to all this. Since 1949, both have claimed to be the sole representative of “China”. This meant that each country was unwilling to participate in any sporting event in which the other country was also taking part.China had left the Olympic movement in 1958 as a direct result of its conflict with Taiwan. And the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966, resulted in Beijing’s withdrawal from all other international sporting events.The country returned to the Olympic Games only in 1980. Its return was the result of earlier negotiations with the IOC about Beijing’s intended participation in the Seventh Asian Games in 1974.One of China’s main supporters was Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi’s Iran. His engagements with China led to increased anti-Soviet political cooperation after Tehran diplomatically recognised Beijing in 1971.Shortly afterwards, Beijing took the seat of “China” in the United Nations, which had been held by Taipei until then. This was the result of decolonisation and of a growing number of UN member countries being sympathetic to Beijing’s claim.The Japanese members of the Asian Games Federation were also important supporters of China’s participation. The Japanese had come to the conclusion that Beijing represented China and intended to make the Asian Games more of a challenge by including Chinese athletes.Simultaneously, the Tehran Games, the first hosting of an Asian Games event in West Asia, had a strong impact on many of the Arab countries in the region. Some of them had only shortly beforehand experienced decolonisation and a financial boom through the first Oil Crisis in 1973.In the end, seven of them joined the Asian Games Federation before or during the Seventh Games, which encouraged their involvement in Olympic sports affairs.The geopolitical backgroundGeopolitical shifts had a massive impact on the Iranian government’s plan to leverage China to counterbalance the Soviet Union. Strong ideological tensions had emerged between China and the Soviet Union since the late 1950s.The reason for the heightened concern over the USSR in the 1970s was the 1969 declaration by an overstretched Britain of its intent to permanently withdraw all its troops based east of the Suez Canal by 1971. This decision strongly contributed to the decolonisation process in the Persian Gulf.These tensions eventually convinced the Iranians that China could be used to limit the USSR’s freedom of action.Intensifying cooperation with other Asian countries, and especially with China through the hosting of the Seventh Asian Games, was a way to support Iran’s anti-USSR plan.After Japan and China normalised relations in September 1972 and the Japanese Olympic Committee became interested in bringing China into the Asian Games, discussions with the Iranians intensified. A final decision was reached at an Asian Games Federation council meeting on November 16 1973.The People’s Republic was chosen as the representative of China. And Taiwan was expelled from the Asian Games until 1990, when it accepted being renamed as “Chinese Taipei”, leaving its international status vague.International sports federations and the IOC, by then tired of decades of Cold War-related political quarrels within the Olympic movement, eventually accepted China’s participation and the highly problematic discrimination against Taiwan.Asia’s growing influenceChina’s return to the Olympic movement via the Seventh Asian Games had a significant influence on its participation in the Olympics beginning with the 1980 Winter Games in Lake Placid.The IOC’s acceptance of the Asian countries’ decision regarding China and especially Taiwan highlighted Japan’s growing importance on the world stage, given that it had already hosted the Olympics twice – in 1964 and 1972.Though less influential, Arab countries also became more involved in Olympic affairs through the Seventh Asian Games. Only Iran was unable to utilise this newly gained influence.Then-IOC president Lord Killanin, who had attended the Seventh Asian Games, judged Tehran qualified to host the Summer Olympics in 1980 (eventually held in Moscow) and 1984 (eventually held in Los Angeles). The Shah’s government, though, had to deal with the superpowers’ own desires to host these events and in 1979 was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution. Needless to say, the new government was not interested in continuing these plans.Iran never applied for the 1988 Summer Games. These games then took place in South Korea, the second Asian country ever chosen (instead of Iran) to host the Olympics.In the case of Southeast Asia, the next Asian Games (Jakarta and Palembang 2018) will reveal if Indonesia is willing – and able – to host the Olympic Games in the not too distant future.Stefan Huebner, Research Fellow in Asian and Global History, National University of SingaporeThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Traveling can be difficult on so many levels--especially for an introvert like me. In fact, traveling low-key scares the hell out of me because I often wonder whether I'll meet anyone at all in these places.I imagine it scares everybody, though. That's why many of my friends don't go on adventures alone when they know full well they could. I think many people are just scared about what's in front of them: the immediate consequences of traveling when you know nobody.You see, though, that's the problem. They're scared of the wrong things. And maybe you yourself have never thought of it the way I do, but I'm more scared of the regret I'll have later if I don't follow my heart right now.I don't know whether I'll have any regrets when I'm older.I don't know if that's even much of a thing nowadays for people to lay in bed sleeplessly at night counting all their travel regrets. Maybe it isn't. But the way that older people talk to me about chasing dreams, it sure does seem many would do it differently if they could.That's why I throw myself out the door, basically. Guess what, guys? I have all the same fears that you do. The difference is I'm driven more by a fear of regret instead of new places.I am no Rick Steves or Anthony Bourdain. I have been to two other countries besides my own in my entire life. I'm planning to multiply that exponentially this summer, but it's true for now.I'm loosening the sails and putting it all out there as an investment in my future. A future in which I hope to eliminate as many regrets as possible.I write this because it's important to squash out any misinterpretations you may have of me as a guy who absolutely loves travel. I don't always love it. It's tiring, to be honest with you. It's unsettling and lonely knowing nobody in a new place. It's hard to stress about finances and not really know where you'll be four months from now. There's a lot of fear in me, doing this.I'm a travel blogger that's just as afraid of travel as you might be.But, my friends, I realized on my trip that these fears are based largely on ignorance. Of course you'll make friends! How did you make friends until this point in your life?You'll also find the good reasons to travel (joy, self-discovery, etc.) are sweeter than you could've imagined. Trust me on this.But guys, both of these realizations still aren't what's pushing me to see Europe this summer.What's still driving me is the possibility of regret. I do not want to be that person who never saw the world. Time is so precious, more precious than many care to realize. That's why I'm practically throwing myself out the door."
62,IMPACT,Working With Millennials And Generation Zers To Change The Way We Think About Distracted Driving,"Joel Feldman , ContributorFounder, The Casey Feldman Memorial Foundation and EndDD.org",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/working-with-millennials-and-generation-zers-to-change_us_58c4bde3e4b0a797c1d39db3,"Since my daughter Casey was killed by a distracted driver in 2009, I have worked to develop distracted driving presentations",2017-03-13,<p>Joel Feldman working with high school teens </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c5ccdf1e0000400077f558.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since my daughter Casey was killed by a distracted driver in 2009, I have worked to develop distracted driving presentations for all age groups: high school to college students and “adults.” Through my organization, EndDD.org (End Distracted Driving), over the past seven years I have personally given presentations to more than 100,000 teens and college students and about 20,000 adults over the age of 40. I have also worked directly with high school and college students on specific projects. These students are affiliated with the premiere student leadership organizations in the country, SADD, FCCLA and NOYS. Some of these students have become part of an informal advisory committee for me. I run ideas by them, listen to their thoughts and in exchange, I am better able to communicate safe driving messages to students. I have nothing but respect for my millennial think-tank, and the more than 100,000 students I have given presentations to. To what may be a surprise for some, I find they are hard-working, polite, engaging, curious and sincerely committed to helping others.My audiences are composed of millennials, those born between 1980 and 1995, and Generation Z, born after 1995. The millennials that I speak with are on the younger side of that generation, mostly now between the ages of 22 and 27. My daughter Casey was a millennial and would be 29. My son Brett is also a millennial, and he is 27 years old. My Generation Z audiences are now between the ages of 15 and 22.My generation, the baby boomers, often describe millennials unflatteringly as “selfish, entitled and addicted to technology.” I hear this time and time again. I don’t think we have gotten around to refining our disparaging remarks for Generation Z members and just lump them in with millennials. But, are our criticisms fair, or accurate?What does research tell us about millenials? In a 2015 Ernest and Young Survey, “Global generations: A global study on work-life challenges across generations,” millennials were most likely to say that they would take a pay cut, forego a promotion or be willing to move to manage work-life demands better. Millennials try to set limits on the demands of work and proactively carve out time for personal activities and needs. Most millennials do not see a career as working for one employer their entire lives. Managers may view this as being lazy, or even disloyal. But millennials expect to change jobs frequently and work-life balance and flexibility are common motivators for changing jobs. In addition to these job hops, millennials also may make entire career shifts. Do these views, and older generations’ perceptions that they lack “our” work ethic, make millennials “lazy?” I don’t think so, just different. For years there has been lip service paid to trying to achieve a better work-life balance, but millenials are actually taking steps to make that happen.And what about the perception that millennials are selfish and entitled? In interacting with high school and college students, I am amazed by how many do volunteer work. I specifically ask that question when I speak with students and easily 60-70 percent of those in attendance will raise their hands. According to the 2014 Case Foundation’s Millennial Impact Report a majority of Americans, including millennials themselves, describe their generation as “selfish” and “entitled.” But, 70 percent of millennials spent at least an hour volunteering their time to a cause they cared about, and more than one-third volunteered 11 hours or more. Forty-five percent participated in a company-wide volunteer day. Thirty-two percent used paid time off to volunteer and 16 percent took unpaid time off to volunteer. The report also found that 84 percent made a charitable donation in 2014. A 2014 Nielsen report, “Millennials: Breaking the Myths,” offered similar data. In 2011, 75 percent made a donation to a charity, 71 percent raised money for one, and 57 percent volunteered—“more than any other generation,” the report says. As compared with prior generations millenials are more committed to social change and, so much so in fact, that marketers are analyzing how to reach millennial consumers through their heightened social consciousness. See the SpencerHall 2015 report “Why Millennials’ Socially Conscious Mindset Is Crucial to Your Innovation Strategy.” These findings seem to belie the opinion that millenials are selfish.Melissa Gomez, Ph.D., and Principal of MMG Jury Consulting Inc., has studied juror beliefs and found that when asked what was more important in rendering a decision, following the judge’s instructions or doing what the juror believed was fair, a stark contrast exists between millennials and other generations. Sixty-five percent of millennials felt doing what was fair most important, while less than half of non-millennials (those over the age of 35) felt fairness was most important. I have asked that same question to predominately those under the age of 25 and found the results even more biased towards fairness. There is a decided appeal to me in the belief that strict adherence to rules should not interfere in doing what is right.I have more than 300 volunteer speakers across the country giving our EndDD.org student presentations. It is crucial that they treat young people with respect. If someone feels young people are “lazy and entitled,” won’t those views come across in their presentation? Isn’t respect for one’s audience a prerequisite for effectively communicating with that audience? What about the credibility of the speaker? I often hear young people use the term “hypocrite” to describe parents, police officers and teachers who try to lecture students not to drive distracted. Distracted driving is not just a teen problem, it is ubiquitous among most age groups and generations and young people are acutely aware of that. That is why speakers must tell audiences about their own distracted driving habits and what they are doing to drive without distraction. Absent that self-disclosure speakers will have difficulty being perceived as credible.Far from being lazy, selfish and entitled I find high school and college students highly motivated and sincerely wanting to make a positive difference in the world. Are they “addicted to technology?” Certainly, technology plays an important role in their lives - as it does for most of us today. But part of being connected is caring about friends and using those connections to get others involved with charitable work and projects and causes that benefit others.With respect to my traffic safety efforts I see students across the country taking the lead in working to keep their friends, and even their parents, safe from distracted driving. More than 70 percent of the students I speak with will publicly admit that their moms and dads drive distracted. Many students tell me that since their parents drive distracted it is up to them, as big brothers and sisters, to teach younger siblings to drive safely. Young people are more open to discussing ideas and changing their points of view, more curious and less rigid than their parents. I am much more likely to hear excuses and rationalizations from parents attempting to minimize their distracted driving behaviors than from students.I am excited each and every day to work with today’s young people to help them be safe and to help them keep their friends safe. I am optimistic that when treated with respect and given the right messages, young people will change the way all of us think about distracted driving and save many lives.―――――――――――――――――――――――Joel Feldman is an attorney in Philadelphia with the law firm Anapol Weiss.

She went on to explain: “I identify as a Zionist because I support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state.” What is Shire actually saying? Some history is required to answer that question. An understanding of Zionism cannot be separated from an understanding of the Nakba (the catastrophe in Arabic), which refers to the expulsion of approximately 750,000 Palestinians from their land and homes during the establishment of Israel in 1948. The history of the Nakba has been thoroughly documented, including by Palestinian, Israeli, and other historians. I know about Zionism from my own relationship with it. I had some serious unlearning to do. When I was younger, I, too, identified as a Zionist (a “socialist feminist Zionist”) until I realized that my image of Zionism as the Jewish national liberation movement was seriously misguided. Instead, I learned that what had been done and was still being done to Palestinians in the name of Zionism was theft of land and denial of a people’s right to freedom and national liberation. It was about the privileging of those who were Jewish over Palestinians. This was not just about Israel’s military occupation of Palestinian lands that began in 1967, but was fundamentally about what happened before and during the creation of the State, and what continues to happen today. In Israel, as well as in the U.S., the Nakba is often disregarded or denied altogether. Instead, the focus is on the creation of Israel as a haven for Jews, completely ignoring the mass dispossession of the Palestinian people.But the Nakba is not only about the past; it is ongoing. Palestinian women, men, and children continue to be pushed off their lands and their homes and denied their basic freedom and rights. Israeli apartheid is woven into the fabric of society, and it is taking brutal forms. Home demolitions, ongoing construction of settlements, land confiscation, arrests, torture of prisoners, and military assaults are just some of what Palestinian families endure on a daily basis, not to mention lack of access to basic rights such as education, healthcare, employment, and the right to live with dignity. What Shire’s feminism seems to ignore is that Palestinian women are forced to give birth at checkpoints; their homes are bulldozed because permission to build is denied from racist Israeli authorities; Palestinians face systemic discrimination wherever they are living; and mothers and fathers live in fear that Israeli soldiers or settlers will injure, imprison, or kill their children.Zionism and Israel have always afforded preferential treatment to Jewish women—and men—over Palestinian women and men, in all aspects of life. This is the Zionism and the Jewish state Shire says is consistent with her feminism.Instead of asking whether Zionists have a place in the feminist movement, perhaps the question that Shire should be asking is: How can someone who considers herself a supporter of feminism, which is a movement for justice and liberation that challenges patriarchal power and all forms of oppression, also consider herself a supporter of Zionism, a movement that denies the basic values of equality and fairness. The women’s day strike was intentionally and critically rooted in an anti-colonial feminism that is liberatory and multidimensional and that has as its foundation a deep commitment to social transformation and to resisting “the decades long economic inequality, racial and sexual violence, and imperial wars abroad.” If Shire has an interest in being part of such an inspiring movement, rather than supporting Zionism, she might want to stand with the Palestinian-led grassroots movement for justice and with the growing number of women around the globe who are committed to equal rights for all peoples living in Palestine and Israel. What could be more feminist than that? "

It has begun to lose command and control,” he said, adding that around 17 out of 40 western districts had been retaken.Saadi said he expected it would take less time to recapture the western half of the city than the east, which was cleared in January after 100 days of fighting.More than 200,000 Mosul residents have been displaced since the start of the campaign in October, of which more than 65,000 fled their homes in the past two weeks alone, according to the International Organisation for Migration.In the Mansour district, from which Islamic State was driven several days ago, residents collected aid brought by volunteers from east Mosul while helicopters circled overhead, firing heavy machine guns and missiles at targets in the city.MASS GRAVE UNEARTHEDIt is three weeks since Iraqi forces launched a campaign to recapture districts west of the Tigris River that bisects Mosul.A federal police spokesman said his forces along with the Rapid Response division, an elite Interior Ministry unit, were now around 300 meters (yards) from the Old Bridge ― one of five that connected west Mosul to east. The southernmost two are already controlled by Iraqi forces.Losing Mosul would be a major blow to Islamic State. It is by far the largest city Islamic State has held since the group’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria from a mosque in Mosul in the summer of 2014.The group is expected to pose a continuing threat, reverting to insurgent tactics such as bombings.As an array of forces dismantle Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate across Iraq and Syria, more evidence is emerging of the war crimes committed by the Sunni Islamist militants, who targeted Shi’ite Muslims and religious minorities as well as opponents from their own sect.A Shi’ite paramilitary spokesman said on Sunday a mass grave had been found containing the remains of “hundreds” of mainly Shi’ite inmates who were killed by Islamic State overran the Badush prison in June 2014.The Iraqi army and a Shi’ite paramilitary group called the Abbas Division recaptured the Badush area in recent days as they cut remaining Islamic State supply lines to Mosul, completing the encirclement of the city."
65,BLACK VOICES,Filmmaker Says This New Video Of Mike Brown Challenges Ferguson Police Narrative,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-brown-ferguson-second-video_us_58c583a6e4b0ed71826d3e1d,"“We had to do this so that people understand what really happened,” said the documentary filmmaker who obtained the video.",2017-03-12,"Michael Brown Sr. walks past the memorial set up where his son Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson, Missouri, Nov. 22, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c5b18f1e00003f0077f512.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A documentary filmmaker has obtained previously unreleased surveillance footage that he said disproves the police narrative of the events that led to the death of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shot to death by a Ferguson, Missouri, police officer in 2014.Film director Jason Pollock debuted “Stranger Fruit,” a documentary that examines Brown’s story from his family’s perspective, at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin on Saturday. The film includes footage that Pollock said was suppressed by police ― a move that consequently fueled the characterization of Brown as a “thug.” Pollock’s video shows Brown trade what he says is marijuana for cigarillos with clerks at the Ferguson Market convenience store in the early morning hours before he was killed.The video Pollock obtained, which was edited for the documentary, challenges the narrative police had long maintained: That Brown committed a strong-arm robbery of the store before the shooting and as a result, Ferguson officer Darren Wilson encountered Brown believing he was the robbery suspect.The video specifically shows Brown giving the clerks a small bag, which they smell and inspect. Then, a clerk bags cigarillos and other items for Brown, but instead of leaving the store with the bag, Brown is seen handing the bag back to the clerk, who places it under the counter. The widely-seen second video, of the moments before the shooting, is Brown returning to collect his items, Pollock said. Lesley McSpadden, Brown’s mother, said in the film the allegations of a strong-arm robbery at the store were a “misunderstanding.”“These people know each other well enough that this is the kind of relationship they have,” she says.St. Louis County Police, which investigated the incident between Wilson and Brown, said via email Sunday they have not authenticated the video on their own. In the film, Pollock said he saw a passing reference to early-morning video while browsing through SLCPD’s account of the investigation and questioned why it was not released. Ferguson police only released video from right before the shooting. Jay Kanzler, a St. Louis attorney representing the convenience store and its employees, disputed the documentary’s version of events and suggested the video Pollock obtained only further implicates Brown rather than absolves him.“It’s just nonsense. It’s patently false, it didn’t happen that way,” Kanzler said of the video Sunday on MSNBC. “The clerks don’t smoke marijuana. They didn’t take the marijuana…maybe Michael Brown thought they would trade him cigarillos, but they didn’t.” Kanzler clarified that he didn’t know what was in the baggie that the clerks took from Brown, but said the only reason he returned the bag to the clerks was because he hadn’t paid for items. Pollock’s video is “neither new nor news,” Kanzler added. He suggested the video was not publicly released because it was “irrelevant” and that people sympathetic to Brown would have accused the police of “piling on” with unfavorable evidence had they shared it. Brown’s relatives maintain that the Ferguson Market convenience store had a history of being involved with local drug deals. Brown’s death quickly became one of the most socially and politically polarizing incidents of the past few years and sparked intense public debate about racism, police brutality and protesting. A grand jury ultimately declined to indict Wilson, who resigned shortly after. The following year, a Justice Department investigation concluded there wasn’t enough evidence to charge Wilson with a civil rights violation. Brown’s family is still pursuing a civil suit for wrongful death.“We had to do this so that people understand what really happened,” Pollock said Sunday while talking to reporters at SXSW. “Because people think all these ridiculous things about him ― that he was a thug. And he was not a thug, he just graduated from high school in a place were there was only 62 percent graduation rate. That means he was a rock star, and he beat all the odds, and he was murdered eight days after his graduation.” “We want people to understand what happened, and they’re going to.”"

As climate change dramatically changes the landscape in the region, the council finds itself exploring opportunities that weren’t possible before.An estimated 100 billion barrels of oil and 35 trillion cubic metres of natural gas are believed to be in the region, according to researchers from the University College London. These reserves are becoming more easily accessible as climate change thaws sea ice and makes the region increasingly navigable. Countries like Norway see this as an opportunity to expand exports through the Arctic.But environmental experts are concerned. The Arctic is widely considered to be the canary in the coal mine of the effects of climate change. Research suggests that ice in the region currently keeps climate change from increasing global temperatures at unprecedented rates. The reflective nature of white snow sends radiation from the sun back into space, but once the snow is gone, the dark soil and ocean is expected to absorb the radiation and heat up the planet even more. Studies show sea ice reflects 85 percent of sunlight, while open sea reflects a mere 7 percent.At the same time, thawing ice is releasing greenhouse gases that had been trapped deep below the surface over the centuries. Many of these gases, like methane, are much more potent than carbon dioxide.In an extreme scenario where Arctic ice disappears completely, the world would be looking at average temperatures of 26 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit), rather than the current average of 14°C (58°F). In hot regions of the world, this temperature shift would be deadly.Already the rate of sea ice and glacier melt is alarming. Last November, temperatures in parts of the Arctic were 20 degrees higher than normal, according to data from Rutgers University. Sea ice has reached record lows at various points in the winter almost ever year in the last five years.Experts say the world can’t afford to continue searching for fossil fuels if nations want to limit global warming. And though Obama banned Arctic drilling in large portions of American-controlled parts of the Arctic, Trump’s presidency could change that.“Trump is very business oriented, so he would be more in favor of drilling in the Arctic. So he will find some friends [in the Arctic Council],” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. “If climate change exceeds thresholds, we can have a global disaster. This is not a process of a little bit more or a little bit less. We’re clearly on an unsustainable path.”For Norway, the climate change problem isn’t going to be resolved by preventing development in the Arctic region. Instead, it’s about curbing emissions from countries like the US, China and India, said Midthun, from Norway’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Combined, the US and China make up 38 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and India produces almost 7 percent of global emissions. Comparatively, Norway produces 0.1 percent.But Norway’s sovereign fund of around $900 billion was mainly built on the country’s fossil fuel reserves. Through the fund, Norway owns a whopping 1 percent of the entire world’s stocks. Though the country has made efforts to divest from fossil fuel-related companies, its oil and gas exploration would pour money into the fund.“We will never achieve climate goals if we don’t create jobs and welfare for people,” Norway’s Prime Minister, Erna Solberg said.This sentiment is echoed by many Republican senators in Alaska. Senator Lisa Murkowski said this week that drilling in the Arctic was a priority for Trump.But some Arctic nations are approaching oil and gas exploration more cautiously.“It is the duty of the Arctic states to develop the Arctic in a sustainable way,” said Iceland’s Foreign Minister.Under Obama’s presidency, America had a similar stance. Oil and gas drilling in most parts of the Arctic was banned in 2016. Trump’s presidency, however, could shift things in Norway’s favor.At the international level, this will shake up America’s role as a leader on addressing climate change, according to Sachs, of Columbia University. Deals Obama made with China and India were widely considered to speed up global deals to limit global warming.Trump has already stated he has no intention to follow through on promises made by Obama’s administration.“We are clearly in an era where US global leadership is over,” said Sachs. “The US under president Trump is not going to play the role it once played.”"

When researched, you will find examples of masterworks by Botticelli and Michelangelo in Renaissance times, to Damien Hirst’s Spin paintings in more recent times, and what will inevitably become clear is the fact that this type has both the staying power and the diversity to meet the aesthetic challenges of any age. What I find particularly demanding, being an artist myself, is how difficult it is to maximize the focused force of a circular composition. Artists are most used to the square or rectangle canvases that can suggest either a portrait or landscape just in the way one uses it. The Tondo is a completely different situation. There is one endless side. And as a format, it has a much more focused configuration that has less to do with incorporating a background and more to do with presenting a subject.For this exhibition at the Walter Wickiser Gallery in NYC, I have selected seven artists who approach the Tondo configuration in new and challenging ways that greatly expand the field. Laurel Garcia Colvin’s What’s a Girl to Do, I Can’t Believe I’m Still Protesting this Shit, Tondo series (2014) focuses her attention of socio-political, feminist related issues that are truly meant to open eyes. Her vision, her agenda and her technical prowess culminate in a potent narrative that will surely force reaction regardless of which side of the aisle you stand on. Created in 2014, her art is more meaningful now than ever, as our nation’s politics and policies are sadly being bent backwards, but hopefully not breaking, under our new administration. Alexis Duque’s Disk (2015) melds abstraction with representation to create an intricate menagerie of hypnotic forms and hazy functions. Duque’s work is about the multiplicity of thoughts and ideas that somehow coalesce into a working system. But look closely, see every little detail and all the nuance, and you will begin to sense an endless, continual consciousness with no beginning or end. Life, like anything else, is a cycle, and with each generation comes the next learning curve. The only thing that grows is the mountain of debris.Karen Fitzgerald sees the Tondo as a chance to “convey an essence of interconnection, wholeness and metaphysical purpose.” And surely, her intention comes through the moment you see her work as your spirit rises and your thoughts move to a better understanding of the universe as both a micro and macro phenomenon. All natural elements are equally important, and everything is universal in its makeup. One of the things I find most fascinating about Fitzgerald’s work is the focus of her vision through the finesse in her technique. Renee Magnanti combines bold patterning with a suggestion of spirituality in her distinctive, colorful and highly textured encaustic reliefs. In looking at her work, you will get a sense of both Eastern and Western aesthetics as your eyes travel across seductive iconic forms shaped by cut-away caverns of color. Above all, there is a reverence for design in nature – how it stirs in us an understanding of the timeless powers that are greater than our own, while we are reminded of the uncomplicated splendor of life and culture. The multi-media Tondi of Creighton Michael express the subconscious connection between human impulse and the language of technology. As we struggle to find a comfort zone with an ever-changing world, a cerebral transformation must occur that may conflict with our instincts. Michael smoothes those transitional moments with a mix of sinuous pours over cryptic patterns balancing them like yin and yang. As a result, this ‘complementary’ pairing forms a universal aesthetic that crosses boundaries, making what was once awkward elevated. Margaret Roleke’s mixed media work puts a dark spin on the state of the world. She reveals, that from a very early age, we are brainwashed, to some extent, to act and think a certain way through fear tactics and false comfort zones. By combining cute Disney imagery with objects of war and aggression, Roleke reveals how pervasive and long standing this approach to social governing is. I am reminded of a quote by Noam Chomsky: “The United States is unusual among the industrial democracies in the rigidity of the system of ideological control – ‘indoctrination’, we might say – exercised through mass media.” Zane York’s hyperrealism is both magical and mesmerizing. The intense and relentless detail in his paintings and drawings is softened by a highly perceptive touch while his subjects reveal both their physical and spiritual sides. In some ways, York’s art is more akin to classical, high art, but with an earthier, more naturalistic narrative. At times, he can capture what at first seems near impossible with works like Untitled (2013), where nesting birds see a young woman’s hair and clothes as nesting materials. It is only after a few moments of looking that the scene becomes believable, even normal as its naturalistic detail takes hold of your subconscious.Tondo, Tondo, Tondo opens April 1, 2017. There is an opening reception on Thursday April 6 from 6-8pm, at the Walter Wickiser Gallery located at 210 Eleventh Avenue, Suite 303, New York City. "

When researched, you will find examples of masterworks by Botticelli and Michelangelo in Renaissance times, to Damien Hirst’s Spin paintings in more recent times, and what will inevitably become clear is the fact that this type has both the staying power and the diversity to meet the aesthetic challenges of any age. What I find particularly demanding, being an artist myself, is how difficult it is to maximize the focused force of a circular composition. Artists are most used to the square or rectangle canvases that can suggest either a portrait or landscape just in the way one uses it. The Tondo is a completely different situation. There is one endless side. And as a format, it has a much more focused configuration that has less to do with incorporating a background and more to do with presenting a subject.For this exhibition at the Walter Wickiser Gallery in NYC, I have selected seven artists who approach the Tondo configuration in new and challenging ways that greatly expand the field. Laurel Garcia Colvin’s What’s a Girl to Do, I Can’t Believe I’m Still Protesting this Shit, Tondo series (2014) focuses her attention of socio-political, feminist related issues that are truly meant to open eyes. Her vision, her agenda and her technical prowess culminate in a potent narrative that will surely force reaction regardless of which side of the aisle you stand on. Created in 2014, her art is more meaningful now than ever, as our nation’s politics and policies are sadly being bent backwards, but hopefully not breaking, under our new administration. Alexis Duque’s Disk (2015) melds abstraction with representation to create an intricate menagerie of hypnotic forms and hazy functions. Duque’s work is about the multiplicity of thoughts and ideas that somehow coalesce into a working system. But look closely, see every little detail and all the nuance, and you will begin to sense an endless, continual consciousness with no beginning or end. Life, like anything else, is a cycle, and with each generation comes the next learning curve. The only thing that grows is the mountain of debris.Karen Fitzgerald sees the Tondo as a chance to “convey an essence of interconnection, wholeness and metaphysical purpose.” And surely, her intention comes through the moment you see her work as your spirit rises and your thoughts move to a better understanding of the universe as both a micro and macro phenomenon. All natural elements are equally important, and everything is universal in its makeup. One of the things I find most fascinating about Fitzgerald’s work is the focus of her vision through the finesse in her technique.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c5c46a1e00002a0077f549.jpeg?cache=9iI68bULlN&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The press is fairly slavering for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. You can hardly read an item in the business pages without some commentator declaring that, at last, the unemployment rate is low enough and the growth rate high enough that the Fed can tighten money… and choke off further progress. Hosannas!But the commentators have to strain to tell us how good things are. Yes, wages are up this year, and unemployment is down, but as EPI’s comprehensive report makes clear, these gains have only begun to reverse several decades of rising inequality. Why does the financial community want higher interest rates? So that banks and other creditors can make more money, of course. And to head off inflation that for the moment is mostly imaginary. The core inflation rate is about 2.3 percent, a hair above its average in recent months. The Fed could easily let this recovery go on still longer, to produce even more wage gains.Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, deserves a medal for fending off this pressure for as long as she could. Yellen is the first liberal to hold the job since renegade banker Marriner Eccles ran the Fed under FDR and engineered low interest rates to help finance World War II.Yellen has brilliantly bobbed and weaved, in the manner of Fed chairs, suggesting that the Fed would surely raise rates sometime soon but not quite yet. But the pressure among other Fed governors and regional Fed bank presidents has reached the point where even Yellen has had to join the inflation-hawk camp, lest she get outvoted on the Fed’s policy-making Open Market Committee—a fate that Fed chairs detest. So Yellen herself has now signaled that the Fed will indeed raise rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.Please recall that Yellen got the job only because progressives in the Senate, led by Elizabeth Warren, were able to block Larry Summers. As a testament to the power of the dead hand of economic orthodoxy, the usual suspects persuaded Obama to name as deputy Fed vice-chair Stanley Fischer, a paladin of financial deregulation and tight money. The austerity caucus at the Fed keeps growing.This brings us to President Trump, who found to his shock that the economic statistics were not fake after all―when they reported the good news the economy had generated 235,000 jobs last month, causing the unemployment rate to tick down to 4.7 percent. Of course, in the boom of the late 1990s, unemployment went below 4 percent and could again.Trump will soon have three seats to fill at the Fed (out of seven), and he probably will replace Yellen when her term as chair expires early next year. What will Trump do?Normally, a conservative Republican president would appoint other conservatives, who are both inflation-phobic and pro-deregulation. But if Trump is shrewd, he will look to inflation doves, so that he can enjoy more good reports of rising growth and declining unemployment.Unfortunately, Trump’s banker chums, such as his economic policy director Gary Cohn, late of Goldman Sachs, and his treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin, also want more deregulation.Loose money and financial deregulation are not a good combination. It leads to bubbles—of the sort that crashed the economy in 2008. The Yellen regime at the Fed has been a splendid exception to the norm, because it has combined easy money with tight regulation, allowing the real economy to recover without a resurgence of abuses.It is a far less dramatic story than all of the Trump outrages that dominate the news, but the competence, progressivism and integrity of the Fed under Janet Yellen are one more thing that we are going to miss.Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and professor at Brandeis University’s Heller School.

His was a presidency fraught with dissension and Bush navigated tentatively. Saturday Night Live satirized him with the mantra “Wouldn’t be prudent.” Ten months into his term, on Friday, October 13th, the stock market crashed for the second time that decade. It was just two months later that the sculptor, Arturo Di Modica, stationed his bronze bull under the giant Christmas tree in front of the New York Stock Exchange, a gift to the people of New York.The sculpture was originally “guerilla art,” meaning that the work was not commissioned—the artist paid for its manufacture and placement, and located it where he wanted. Imagine the logistics of installing an 11 foot tall, 16 foot long, 7,100 lb sculpture.Picture the scene: it needed a big truck, a crane, and a posse of handlers—all shouting. Normally you would have a fistful of permits, barricades and police officers to hold back gawkers, and the mayor to “say a few words.” Di Modica skipped those steps and boldness was his friend. The bull was so big that no one thought to challenge him. It was just part of another unpredictable day in the Big Apple and it was met with New Yorkers’ habitual expectation of the unexpected. No one walking past asked pointed questions and no authorities were called—everyone assumed the sculpture was a commission. Di Modica himself expected the bull’s removal to be required as soon as city officials figured out who was responsible for its arrival.But Charging Bull stayed by popular acclaim. It’s an oversized, whimsical, approachable, dynamic figure that seems to imply respect—love even—for New York. It became an attraction immediately, drawing crowds on its very first day and ever since. As a photo-op it is now second only to the Statue of Liberty. There it has stood for almost 30 years, a symbol of the most powerful financial market in the world, an icon of runaway capitalism.When a Canadian magazine called Ad Busters instigated the Occupy Wall Street movement, it used the photograph of a ballerina posing on the back of the bull as the central image on announcements of the first Occupy gathering. Young, slight, and above all female, the dancer was the bull’s first formal encounter with a woman. Gently mocking as it felt at the time, the poster now seems prescient as it asks, “What is our one demand?” The answer wasn’t simple, of course. Wall Street stands for too many things: corporate influence on government, the greed that caused the global financial crisis of the day, and the wealth gap between the very rich and everyone else.As any artist will tell you, Di Modica’s sculpture has been irrevocably altered—destroyed in a way. Fearless Girl, by artist Kristen Visbal, was commissioned by State Street Global Advisors, and the juxtaposition of this new work changes everything. The bull’s untamed rampage is now about to be halted by a child—not a woman, but a self-assured little girl. What does it say? Without the bull, she’s nothing. With the bull, she’s the statement of a new order.And what about that bull? He was always a creature of his context. He was a bull without a bear. He was unchecked, a powerful and essentially optimistic creature. Meanwhile, Di Modica’s own feelings about the bull may have shifted. In 2010, he placed another one in Shanghai. While New York’s bull looks powerful and mature, the Shanghai version seems younger and stronger—possibly Di Modica’s comment on the developing Chinese economy.Fearless Girl, installed on International Women’s Day last week, is a creature of her time also. Who is she? The girl, despite being cast in bronze, is clearly of European heritage. It’s a choice that may be viewed with some irony as the world progresses, but which draws on the iconography of American children’s literature. She has a swinging ponytail, stands arms akimbo, and embodies a level of confidence seldom found in adult women. We know her—she’s who we wanted to be, who we want our kids to be. She’s the modern version of Ann of Green Gables, Laura Ingalls, Nancy Drew, and perhaps even Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. She’s brave, committed, not too pretty but still charming. Expect books, dolls, and action figures as part of the bull’s attempts to subvert her.But the girl has already appropriated the bull—or her sculptor has. The unfettered creature about to go on a heroic rampage now has to make a calculation: to charge or not to charge? A ring in his nose might be next.While the juxtaposition of the two sculptures is a concept developed by a finance company, the statement it makes could have come from the Women’s March itself. It speaks to women’s rights, to equal opportunity, and opposes the corruption that comes with unbridled power. Yes, the Women’s March is a young organization. Yes, its powers do not look strong as yet. But there’s a readiness there to confront the old bull: capitalism as it is currently configured, the corporate establishment, and the homeboy New York loves to hate, Donald Trump.And, by the way, there’s a photograph circulating on Instagram of some suited finance hopeful humping Fearless Girl.

Future and Ciara used to be a thing. They were more than a thing; they were engaged to be married, and they had a child together. They eventually broke up, and Ciara is now married to Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, and is pregnant with his twins. In any celebrity relationship, people will have their opinions, and when celebs break up, people will choose sides. But this situation seems a bit different to me. Since Future and Ciara split, thousands of people have been slandering Ciara like they know her personally. The internet, especially Twitter, is full of people who wish Ciara ill will. I recently saw a tweet rejoicing at the fact that Ciara, pregnant with twins, was in a car accident. These kind of posts usually include the idea that Ciara broke Future’s heart, or that it is okay to speak this way of her because of the fact that she left Future. People will try to justify this by saying “calm down, it’s a joke.” While I know it’s part of internet culture to roast people and joke around, some things really do point to a deeper issue, and I believe this is one of those things. Let’s begin with the fact that no one besides Future, Ciara, and possibly their loved ones know exactly what happened and why they split up. There were bits and pieces of transcripts posted online from their court appearances, and these transcripts did not paint Future as the saint that people act like he is. Why, then, is everyone jumping to his defense, even so long after the whole thing happened? Why is everyone so willing to degrade Ciara, and even go to the point of rejoicing over the idea of harm to her and her babies? The answer is simple. People have such a disregard for black women, that is doesn’t matter whether or not we are happy. Whether or not we are disrespected. Whether or not we are harmed. Malcolm X himself said “The most disrespected woman in America, is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America, is the black woman.” He said that in 1962, and it is still true in 2017. This can be seen in media portrayals of black women, in the way black women are treated in daily life, in the lack of focus on black women in social justice movements. It can especially be seen in the statistics surrounding black women. Black women make up only 8% of the population, but in 2005 accounted for 22% of the intimate partner homicide victims and 29% of all female victims of intimate partner homicide. Many black women also experience sexual violence. Approximately 40% of black women report coercive contact of a sexual nature by age 18. Black women are told we must be “strong,” aka ignore our feelings and our trauma, and remain silent and supportive of our men. This is why people are so okay with this treatment of Ciara. They think they can disrespect her because she is a black woman, and they hate her for wanting to do better. It’s not about whether or not she “broke Future’s heart.” Beyoncé made not only a whole deeply personal album, but also an accompanying film, to talk about how her man broke her heart. Where is the outrage at Jay-Z? Why was everyone so quick to forgive? Granted, they are still together, and that may play a role. But it doesn’t play the whole role. The “jokes”, the misrepresentation, the lack of representation, the silencing of our voices, the disregard for our bodies—all these things culminate to perpetuate a culture that is very hostile towards and dangerous for black women. We need to be aware of the messages that we put forward. I am a black woman, and I understand firsthand how these views of black women impact me personally, as well as black women at large. If you are a black man making these kinds of jokes and perpetuating these ideas about—and subsequently this violence towards—black women, then you need to check yourself. As black men, you should be wanting the best for and protecting you black sisters. And as people in general, we should all be looking out for each other. Jokes matter. Words matter. Choose them wisely. "

John McCain (R-Ariz.) wants the evidence to speak for itself. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee called on Trump on Sunday to either prove that his predecessor Barack Obama illegally tapped his phones or retract the allegation. His request comes roughly one week after Trump made the unprecedented claim on Twitter without offering any evidence backing it up.“The president has one of two choices, either retract or provide the information that the American people deserve,” McCain told CNN’s Jake Tapper, host of “State of the Union.” “I have no reason to believe that the charge is true, but I also believe that the president of the United States could clear this up in a minute.”So far, FBI Director James Comey, former senior U.S. officials and an Obama spokesman have called the claim false. Some Trump critics have accused him of making up the allegation to divert attention from investigations into his administration’s potential ties to Russia. Instead, it’s just created another talking point — one that wasn’t missed by McCain.“There’s a lot of things about our relations with Russia that trouble me a lot,” he said when asked about Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, previously working as a foreign agent for Turkey.“There’s a lot of aspects of this whole relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin that requires future scrutiny and so far I don’t think that the American people have gotten all of the answers and in fact I think there’s a lot more shoes to drop from this centipede,” he said. Though Trump has yet to produce evidence or again address the claim, two senior senators have since asked the FBI and Justice Department to produce whatever information they have on the matter.In a letter addressed to Comey and Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Wednesday demanded to know whether any warrants were obtained or requested by Obama. Graham told CNN that subpoenas will be issued if the federal agencies do no cooperate."

This discussion of tolerance has come in two forms: the first from the far right, which argues that their religious beliefs must be tolerated, and the second from the center and certain pockets of the left, who uncomfortably and half-heartedly argue that we should tolerate transgender people in our communities.This lukewarm, quiet statement of tolerance is supposed to be sufficient evidence of their support for transgender rights. It is, however, paltry when compared to the seven transgender people who have been killed just in the first two months of this year alone, or the fact that one site has figures showing one transgender person murdered every 29 hours, on average.As we come off of International Women’s Day, celebrated here in the US and abroad as A Day Without Women, it bears remembering that for the friends and families, created or biological, of those who have been killed, living one’s truth - particularly when it is so politically and culturally stigmatized - carries consequences that outlast a single day. They face lives without their loved ones, often uncomforted in their grief and greeted by hostility from opponents and cool detachment from supposed allies.Perhaps I am naïve, or just an optimist, but I fail to see what is so threatening to people about the idea of a transgender person using the bathroom. If we are struggling so hard with this microcosmic issue - one single space in a whole world - it remains to be seen how we can ever come to grips with this macrocosmically.This is where the limits of tolerance are most apparent. Tolerance, defined by Merriam Webster, is the ability or willingness to [allow] something, in particular the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with.There are lot of things that we tolerate. We tolerate poor customer service from one internet company because that of its competitors is just as bad. We tolerate our friends’ or partners’ bad habits, like putting a drink on a table without a coaster. It is shameful that we should think of human lives as merely “tolerable.”When we say it like that, of course, it sounds awful. But we’ve gotten very good at talking around tolerance. We proudly declare that we accept fundamental things, like a transgender person’s right to self-identify and choose their own pronouns. Sometimes we say this with a slight grudge, as if the idea of having to cede that much is spiritually costly.It follows, then, that we have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the point that we are proactive in protecting the rights of transgender Americans and those around the world rather than reactive. If we’re this unabashedly awful at faking like we respect others, if we can’t even admit that we tolerate someone else’s mere existence without gritting our teeth, how can we be angry when we’re called to task for our inaction? Why are we so upset when someone points out that every time we’re asked not to be merely reactive we throw a mini temper tantrum at the prospect of having to do more than acknowledge someone has Constitutional rights?I understand that tolerance can be hard. There are a lot of things I don’t agree with in this world, and if I had things my way people like the Westboro Baptist Church or the Ku Klux Klan wouldn’t be allowed to operate in our country. But I know that because the Constitution treats racism and homophobia as expressions of personal opinion rather than systemic repression, I have to suck it up and learn to live with them.The thing is, transgender people are in no way, shape, or form anything like a group preaching hate or inciting violence. And I made that comparison because if you can hear how stupid it sounds to compare the Ku Klux Klan to someone who just wants to pee without government regulation, you can understand why framing this as an issue of tolerance just doesn’t work.If we expect to be showered with praise and prizes for inclusivity, acceptance, and community, we must do something to create that environment. It is not enough simply to choose not to lock the door or pull the blinds. Passively resisting the forces of change and justice is not the same thing as actively propelling them onwards. In this political climate, we can’t just tolerate people. We have to welcome them, support them, and uplift them. And we have to do that in a way that, while allowing for theory and praxes to shift and evolve, never forgets the humanity of the people living in our communities. Tolerance just won’t cut it anymore."
79,POLITICS,Sarah Palin Blasts GOP Health Care Plan As 'Socialism',Mary Papenfuss,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sarah-palin-gop-socialism_us_58c4ca63e4b0ed71826d1b54,"But she's counting on Trump to ""fix"" the proposal that's ""Republican in name only.""",2017-03-12,Sarah Palin isn't a fan of the new GOP health care plan.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c4cbc71d000037037cdeb8.jpeg?cache=cX4NFquDIb&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An angry Sarah Palin tore into the new proposed Republican health care program as “socialism” on Saturday.In a strident interview with the conservative news outlet Breitbart, she also ripped the “quasi-reformed” proposal as a “RINO plan” — Republican in name only.She said she expects President Donald Trump to “step in and fix it.” “Remember this is government-controlled health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of government-run medicine,” the former Alaska governor and one-time vice presidential candidate told Breitbart. “Even in this new quasi-reformed proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That’s the whole premise here.”Palin’s vociferous opposition underscores the problem Republicans face in getting their plan off the ground. Not only do they face millions of furious voters terrified of losing insurance under Obamacare, but they must also grapple with stiff opposition from those on the extreme right who see the program as granting too much insurance aid to struggling Americans.The proposed American Health Care Act would drop a requirement that all Americans have health insurance, just as all drivers are required to have car insurance. The GOP plan instead would allow insurance companies to tack on a 30 percent penalty for people who have opted out of health insurance once they decide to sign up at some point in the future.“This 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers. It makes you wonder who’s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved,” Palin said. She was apparently referring to insurance companies that would reap the rewards of the penalty while other companies in the private sector would not receive any kind of comparable benefits with the help of government regulation.“It would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do ... let them wear their sponsors [the names of their contributors] plastered all over their three-piece suits ... so we know what side they’re on and who they’re actually doing their bidding for,” she added.Palin said she’s not opposed to all aspects of the plan, and is counting on the president to fix its problems.She added: “As a businessman, he’s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side.” "

But he has since dropped the anti-southern rhetoric and plans to run for prime minister at Italy’s next general elections in 2018.In an effort to broaden the party’s support base after taking over as leader from Northern Leaguefounder Umberto Bossi in 2013, Salvini has apologized for his party’s traditional anti-southern stance.“I want to go to Naples’ periphery where life is real, unlike that of posh neighborhoods,” Salvini told supporters in Naples on Saturday.The League was founded in the 1980s and used to campaign for the independence of northern Italy."

One day after officially declaring a famine in parts of the five-year-old country on Feb. 20 ― the world’s first famine declaration in six years ― President Salva Kiir vowed to grant aid organizations “unimpeded access.”U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Eugene Owusu praised Kiir’s commitment and urged swift action to support the millions of people in need. “Time is of the essence, and lives are in the balance, so it is critical that these words be translated into concrete actions on the ground immediately.”But just a week later, South Sudan raised the cost of aid worker permits a hundredfold, from $100 to $10,000. Minister of Information Michael Makuei told The Associated Press that the change is intended to increase government revenue. The timing is devastating. At least 100,000 South Sudanese residents are facing death, and 1 million more teeter on the brink of starvation. Of the country’s 13 million people, 6.1 million are in need of humanitarian aid.The Huffington Post reached out to representatives of various international humanitarian agencies operating there, but they were reluctant to comment on the unfolding situation, as it remains unclear. The government’s stunning move to hike the cost of permits follows a disturbing pattern of relief effort obstruction that has been documented since the civil war erupted in late 2013. It has repeatedly prevented aid groups from reaching and helping the people of South Sudan, who, Owusu says, are “suffering beyond measure.”The tragedy of South Sudan is that the suffering is manmade.Just two years after its liberation and independence from Sudan in 2011, a political power struggle between Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, exploded into violence that consumed the infant nation and plunged it into a gruesome spiral of self-destruction.The chaos expanded from warring government and rebel forces into a feud between ethnic groups and has been prolonged by corruption to outlast a string of failed cease-fire agreements with no end in sight.The horrific civil unrest triggered mass displacement, which hindered farmers’ crop maintenance. This, in turn, decimated South Sudan’s vital agriculture industry and created conditions for a famine that have been amplified by a severe drought. A subsequent cholera outbreak that began last June has infected thousands, and as of Friday it had spread to the crippled nation’s second-largest city, Malakal. More than a quarter of the population has been forced from their homes since the start of the 2013 conflict, including at least 1.5 million people who fled the country as refugees. In four months, when South Sudan turns six years old, the humanitarian community anticipates 5.5 million people there will have severely inadequate access to food.“The root cause of this suffering is conflict,” said U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O’Brien, who returned from a visit to South Sudan this month. “People have been displaced, brutalized and raped. They have been attacked when they sought out assistance.”At least 700,000 people have crossed the border into Uganda at an unprecedented rate of nearly 3,000 a day. Many have fled sexual violence, according to a report released Thursday by Refugees International. Some women described having to pay soldiers a “rape tax” in order to escape.“We hired a driver to take us to the Oraba border point,” explained an unnamed South Sudanese woman featured in the report. “When we reached Kimba, there were two soldiers. They told the women to get out, to remove their clothes and lie down. The children saw their mothers get raped.”All the while, the government has consistently thwarted humanitarian efforts to alleviate suffering and resolve tensions by blocking and even expelling aid workers.The government has also been widely accused of stealing aid supplies. In July, thieves seized more than 4,500 metric tons of food from the World Food Programme’s main warehouse in the capital of Juba ― enough to feed 220,000 people in impoverished regions for a month.A scathing report from Washington-based rights group The Sentry following a two-year investigation offers insight as to why the imploding nation is resisting outside help and seemingly exacerbating its own crisis. It concludes that top government officials have orchestrated, perpetuated and exploited the chaos in South Sudan to accumulate vast fortunes by looting billions of dollars from the country.The war helps the rich get richer, explained actor George Clooney, co-founder of The Sentry, in an interview on “PBS News Hour.”The president and other senior government leaders are not only “committing these crimes, which they have already been accused of,” Clooney said, “they’re profiting off of it.”The U.N. Commission on Human Rights also released a report this week following a seven-month inquiry into South Sudan that accuses government forces and affiliated militia of using “the cover of an ongoing conflict to act as a ‘smoke screen’” while carrying out acts of civilian abuse that may amount to war crimes with impunity.The comprehensive report outlines indications of genocide and ethnic cleansing in the war-ravaged country, including deliberate starvation, bombardment of civilians, forced displacement and burning of villages.Survivors told UNCHR how South Sudanese soldiers use rape as a weapon of war. After suffering an anal rape last June that left her incontinent, one woman recalled, she was raped again and her genitalia was cut as punishment for “being stubborn.” She said she begged the assailants to kill her but instead was left for dead.Soldiers are also accused of targeting aid workers. The U.N. claims armed troops beat and gang-raped its personnel at a private Juba compound last July. No one responded to their cries for help, the U.N. said.Makuei dismissed the reports of atrocities committed by his government as fake news, according to local media outlets.“There is no looming genocide in South Sudan. Nevertheless, the media houses, the reporters and everybody are still repeating the same thing; it is a matter of cut and paste. And when you cut and paste it would appear as if it is a new report,” he reportedly said at a press conference in Juba on Thursday.“You find NGOs, humanitarian organizations talking about obstruction of their movement, [but] they are not being obstructed,” Makuei added. “They are being regulated, and if you don’t want to be regulated, then you are a no-system person, because you must be regulated by the laws of our country.”Meanwhile, as Juba continues to deny culpability against mounting evidence, and as humanitarians grapple with yet another government-imposed challenge to reach the growing number of people so desperately in need of aid, tens of thousands of emaciated men, women and children languish in agony.Jess covers world news for The Huffington Post.

Let’s call it their Jimmy Carter problem.After the outsider peanut farmer-turned-politician from Georgia won the White House in 1976’s post-Watergate election, he took office with near historic majorities in both chambers of Congress ― 61 Democrats in the Senate and a 292 to 143 edge in the House.Democrats had high hopes for the optimistic, famously toothy embodiment of the New South. What they got was underwhelming ― a leader who feuded with Congress, and scored some foreign policy successes, but never managed to pull off anything especially ambitious. “He got some stuff through, but it was certainly not another Great Society,” said Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer, referring to achievements of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, who also presided over one-party government. “I think Democrats feel he wasted an opportunity that existed, and that helped open the door to the right.”There were certainly economic and international crises beyond Carter’s control, but his failure to achieve big-ticket success paved the way for former President Ronald Reagan’s revolution from which liberals still haven’t entirely recovered.Now, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his fellow Republicans can see the historic writing on the wall with their own outsider reality-TV-star-turned-politician occupying the White House. It’s the first time since former President George W. Bush’s second election that the Republicans are starting a fresh four-year presidential term with unified control of government.And they’ve got something big they want to do. Or, more accurately, that they want to undo. Their signature promise for the last six years has been to repeal Obamacare. Even as the GOP proposal to deliver on that promise got “Ishtar” level pans from the left, right and experts, Ryan and many of his colleagues made clear this past week how vital they think it is to propel their deconstructive blueprint into law.Ryan told reporters on Capitol Hill that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act should come first, before the GOP can pursue any other cherished goals. He offered an especially stark explanation in a radio interview Friday with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt. “I do agree that this is momentum-killing,” the speaker said. “If we don’t do this and reduce or get rid of the trillion-dollar tax increases in Obamacare, that just puts tax reform a trillion dollars further out of our reach. So there’s a lot that rides on this, not to mention just the schedule.”While Ryan cast it in practical terms, other Republicans were blunter, and recognized a global importance to their and Trump’s agenda in revoking former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement.“This is so basic to what we have promised over the last few elections,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the second ranking Republican in the Senate. “I think if we fail to keep this promise then I think it makes the rest of our work much, much more difficult to accomplish.”Failing to accomplish goals has electoral consequences. Historian Zelizer points to former President Bill Clinton’s first term, when he managed to boost taxes but failed utterly at health care reform, and the country answered with the Republican revolution of Newt Gingrich, who was speaker from 1995 to 1999.A similar tale was told when Bush won his second term in 2004.“His big push was for privatizing Social Security,” Zelizer said. “That falls apart, he gets nowhere on immigration reform and he, too, is not able to really capitalize on united government, and, in that case re-election, which is in some ways even a better situation.”The wave election that that hit the nation in 2006 washed away the GOP majorities.Republicans aren’t eager to entertain the possibility that they could fail to repeal and replace Obamacare, but they do see electoral doom in failure.They are not willing to acknowledge that Americans might grow angry at the GOP for even pursuing a plan that, as it stands now, would cut health care for millions and dramatically raise costs for millions more if it passes.But they are highly cognizant of how the more zealous portions of their electoral base will react.Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) sees the need to satisfy that contingent as so important that his side would be best off simply repealing Obamacare and worrying about the replacement later.“We have to repeal it, and if we don’t repeal it, we’re going to split with our base,” he said. “That’s a dangerous political thing to do.”“Republicans have been talking for six years that we’re going to repeal and replace, and that’s got to be the top category ’cause we may only get one chance,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). In the House, where conservatives make up an even more powerful block, some lawmakers believe passing a hard-right health care plan is so pressing a requirement that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) should take the extraordinary step of rewriting Senate rules to end the filibuster.Arizona Rep. Trent Franks (R) told The Huffington Post he doesn’t especially like the House replacement plan, but he was inclined to support it because he’s sure a more conservative alternative cannot get through a filibuster by Democrats.The current GOP plan is being advanced as a budgetary measure under a process known as reconciliation. Such measures cannot be filibustered. But they are meant to deal only with budgetary matters. While the GOP has tried to craft their reconciliation plan as broadly as possible, there are still policy issues that cannot be addressed with a budget bill. Franks said that leaves the House leaders in the terrible position of trying to satisfy a potentially furious GOP base and Senate rules that actually grant the Democratic minority power. “This is like trying to walk a tightrope in an earthquake. It’s just an untenable circumstance for them,” he said.Failure ― even if Senate Democrats cause it playing by the rules ― could doom his party, Franks added.“I think that Senate rule has the potential of putting both houses in the hands of Democrats next time,” he said, referring to the 2018 elections.Franks argued the consequences make it essential for the GOP to do whatever it can.“It just means whether or not Republicans are going to take this last best hope they’ve had in a long time, and at least give the American people a snapshot of what Republican policy looks like,” he said. “Or if we’re going to become victims of our own traditions and send the Republican ideals down the corridors of history.” It’s not just the Republican representatives and senators who would suffer under such failure.Trump would also find himself in a precarious spot, even if his voters heap blame on Congress. Because members of Congress will blame Trump if he can’t use the bully pulpit to help them succeed with legislation.“I think a lot of Republicans figured he was just going to blitz them with lots of legislation, and he hasn’t. And it’s not even clear the White House is working on it,” Zelizer said. “I think they’re comfortable using executive action and causing a lot of chaos.”But that is not what the GOP lawmakers need. They need success, not some Trump-concocted blend of rhetorical and executive mayhem.“If nothing happens on ACA, if it’s just one big disaster, this whole effort in the next few weeks, it will soften or weaken Republican support on Capitol Hill for the president,” Zelizer said.If Republicans cannot count on Trump, the president may no longer be able to rely on the people who are holding back Democratic demands for probes of everything from his still ill-understood ties to Russia to his many and conflicted business entanglements. “This president could start entering a danger zone where members of his own party are willing to go after him,” Zelizer said.Just imagine an election in 2018 where Republicans have angered their base by failing to pass an Obamacare replacement, and their president is facing bipartisan investigations on multiple fronts.Republicans certainly can, and the result doesn’t leave them and their man remembered in history at all like previous titans of unified government ― an LBJ, JFK or FDR.Instead, it’s more like JEC, and who even knows Jimmy Carter’s middle name?

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c3f812270000ee647496dc.jpeg?cache=s06NSXpDzx&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Running for Congress under even the best circumstances is a grind: Up early for breakfast meetings, on the trail all day and finish with an evening event. The time between your head hitting the pillow and your alarm going off gets squeezed until there’s little of it left. Then you get up and do it again. Doing all that to win is one thing. Doing it just to get wiped out at the polls requires a level of dedication bordering on bonkers. That means that one of the first questions top potential candidates ask party handlers before making the decision is a simple one: “Can I win? If so, show me the numbers.”But a funny thing is happening this time around: Democratic prospects, in conversations with party elders, are skipping that question. Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that the question of how winnable a race is is often among the top concerns. This year, the energy among Democratic activists has persuaded potential candidates that anything is possible.“So far, this cycle is very different,” she said. “People are coming to us in a way that’s new and exciting, and it’s clear that we will have strong candidates across an expanded battlefield in 2018.”Finding good candidates has been even easier this year than it was in 2016, bucking a years-long trend. “Despite the fact that presidential cycles tend to benefit Democrats in terms of turnout, recruitment was not easy last cycle,” Kelly said. “Our political department ultimately recruited a number of strong, successful candidates, but it was only after camping out in districts and going person to person, sometimes for months, until they found someone qualified and interested in running.”It started with the Women’s March events in January, when around 4 million people took to the streets around the country, for the largest single-day rally in American history. It continued with surging turnout in special elections from Minnesota to Iowa to Virginia, Connecticut and Delaware. It has flowed down to Georgia, where a 30-year-old Democrat, Jon Ossoff, is attempting to take Republican Tom Price’s House seat. Ossoff is breaking fundraising records thanks to a burst of small-dollar support from around the country. And now in Montana, Rob Quist, a bluegrass legend, has jumped into the race for the Democrats to fill the seat vacated by Ryan Zinke, who, like Price, joined President Donald Trump’s cabinet. Quist has a long history of public service and charitable work and is wildly popular in Montana, but he has never run for office. Trump has changed things. Groups that have exploded since the election, like Swing Left, Flippable and the Sister District Project, are funneling money and volunteer resources from blue districts to where it’s needed more.Democrats have been bad at getting out their base in recent midterm elections ― although history is on their side this time around, since the party in control of the White House traditionally suffers losses in these off-year elections. But with midterm turnout low, the best candidates often take a pass at making a bid. Without good candidates, turnout falls lower, accelerating a vicious cycle.The Democratic Party is face an uphill climb in the Senate in general, but particularly this year: Democrats are defending 25 of the 34 seats up for grabs. Winning the 218 seats needed to take back the House of Representatives is a daunting task as well, no matter how much energy is in the streets, because Republicans have used their power at the state level to redraw districts to favor them. The fact that Democrats tend to cluster in major cities also plays a role in sorting voters in a way that allows Republicans to claim 55 percent of the seats, even though more people voted for Democrats for Congress. But Republicans can’t gerrymander a state ― and 36 states have governors races in 2018. Those elections will be critical in helping to un-gerrymander the damage that was done after the 2010 census. Nine of those are in currently Republican-governed states that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and at least another half dozen are well within reach. Another nine are currently held by Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already had more than 175 serious conversations or meetings with potential recruits in more than 55 districts ― far more than in past cycles. The group said it’s seeing more interest from veterans, who are concerned about Trump’s views on national security and see running for office as a second call to duty.There’s also been a surge of interest from people who have never run for office and now want to at least explore stepping up to the plate. This trend is happening even in GOP bastions like Utah and South Carolina. When the state party opened up registration for a March candidate training, officials sold out of their 50 tickets in the first day. A week later, the party expanded it to 200 spots ― and again immediately sold out. In a wave election, districts that are evenly split swing toward the party that is surging ― Democrats in 2006 and 2008, then Republicans in 2010 ― and districts that lean toward the majority party become winnable. In a district which went for Trump by 10 points, it’s not hard to see how that becomes a tight race under the right circumstances.Mark Fraley, chairman of the Monroe County, Indiana Democratic Party, said that Democrats on the ground are fired up, and Republicans are checking out. Stephanie Hansen, who won a Delaware special election in February, saw the same thing, moving what was a two point race to an 18 point blowout. “If our people are mobilized and Trump supporters are demoralized, then yes, some of these races that have nine-point Republican advantages start looking close,” Fraley said. “A lot of Trump’s core supporters aren’t going anywhere, but you start seeing demoralization among working people ― they voted for Obama twice, then Trump. If we’re not seeing the changes they hoped to see you’ll be able to see disengagement on that part.”There are, meanwhile, eight districts that could be easier picking for Democrats. These seats ― one each in Arizona, New Jersey and Kansas, two in Texas and three in California ― are all congressional districts that voted for the GOP presidential candidate in both 2008 and then 2012 ― and then went for Hillary Clinton this past cycle. They’re also all still represented by GOP House members. It won’t be easy, of course. Texas’s 7th district hasn’t elected a Democrat to Congress since 1967. One of those seats is currently held by veteran congressman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), an eccentric libertarian-leaning Republican who’s been in office nearly 30 years. He faced his toughest challenge in 2008, but still won by some 10 points and hasn’t faced a true challenge since. That changed this year, thanks in large part to the endless demonstrations local Democrats have held against Rohrabacher.Local businessman Harley Rouda, seeing the energy in the streets, decided to jump in and challenge Rohrabacher. “The energy is what motivated me to get in the race, hands down,” he said. “The Women’s March, coupled with the activist movement here ... was the biggest motivation that now is the time for all of us to get involved and be the change we want to see.”It mattered to Rouda that, with the uptick in anti-Trump energy, the race seems winnable. “I’ll be straight with you,” he said. “The fact that midterms don’t typically draw voters out ... is tempered by the populist movement we’ve got going here. Now is the time to tap into that crowd who really want to get engaged and committed to making that difference.”In some rare cases, there may even be too much engagement. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the top two finishers, regardless of party, go on to compete in the general election, even if both are from the same party. Christy Smith, a progressive school board president in the Los Angeles region, had her eye on California’s 25th congressional district, a seat held tenuously by Republican Stephen Knight, but one carried in 2016 by Clinton. The DCCC in 2016 had backed Bryan Caforio, who raised a lot of money but never connected with voters and lost by six points. With the energy coursing through the district, a campaign began to draft Smith to jump in the race. He’s popular with both supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and those who backed Clinton. Smith gave it a lot of thought, and when first interviewed by The Huffington Post this month, she was undecided. “I was riding two horses with one ass,” she joked a week later, having finally made up her mind to run for state assembly rather than Congress. Her reasoning, she said, was two-fold. “California is on the leading edge of what’s possible with effective government,” she said. “To be able to be a part of that could be tremendous and allow me a lot of latitude to really get things done for people in my district and bring resources back.” Strategically, though, it was also the smarter move. “With all of this newfound energy, there’s not a lot of understanding of strategy with those folks, because they’re new to the game,” she said. “There’s a broad ‘y’all come’ attitude, with people coming out of the woodwork.” That’s great when it comes to turnout, but California has a top-two system, meaning that the top two finishers in the primary, regardless of party, go on to the general election. If a big batch of Democrats run, then Republicans tend to run only two candidates. That can allow those two candidates to finish one and two, while Democrats split the remainder among themselves. That puts two Republicans on the general election ballot. “We need to be smart if we’re going to flip this district,” she said.HuffPost Survey: Should Democrats in Congress resist Trump across the board, or work with him where there is common ground?CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Caforio campaigned in 2014; he ran in 2016."
88,POLITICS,Anger At Donald Trump Could Break The Democrats' Midterm Curse,Ryan Grim and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-democrats-midterm_us_58c3f500e4b0d1078ca716d0,"“A lot of Trump’s core supporters aren’t going anywhere, but you start seeing demoralization among working people.""",2017-03-11,Democrats need to win well over a majority to control the House Senate and White House,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c3f6af1e00003f0077f2fc.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Running for Congress under even the best circumstances is a grind: Up early for breakfast meetings, on the trail all day and finish with an evening event. The time between your head hitting the pillow and your alarm going off gets squeezed until there’s little of it left. Then you get up and do it again. Doing all that to win is one thing. Doing it just to get wiped out at the polls requires a level of dedication bordering on bonkers. That means that one of the first questions top potential candidates ask party handlers before making the decision is a simple one: “Can I win? If so, show me the numbers.”But a funny thing is happening this time around: Democratic prospects, in conversations with party elders, are skipping that question. Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said that the question of how winnable a race is is often among the top concerns. This year, the energy among Democratic activists has persuaded potential candidates that anything is possible.“So far, this cycle is very different,” she said. “People are coming to us in a way that’s new and exciting, and it’s clear that we will have strong candidates across an expanded battlefield in 2018.”Finding good candidates has been even easier this year than it was in 2016, bucking a years-long trend. “Despite the fact that presidential cycles tend to benefit Democrats in terms of turnout, recruitment was not easy last cycle,” Kelly said. “Our political department ultimately recruited a number of strong, successful candidates, but it was only after camping out in districts and going person to person, sometimes for months, until they found someone qualified and interested in running.”It started with the Women’s March events in January, when around 4 million people took to the streets around the country, for the largest single-day rally in American history. It continued with surging turnout in special elections from Minnesota to Iowa to Virginia, Connecticut and Delaware. It has flowed down to Georgia, where a 30-year-old Democrat, Jon Ossoff, is attempting to take Republican Tom Price’s House seat. Ossoff is breaking fundraising records thanks to a burst of small-dollar support from around the country. And now in Montana, Rob Quist, a bluegrass legend, has jumped into the race for the Democrats to fill the seat vacated by Ryan Zinke, who, like Price, joined President Donald Trump’s cabinet. Quist has a long history of public service and charitable work and is wildly popular in Montana, but he has never run for office. Trump has changed things. Groups that have exploded since the election, like Swing Left, Flippable and the Sister District Project, are funneling money and volunteer resources from blue districts to where it’s needed more.Democrats have been bad at getting out their base in recent midterm elections ― although history is on their side this time around, since the party in control of the White House traditionally suffers losses in these off-year elections. But with midterm turnout low, the best candidates often take a pass at making a bid. Without good candidates, turnout falls lower, accelerating a vicious cycle.The Democratic Party is face an uphill climb in the Senate in general, but particularly this year: Democrats are defending 25 of the 34 seats up for grabs. Winning the 218 seats needed to take back the House of Representatives is a daunting task as well, no matter how much energy is in the streets, because Republicans have used their power at the state level to redraw districts to favor them. The fact that Democrats tend to cluster in major cities also plays a role in sorting voters in a way that allows Republicans to claim 55 percent of the seats, even though more people voted for Democrats for Congress. But Republicans can’t gerrymander a state ― and 36 states have governors races in 2018. Those elections will be critical in helping to un-gerrymander the damage that was done after the 2010 census. Nine of those are in currently Republican-governed states that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won in 2016, and at least another half dozen are well within reach. Another nine are currently held by Democrats. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already had more than 175 serious conversations or meetings with potential recruits in more than 55 districts ― far more than in past cycles. The group said it’s seeing more interest from veterans, who are concerned about Trump’s views on national security and see running for office as a second call to duty.There’s also been a surge of interest from people who have never run for office and now want to at least explore stepping up to the plate. This trend is happening even in GOP bastions like Utah and South Carolina. When the state party opened up registration for a March candidate training, officials sold out of their 50 tickets in the first day. A week later, the party expanded it to 200 spots ― and again immediately sold out. In a wave election, districts that are evenly split swing toward the party that is surging ― Democrats in 2006 and 2008, then Republicans in 2010 ― and districts that lean toward the majority party become winnable. In a district which went for Trump by 10 points, it’s not hard to see how that becomes a tight race under the right circumstances.Mark Fraley, chairman of the Monroe County, Indiana Democratic Party, said that Democrats on the ground are fired up, and Republicans are checking out. Stephanie Hansen, who won a Delaware special election in February, saw the same thing, moving what was a two point race to an 18 point blowout. “If our people are mobilized and Trump supporters are demoralized, then yes, some of these races that have nine-point Republican advantages start looking close,” Fraley said. “A lot of Trump’s core supporters aren’t going anywhere, but you start seeing demoralization among working people ― they voted for Obama twice, then Trump. If we’re not seeing the changes they hoped to see you’ll be able to see disengagement on that part.”There are, meanwhile, eight districts that could be easier picking for Democrats. These seats ― one each in Arizona, New Jersey and Kansas, two in Texas and three in California ― are all congressional districts that voted for the GOP presidential candidate in both 2008 and then 2012 ― and then went for Hillary Clinton this past cycle. They’re also all still represented by GOP House members. It won’t be easy, of course. Texas’s 7th district hasn’t elected a Democrat to Congress since 1967. One of those seats is currently held by veteran congressman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), an eccentric libertarian-leaning Republican who’s been in office nearly 30 years. He faced his toughest challenge in 2008, but still won by some 10 points and hasn’t faced a true challenge since. That changed this year, thanks in large part to the endless demonstrations local Democrats have held against Rohrabacher.Local businessman Harley Rouda, seeing the energy in the streets, decided to jump in and challenge Rohrabacher. “The energy is what motivated me to get in the race, hands down,” he said. “The Women’s March, coupled with the activist movement here ... was the biggest motivation that now is the time for all of us to get involved and be the change we want to see.”It mattered to Rouda that, with the uptick in anti-Trump energy, the race seems winnable. “I’ll be straight with you,” he said. “The fact that midterms don’t typically draw voters out ... is tempered by the populist movement we’ve got going here. Now is the time to tap into that crowd who really want to get engaged and committed to making that difference.”In some rare cases, there may even be too much engagement. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the top two finishers, regardless of party, go on to compete in the general election, even if both are from the same party. Christy Smith, a progressive school board president in the Los Angeles region, had her eye on California’s 25th congressional district, a seat held tenuously by Republican Stephen Knight, but one carried in 2016 by Clinton. The DCCC in 2016 had backed Bryan Caforio, who raised a lot of money but never connected with voters and lost by six points. With the energy coursing through the district, a campaign began to draft Smith to jump in the race. He’s popular with both supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and those who backed Clinton. Smith gave it a lot of thought, and when first interviewed by The Huffington Post this month, she was undecided. “I was riding two horses with one ass,” she joked a week later, having finally made up her mind to run for state assembly rather than Congress.

89,POLITICS,Conservatives Craft Their Wish List On The GOP Health Care Bill,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-wish-list-health-care_us_58c339eee4b0d1078ca6ebb3,They want a lot. And they figure the bill won't pass without their support.,2017-03-11,"Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), left, and Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) conclude a March 7 news conference with House Freedom Caucus members who criticized the GOP health care bill.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58c33c3b2700003800749627.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As House Republicans prepare to bring their health care proposal to the floor, conservatives are demanding a slate of major changes that they say are necessary to bring them on board and, ultimately, pass the bill.According to members familiar with negotiations among the House Freedom Caucus, GOP leadership and the White House, conservatives are still demanding that the rollback of the Medicaid expansion begin in 2018, not 2020, as currently written in the Republican bill.House Republican leaders have been emphatic that they can’t move up that date, and White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Friday that the 2020 date to begin the Medicaid expansion phaseout was what President Donald Trump supported.“It’s not a question of negotiation,” Spicer said.But, based on their own conversations with the White House, conservatives believe it is still a question of negotiation.“We had tremendous conversations with the president a couple of times yesterday,” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said Friday, “and we found him to be not only willing to negotiate, but a desire to really make this bill the very best it can be. His willingness to find common ground shows why The Art of the Deal is not just a distant memory of a previous life.”Meadows was joined in the White House meetings Thursday by former HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who also noted the receptiveness of the president to strike a deal.“We’re still working on those changes that we think would make this bill consistent,” Jordan told The Huffington Post on Friday, adding that they hadn’t “settled” on any of their negotiations.But based on conversations with members familiar with the negotiations, in addition to the Medicaid timeline, conservatives also want to allow insurance companies to offer plans that don’t meet the coverage standards of the Affordable Care Act, which means plans could have higher deductibles or offer gaps in coverages for lower premiums.The Republicans legislation already does some of this by repealing the rule mandating that plans cover at least 60% of medical expenses. There is some concern that other provisions on coverage would break the reconciliation status of the bill, which means those provisions would take 60 votes in the Senate to pass, but members want to look for ways to increase the number of insurance mandates and rules that could be repealed while still not violating that so-called Byrd rule.Freedom Caucus members also want to allow people to use health savings accounts to pay their premiums, instead of just using them for deductibles and other out-of-pocket medical costs. Making that change would introduce an element of a plan by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) to allow tax-free dollars to be used to pay for insurance, which would not quite blow up the entire current GOP bill.Finally, members want a 20-hour work requirement for able-bodied adults who are on Medicaid. That would further cut some Medicaid costs, but the idea seems based more on stereotypes than on potential savings. The vast majority of people on Medicaid are ill, in school, already working or looking for work.Freedom Caucus members still haven’t given up on overhauling a linchpin of the bill ― the advance refundable tax credits ― but some members now acknowledge that major changes to the basis of the replacement language would pretty much amount to Republicans starting over, which doesn’t look apt to happen.Still, one caucus member noted that if Republicans were willing to negotiate on the tax credits, there would be a universe of items that conservatives could give up in exchange, perhaps even lengthening the term of the Medicaid expansion past the 2020 date.If Republicans actually adopted the changes conservatives are advocating for, however, it would instantly present the House with vote problems from moderates ― and even more problems in the Senate.Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), the chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, told HuffPost on Friday that if Republicans moved up the Medicaid expansion phaseout, it would be a “big problem,” and he indicated that a strong majority in the House ― probably every Democrat and a number of Republicans ― would oppose that change. “If there’s that discussion, they should allow an amendment on the floor to resolve the issue.”The problem for House leaders is that even if Republicans agreed to the conservative wish list, there still would be Freedom Caucus members voting against the bill.HFC member Scott Perry (R-Pa.) noted on Friday that everyone knows there are some conservatives who are going to oppose the bill. “But I think some members are more flexible,” Perry said, adding that leaders needed to show “some good faith” and make changes that are “meaningful and impactful.” Among the conservatives who appear unwilling to negotiate are Justin Amash (R-Mich.), who is upset with just about every facet of the bill and the process for the legislation, and his non-HFC buddy Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has taken to calling the legislation “a stinking pile of garbage.”“My calls are running 30 to 1 to oppose it,” Massie said Thursday night.Massie went on to ridicule House Speaker Paul Ryan’s three-pronged approach to “repeal and replace,” which involves passing this reconciliation bill, letting Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price handle some aspects administratively and then passing other bills (with a challenging 60-vote threshold in the Senate) to address health care costs.“There’s three baskets: There’s the repeal-and-replace basket, there’s the Tom Price basket and the Easter basket,” Massie said.And there are other hard-line right members who look apt to oppose any bill resembling this plan if it maintained the 2020 date for rolling back Medicaid. Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) told HuffPost on Friday that Republicans shouldn’t agree to any Medicaid expansion “whatsoever,” and Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) suggested he couldn’t support any measure that didn’t address the expansion until after 2018.Which is all to say, even if Republicans adopted the other changes conservatives wanted, without the most contentious modification, the Medicaid expansion date, there would still be a group of Republicans who would probably oppose the measure. And if Republicans did change the date of the Medicaid expansion, they would face a mutiny from moderates.Conversely, if House GOP leadership continued to refuse to negotiate, they could probably still pick off a number of Freedom Caucus members, who are not united in their opposition to the bill.Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) told HuffPost this week that the tax credits were a “positive step,” and his fellow Freedom Caucus Texan, Joe Barton, already supported the most contentious provisions in the Energy and Commerce Committee.Barton actually had an amendment in committee to shorten the time on the expansion, but he withdrew it when Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) asked, though Barton noted Friday he had a “green light” to offer it for floor consideration.On the one hand, Freedom Caucus members hope their negotiations lead to floor votes on their demands, but on the other hand, they worry House leadership will rally members against their amendments.“We don’t want anybody’s thumb on the scale,” Perry said this week. “We want an honest run at the thing.“If we lose, I guess we’ll have to determine how that factors into our decision. But if we lose an unfair fight, that’s going to be problematic.”Jeffrey Young and Jonathan Cohn contributed reporting."

Why not?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576767b81500002d001ba43e.png?ops=100_100,"I arrived in South Korea fairly rested after 20 hours of travel, ready to try out the brand new bobsled track that was constructed for the 2018 Olympic Games. For safety reasons, host cities must offer training sessions before the Olympics to give everyone equal time to learn the new track. I was ready. I was excited.I never get sick ― not a cold, not a cough or sore throat. Everyone around me can be hacking up a lung, and I’m fine. When we first talked about going to Korea for the World Cup this season, I remember wondering what the new track would look like, how good the food would be and the fact that I would be spending my third birthday in three years in a different country. While the talk of possible illness was also in the air, I never gave it a second thought, because again, I don’t get sick, and we were getting vaccinations. I’m invincible, of course.It’s 1:30 a.m. and suddenly I’m awake. I’m so thirsty, and even though the room is freezing, I’m hot. As I lay there trying to understand why I’m awake, only having gone to bed three hours prior, I start to hear something that sounds out of place. I turn to my roommate, thinking she is also awake, only to find her out cold. As the noise continues I try to place it ― it sounds like waves crashing against rocks. I feel disoriented, a feeling that happens often on tour; we move hotels and countries weekly. Waking up not knowing where I am, what day of the week it is or even the month has become customary for me.This feeling and this noise are different, though. I know what month it is; it’s March, March 6 in fact ― four days after my 33rd birthday. I also know where I am; I am in a hotel in PyeongChang South Korea, the location of the next winter Olympics and nowhere near an ocean.As I continue to try and make sense of what is going on, I reach for my water, and a pain unlike anything I have ever felt before rolls through my body and takes my breath away. I try to breathe. I get hit again. I curl into a ball and let out a muffled groan into my pillow. As I roll around my bed writhing in pain, I begin to take a mental note of what I had eaten that day, trying to figure out what in the world could have implanted an alien into my body that was now trying to make its way out.I spent the rest of the night split between my bed and the floor. The pain must have subsided or caused me to lose consciousness because I woke up the next morning covered in sweat and once again, disoriented. We had the day off, so I lingered in bed. I was afraid to wake whatever it was that had taken up residence in my body. By the time I worked up the nerve to get up, breakfast was almost over. The lack of hunger should have been an indication that something was wrong, but I was so relieved to have a break from last night’s horror show I didn’t think anything of it.The rest of the day was fairly uneventful, I still didn’t have much of an appetite but forced myself to eat dinner anyway. As I got ready for bed, I could hear my stomach starting to gurgle again. The next morning I met with one of our medical providers to devise a plan. We tried to visit the medical clinic across from the hotel before training to see if we could get a handle on what was going on, but it was closed. I took a handful of Pepto-Bismol and hoped for the best. After the first run, I could tell I definitely wasn’t well. The pilots were taking three runs down the track that day, that but luckily I was only slated for two. After the second run, I could barely get out of the sled. My whole body ached, and the alien was back.I was taken to the medical tent at the track to see the doctor on call. She explained that she was a neurologist, asked about my symptoms and suggested that I be transported to the emergency room via ambulance. After arguing back and forth about the overkill of an ambulance, we finally agreed on an IV for rehydration. For most people an IV isn’t a big deal, but for me and the rest of my teammates and fellow competitors, IVs are not allowed unless it’s an emergency, and even then special paperwork has to be filed with USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency). IVs can be used as a masking agent for prohibited substances. After being stuck in the arm twice unsuccessfully by a nurse (well, at least her track badge said she was a nurse), the idea of going to the hospital began to sound like a good plan. We took the 30-mile drive to the GangNeung Asan Hospital.I travel quite a bit for both bobsled and leisure. I am used to being places where I don’t speak the language. What I am not use to is being in a part of a country where few people speak my language. Call it ignorance, arrogance or what have you, but most places I have visited, I was lucky enough to be able to get by with English.Not here. As we walked into the hospital, we were greeted with stares. The track doctor recommended that we go to the emergency room because we would be seen faster than if we went to a clinic, and she had called ahead to let them know we were coming.After a series of hand gestures and attempting to ask multiple people where to go, we found the emergency room. The nurse’s ability to take my blood and start the IV in one attempt immediately put me at ease. They ran me through a number of tests to come to the diagnosis of gastroenteritis, which is basically a fancy word for a stomach bug. After a few hours, I was hydrated and on my way with some antibiotics and the hope that this ordeal would soon be behind me.As I mentioned earlier, I never get sick. I have no experience in losing my appetite, in unintentional weight loss, in not being able to get out of bed; in fact, I have always joked, “If I am ever too sick to eat, take me to the hospital.” Ask and you shall receive, I guess. After losing six pounds in three days, I can check getting sick in a foreign country off of my bucket list."

The whole world, especially NATO, held their breath for fear of an outbreak of a war that would drag in great powers.The jet saga did not unleash a war despite overwhelming concern over unpredictable nature of rulers of the two countries, both are strong men with authoritarian tendencies. A few months ago, Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov was killed in a shocking assassination in Ankara. That fueled fears of breakdown in Turkish-Russian relations. What otherwise would lead to a war elsewhere, however, did not confirm the worst of the fears, but, surprisingly, sparked flourishing in bilateral relations.Started as a hard-boiled, thrilling drama soon morphed into a soap opera defined by mutually declared new love affair, geopolitical realignment, and cordial relations. That metamorphosis of the Turkish-Russian story has become source of bewilderment for many, but realities of realpolitik in a conflict-ridden region seemed to contain ramifications of the two incidents as common sense, self-imposed restraints and realism reined in.In a visit to cement building a strong partnership, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin met in Moscow on Friday to discuss cooperation in Syria and to boost bilateral economic relations.President Putin hailed cooperation between militaries of two countries and quick restoration of relations which almost broke down two years ago after Turkey’s shoot-down of a Russian warplane at the Turkish-Syrian border. After two years of hiatus, High-Level Cooperation Council meeting took place between cabinet ministers of Turkey and Russia, in a testimony to construction of cordial ties.“We are very happy our inter-state relations are restoring rather quickly, ” Putin said.“Many events have happened, and lately we have been working actively to bring the Russia-Turkey relations to the level of worth our countries,” Russian state-run TASS agency quoted Putin as saying. Mr. Erdogan’s visit came two days after top military brass of Turkey, Russia and the U.S. convened at a meeting in a southern Turkish city to craft a joint working mechanism to de-conflict their operations in crowded Syrian battleground, and to defuse lingering tension between Turkey-backed forces and the Syrian Kurdish militia.Russia and Turkey have proved to be pragmatic players despite conflicting policies and strategies, backing opposite sides in Syria’s rapidly shifting geopolitical theater. They once came closer to brink of a military confrontation after the jet incident. But a set of timely calculated diplomatic moves helped them manage to thaw strained relations.Mr. Erdogan’s apology to Putin last June for jet downing, and the Russian president’s unwavering support to his Turkish counterpart during a coup attempt from which Mr. Erdogan barely survived helped reach a rapprochement.“They have totally different agendas, and yet despite this, their relations have improved remarkably in the past months alone,” James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at London’s Chatham House, told CNN International.Even Russia’s killing of three Turkish soldiers in an accidental air strike did not throw relations into turmoil, or reverse the progress recently made.Turkey backs rebels fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Russia has deployed its fighter jets and other cutting-edge military hardware in Syria to shore up its ally in Damascus. Moscow also cultivates close ties with Syrian Kurds whose aspiration to form a small statelet, a separate polity in northern Syria is the cause of gravest concern for Ankara as Turkish forces plunged into Syria to blunt Kurds’ bid.During Mr. Erdogan’s visit, both leaders contemplated on joint efforts to resolve the Syrian conflict as Ankara and Moscow sponsor talks between the Syrian government and the armed opposition.Though, they have divergent positions sometimes clash with each other’s policies, Turkey and Russia have emerged as two powerful actors with diplomatic clout to shape the course events in Syria’s multisided six-year war. In December, the Turkish-Russian coordination has produced a ceasefire, which according to many observers, appears to be the most effective to this day. The truce between rebels and the Syrian government troops largely takes hold despite some local violations.Mr. Putin exulted at Turkish-Russian efforts bearing fruit. He said “Russia and Turkey have made a major contribution not only to securing a cease-fire between Syrian government forces and the armed opposition, but also to launching direct, concrete talks” between them.Whatever differences between two countries’ Syria policies are, preserving Syria’s territorial integrity is a common goal shared both by Ankara and Moscow.Mr. Putin underscored that Syria’s territorial integrity is a “necessary condition for the full-scale peace settlement in this country.” Mr. Erdogan voiced a similar view, describing maintaining Syria’s current borders as Turkey’s major diplomatic objective.The Russian president also hailed progress in trade and economic relations, which were hit hard by Russia’s punishing sanctions after the jet incident. Defense industry and energy field are main elements of cooperation, the Turkish president added.Turkey and Russia ramped up efforts to accelerate building Turkish Stream gas pipeline project and construction of Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant. “As far as implementation of the Turkish Stream and Akkuyu NPP projects are concerned, cooperation returns to its previous path and is increasing developing,” TASS quoted Mr. Erdogan as saying.One of the crown jewel of the meeting was the decision to establish a joint investment fund to further economic ties. Mr. Putin also pledged to reverse sanctions for Turkish companies and their employees in Russia.Removal of sanctions would foster a robust recovery in bilateral trade as Turkish companies are desperately coveting to revive their stalled business operations in Russia.Turkey's cozying up to Russia comes with deterioration in relations with its Western allies, most notably the U.S. and EU.Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Putin mold similar view of international relations. Their disdain for liberal umbrage voiced by the West, their shared enmity and animus toward international criticism over handling of domestic opponents, their crushing of media freedom and critical voices mold them into a similar line of thinking, common governing practices defined as authoritarianism.The Turkish president's post-coup crackdown on political rivals and opposition earned him an upswell of criticism in the West, but acclaim from the leader in Moscow. Whenever Mr. Erdogan had expressed his desire for a shift to presidential system in Turkey, it was Mr. Putin whom he portrayed as a role model, an ideal embodiment of a functioning presidency.While his presentation of Mr. Putin as a model president was met with trepidation in the EU, it was cheered with elation in Russia where Kremlin is delighted to see that its divide-and-rule policies against Western alliance pay dividends. For Russia, partnering with Turkey is blowback to NATO and the U.S. as Ankara grows skeptical of its Western allies in aftermath of the abortive coup.Both countries want to show to the West that they are not without options. Russia's relations with the West plunged into an ensuing dispute. A state of geopolitical competition and tension emerged after Russian annexation of Crimea, its covert operations and backing of rebels in eastern Ukraine, and its involvement in the Syrian civil war. Its regional muscle-flexing stirred a new NATO buildup in eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression and to ensure frightened small allies, while expectations for reset in the American-Russian relations under President Donald Trump's administration run low.But no partnership is without its perils and hazards, and ""Turkish-Russian honeymoon"" is no exception. There are remaining points of contention between Turkey and Russia which have to tread carefully on a number of issues ranging from NATO's robust posture in the Black Sea, lingering flash-points in Caucasus that concern both countries, the pitfalls of cooperation and coordination in Syria's shaky battleground.
