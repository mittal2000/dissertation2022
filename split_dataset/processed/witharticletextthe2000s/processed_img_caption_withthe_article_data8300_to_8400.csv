2,WOMEN,Alabama Minors Seeking Abortions No Longer Have To Face Their Fetuses' Lawyers In Court,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-abortion-law-minors_us_597f6b83e4b02a4ebb7750da,"Yes, that was a thing.",2017-08-01,"<span class=""big""><strong>MYTH:</strong></span> Abortion is dangerous.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d355f41700006e00567c56.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Alabama minors will no longer have to endure a trial-like proceeding in court if their parents or legal guardians don’t provide consent for an abortion.On Friday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan Russ Walker struck down portions of a law that forced some minors seeking abortions to undergo cross-examination by the district attorney, the minor’s parents or guardians, and a court-appointed lawyer representing the minor’s fetus.In 1987, Alabama lawmakers enacted a law that required minors to first receive approval from a judge before having an abortion if the minor’s parent or legal guardian refused or was unable to provide consent.The process, known as “judicial bypass,” was amended in 2014 to enable a judge to appoint legal representation to the minor’s fetus and hold a trial-like proceeding to assess the minor’s “maturity” before deciding whether the state’s parental consent requirement for an abortion could be waived.But on Friday, Walker issued a 54-page opinion that ruled the 2014 amendment unconstitutional and found that it violated the minor’s “constitutionally guaranteed option of an anonymous and expeditious [judicial] bypass.”“The Act clearly imposes an undue burden on the rights of the minor participants to whom it applied,” Walker wrote.The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit in 2014 on behalf of Reproductive Health Services, a Montgomery abortion clinic, according to The Associated Press.Andrew Beck, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, called Friday’s ruling “a victory for women, for young people, and for reproductive health in Alabama.”“When a young woman decides to end her pregnancy, she should be able to do so with compassion and respect, without cruel barriers that shame her and put her in harm’s way,” Beck said in a statement on Friday.Nearly half of all U.S. states require minors seeking abortions to get their parent or legal guardian’s permission or approval from a judge. But the ACLU contends that the Alabama law added additional restrictions unlike any other law in the country.The 2014 amendment not only allowed involved parties to disclose the minor’s pregnancy to others, such as her teachers and employers, but it also potentially dragged out the approval process for so long that the minor would no longer be able to get an abortion, which is not permitted in Alabama after 20 weeks unless the woman’s life is in danger.Friday’s ruling follows several months of court proceedings involving a 12-year-old Alabama girl who sought approval for an abortion after being raped by an adult relative. The girl cited her estranged relationship with her mother as a reason she did not want her involved in the decision.On June 27, a family court judge approved an abortion for the girl, who had just completed fifth grade, according to Alabama.com. The district attorney immediately appealed the decision, arguing that the girl was too immature to make an informed decision.But on July 12, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals ruled in favor of the girl, who had reached her second trimester of pregnancy by that point. The district attorney missed the deadline to appeal that ruling, making the decision final and allowing the girl to have an abortion, according to the ACLU.“If Judge Walker’s ruling had happened before that poor girl’s scenario took place, she would never have to go through any of that,” Beck told HuffPost. “[The 2014 amendment] is just a cruel opportunity to inflict further damage and harm on teens who don’t need a trial ― they need a doctor.”A spokeswoman for the state attorney general’s office told the AP that the office is reviewing Walker’s ruling.Read Judge Walker’s full opinion below."

The foundation of international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney and her movie star husband, George Clooney, says it will help nearly 3,000 refugee children who are currently not enrolled in school, and provide them with necessary transportation and school supplies.Lebanon, the birthplace of Amal Clooney, has the world’s highest population of refugees per capita. There are more than 1 million Syrian refugees registered living in Lebanon, and about 200,000 of the refugee population are children who are not enrolled in school.“Without education, this lost generation becomes not only a missed opportunity for the advancement of Lebanon but also a huge security threat in the region and beyond,” states the Clooney Foundation for Justice on its website, in reference to the goals of the project, titled “Empowering a Generation.”By partnering with UNICEF and obtaining funding from companies including HP Inc. and Google, the Clooneys’ foundation will work with seven existing public schools in Lebanon. Its program will enable the schools to provide formal education in the afternoons to Syrian refugee children who are currently not getting an education.“They have been victims of geography and circumstance, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t hope,” George and Amal Clooney said in a statement to The Associated Press this week. “Our goal with this initiative is to help provide Syrian refugee children with an education and put them on a path to be the future leaders their generation desperately needs.”UNICEF announced Monday that the foundation secured a $2.25 million partnership, which included a notable donation from Google, as well as a $1 million technology grant from HP.The Clooneys met with Syrian refugees in the German capital of Berlin in March 2016, marking five years of the war in Syria. “We always look around at the end of these tragedies and say if we knew, we would have done something,” George Clooney said in a video released at the time. “And the reality is, of course we know.”"
4,WORLD NEWS,The World Bank Accidentally Left Me A Voicemail Discussing Their Strategy To Downplay Rights Abuses,"Jessica Evans, ContributorSenior advocate/researcher on international financial institut...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-peek-behind-the-world-banks-mask_us_59808291e4b0cb4fc1c73c30,On June 27 we released a joint report documenting forced and child labor linked to the World Bank’s agriculture projects,2017-08-01,"<p>13-year-old boy picking cotton in a World Bank project area, Ellikkala, Karakalpakstan, under orders from his school during the 2016 harvest. In Ellikkala, officials from at least two schools ordered 13 and 14-year-old children to pick cotton after school. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5980af7e1a00001800dc1862.jpg?ops=crop_0_107_540_534%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On June 27 we released a joint report documenting forced and child labor linked to the World Bank’s agriculture projects in Uzbekistan. We hoped it would cause bank officials to rethink their approach. But then the bank’s country team inadvertently left an internal conversation on our voicemail. Oops! It revealed their ultimate goal: to protect the bank from external pressure and get new agriculture projects through their executive board “unscathed,” as one of the voices on the phone said. He went on: “We want to avoid any more stuff that goes out that says ’oh and look [a board member is] really taking this seriously, now they’re going to call for a full board hearing.”The country team’s strategy seems to have paid off. On June 30 the bank’s executive board approved yet another loan benefiting Uzbekistan’s cotton sector, which is at the center of the government’s forced labor system. The Australian constituency opposed the $145 million irrigation project, and the United States, United Kingdom, and Nordic/Baltic constituency abstained. But the remainder of the board, including self-styled labor rights champions Canada, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, supported it.The “strategic story line” to which the country team agreed on the call was to highlight to the board the bank’s role in reducing child labor in cotton, which according to them wouldn’t have happened “without the World Bank being involved,” and dismiss our research as “old news.”But our research found that the Uzbek government is still forcing kids as young as 10 to work in four regions, including in a World Bank project area and one of the regions of the new project. And the bank can hardly take credit for the reduction in child labor since the greatest progress was made in the fall of 2012 and 2013, when the bank was still ignoring the problem.In addition to cynically plotting to dismiss our research rather than respond to it, staff planned to point the board to “a lot of progress” since we undertook the research in 2015 and 2016. But the report, which we wrote with our partner organization the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights, details abuses until the close of last year’s harvest season. The Forum has continued to document forced and child labor this spring, and the next harvest does not begin until September. Any progress that the bank can point to since the end of last harvest can only be rhetorical in nature, when the real measure should be what is happening on the ground.The bank’s new irrigation project is akin to an ongoing project in the west of the country, where we found that the government forced adults and children to harvest cotton in 2015 and 2016, as well as to weed the fields and plant cotton in the spring of 2016. These abuses took place on the bank’s project area, contrary to the government’s loan agreement with the bank. The country team noted on the call that this existing irrigation project hasn’t even gotten off the ground due to “very serious procurement issues.” But even the combination of human rights abuses and operational failures were not enough to convince the bank to hold off on a new, similar project.Just prior to the message ending, I hear a voice I recognized say, “Why does this keep ringing, or trying to dial? Oh Jessica Evans on speed dial, that’s a frightening prospect.” I hate to be the staff’s nightmare, and I suppose one can understand the project staff feeling an urge to downplay rights abuses when the institution’s incentives reward getting money out the door above all else. But the World Bank president, Jim Kim, should turn this around. Instead of sending good money after bad, the bank should immediately suspend its agriculture investments in Uzbekistan, while supporting reforms to halt the Uzbek government’s use of forced labor to harvest its cotton.Previously on HuffPost: How The World Bank Broke Its Promise To Protect The Poor"

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) recently signed a pledge to ""stand up for Medicare for all"" whenever publicly discussing health care reform.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5980ee971a00009bc1dc1943.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democratic leaders in Congress are offering to cooperate with Republicans on solutions to stabilize the Obamacare exchanges, but progressive groups and their congressional allies are heading in the opposite direction.Following the defeat of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, left-leaning organizations are accelerating their long-standing goal of establishing a single-payer system in which the government provides health insurance for all.Although proponents of what they call “Medicare for all” acknowledge that such a radical overhaul of the health care system is impossible as long as Republicans control the White House and Congress, they want it to become a litmus test for 2020 presidential candidates ― and a winning issue for as many 2018 congressional candidates as possible.That way, the thinking goes, when Democrats return to power, they will recognize that single payer, or a number of interim steps favored by advocates, is the only politically viable health care policy.“The Democratic position has to be guaranteed health care with single-payer financing,” said Michael Lighty, director of public policy for National Nurses United, a 150,000-member labor union that has been at the forefront of single-payer advocacy. “The activists who volunteer for campaigns and put their heart and soul into the party, aren’t going to be satisfied with anything less than Medicare for all.”“All Democrats who have any aspiration to run for national office must support Medicare for all,” said Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo Mobile, a phone company that channels its revenue into progressive online organizing. “That automatically puts certain people ― Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, for example ― on the spot: Are they going to support Medicare for all or not?” On Friday, Credo launched an email campaign asking activists to sign a petition telling “all Democrats running for national office: Support Medicare for All.” The group plans to gradually send the appeal to its entire email list of more than 5.7 million people.The goal, Zaheed said, is to make opposition to single payer as politically radioactive for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates as support for the Iraq War was in the 2008 primary. In Democrats’ 2008 nominating contest, then-Sen. Barack Obama’s opposition to the war from its outset helped him defeat then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, who had voted to authorize the invasion in 2002.At the same time, Zaheed said, they welcome more modest proposals that lay the foundation for full, publicly provided coverage, including the creation of a public health insurance option, lowering the Medicare eligibility age and expanding Medicaid. “We’re not going to pooh-pooh them and say ‘No, no, we want Medicare for all.’ We will say it is a great starting point,” he said.Credo’s initiative joins the growing chorus of progressive voices pushing to make single payer an official Democratic stance.Single payer has more support among congressional Democrats than ever ― on paper, at least. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose 2016 presidential campaign shined a national spotlight on single payer, plans to introduce single-payer legislation, though he has yet to announce a date for the bill’s rollout.A single-payer bill Sanders introduced in 2013 did not attract any co-sponsors. But he is poised to pick up more backers this time around: Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) are all on the record in support of “Medicare for all.”In the House, Rep. John Conyers’ legislation creating a national health insurance program, which he has introduced multiple times in the past, now enjoys the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.Long before it became clear that Obamacare repeal was headed for defeat, liberal activists set out to press their advantage. Last Tuesday, Our Revolution, National Nurses United, Democracy for America and other like-minded groups announced a campaign to get House Democrats to endorse a slate of progressive bills, including Conyers’ single-payer bill, that they are calling the People’s Platform.The movement for single payer is backed by a firm belief that the for-profit health insurance model has failed. Virtually all of the world’s other developed nations guarantee health care to their citizens through direct government insurance or something similar, these critics note. Unlike the United States, these countries enjoy universal coverage ― and they provide it at a much lower cost per person than the private-insurance-heavy U.S. system.What’s more, advocates observe, Medicare, which is effectively a single payer program for seniors and people with disabilities, already does a better job controlling costs than its private insurance counterparts.Now that Republican efforts to repeal key provisions of Obamacare appear to be dead, progressive activists see an opening to shape health care reform that they believe they were denied when Obamacare was crafted in 2009. “There’s more optimism on the health care issue, ironically, than there has been since 2008 ― both because of the failure of repeal and the excitement for Medicare for all,” Lighty said.From the beginning, these progressives have blamed Obamacare’s shortcomings on its reliance on private insurance companies. They are eager to point out that the most troubled part of Obamacare ― coverage on the exchanges ― relies on private insurance, while the law’s expansion of Medicaid, a government insurance program for low-income Americans, has proved far more successful. In fact, thanks in part to the staunch opposition of Republican governors, rolling back Medicaid expansion proved so politically toxic that it was not even included in the so-called skinny Obamacare repeal bill that collapsed on the Senate floor Friday morning. “Policymakers have tried to expand almost every aspect of the current system in order to increase access,” Lighty said. “The one thing they haven’t done is expand Medicare. We’ve already tried everything that doesn’t work. Let’s try the one thing that’s working.”The trouble for activists like Lighty is that many Democrats, eager to curry favor with grassroots activists, have given verbal support for single-payer insurance only to shy away from it when given the chance to actually act on their beliefs.In California, where Democrats control the governorship and enjoy supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature, National Nurses United led an effort to advance state-level single-payer legislation. The bill passed the state Senate, but in June, Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon refused to allow it to come up for a vote in the lower house. The result infuriated activists because similar legislation had passed both legislative chambers in the past, albeit at a time when a Republican governor ensured that it stood no chance of becoming law.The experience shows the limits of asking Democrats to simply check a box, according to Lighty. After lambasting Rendon for his decision, NNU has turned to raising awareness of the issue in Assembly districts where incumbent Democrats are more vulnerable. If Democrats in those districts can be convinced to get behind the initiative, the thinking goes, Rendon won’t feel compelled to spare those members a tough vote.Others groups are testing their own methods of pushing lawmakers beyond paper-thin commitments to single-payer health care. Justice Democrats, a political action committee that is backing progressive primary challengers to 11 congressional Democrats, rolled out a campaign Friday asking Democratic congressional incumbents and candidates to sign the “Stand up for Medicare” pledge. The pledge asks signers to “stand up for Medicare for all in any public appearances and statements addressing our country’s healthcare crisis,” rather than merely affix their name to a piece of legislation. Thus far, Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) are the only incumbents who have signed the pledge. (Both spoke in support of the initiative after signing it at a news conference near Capitol Hill on Friday.)Democratic leaders in Congress have taken a decidedly different approach after the collapse of Obamacare repeal.In a Friday letter to Republican congressional leaders, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) invited their collaboration on allotting funding to help stabilize Obamacare’s individual insurance exchanges.For lawmakers concerned about spiraling costs and dwindling coverage options in the exchanges, it’s a natural place to start. As Pelosi noted, Republicans already set aside funds for the purpose in one of their failed repeal-and-replace bills.A new bipartisan group of about 40 moderate House Democrats and Republicans wants to take it a step further, coupling funding to entice insurers to stay on the exchanges with looser regulation of existing plans.But Democratic leaders have declined to make single payer part of “A Better Deal,” the economic agenda they released last week.Khanna revealed Friday that the Congressional Progressive Caucus had tried to get Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to add single payer to the party’s new agenda during a recent meeting.“There’s a simplicity in standing for Medicare for all, for free public college that I think will break through the noise,” Khanna said.Of course, Democrats have reasons to be squeamish. Republicans are already salivating at the prospect of Democrats getting behind single payer, casting it as a massive tax increase. During a series of Obamacare repeal votes Thursday, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) tried to sucker Democrats with a last-minute amendment that would have expanded Medicare to the entire population. The trick, which fell through when Sanders refused to play along, would have forced vulnerable Senate Democrats to choose between spurning their base and signing onto an ambitious progressive plan that would require tax hikes. The Republican line of attack should not scare Democrats, according to Lighty.Indeed, 60 percent of Americans favor “an expansion of Medicare that would make it available to any American who wanted it,” according to a June Quinnipiac University poll.“I don’t really understand why [Republicans] think that making the most popular government program available to everyone is a political loser,” he said. “When people actually see tax dollars going for things that benefit them and that meet their needs directly, they tend to support those taxes.”"
8,POLITICS,"As Democratic Leaders Seek Bipartisan Obamacare Fix, Progressives Elevate Single Payer",Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-progressives-double-push-single-payer_us_5980ebdfe4b0353fbb33406b,Left-leaning groups want the issue to be a litmus test for Democrats.,2017-08-01,Progressive activists demonstrate for single-payer health insurance in Manhattan's Union Square on July 2.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5980edd115000021008b49c5.jpeg?cache=DdUwYwboQG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democratic leaders in Congress are offering to cooperate with Republicans on solutions to stabilize the Obamacare exchanges, but progressive groups and their congressional allies are heading in the opposite direction.Following the defeat of Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, left-leaning organizations are accelerating their long-standing goal of establishing a single-payer system in which the government provides health insurance for all.Although proponents of what they call “Medicare for all” acknowledge that such a radical overhaul of the health care system is impossible as long as Republicans control the White House and Congress, they want it to become a litmus test for 2020 presidential candidates ― and a winning issue for as many 2018 congressional candidates as possible.That way, the thinking goes, when Democrats return to power, they will recognize that single payer, or a number of interim steps favored by advocates, is the only politically viable health care policy.“The Democratic position has to be guaranteed health care with single-payer financing,” said Michael Lighty, director of public policy for National Nurses United, a 150,000-member labor union that has been at the forefront of single-payer advocacy. “The activists who volunteer for campaigns and put their heart and soul into the party, aren’t going to be satisfied with anything less than Medicare for all.”“All Democrats who have any aspiration to run for national office must support Medicare for all,” said Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo Mobile, a phone company that channels its revenue into progressive online organizing. “That automatically puts certain people ― Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, for example ― on the spot: Are they going to support Medicare for all or not?” On Friday, Credo launched an email campaign asking activists to sign a petition telling “all Democrats running for national office: Support Medicare for All.” The group plans to gradually send the appeal to its entire email list of more than 5.7 million people.The goal, Zaheed said, is to make opposition to single payer as politically radioactive for 2020 Democratic presidential candidates as support for the Iraq War was in the 2008 primary. In Democrats’ 2008 nominating contest, then-Sen. Barack Obama’s opposition to the war from its outset helped him defeat then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, who had voted to authorize the invasion in 2002.At the same time, Zaheed said, they welcome more modest proposals that lay the foundation for full, publicly provided coverage, including the creation of a public health insurance option, lowering the Medicare eligibility age and expanding Medicaid. “We’re not going to pooh-pooh them and say ‘No, no, we want Medicare for all.’ We will say it is a great starting point,” he said.Credo’s initiative joins the growing chorus of progressive voices pushing to make single payer an official Democratic stance.Single payer has more support among congressional Democrats than ever ― on paper, at least. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose 2016 presidential campaign shined a national spotlight on single payer, plans to introduce single-payer legislation, though he has yet to announce a date for the bill’s rollout.A single-payer bill Sanders introduced in 2013 did not attract any co-sponsors. But he is poised to pick up more backers this time around: Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) are all on the record in support of “Medicare for all.”In the House, Rep. John Conyers’ legislation creating a national health insurance program, which he has introduced multiple times in the past, now enjoys the support of a majority of the House Democratic Caucus.Long before it became clear that Obamacare repeal was headed for defeat, liberal activists set out to press their advantage. Last Tuesday, Our Revolution, National Nurses United, Democracy for America and other like-minded groups announced a campaign to get House Democrats to endorse a slate of progressive bills, including Conyers’ single-payer bill, that they are calling the People’s Platform.The movement for single payer is backed by a firm belief that the for-profit health insurance model has failed. Virtually all of the world’s other developed nations guarantee health care to their citizens through direct government insurance or something similar, these critics note. Unlike the United States, these countries enjoy universal coverage ― and they provide it at a much lower cost per person than the private-insurance-heavy U.S. system.What’s more, advocates observe, Medicare, which is effectively a single payer program for seniors and people with disabilities, already does a better job controlling costs than its private insurance counterparts.Now that Republican efforts to repeal key provisions of Obamacare appear to be dead, progressive activists see an opening to shape health care reform that they believe they were denied when Obamacare was crafted in 2009. “There’s more optimism on the health care issue, ironically, than there has been since 2008 ― both because of the failure of repeal and the excitement for Medicare for all,” Lighty said.From the beginning, these progressives have blamed Obamacare’s shortcomings on its reliance on private insurance companies. They are eager to point out that the most troubled part of Obamacare ― coverage on the exchanges ― relies on private insurance, while the law’s expansion of Medicaid, a government insurance program for low-income Americans, has proved far more successful. In fact, thanks in part to the staunch opposition of Republican governors, rolling back Medicaid expansion proved so politically toxic that it was not even included in the so-called skinny Obamacare repeal bill that collapsed on the Senate floor Friday morning. “Policymakers have tried to expand almost every aspect of the current system in order to increase access,” Lighty said. “The one thing they haven’t done is expand Medicare. We’ve already tried everything that doesn’t work. Let’s try the one thing that’s working.”The trouble for activists like Lighty is that many Democrats, eager to curry favor with grassroots activists, have given verbal support for single-payer insurance only to shy away from it when given the chance to actually act on their beliefs.In California, where Democrats control the governorship and enjoy supermajorities in both chambers of the state legislature, National Nurses United led an effort to advance state-level single-payer legislation. The bill passed the state Senate, but in June, Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon refused to allow it to come up for a vote in the lower house. The result infuriated activists because similar legislation had passed both legislative chambers in the past, albeit at a time when a Republican governor ensured that it stood no chance of becoming law.The experience shows the limits of asking Democrats to simply check a box, according to Lighty. After lambasting Rendon for his decision, NNU has turned to raising awareness of the issue in Assembly districts where incumbent Democrats are more vulnerable. If Democrats in those districts can be convinced to get behind the initiative, the thinking goes, Rendon won’t feel compelled to spare those members a tough vote.Others groups are testing their own methods of pushing lawmakers beyond paper-thin commitments to single-payer health care. Justice Democrats, a political action committee that is backing progressive primary challengers to 11 congressional Democrats, rolled out a campaign Friday asking Democratic congressional incumbents and candidates to sign the “Stand up for Medicare” pledge. The pledge asks signers to “stand up for Medicare for all in any public appearances and statements addressing our country’s healthcare crisis,” rather than merely affix their name to a piece of legislation. Thus far, Reps. John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) are the only incumbents who have signed the pledge. (Both spoke in support of the initiative after signing it at a news conference near Capitol Hill on Friday.)Democratic leaders in Congress have taken a decidedly different approach after the collapse of Obamacare repeal.In a Friday letter to Republican congressional leaders, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) invited their collaboration on allotting funding to help stabilize Obamacare’s individual insurance exchanges.For lawmakers concerned about spiraling costs and dwindling coverage options in the exchanges, it’s a natural place to start. As Pelosi noted, Republicans already set aside funds for the purpose in one of their failed repeal-and-replace bills.A new bipartisan group of about 40 moderate House Democrats and Republicans wants to take it a step further, coupling funding to entice insurers to stay on the exchanges with looser regulation of existing plans.But Democratic leaders have declined to make single payer part of “A Better Deal,” the economic agenda they released last week.Khanna revealed Friday that the Congressional Progressive Caucus had tried to get Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to add single payer to the party’s new agenda during a recent meeting.“There’s a simplicity in standing for Medicare for all, for free public college that I think will break through the noise,” Khanna said.Of course, Democrats have reasons to be squeamish. Republicans are already salivating at the prospect of Democrats getting behind single payer, casting it as a massive tax increase. During a series of Obamacare repeal votes Thursday, Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) tried to sucker Democrats with a last-minute amendment that would have expanded Medicare to the entire population. The trick, which fell through when Sanders refused to play along, would have forced vulnerable Senate Democrats to choose between spurning their base and signing onto an ambitious progressive plan that would require tax hikes. The Republican line of attack should not scare Democrats, according to Lighty.Indeed, 60 percent of Americans favor “an expansion of Medicare that would make it available to any American who wanted it,” according to a June Quinnipiac University poll.“I don’t really understand why [Republicans] think that making the most popular government program available to everyone is a political loser,” he said. “When people actually see tax dollars going for things that benefit them and that meet their needs directly, they tend to support those taxes.”"

Lyman did not attend the previous two conferences, in Kyoto in 2009 and Paris in 2013, and was looking forward to rubbing shoulders with hundreds of scientists from around the world, including more than two dozen from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories.Shortly after he arrived, however, Lyman learned that the 27 DOE lab scientists listed in the conference program were no-shows. One session featuring a panel of four DOE lab scientists talking about code development was cancelled outright, Lyman said, while a handful of other panel discussions, originally comprised of five to six speakers, soldiered on without U.S. participation. “On the first day, the DOE attaché at the U.S. embassy in Moscow gave a 20-minute talk about the U.S. fast reactor program and refused to take questions,” he said. “That was it for the Energy Department.” Three DOE scientists did attend the conference, according to the DOE, but none of them were part of the official program.Sandra Bogetic, a University of California, Berkeley, doctoral student who presented a research poster at the conference, also couldn’t help but notice that the DOE scientists were missing. Bogetic’s poster session was slated to include presentations by 122 scientists from 17 countries, including a dozen scientists from DOE labs. The DOE scientists were nowhere to be found, and another five DOE scientists missed a second poster session the following day.“Everyone was in shock that they didn’t show up,” Bogetic said. “It’s the most important conference for fast reactors, and it was a lost opportunity for U.S. scientists to share their work at a conference that takes place only every four years.”Mum’s the WordScientists planning to speak or present posters at the IAEA conference were asked to hand in their papers to conference organizers last December, five months before the event. The deadline was then extended into January, and at that point, the 27 DOE lab scientists were all on board to participate.In early April, however, the DOE scientists received an email from Sal Golub, associate deputy assistant secretary for nuclear technology research and development at the DOE, indirectly telling them that the agency was not going to let them go.“Yesterday,” Golub wrote, “we informally notified the IAEA conference organizers of the following: Representatives from the Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy and DOE/NE contractors at the National Labs are currently unable to travel to Russia, which means they will not be able to attend the IAEA’s Fast Reactor conference in June.” He also assured the scientists that the DOE was “working with the organizers to adjust the program to reflect our absence,” which obviously didn’t happen.Golub gave no reason why DOE scientists were “unable” to travel to Russia, and, when I asked him for an explanation, he referred me to the DOE public relations office. Spokespeople at department headquarters in Washington, D.C., and the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois — where 15 of the 27 missing DOE scientists are based — were equally unhelpful.A DOE spokesperson in Washington, who declined to be identified, responded in an email: “We greatly value cooperation with the IAEA and plan to continue to do so whenever we can. The Department of Energy and the [U.S.] Embassy were represented at the event.”Christopher Kramer, Argonne’s media relations manager, also avoided answering my question. “I can tell you that Argonne greatly values its relationship with the IAEA and plans to continue cooperation whenever we can,” he said in an email. “... From what I understand, Argonne did have two people in attendance at the conference in question.”I emailed both PR officers back and again asked why the scientists weren’t at the conference. No response.Finally, I called a random sample of the grounded scientists. It was another dead end.“I wasn’t able to attend,” one said tersely. “I won’t talk about it.” Click. “We were told not to deal with outside media or organizations,” said another. Click. Two others were slightly more talkative, but neither could clear up the mystery. “I know very little about the decision” to cancel the trip, said one of the scheduled panelists. “It was above my pay grade. I basically followed orders from management.” The other scientist, a would-be poster session participant, was clearly perturbed. “The only reason I know is the [DOE] Office of Nuclear Energy wouldn’t let people go,” he said. “They didn’t give us a reason. I don’t know what their rationale is. Other U.S. government agencies are sending their people to Russia.”Trump’s War on Science or a New Cold War?So what’s the story behind the case of the missing DOE scientists?It could come down to money. It’s certainly no secret that the Trump administration wants to slash DOE science spending. Just last month, for instance, the department closed its Office of International Climate and Technology, eliminating 11 staff positions. The office, which was established in 2010, provided technical advice to other countries on ways to reduce carbon emissions. The administration’s proposed federal budget, meanwhile, would cut the annual budget of the DOE Office of Science — the nation’s largest funder of the physical sciences — by 17 percent to $4.47 billion, its lowest level since 2008, not adjusting for inflation. Outlays for nuclear energy research would drop 28 percent. Even more drastic, the budget for the department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy would plunge nearly 70 percent.DOE spokespeople, however, didn’t cite financial constraints as a reason, and the cost of sending the scientists to Russia was presumably built into the fiscal year 2017 budget, which predated the Trump administration. In any case, Bogetic, the Berkeley grad student, told me that one of the scientists who wasn’t allowed to attend the conference asked the DOE if he could pay his own way. The answer was no.It’s also tempting to chalk it up to the Trump administration’s war on science. Besides barring federal scientists from attending conferences, according to a new report by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), the administration also has been preventing scientists from speaking publicly, dismissing key scientific advisors, denying public access to taxpayer-funded information, and ignoring scientific evidence to justify rolling back public health, environmental and workplace safeguards. No doubt, the administration’s hostility toward federal scientists may have been a factor.The most likely explanation, however, is where the conference took place — Russia — and what it was about — nuclear energy.U.S.-Russian relations, notwithstanding President Trump’s bromance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, have been deteriorating for quite some time. The White House is under investigation for possibly colluding with Moscow to undermine Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, and Congress just passed tougher sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexing Crimea, and supporting eastern Ukraine separatists.Nuclear-related relations between the United States and Russia are also frayed. Last October, in response to U.S. sanctions, Putin suspended a U.S.-Russian agreement to dispose of excess weapons grade plutonium; an agreement to cooperate with the United States on nuclear energy-related research; and a pact between the DOE and Rosatom — the Russian state atomic energy corporation — to conduct feasibility studies on converting six Russian research reactors to safer, low-enriched uranium.Putin’s actions didn’t get much media attention, but they should have. Writing in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists last December, Siegfried Hecker, former director of the DOE’s Los Alamos National Laboratory, warned that “the Kremlin’s systematic termination of nuclear cooperation with the United States … sets the clock back, putting both countries at enormous risk and endangering global stability.”Rosatom was the co-host of the June IAEA conference, which was held in Yekaterinburg mainly because the world’s largest operating fast reactor is only 35 miles away, at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant. Conference participants were treated to a tour of the 880-megawatt BN-800 reactor, which began generating power last year, as well as its smaller predecessor, the BN-600, which has been running since 1980. There are only four other fast reactors currently in operation worldwide: one in China, two in India, and another one in Russia.The IAEA conference, however, was not Russo-centric. Scientists from more than two dozen countries, including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea and Sweden, participated. And despite Russia’s suspension of nuclear cooperation with the United States, U.S. scientists were welcome.“Scientists shouldn’t be limited by political problems,” said Bogetic. “We are scientists. We need to communicate.”Lyman, the UCS physicist who participated in a panel discussion at the conference, agrees. “With so many communication channels between the U.S. and Russia now cut off, it’s essential to preserve scientific cooperation in areas where there is common ground between the two countries,” he said. “Preventing DOE scientists from attending the IAEA conference — for whatever reason — was shortsighted and ultimately self-defeating.”Elliott Negin is a senior writer at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Not.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5980b4a5210000a134fc9a3a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Imagine a world where President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans don’t want to repeal the Affordable Care Act and strip health insurance from millions of people. They want to expand it. In this parallel universe, they pass laws to make sure every kid has health care coverage and every woman has access to full reproductive care, including abortion. That includes undocumented immigrants, too.Well, that’s not happening. But this planet exists: it’s called Oregon.The state’s lawmakers there just wrapped up their legislative session and passed health care laws that fly in the face of what is happening in the nation’s capital. While Congress was threatening people’s health care, Oregon passed a law that gives coverage to just about everyone, regardless of income level, citizenship status, gender identity or type of insurance. They passed another law ensuring that not a single child goes without coverage. This is in a state of 4 million people, of which roughly 420,000 get coverage through Medicaid.Once these laws are fully implemented, 95 percent of adults and 100 percent of kids in the state will be covered. “These conversations around the Affordable Care Act, I was committed to expanding access to health care and not going backwards,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) told HuffPost over hot chocolate in a recent interview. “What is happening federally makes me want to fight, fight, fight.”This was no easy task, even in a state led entirely by Democrats. They had to come up with a way to pay for expanded health coverage and opted for a new tax that, in Oregon, requires a supermajority vote in the legislature. That meant Brown had to find Republicans to join Democrats to support the effort. It took most of the session to get it done.The new laws mean 15,000 more children who previously didn’t have health coverage will now have it. Most of them are undocumented. Brown said she recently met with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who backed the House-passed Obamacare repeal bill that denied assistance to undocumented immigrants, and he asked who those 15,000 kids were. She told him.“Uh, he didn’t have any reaction,” Brown said.The governor also signed a bill codifying Roe v. Wade, the landmark federal ruling that protects a woman’s right to safe and legal abortion. The idea is that if the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn the ruling, the state would already have the statute on its books and it would take effect immediately.Beyond health care, Oregon lawmakers pushed through other progressive policies that completely counter what the president is trying to do.While Trump is looking at downsizing national monuments to open up federal land to oil and gas drilling, Brown signed a law protecting 93,000 acres of state forest from being logged. When Trump renounced the Paris Accord on combatting climate change, Oregon committed to it on its own.Brown also signed laws shielding transgender people from discrimination and beefing up policies to prevent racial profiling ― just as the president announced a ban on transgender people in the military and encouraged police officers to be “rough” on criminal suspects. (The White House later said he was “making a joke” on that last one.)Brown said she doesn’t see herself as an antidote to Trump, despite being a female and openly bisexual progressive governor in the only designated sanctuary state for undocumented immigrants, where recreational marijuana is legal and any kind of Muslim registry is explicitly banned.She demurred when asked if she expects Trump to keep his job for the full four years, amid his erratic behavior, the probe into his potential obstruction of justice and general disarray at the White House.“Who knows,” Brown said. “I didn’t think he’d make it four weeks.” Language in this story has been amended to clarify the legal standing of Roe v. Wade."

I’m concerned your response will encourage other mothers to buy into the incorrect assumption that it’s ‘impolite’ to ask questions that ensure their child’s safety.”Phillips agreed with the reader.“The woman’s question wasn’t about etiquette. It was about child safety,” Phillips wrote in her Monday column. “A large number of readers besides you agreed my perspective was off. I have heard all of you loud and clear, and I apologize.”A mom also wrote to Phillips with various scripts she uses to bring up the gun safety conversation including, “I love how well our boys play together! It’s fun to see their energy have an outlet. But I have a question before their playdate at your house. It’s one that always makes me a little uncomfortable, so please forgive me if this seems forward. Do you keep guns on the premises, and if so, how do you secure them?”Phillips thanked the reader for “providing a road map for other concerned parents to follow.”Brady Campaign President Dan Gross responded to Phillips’ apology and new stance on gun safety in her column, and noted that the center and Phillips both encourage parents to ask about guns before allowing their kids to visit other people’s homes. “We thank ‘Dear Abby’ for taking the time to hear us out and use her platform to spread the word,” he said. “It’s a simple question, but one that really does have the power to save young lives.” "

If a flier doesn’t request a certain seat, the airline will still ensure she receives either a window or an aisle position, rather than a middle seat. Sanjiv Kapoor, Vistara’s chief strategy and commercial officer, told HuffPost in a statement that the airline’s initiative is based on “intuitive thoughtfulness,” noting many of its solo female travelers request assistance.  “One of our core values is ‘intuitive thoughtfulness.’ We observed the preferences of solo women travellers on our flights, and noticed that they often sought assistance on ground upon arrival at their destinations, mostly either regarding their baggage or to reconfirm the safest and most reliable options for airport transfers. Some even shared their feedback with us that they would like proactive assistance on arrivals, both with luggage and with ground transport/ booking of taxi, especially at night. As part of this optional service, solo women travelers are not assigned middle seats, again based on feedback and intuitive thoughtfulness.”Vistara currently flies domestic routes in India, but has plans to expand and “intends to provide this service on international flights,” according to CNN. Air India has recently taken steps to make its flying experience safer for female travelers, too. After two separate incidents of groping aboard Air India flights were reported, the airline rolled out a reserved section of six seats for women. Launched in January 2017, the seating is available only to solo fliers, not women traveling with family.Sexual assault and harassment on planes happens everywhere, unfortunately, and India has been grappling with such crimes in general. The U.S. State Department advises women not to travel alone in the country: “Travelers should be aware that there have been reported cases of sexual assault, including rape, of U.S. citizens traveling throughout India,” the agency’s website says. “U.S. citizens, particularly women, are cautioned not to travel alone in India.”The State Dept. also notes harassment “can occur anytime or anywhere [in India], but most frequently has happened in crowded areas such as in market places, train stations, buses, and public streets. The harassment can range from sexually suggestive or lewd comments to catcalls to outright groping.”In the U.S., the FBI saw reports of sexual assaults on flights increase 45 percent by the fall of 2016, according to the New York Times. But are initiatives to separate women the answer? Not everyone thinks so, and Air India faced some blowback for its women-only section. Critics pointed out that the groping incidents speak to a larger cultural problem, and argued that rather than trying to address issues by isolating women, the problem required education and accountability. Vistara’s initiative has also been met with praise and participation.

Putin and his supporters have repeatedly let it be known that they would likely resume permission for Americans to adopt Russian orphans if the Magnitsky Act and other sanctions are lifted.As The Washington Post reported, it was Donald Trump who personally authored a false statement that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer to discuss “a program about the adoption of Russian children.”This statement quickly proved untrue, as Trump Jr.’s email chain, on which Kushner and Manafort were copied, was released by The New York Times. The subject line at the top of the email inviting Trump Jr. to the meeting (and which he forwarded to Kushner and Manafort) was headed “Russia-Clinton-private and confidential” and promised “information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Trump Jr.’s response: “… if it’s what you say I love it.” So much for the meeting being about adoptions.But even if President Trump’s statement that the meeting was about the adoption of Russian children were true, it’s still potentially incriminating. “Adoption of Russian children” is thinly veiled code for discussing lifting the Magnitsky Act and other U.S. sanctions on Russia. An undisclosed meeting between a Kremlin-connected lawyer and Trump Jr., Kushner, and Manafort to discuss the basis for allowing Americans to again adopt Russian orphans (i.e. by lifting sanctions) could still constitute collusion.The media has done little to help the public to understand the tie between “Russian adoptions” and “Russian sanctions.” That will hopefully change.But it’s doubtful that Robert Mueller doesn’t understand the connection. It’s likely that discussions between the Trump campaign and Kremlin-connected representatives, which are falsely or truthfully claimed to be about Russian adoptions, are already at the front of the mind of Mueller and his investigators."

Wednesday’s kickoff event in Los Angeles featured a panel with hip-hop mogul and producer Russell Simmons and actor and rapper Nick Cannon, as well as performances that included spoken word poetry. In an interview with HuffPost before the tour launched, Jones said he wants to push people ― progressives in particular ― to think beyond partisan divides to work on social justice issues, such as mass incarceration and the drug epidemics.“Part of what’s happened is everybody feels a sense of crisis ― economically, geopolitically ― but instead of turning to each other, we’re turning on each other,” Jones said.Since the election, Jones has drawn some criticism from the left for his push to “bridge divides” with folks on the right, particularly those who voted for Donald Trump. As a proud progressive who worked in the Obama administration and famously dubbed Trump’s election a “whitelash” against changing demographics, Jones caused some brows to furrow when his CNN show, “The Messy Truth,” which launched in December, had him visiting Trump supporters to listen to their struggles. Many progressives ― and people of color in particular ― have taken issue with the panoply of people after the election, including Jones, who have called for those on the left to “have conversations” with Trump voters rather than focus solely on supporting marginalized groups, many of which have seen their rights threatened by the Trump administration.Jones maintains that he can do both: “I’m just as concerned about what’s going on in Appalachia as in South-Central Los Angeles. We’re concerned about people both parties have let down for decades.”“It’s a lot easier to say, ‘Screw Trump and anyone who voted for him,’” he added. “But the problem is it doesn’t create a job or close a prison.”Jones’ “We Rise” tour won’t mirror his “Messy Truth” show, he says, largely because he will be talking mostly with liberal panelists and audience members, since, as he put it, “progressives and people of color will be the main people who show up.” “I’m going to be challenging those folks with stuff I’ve seen, to try to get us to open our hearts,” Jones said. “It’s a risk for me, because right now there is real risk as a progressive to raise criticism, because they don’t want it to play into Trump’s hand somehow.” Sales from the tour’s tickets ― ranging from a low of $17 in Las Vegas to a high of $216 in Miami ― will benefit Jones’ nonprofit, The Dream Corps.HuffPost spoke to Jones about the tour and why he thinks people on the left should be joining with those on the right to advance social justice. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Your “We Rise” tour wants people to “focus on our commonalities as opposed to our differences.” At a time of deep political division, why do you believe bipartisan efforts are the path forward?It’s about trying to get us back to a place where we’re talking about solutions and building bridges again. It’s scary to me, because I’m going out into what feels like a civil war ― and trying to point out opportunities for hope and progress ― without being Pollyanna about it.I’ve gotten a chance to go to so many different cities ― I’ve been to West Virginia, to South-Central L.A. Everywhere I go it’s the same thing: addiction, poverty, a broken criminal justice system, high death rates. I’m seeing common pain but no common purpose.There’s stuff we’re not going to agree on ― health care, immigration ― and everyone knows where I stand on those issues. But there are issues we do agree on, and nobody is doing anything. No one thinks the criminal justice system is doing well, or addiction ― whether narcotics in black communities or opioids in white communities ― or that were preparing the next generation of workers.We’re all yelling at each other about who’s a snowflake, but there’s funeral after funeral of young Americans from overdoses, homicides and even sometimes police shootings. You’ve done some of this kind of bipartisan bridge-building work with your show, “The Messy Truth,” when you talked to Trump voters about their concerns. How do you respond to the criticism you’ve gotten over those efforts?Look, I think Trump is worse than people fear ― and I think many of the Trump voters are better than people know. The truth is messy. Many of the Trump voters held their nose to vote for Trump, just as many of us held ours to vote for [Hillary] Clinton. My view is we should be tough on Trump and his policies and behaviors, but we should be very curious and open to understanding and finding common ground with Trump’s voters.I’m not kumbaya ― but unless you’re saying “Screw Trump,” you’re accused of being kumbaya. I’ve been in politics for 30 years. You have to look at reality, and to get things we want to get done, we have to de-inflame some of these tensions.  You mentioned there are issues people on the left and right tend to agree on. For instance, that mass incarceration is a problem. But even so, aren’t there still divides on how to solve it, or issues related to it, like police violence?My organization [The Dream Corps] has real legislation moving right now, the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, where we think we’ll pick up Republicans on not shackling women in federal prisons when giving birth. We don’t have to agree on everything to agree on some things. On criminal justice, there has been real bipartisan progress.I think the problem is people are in their own bubbles of outrage, and we’re not trying to solve problems anymore.

There’s a bunch of people addicted to being righteous and saying Republicans suck. That’s not a hard case to make. The harder case is that there are things we could be doing as progressives to get better outcomes for our community. You haven’t been the only one making calls to “bridge divides” since the election. Everyone from the Women’s March to Heineken has pushed people to “have conversations” with folks they disagree with. But critics note that promoting dialogue makes it seem like it’s individual opinions that need to change rather than systems or policies.That’s a false choice. We get in these false binaries: either you work on dialogue and understanding or on systemic change. But you can’t work on either unless you’re working on both. Try to close a prison without talking to a Republican. You can’t do it in any state. It’s not dialogue for its own sake: You can’t deliver on structural reforms without being in dialogue.

I think people have lost all perspective. It’s become fashionable to be cynical. I’m not going to let Trump change who I am.

Wells, while people were being lynched, talking about hope and change. This is what we do. This country was a slave state on stolen land, and we had to fight a civil war only to get to apartheid. And Dr. King created a democracy out of apartheid. I stand in that tradition. People with less money and no phones turned an apartheid regime into a democracy against much greater odds than what we face, and they weren’t cynical. I’m literally bewildered by how fashionable it’s become to just shoot down any idea or any suggestion that we might be able to get kids out of jail or morgues as Pollyanna, kumbaya stuff.

Programs like Upward Bound work to “level the playing field” by allowing students from low-income families entry into higher education, something they might have not otherwise had. Upward Bound, along with Educational Talent Search and McNair Scholars – collectively known as TRIO – are federally funded programs resulting from the 1960’s.At UMPI, all members of the Upward Bound Program, including first generation students and the staff hired to support them, lost the funding that gave them access to institutions of higher education. But none of that mattered to our new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, and the Department of Education, who denied the recent application due to formatting errors. And UMPI was not alone. Other colleges were not only denied funding based on small errors but were also told they weren’t allowed to fix them.The President’s new budget proposes massive cuts to the Department of Education. Amongst the most problematic is a $15 million cut to a program that provides child-care for low-income parents in college. In the early 1990’s, I was one of these parents. Without financial supplements by way of affordable childcare and co-operative opportunities at my community college, post-secondary education would not have been an option.In the proposed budget, grants to states for career and technical education would lose $168 million; adult basic literacy instruction would lose $96 million. There’s no support allocated to a $400 million student support and academic enrichment fund Congress created this fiscal year by rolling together smaller programs. A product of both the California Community College system and state and private universities, I graduated because of the EOP&S/CARE childcare programs, along with the EOP and Pell Grants available during my upperclassmen years, even as a former high-school dropout.Perhaps one of the most detrimental changes would be to students who receive financial aid - especially those who receive and rely on the popular Perkins loan and federal work-study programs. My entire education would not have been possible without access to financial aid in all of its various forms. In addition, the loan forgiveness program that serves social workers, public defenders or doctors in rural areas is also on the chopping block. My own combat veteran spouse utilizes such programs.Without educational programs like TRIO, the world would not have its alumni that contribute to the meaning of excellence. Viola Davis, Academy Award winner and should-be-professional-speaker, is a proud Student Support Services alum. Upward Bound produced John Quinones, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis. TRIO alumni include Oprah Winfrey and are found in the NBA, NFL, NASA, and even the Democratic National Convention.The Education Department still had not indicated whether or not those denied applications would be reconsidered. During the wait, thousands of students twisted in the wind with concerns of not completing or starting their journey to higher education. Finally, the Department and other officials heard the outcry over the injustice and changed their position.On May 24th, DeVos announced that the 77 applications previously denied would be reconsidered – largely due to a $50 million spending bill. She stated that Congress’s passing of the 2017 Omnibus spending bill allowed them the affordability to review the affected applications and that bureaucracy should not impede students. DeVos’s statement resembles empathy and can allow those affected to breathe a temporary sigh of relief.This policy change is the right thing to do. It provides much needed hope after Trump’s plan to butcher the budget. In the proposed $9.2 billion cut—the work of Trump officials with access to the upper echelon of education—the loss of opportunities for all levels of education would be incredibly detrimental. At the very least, this plan’s lack of loan forgiveness would discourage those drawn to work in education.This doesn’t have to be our reality. If the citizens of the United States have forgiven and can continue to forgive our government when they make a mistake—even a grammatical one—our government should return the favor. Here in America we call this access, and itis one of our treasured values that has always made us great.Sharisse Tracey is a writing fellow for the Center for Community Change."

In one incident captured on video, a roadside bomb detonated near a group of police on motorcycles in the capital of Caracas and left several officers injured. Opponents of the vote, which has been deemed as illegitimate by the U.S. and a host of countries in South America, view the election as embattled President Nicolas Maduro’s attempt to consolidate power and remove his political opposition from office. The new Constituent Assembly has extremely far-reaching powers to reshape the country’s political institutions and potentially dissolve the opposition-led National Assembly.In response to the election, the U.S. announced that it would be issuing sanctions on Maduro and accused him of undermining democracy in the hemisphere. Despite the international condemnation, reports of low turnout and public opposition, Maduro on Sunday declared the result a huge victory and plans to go ahead with establishing the Constituent Assembly. The opposition, meanwhile, called for fresh protests on Monday amid fears that the crisis will continue to spiral. Venezuela’s political turmoil is occurring amid a crippling economic crisis that has led to shortages of basic necessities and long lines to buy whatever food is available. Although Sunday was one of the deadliest days in Venezuela’s ongoing political and economic crisis, there have been months of protests and violent confrontations. Thousands have been injured in the demonstrations and at least 113 people killed.Photojournalists in the country have captured scenes of fiery melees, injured demonstrators and a polarized country that is increasingly being plunged into unrest and uncertainty."

Each of the previous five tests had grown increasingly more powerful and experts have warned that North Korea may be working to craft a warhead that can fit atop a long-range missile.North Korea conducted its second successful ICBM test last week. The launch drew international condemnation and an angry response from President Donald Trump, who appeared to blame China and its inability to rein in the North“I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet,” Trump tweeted. “They do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!”On Sunday, the U.S. flew two supersonic bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force, Reuters reported.Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, does not plan to seek an emergency session of the UN’s Security Council. She said there was “no point” in doing so if China did not act to help pressure Kim.Known for hyperbole, North Korea has warned of “stern action of justice” should the U.S. seek increased sanctions against the country, Yonhap reported.“If the United States sticks to its military adventurism against us and super-intensive sanctions schemes, we will respond with a stern action of justice as we have already declared,” a North Korean spokesperson told the country’s state run news agency."

Past crises in relations had been peacefully resolved, but this time Qatar’s antagonists demanded its virtual surrender, particularly abandonment of an independent foreign policy. They believed they had Washington behind them.Alas, the intervening weeks have not been kind to Riyadh and UAE. They now say they are willing to negotiate previously “nonnegotiable” demands. A further retreat seems likely.Everything started going wrong when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signaled their support for Doha. Tillerson demonstrated obvious impatience with demands he viewed as extreme and not even worth negotiating, and called Qatar’s positions “very reasonable.”Then more than a few critics observed that Riyadh and Dubai are even guiltier than Qatar in funding terrorism. One of them was Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who complained that “The amount of support for terrorism by Saudi Arabia dwarfs what Qatar is doing.” Indeed, the Kingdom long has been the most dangerous incubator of intolerance in the entire Middle East. In response to the controversy Doha inked an agreement with the U.S. on targeting terrorist financing, which none of Qatar’s accusers had done.George Washington University Professor Marc Lynch observed that “The extremist and sectarian rhetoric which external forces brought to the Syrian insurgency was a problem extending far beyond Qatar.” The demand to shut Al Jazeera by nations which have no free press and even criminalized the simple expression of sympathy for Qatar was denounced globally.Then came reports that U.S. intelligence concluded the UAE had hacked the official Qatar website a couple months ago, creating the incendiary posts allegedly quoting Qatar’s emir which helped trigger the crisis. In contrast, Bahrain and Egypt, which joined the anti-Doha bandwagon, looked like mere hirelings, doing as they have been told by states which provided financial and military aid. Having initiated hostilities without a back-up plan, the anti-Qatar coalition can move neither forward nor backward without a huge loss of face. But staying the course looks little better. Saudi Arabia and UAE caused Qataris to rally behind their royal family, wrecked the Gulf Cooperation Council, eased Iran’s isolation, pulled Turkey directly into Gulf affairs, and challenged Washington. Quite an achievement.The experience has yielded several important lessons.President Donald Trump huffs and puffs, but doesn’t have much to do with U.S. foreign policy. Despite having criticized Saudi Arabia in the past, he flip-flopped to become Riyadh’s de facto lobbyists in Washington. However, his very public preferences have had little impact on U.S. policy, which ended up tilting strongly against UAE and Saudi Arabia. He recently acknowledged that he and Secretary Tillerson “had a little bit of a difference, only in terms of tone.”Saudi Arabia proved to be more paper tiger than regional leader. It spent lavishly on weapons, subsidized other Muslim states, sought to overthrow of Syria’s Assad regime, and launched a brutal war against Yemen, but had no response prepared when Qatar dismissed Riyadh’s demands. Then Secretary Tillerson effectively blocked any escalation. With the expiration of the Saudi-UAE ultimatum several weeks ago some observers feared that Saudi Arabia and UAE would impose additional sanctions, expel Qatar from the GCC, or even invade their independent neighbor. But Secretary Tillerson made all of those steps more difficult if not impossible in practice.Indeed, the secretary’s shuttle diplomacy to support the Kuwaiti mediation attempt even forced Qatar’s accusers to effectively negotiate what they had termed nonnegotiable. UAE Minister of State Noura al-Kaabi said “We need a diplomatic solution. We are not looking for an escalation.” More recently Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, along with their subsidized allies, Bahrain and Egypt, offered to engage in a dialogue with Qatar. No wonder the Saudis, who once believed they had coopted America’s president, now complain that America’s secretary of state is backing Doha.Saudi Arabia’s expensive overseas diplomacy has been of dubious value, gaining the Kingdom few friends. Riyadh and UAE organized an inconsequential coalition featuring dependents Bahrain and Egypt, international nullity Maldives, and one of the contending governments in fractured Libya. Since then the group has failed to win meaningful support from any other state. The problem? The real issue isn’t terrorism, but far more selfish concerns, such as support for domestic political opponents.The reputation of the accusers has tanked. Discussion of the controversy almost inevitably resulted in more attention to the misbehavior of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, particularly their brutal repression of any political and religious dissent at home, Saudi Arabia’s lavish funding for the extremist and intolerant Wahhabist strain of Islam, and UAE’s initiation of cyber-hostilities against Doha. Tom Wilson of the London-based Henry Jackson Society recently published a report calling Riyadh the “foremost” funder of terrorism in the United Kingdom and citing concerns that “the amount of funding for religious extremism coming out of countries such as Saudi Arabia has actually increased in recent years.” While Qatar was vulnerable to criticism over its backing for some radical groups, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had been subject to even harsher U.S. attacks.Iran continued to gain more from the actions of its antagonists than its own efforts. Doha and Tehran are linked by a shared natural gas field. Their relationship is one of Saudi Arabia’s chief complaints. Iran is a malign actor, but Riyadh, a totalitarian Sunni dictatorship, is worse. Saudi Arabia intervened militarily in Bahrain to sustain the Sunni monarchy against the Shia majority and backed radical insurgents to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The reckless new Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, orchestrated the murderous, counterproductive war in Yemen and diplomatic/economic attack on Qatar in order to achieve Gulf hegemony. Now, without firing a shot, Iran helped thwart Riyadh’s latest scheme, won the gratitude of Qataris, and put a reasonable face on the Islamist regime.Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis deserve special credit. By ignoring President Trump’s misdirected enthusiasm for the Saudi monarchy, they helped shift public attention back to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Neither has demonstrated sufficient interest in cutting terrorist funding.For instance, in a lengthy cable dated December 30, 2009, released by Wikileaks, the State Department criticized Qatar and UAE, but was toughest on Saudi Arabia: “it has been an ongoing challenge to persuade Saudi officials to treat terrorist financing emanating from Saudi Arabia as a strategic priority.” Moreover, “donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” The Kingdom “remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaeda” and other terrorist organizations. Despite Riyadh’s policies, “groups continue to send money overseas and, at times, fund extremism overseas.”If Saudi Arabia and UAE cared about terrorism, they would look inward first. And Riyadh would stop funding Wahhabism, an intolerant Islamic teaching which demonizes those who believe differently. The consequences of this funding may be more long-lasting than payments to the terrorist group du jour. Norwegian anti-terrorism analyst Thomas Hegghammer observed “If there was going to be an Islamic reformation in the 20th century, the Saudis probably prevented it by pumping out literalism.” Wilson observed: “a growing body of evidence has emerged that points to the considerable impact that foreign funding has had on advancing Islamist extremism in Britain and other Western countries.”What really bothers Saudi Arabia and the UAE is Doha’s support for opposition groups. For instance, both Riyadh and Egypt fear the Muslim Brotherhood, which offers a flawed but serious life philosophy—and does not promote terrorism. The Saudi royals are insecure because a kleptocratic, totalitarian monarchy holds little appeal to anyone other than the few thousand princes who live lavishly at everyone else’s expense. Similar is the Saudi and Emirati demand that Qatar shut TV channel Al Jazeera, which has criticized both regimes.Riyadh also wants to conscript all of its neighbors in its campaign to isolate Iran, yet has applied no pressure on UAE which, like Qatar, has maintained ties with the Islamist regime. Anyway, it would be far better to promote long-term change by continuing to draw Iran’s population Westward in opposition to the Islamist elites. By playing host to groups as diverse as the Taliban and Hamas, Doha actually has drawn controversial organizations away from more radical governments, such as Iran’s, and enabled the West to have unofficial contact with groups with which it is officially at odds, such as the Taliban.Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have sown the wind. Now the entire Gulf will reap the whirlwind. Their attack on Qatar further destabilized the Middle East, unsettling several of Washington’s closest allies. The Saudis and Emiratis ended up in a global cul-de-sac, isolating themselves more than Qatar. The latter has little incentive to yield, while the former face debilitating humiliation if they abandon their claims. Other governments increasingly expect a lengthy stand-off. Secretary Tillerson predicted that the “ultimate resolution may take quite a while.”That will benefit no one, other than Iran, perhaps. Not Qatar. Not America. And certainly not Saudi Arabia and the UAE.The U.S. can’t impose a settlement on its dubious allies. But Washington can recognize that “there are no clean hands here,” as a State Department spokesman recently observed. The Trump administration should place full responsibility for the current stand-off where it belongs, on Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. They should be the countries punished by international isolation.This article was first posted to Forbes online."

Her extended family and friends were all hit with cancers.“It’s just the way it was,” she said.Not until Sanchez-Hall left Wilmington—an industrial powerhouse where multiple freeways, the Port of LA, rail spurs, and four oil refineries crowd into in less than 10 square miles—did she began to connect the dots.The awakening came in her first semester at UCLA, where she was pursuing a master’s degree. A guest lecturer for her environmental law class began a presentation by describing “the most polluted place in America” where taking in a lungful of air was considered a debatable health choice. He called it “ground zero” for industrial pollution.“He began to show slides of this ‘terrible’ place,” Sanchez-Hall said. “I was curious where it would be. But when I saw the pictures, I couldn’t believe it, there was my brother’s house, there was my uncle’s house, there was my church.”This is a neighborhood that cap and trade left behind. California’s landmark climate change law has done its job in reducing greenhouse gases that drive global warming. The program was renewed by the legislature through to 2030, and signed into law this week, codifying what many see as the state’s international leadership on climate change.But the climate law promised something else too. Embedded in its enabling language was a pledge not to make things worse in the communities where big polluters operate. Its framers anticipated that, even as cap and trade’s market-based mechanism provides flexibility to industry, it opens the door to a host of unintended consequences. By allowing industries to buy carbon credits or offset projects rather than modernize old equipment, localized pollution would not improve, and could get worse.None of the refineries contacted commented for this story.As for Sanchez-Hall, she once again lives in the embrace of her family, fortified with sophisticated air filters in her home and standing orders to close windows and stay inside when one of the local refineries is burning off gas, or flaring. And she maintains a hard rule to never go anywhere without an inhaler, lest one of her kids experience an asthma attack.“People say, ‘Why don’t you just leave?’” said Sanchez-Hall, a public policy consultant. “Yeah, I could afford to. But what about my mom? What about my brother and his kids? What about the lady who cuts my hair? What about the mechanic who fixes my car? What about the guy who runs the local store? What about all those people?”This week Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the extension of the state’s cap-and-trade system, ensuring that the landmark climate law continues until 2030. California’s aggressive efforts to combat global warming have gained international acclaim, and the ambitious goals for greenhouse gas reductions are on track.But from its origins in 2006, the law creating cap and trade contained another promise: to ensure that air quality in communities in the shadow of industrial polluters would not worsen. By that measure, it has been less successful.In some cases pollution is pouring out of smokestacks, unabated, because more than three-quarters of the carbon-reduction projects the law allows are taking place out of state. Studies show that air is getting worse in some low-income neighborhoods around the state, from the Bay Area to the Central Valley and south Los Angeles. Rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments are on the rise.Granted, cap and trade’s primary function is to regulate and reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases. Viewed simply, the 2006 law that created it restricts the amount of greenhouse gases a facility can belch out of a smokestack. The law does not regulate the other pollutants that flow out at the same time.That doesn’t mean, however, that cap and trade doesn’t concern itself with air pollution. The law directs the state to design a market-based system that will “prevent any increase in the emissions of toxic air contaminants or criteria air pollutants.” Among those toxins are the carcinogen benzene, noxious chemicals such as sulfur dioxide, and particulates damaging to respiratory health.The wording of the law is the equivalent of the physicians’ admonition to “First, do no harm.”The state knew all along that the carbon trading system could create “hot spots.” In 2011, the state Air Resources Board established a process under the umbrella of cap and trade to monitor localized air quality impacts as a result of cap and trade. The air board convened an advisory group to devise a plan requiring emitters to quickly reduce local pollution.The panel has yet to agree on a course of action. An air board spokesman said the group was moving forward with its work.“Even though there’s this language in the law that tells them to design a system to prevent increased pollution, they’ve said, ‘Don’t worry your little heads, we’ll take care of it.’ They haven’t,” said Brent Newell, legal director for the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, which provides organizational and legal assistance to low-income communities.To some, the impetus to reduce point-source pollution has been overtaken by the air board’s enormously complicated task of getting a first-of-its-kind carbon market up and running.Dean Florez, who as a state senator voted for the creation of cap and trade, now sits on the air board. He said that in retrospect, it was a mistake to saddle the agency with twin missions to reduce carbon and air pollution. “I think that we piled too much on the air resources board,” he said.Even though cap and trade is achieving its goals, he said, success now becomes a relative term. “If we are just solving for carbon, those communities are not any better off.”Former state legislator Fran Pavley, who authored the law birthing cap and trade, said its intent was to was to create a “multi-benefit approach ... As we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we would also be able to reduce criteria air pollutants which have the localized direct health impacts.”Pollution control in many impacted neighborhoods has been regulated by local air boards, who can adopt robust policies, or not, in response to local needs. Cap and trade was not meant to replace efforts by state or local air boards to reduce air pollution, Pavley said, but it envisioned the program would bring cleaner air to the low-income neighborhoods located near regulated facilities.Still there’s no guarantee—even when industries comply with the emissions cap—that the air quality in their proximity will improve. That’s because the system allows companies options: retrofit aging facilities to reduce emissions, purchase permits from the state auction, or buy a certain number of offsets from carbon-reducing projects in California or elsewhere. With more than 75 percent of the program’s offsets paying for out-of-state projects, emissions at some individual facilities here remain unchanged.The new legislation reduces the percentage of a firm’s greenhouse gas emissions that can be offset, beginning in 2021, and adds a requirement that half the projects take place in California.For now, at many of the most-polluting smokestack industries, it’s been business as usual.Recent reports have clarified the state of play, often stating the obvious: Facilities regulated under cap and trade are located in neighborhoods with higher proportions of residents of color and residents living in poverty. And, those neighborhoods are also more likely to have the biggest polluters.A 2016 report, prepared by researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, University of Southern California, San Francisco State and Occidental College, examined the environmental equity of cap and trade. It tempered the overall good news about statewide greenhouse gas reductions, finding, “…on average, many industry sectors covered under cap-and-trade report increases in localized instate GHG emissions since the program came into effect…”The report concluded that large industries whose emissions represent public health concerns are the most likely to use offset projects to meet their obligations under the cap-and-trade program.Another analysis, published in February by the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, concluded what common sense would suggest: There is a “strong correlation” between greenhouse gas emissions and emissions of air pollutants among refineries, and, in general, higher greenhouse gas emitters also were higher emitters of other pollutants.Martha Argüello, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility, called the latter the “I-told-you-so report,” which affirmed what local residents had been complaining about.“Often, the data ground-truths the community experience,” she said. “There was a promise with cap and trade not to make things worse. The data shows that’s happening. Promise broken.”Betrayal has been the theme from critics of Gov. Brown’s willingness to compromise to get the votes needed to secure cap-and-trade’s extension. The governor toured low-income neighborhoods in the lead-up to the reauthorization vote, promising skeptical activists that areas hard-hit by pollution would receive revenue from the cap-and-trade auction program.To ease passage of the new cap-and-trade law, Brown and legislators also approved a companion measure—sponsored by Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia of Bell Gardens—intended to hold polluters accountable for cleaning air in vulnerable communities.But the Assembly killed a much more stringent version, and what emerged left some environmental justice advocates complaining that it would yield no appreciable benefit. It also would allow local air districts to create pollution trading markets that could permit companies to continue to pump toxics into the air in fence line neighborhoods. On the other hand, the law will greatly expand air pollution monitoring, and it raises the maximum fines levied against industries.The oil and gas industry was at the negotiating table, strongly opposing aspects of both new laws that sought more control over emitters. Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, said oil and gas producers and refiners support both enacted measures.“Local monitoring and community investment are important; as an industry we embrace that,” she said. “There’s more to be done in local communities, we understand that. We do have to reduce criteria pollutants and toxic pollutants.”Reheis-Boyd would not specify what actions polluting companies would take under the new rules to retrofit facilities, but termed tackling air pollution in the state “very expensive.”Brown encountered a small group of protesters this week at the signing ceremony for Garcia’s bill, making up his own pro-cap and trade chant to counter theirs.“Today, we’re taking a step to take the poison out as well as increase the prosperity and the goodies for all,” he said.Garcia, too, has felt the sting from the environmental justice community. A former teacher who has championed public health issues, she said candidly that she understood their anger.“There’s more work to be done. I’m going to keep fighting,” she said. “We have left communities like mine behind too long. We get treated like a wasteland. But let’s not be lost in our frustration. I’ve been on the outside my whole life, I’ve been throwing rocks. I understand. I’m not going to pretend this is going to solve all our problems. But this is something.”Even though greenhouse gas emissions in the state are declining —down 10 percent since peak levels in 2004 —localized pollution is another matter. The February state report studied 10 areas and found that four—Richmond, Oakland, downtown Los Angeles and Fresno—experienced increased pollution since cap and trade was fully implemented in early 2012.In short, the program is doing global good. Except in communities such as Wilmington, where it isn’t.Alicia Rivera is a local organizer with Communities for a Better Environment, a California-based environmental justice group. She walks the busy streets in Wilmington and Carson, pushing through creaking wrought iron gates, calling out to calm barking dogs, knocking on doors. To those who answer, she asks, “Is anyone sick?” and people spill out their stories.For her, every street elicits a litany of medical nightmares. “That house over there, with the white car? The woman has two children, one with asthma and the other with stomach ulcers,” Rivera said. “That one with the beautiful garden? She has a tumor in her head. The brown house? Cancer.”Should Rivera’s inventory require official confirmation, the neighborhood appears on the state’s CalEnviroScreen maps as a grim sweepstakes winner: It’s in California’s 96th percentile for pollution burden.These working-class neighborhoods cram together what health researchers term “sensitive receptors”—society’s most medically vulnerable—all in one place, in close proximity to heavily-polluting sites. At one four-way intersection: Low-income and senior housing, an elementary school, a walk-in medical clinic and a daycare center advertising “Open Enrollment: 3- & 4 year-olds.”It’s two blocks from a refinery and an industrial oil tank farm, against the backdrop of the port’s loading cranes, towering on the horizon like prehistoric birds.Linda Bassett teaches at a nearby elementary school, where children on the playground can see puffing smokestacks.“I have kids with nosebleeds, headaches and stomach aches all the time, first graders,” Bassett said. “I have brilliant kids in my classroom. I know that I have bright kids. They are discounted in so many ways. Who cares about their health? Why is it okay? It’s disgusting.”Schools in the neighborhood have been studied by the state air board out of concern for poor air quality. The county health department regularly sends a specially-equipped medical van to the school to treat students with asthma.So widespread are respiratory ailments that one grassroots environmental justice group in the area has as its slogan, “We are just trying to breathe.”Do you like what you are reading?

By that measure, it has been less successful.In some cases pollution is pouring out of smokestacks, unabated, because more than three-quarters of the carbon-reduction projects the law allows are taking place out of state. Studies show that air is getting worse in some low-income neighborhoods around the state, from the Bay Area to the Central Valley and south Los Angeles. Rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments are on the rise.Granted, cap and trade’s primary function is to regulate and reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases. Viewed simply, the 2006 law that created it restricts the amount of greenhouse gases a facility can belch out of a smokestack. The law does not regulate the other pollutants that flow out at the same time.That doesn’t mean, however, that cap and trade doesn’t concern itself with air pollution. The law directs the state to design a market-based system that will “prevent any increase in the emissions of toxic air contaminants or criteria air pollutants.” Among those toxins are the carcinogen benzene, noxious chemicals such as sulfur dioxide, and particulates damaging to respiratory health.The wording of the law is the equivalent of the physicians’ admonition to “First, do no harm.”The state knew all along that the carbon trading system could create “hot spots.” In 2011, the state Air Resources Board established a process under the umbrella of cap and trade to monitor localized air quality impacts as a result of cap and trade. The air board convened an advisory group to devise a plan requiring emitters to quickly reduce local pollution.The panel has yet to agree on a course of action. An air board spokesman said the group was moving forward with its work.“Even though there’s this language in the law that tells them to design a system to prevent increased pollution, they’ve said, ‘Don’t worry your little heads, we’ll take care of it.’ They haven’t,” said Brent Newell, legal director for the Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment, which provides organizational and legal assistance to low-income communities.To some, the impetus to reduce point-source pollution has been overtaken by the air board’s enormously complicated task of getting a first-of-its-kind carbon market up and running.Dean Florez, who as a state senator voted for the creation of cap and trade, now sits on the air board. He said that in retrospect, it was a mistake to saddle the agency with twin missions to reduce carbon and air pollution. “I think that we piled too much on the air resources board,” he said.Even though cap and trade is achieving its goals, he said, success now becomes a relative term. “If we are just solving for carbon, those communities are not any better off.”Former state legislator Fran Pavley, who authored the law birthing cap and trade, said its intent was to was to create a “multi-benefit approach ... As we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we would also be able to reduce criteria air pollutants which have the localized direct health impacts.”Pollution control in many impacted neighborhoods has been regulated by local air boards, who can adopt robust policies, or not, in response to local needs. Cap and trade was not meant to replace efforts by state or local air boards to reduce air pollution, Pavley said, but it envisioned the program would bring cleaner air to the low-income neighborhoods located near regulated facilities.Still there’s no guarantee—even when industries comply with the emissions cap—that the air quality in their proximity will improve. That’s because the system allows companies options: retrofit aging facilities to reduce emissions, purchase permits from the state auction, or buy a certain number of offsets from carbon-reducing projects in California or elsewhere. With more than 75 percent of the program’s offsets paying for out-of-state projects, emissions at some individual facilities here remain unchanged.The new legislation reduces the percentage of a firm’s greenhouse gas emissions that can be offset, beginning in 2021, and adds a requirement that half the projects take place in California.For now, at many of the most-polluting smokestack industries, it’s been business as usual.Recent reports have clarified the state of play, often stating the obvious: Facilities regulated under cap and trade are located in neighborhoods with higher proportions of residents of color and residents living in poverty. And, those neighborhoods are also more likely to have the biggest polluters.A 2016 report, prepared by researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, University of Southern California, San Francisco State and Occidental College, examined the environmental equity of cap and trade. It tempered the overall good news about statewide greenhouse gas reductions, finding, “…on average, many industry sectors covered under cap-and-trade report increases in localized instate GHG emissions since the program came into effect…”The report concluded that large industries whose emissions represent public health concerns are the most likely to use offset projects to meet their obligations under the cap-and-trade program.Another analysis, published in February by the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, concluded what common sense would suggest: There is a “strong correlation” between greenhouse gas emissions and emissions of air pollutants among refineries, and, in general, higher greenhouse gas emitters also were higher emitters of other pollutants.Martha Argüello, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility, called the latter the “I-told-you-so report,” which affirmed what local residents had been complaining about.“Often, the data ground-truths the community experience,” she said. “There was a promise with cap and trade not to make things worse. The data shows that’s happening. Promise broken.”Betrayal has been the theme from critics of Gov. Brown’s willingness to compromise to get the votes needed to secure cap-and-trade’s extension. The governor toured low-income neighborhoods in the lead-up to the reauthorization vote, promising skeptical activists that areas hard-hit by pollution would receive revenue from the cap-and-trade auction program.To ease passage of the new cap-and-trade law, Brown and legislators also approved a companion measure—sponsored by Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia of Bell Gardens—intended to hold polluters accountable for cleaning air in vulnerable communities.But the Assembly killed a much more stringent version, and what emerged left some environmental justice advocates complaining that it would yield no appreciable benefit. It also would allow local air districts to create pollution trading markets that could permit companies to continue to pump toxics into the air in fence line neighborhoods. On the other hand, the law will greatly expand air pollution monitoring, and it raises the maximum fines levied against industries.The oil and gas industry was at the negotiating table, strongly opposing aspects of both new laws that sought more control over emitters. Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, said oil and gas producers and refiners support both enacted measures.“Local monitoring and community investment are important; as an industry we embrace that,” she said. “There’s more to be done in local communities, we understand that. We do have to reduce criteria pollutants and toxic pollutants.”Reheis-Boyd would not specify what actions polluting companies would take under the new rules to retrofit facilities, but termed tackling air pollution in the state “very expensive.”Brown encountered a small group of protesters this week at the signing ceremony for Garcia’s bill, making up his own pro-cap and trade chant to counter theirs.“Today, we’re taking a step to take the poison out as well as increase the prosperity and the goodies for all,” he said.Garcia, too, has felt the sting from the environmental justice community. A former teacher who has championed public health issues, she said candidly that she understood their anger.“There’s more work to be done. I’m going to keep fighting,” she said. “We have left communities like mine behind too long. We get treated like a wasteland. But let’s not be lost in our frustration. I’ve been on the outside my whole life, I’ve been throwing rocks. I understand. I’m not going to pretend this is going to solve all our problems. But this is something.”Even though greenhouse gas emissions in the state are declining —down 10 percent since peak levels in 2004 —localized pollution is another matter. The February state report studied 10 areas and found that four—Richmond, Oakland, downtown Los Angeles and Fresno—experienced increased pollution since cap and trade was fully implemented in early 2012.In short, the program is doing global good. Except in communities such as Wilmington, where it isn’t.Alicia Rivera is a local organizer with Communities for a Better Environment, a California-based environmental justice group. She walks the busy streets in Wilmington and Carson, pushing through creaking wrought iron gates, calling out to calm barking dogs, knocking on doors. To those who answer, she asks, “Is anyone sick?” and people spill out their stories.For her, every street elicits a litany of medical nightmares. “That house over there, with the white car? The woman has two children, one with asthma and the other with stomach ulcers,” Rivera said. “That one with the beautiful garden? She has a tumor in her head. The brown house? Cancer.”Should Rivera’s inventory require official confirmation, the neighborhood appears on the state’s CalEnviroScreen maps as a grim sweepstakes winner: It’s in California’s 96th percentile for pollution burden.These working-class neighborhoods cram together what health researchers term “sensitive receptors”—society’s most medically vulnerable—all in one place, in close proximity to heavily-polluting sites. At one four-way intersection: Low-income and senior housing, an elementary school, a walk-in medical clinic and a daycare center advertising “Open Enrollment: 3- & 4 year-olds.”It’s two blocks from a refinery and an industrial oil tank farm, against the backdrop of the port’s loading cranes, towering on the horizon like prehistoric birds.Linda Bassett teaches at a nearby elementary school, where children on the playground can see puffing smokestacks.“I have kids with nosebleeds, headaches and stomach aches all the time, first graders,” Bassett said. “I have brilliant kids in my classroom. I know that I have bright kids. They are discounted in so many ways. Who cares about their health? Why is it okay? It’s disgusting.”Schools in the neighborhood have been studied by the state air board out of concern for poor air quality. The county health department regularly sends a specially-equipped medical van to the school to treat students with asthma.So widespread are respiratory ailments that one grassroots environmental justice group in the area has as its slogan, “We are just trying to breathe.”Do you like what you are reading?

Her extended family and friends were all hit with cancers.“It’s just the way it was,” she said.Not until Sanchez-Hall left Wilmington—an industrial powerhouse where multiple freeways, the Port of LA, rail spurs, and four oil refineries crowd into in less than 10 square miles—did she began to connect the dots.The awakening came in her first semester at UCLA, where she was pursuing a master’s degree. A guest lecturer for her environmental law class began a presentation by describing “the most polluted place in America” where taking in a lungful of air was considered a debatable health choice. He called it “ground zero” for industrial pollution.“He began to show slides of this ‘terrible’ place,” Sanchez-Hall said. “I was curious where it would be. But when I saw the pictures, I couldn’t believe it, there was my brother’s house, there was my uncle’s house, there was my church.”This is a neighborhood that cap and trade left behind. California’s landmark climate change law has done its job in reducing greenhouse gases that drive global warming. The program was renewed by the legislature through to 2030, and signed into law this week, codifying what many see as the state’s international leadership on climate change.But the climate law promised something else too. Embedded in its enabling language was a pledge not to make things worse in the communities where big polluters operate. Its framers anticipated that, even as cap and trade’s market-based mechanism provides flexibility to industry, it opens the door to a host of unintended consequences. By allowing industries to buy carbon credits or offset projects rather than modernize old equipment, localized pollution would not improve, and could get worse.None of the refineries contacted commented for this story.As for Sanchez-Hall, she once again lives in the embrace of her family, fortified with sophisticated air filters in her home and standing orders to close windows and stay inside when one of the local refineries is burning off gas, or flaring. And she maintains a hard rule to never go anywhere without an inhaler, lest one of her kids experience an asthma attack.“People say, ‘Why don’t you just leave?’” said Sanchez-Hall, a public policy consultant. “Yeah, I could afford to. But what about my mom? What about my brother and his kids? What about the lady who cuts my hair? What about the mechanic who fixes my car? What about the guy who runs the local store? What about all those people?”This week Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the extension of the state’s cap-and-trade system, ensuring that the landmark climate law continues until 2030.

Nor are all boats rising at the same rate with regard to clergy pay.Some 42 percent of the difference in the closing of the gender gap was related to slower increases in compensation for male pastors, researchers said.Today, several factors may put further pressure on ministerial wages, notably:· The rising number of Americans choosing not to affiliate with a religious group, which reduces clergy demand.· Economic theories that indicate some occupations are devalued when they come to be seen as “women’s work.” “We might be at a point where we see a general devaluation of the clergy occupation,” lead researcher Cyrus Schleifer said.Growing work forceResearchers have faced difficulties in analyzing gender compensation gaps among clergy – and comparing figures with other occupations. It is hard to find national data with enough numbers of women clergy and to account for the benefits minsters receive in the form of housing allowances or living in church-provided residences.In their study, researchers Schleifer and Amy Miller of the University of Oklahoma analyzed data on working clergy ages 18 to 65 from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey from 1976 to 2016. The survey, administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, is widely used in measuring economic inequalities and provides information on the housing benefits that are a special part of clergy compensation.The study results were just published online in Sociology of Religion, a prominent, peer-reviewed journal.Some of the key findings include:· Dynamic movement toward equal pay: Consider that congregations as a matter of religious freedom are free to hire who they want as their spiritual leader and that many Scriptures are interpreted as modeling traditional gender roles. That makes it all the more surprising, Schleifer said, that the income disadvantage between male and female clergy fell in the last four decades to less than a dime on the dollar, below the pay gap of many government agencies under gender discrimination laws. “It’s good news for the religious communities,” he said.· The married-with-children penalty: Some women benefited more than others. Married female clergy make around 28 percent less than male clergy. This may go back in part to the traditional assumption that a male pastor’s wife would serve as unpaid labor; there is no similar expectation for clergy husbands. The study also found that female clergy with children in their home are paid less than female clergy with no children. · And the highest paying jobs still are more likely to go to: Men. Around 21 percent of female clergy are part-time, compared to only 4 percent of male clergy. In a separate finding that researchers said also reinforces the idea of a stained-glass ceiling for women clergy, male clergy who work in non-congregational settings such as church agencies, school and hospitals make around 11 percent more than congregational clergy. But there is no such wage benefit for women clergy, indicating men are more like to serve as agency heads or school administrators, while women are more likely in lower-level positions.· Wage hikes for men? Not so fast: Male clergy show an average yearly increase of around 0.2 percent compared to workers in the general population. Female clergy show a faster rate of change at around 1.3 percent each year. Looking ahead The national study was not able to compare clergy pay by religious groups.But its findings are consistent with other research indicating that even though advances are being made, gender bias persists in many denominations.A 2016 survey of 224 clergywomen in the Evangelical Covenant Church found women “have struggled in finding jobs and are concerned over the underrepresentation of women at all levels of leadership.” Some described the denomination as a “good old boys’ club,” reported researcher Lenore M. Knight Johnson of Trinity Christian College.In the Episcopal Church, the Rev. Paula Nesbitt, a leading researcher on faith and gender, noted in a report that 2013 pension fund data showed even among those just starting their ministry, “women earn a median of eight cents less for every dollar a man makes. The gender gap increases to eleven cents less for women with more than five years of credited service or who have reached age 35.”The findings also seem to give credence to other research on gender bias – sometimes called occupational feminization theory - that suggests that rising numbers of women in an occupation may result in a loss of status and value in the profession as it is seen as more feminine.Despite these continuing hurdles, Schleifer suggests, “My sense is we’re moving in the right direction” in addressing clergy gender bias.But even as younger generations in society embrace and experience greater equality, shifting cultural attitudes takes time, Schleifer noted.“While our results highlight growth in gender income parity among American clergy, there are still barriers to female mobility within this occupation,” he and Miller concluded.For female and male clergy already coping with a shrinking market of worshippers, how fast attitudes change may impact everyone’s bottom line.Explore survey questions on the role of women in religion with ARDA’s Measurement Wizard."

Looking ahead The national study was not able to compare clergy pay by religious groups.But its findings are consistent with other research indicating that even though advances are being made, gender bias persists in many denominations.A 2016 survey of 224 clergywomen in the Evangelical Covenant Church found women “have struggled in finding jobs and are concerned over the underrepresentation of women at all levels of leadership.” Some described the denomination as a “good old boys’ club,” reported researcher Lenore M. Knight Johnson of Trinity Christian College.In the Episcopal Church, the Rev. Paula Nesbitt, a leading researcher on faith and gender, noted in a report that 2013 pension fund data showed even among those just starting their ministry, “women earn a median of eight cents less for every dollar a man makes. The gender gap increases to eleven cents less for women with more than five years of credited service or who have reached age 35.”The findings also seem to give credence to other research on gender bias – sometimes called occupational feminization theory - that suggests that rising numbers of women in an occupation may result in a loss of status and value in the profession as it is seen as more feminine.Despite these continuing hurdles, Schleifer suggests, “My sense is we’re moving in the right direction” in addressing clergy gender bias.But even as younger generations in society embrace and experience greater equality, shifting cultural attitudes takes time, Schleifer noted.“While our results highlight growth in gender income parity among American clergy, there are still barriers to female mobility within this occupation,” he and Miller concluded.For female and male clergy already coping with a shrinking market of worshippers, how fast attitudes change may impact everyone’s bottom line.Explore survey questions on the role of women in religion with ARDA’s Measurement Wizard."

Glickman, ContributorFormer Obama White House senior economic advisor; Georgetown U...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-rediscover-their-true-progressive-roots_us_59773a3ee4b01cf1c4bb7342,The party's new economic plan is a thinly-veiled return to the party's early 20th century progressive roots.,2017-07-31,"Democratic lawmakers huddle together in a coffee shop before unveiling their party's ""A Better Deal"" for working Americans in Berryville, Virginia, U.S., July 24, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f53071500007d208b456d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past few decades, Democrats have done little to prevent entrenched corporations from monopolizing the U.S. economy, one of the largest drivers of economic inequality, and at the same time, have been too reticent to defend the new and independent businesses that drive job creation. However, last week, Democratic congressional leadership tapped into the party’s rich legacy of progressive capitalism through the release of its new economic plan — “A Better Deal” — a thinly-veiled return to the party’s early 20th century progressive roots. This approach has the potential to plant the seeds for a retro-reboot that Democrats desperately need.The blueprint highlights a new Democratic commitment to “ensure start-ups and small business can compete and prosper” and “crack down on monopolies and the concentration of economic power.” It harkens back to an earlier age of Democratic politics — for example, the Democratic Party Platform in 1940 — which emphasized the importance of “new enterprises in our national economy” giving the “ordinary citizen a chance to go into business and stay in business,” and attacked the “unbridled concentration of economic power” via “the extortionate methods of monopoly.”Rather than Big Oil and Big Steel, though, presumably Democrats will now begin calling to task the new monopolists dominating their industries — for starters, the big four airlines, half a dozen major banks, and yes, America’s tech giants with strong Democratic ties like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The Party appears to finally be waking to the hard realities that it’s never been more difficult to be an entrepreneur in an America increasingly dominated by large corporate oligopolies, a major contributing cause to lower rates of investment in American communities and depressed workers’ wages.We are simply not creating enough new businesses in the U.S., and those that are being created, are found in a smaller and smaller number of urban centers. The net result is unprecedented levels of geographic inequality, dividing the coastal, cosmopolitan powerhouses and our industrial and Rural heartlands into two different countries. It explains why years after the Great Recession’s official end, a majority of Americans still feel that their local communities are in a recession.A modernized FDR-style agenda would focus on the following priorities: (1) increasing public and private sector investment in more communities; (2) limiting the public sector’s regulations on new businesses; (3) scrutinizing industry barons to prevent potential monopolies from exerting too much economic power; and (4) putting people to work immediately through a national infrastructure and job training program. However, for it to really take root today, and not merely serve as more empty rhetoric, Democrats must also be prepared to set aside long standing, Democratic dogma:Stop blaming globalization and technology for U.S. economic challenges. Globalization and technology are inevitable forces, largely beneficial to Americans, who enjoy cheap goods, open markets, international peace, and modern conveniences. While these forces have enacted serious costs on certain industries, workers, and communities, solutions must be targeted, local, and inclusive of the private sector. However, even a bold new agenda is not enough. Teddy Roosevelt, the original progressive Trust Buster, understood that “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” Democrats now have the burden of demonstrating they understand that national economic growth since the recession has not lifted all boats and that for many communities the American Dream is even further away.Democrats should get out of Washington and localize their new agenda, making clear that their focus is on empowering local communities by giving them the tools to decide their own economic destiny. What works for California or New York may not work in Michigan or Ohio ... or, even more so, in Rural America. That will require spending far more time in smaller cities with local entrepreneurs and innovators, as well as young elected leaders, like those in The NewDEAL, who are building America’s economic ecosystems from the ground up.A new chapter of Democratic leadership is desperately needed in America, and a real progressive agenda could unite the party, and win over the country. It’s no coincidence that FDR’s Greatest Generation made up the Party’s most loyal voters for decades, ensuring fifty years of nearly unbroken Democratic control of Congress."

The House of Representatives has passed an overhaul but the Senate has been unable to do so despite having worked on it for months. Three Senate Republicans joined Democrats in voting against repealing even part of the law at the end of last week.“Don’t give up Republican senators, the world is watching: Repeal & Replace ...,” Trump tweeted on Sunday while White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the Senate should stay in session to get something done on healthcare, even if it means postponing votes on other issues.Hatch said although he understood Mulvaney’s position, he did not think he was right. The senator said he saw no real desire on the part of Democrats to work together on the healthcare issue “and I have to say some Republicans are at fault there, too.”Hatch said he had not given up on healthcare. “I think we ought to acknowledge that we can come back to healthcare afterwards but we need to move ahead on tax reform,” Hatch said.Asked who would relay the message to the Trump administration, Hatch laughed and said, “I’m going to be one who does that,” adding that he expected Republican leaders of the House and Senate, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, would do so, too.Hatch said lawmakers would need to appropriate the cost-sharing subsidy payments that the administration has been making. Trump has threatened to cut off these subsidies, which help insurers keep deductibles down for low-income people who get health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.“I’m for helping the poor, always have been. And I don’t think they should be bereft of healthcare,“Hatch said.(additional reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Bill Trott)"

One bit of Valyrian steel keeps cropping up around “Game of Thrones” this season: the dagger used in the attempt on Bran’s (Isaac Hempstead Wright) life in Season 1.Let’s quickly recap: After being pushed out of a window, the young Stark was attacked in his recovery bed by a hired assassin who ends up getting mauled by Bran’s direwolf, Summer (RIP). His mother, Catelyn (Michelle Fairley), then takes the distinctive blade to her husband at King’s Landing, where Littlefinger (Aiden Gillen) claims it originally belonged to him but that he lost it in a bet with Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). Thing is, honesty is the last quality Littlefinger is known for.With a black tapered handle and blood-red stone topping off a curved blade, the dagger ― sometimes called “catspaw” for its association with the assassin ― is a fairly wicked-looking instrument.And the foreshadowing is strong with this one: HBO Nordic featured the weapon in a cheeky teaser for Season 7 alongside the words “be prepared” on its Facebook page. It was also featured prominently on Arya’s (Maisie Williams) hip in Season 7 promotional images for Entertainment Weekly, suggesting it’ll end up in her care. But last we know, the dagger was still in the possession of Littlefinger. And in the Episode 4 trailer, we see what appear to be his hands unsheathing the blade. (Catch the full trailer above.)Although the shot is dark, the rings appear to be the ones Littlefinger is shown wearing earlier in the series. The sleeve styling appears similar to that favored by Littlefinger, too.If the blade changes hands, some fans wonder whether that might spell the end for Littlefinger, whose betrayal of Ned Stark (Sean Bean) in Season 1 isn’t widely known at the moment.There are a few good reasons to believe his time is now running out. Even though his knights saved the day during the Battle of the Bastards, Sansa (Sophie Turner) clearly doesn’t have much love for Littlefinger after the whole Ramsay thing. Bran has also returned to Winterfell with his newfound ability to see into the past and present, worldwide, making it pretty clear that he’s been doing some off-camera exploring. If he discovers Littlefinger’s past scheming, he could pass on that knowledge to his assassin sister Arya, who may make her return in Episode 4. (It sure looks like Arya is looking out onto Winterfell from horseback at the end of the teaser.) Another detail in the show suggests the dagger will do some damage: It shows up in a book Sam was reading at the Citadel in the Season 7 premiere. As Samwell Tarly actor John Bradley told HuffPost earlier this month, viewers are meant to notice it ― he was told to linger on that page during the shoot. Aside from its obvious power to enact vengeance, the dagger might also prove useful in the war to come. Valyrian steel is one of few things that can kill White Walkers, which we observed when Jon (Kit Harington) killed a Walker with his Valyrian sword, Longclaw. (Dragonglass also gets the job done.) We like the idea of Arya having some at her side, just like her big brother ― er, cousin. Aww.“Game of Thrones” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and HBO Now."

America really should stand for more than that.”Shaub, a longtime government lawyer who served as the OGE chief under former President Barack Obama, left his position after months of clashing with Trump and his administration over possible ethics violations. Trump frequently hosting political leaders and lobbyists at his international hotel chain is just one example of the White House’s unprecedented disregard for government ethics and transparency, Shaub has argued. “It’s wildly inappropriate for him to be running a hotel that he’s leasing from the federal government,” said Shaub, who currently serves as the senior director of ethics for the nonprofit Campaign Legal Centers. “As a president, you shouldn’t be doing business with the United States government. He’s his own landlord at this point.”Trump broke decades of ethics norms when he announced in January that he would not divest from his businesses during his time in office. Instead, he claimed that conflict-of-interest laws and constitutional provisions don’t apply to him. He placed his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, at the helm of his multibillion-dollar organization.“I think our brand is the hottest it has ever been,” Eric Trump told The New York Times in March.Trump, who has visited his own properties at least 57 of the 193 days he’s been in office, according to The Washington Post, is “undermining” the integrity of the government, Shaub said.“We’re running around the world trying to promote anti-corruption measures and we don’t even have our own house in order,” Shaub said. “So it’s an embarrassment.”Read The Guardian’s full interview with Shaub here."

He said people began eating caviar this way in order to test out what they were buying before they purchased a tin of caviar. “If you eat something off of your hand, your brain automatically says that there is no flavor profile or texture coming off the back of your hand,” Knierim said. “But if you eat something off a spoon, your brain tells you that a spoon has a taste and a texture to it. “But [people] realized there was bacteria being passed along by the palm of the hand, but the back of the hand was the purest form, because they could actually put caviar on the back of the hand and not pass disease along from one person to the next,” he said. “They would actually taste the caviar off the back and if they liked it, they would take that tin.

But it’s taken other people a little longer to catch on. “There are more people learning to enjoy caviar off the back of their hand versus putting it on a blini with egg and all the other accoutrements,” he said. “Most times in restaurants people are going to put it on a toast point or a blini because of decorum.”  Even though it might look foolish to eat caviar like this, it actually helps get a “cleaner flavor” of the caviar, according to Knierim.

In honor of Black Women’s Equal Pay Day on Monday, the day the average black woman’s pay finally catches up to the average white man’s pay from the previous year, Williams wrote a moving a piece for Fortune in which she not only gets personal about her own experiences being paid less than the white men and women in her field but also identifies ways to help close the wide wage gap for all women of color.“I’d like to acknowledge the many realities black women face every day,” she wrote in the piece published Monday. “To recognize that women of color have to work — on average — eight months longer to earn the same as their male counterparts do in one year. To bring attention to the fact that black women earn 17 percent less than their white female counterparts and that black women are paid 63 percent of the dollar men are paid.” Williams wrote about her own experiences with inequity and discrimination over the years ― as well as how they motivated her to push for change and no longer stay silent about injustices like sexism and racism. “Growing up, I was told I couldn’t accomplish my dreams because I was a woman and, more so, because of the color of my skin,” she wrote. “In every stage of my life, I’ve had to learn to stand up for myself and speak out. I have been treated unfairly, I’ve been disrespected by my male colleagues and — in the most painful times — I’ve been the subject of racist remarks on and off the tennis court.”“Luckily, I am blessed with an inner drive and a support system of family and friends that encourage me to move forward,” she added. “But these injustices still hurt.” Williams has spoken previously about her experiences with the wage gap, especially as a woman in professional sports, and her will to continue to help bring about positive changes for women everywhere. However, she also reckons with the unique challenges black women face in America and is actively using her platform to help ensure that they matter, too. “Through decades of systematic oppression, black women have been conditioned to think they are less than,” she wrote. “Changing the status quo will take dedicated action, legislation, employer recognition, and courage for employees to demand more....an injustice to one is an injustice to all.”As a way help raise more awareness and action around the wage gap, Williams said she joined Survey Monkey’s board of directors to help address the issues of inequity in the workplace ― starting with pay. And in honor of Monday’s commemoration of Black Women’s Equal Pay Day, she partnered with the company to release key findings from surveys the company conducted around black womens’ wages in the workplace, which they released on Monday. One outcome showed that 69 percent of black women perceive a pay gap, while just 44 percent of white men recognize the issue.“Unfair pay has prevailed for far too long with no consequence,” Williams wrote. “Black women: Be fearless. Speak out for equal pay. Every time you do, you’re making it a little easier for a woman behind you. Most of all, know that you’re worth it.” "
36,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders To Propose New Rule Requiring Fair Prices For Taxpayer-Funded Drugs,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-drug-prices_us_597f4546e4b0da64e87aaebf,The bill is the latest move in the Vermont senator's fight with Big Pharma over the patent for a Zika vaccine.,2017-07-31,"This photo shows an infant girl in Brazil born with an undersized skull and under-developed brain due to microcephaly, a rare birth defect caused by the Zika virus.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f46e815000021008b4540.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) plans to propose a new rule Monday that would require pharmaceutical companies to charge fair prices for drugs developed with taxpayer-backed research, he told HuffPost.The rule, introduced as an amendment to the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, would force federal agencies and federally funded nonprofits, such as research universities, to secure a reasonable pricing agreement from a manufacturer before granting it exclusive rights to make drugs, vaccines or other health care products.The bill is Sanders’ latest attempt to stop the Department of Defense from awarding drugmaker Sanofi Pasteur an exclusive license to produce a Zika vaccine developed over the past year by the U.S. Army. The mosquito-borne virus is sexually transmitted and causes devastating birth defects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 181 cases in U.S. states this year alone, with another 532 reported in U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.“The days of allowing Sanofi and other drug makers to gouge American consumers after taking billions in taxpayer money must end,” Sanders told HuffPost. “That is why I am introducing legislation to demand fairer, lower prices for the Zika vaccine and for every drug developed with government resources. This is a fight that we cannot afford to lose.”The Army granted Sanofi $43 million to conduct a second phase of trials on the vaccine, and, if successful, promised another $130 million to conduct a third phase. Yet the French pharmaceutical giant has refused to agree to sell the drug back to taxpayers at a fair price, despite demanding a patent that would prevent other drugmakers from competing to manufacture the vaccine at a lower cost. (Sanofi denied rejecting the Army’s request in a series of letters to senators this month.)“That is simply unacceptable,” Sanders said of the company’s refusal. “Sanofi and the rest of the pharmaceutical industry cannot be allowed to make huge profits on the backs of working class Americans, many of whom cannot afford the medication they are prescribed.”Sanofi’s history of charging more for its products in the U.S. makes that troubling. The company’s multiple sclerosis drug Aubagio costs eight times more in the U.S. than in France and the United Kingdom, according to Knowledge Ecology International, a Washington-based watchdog group. Diabetic patients sued Sanofi and two other drugmakers in January for jacking up the cost of insulin.Cash-strapped states most at risk from Zika, including Louisiana, have called on the Army to withhold a patent until Sanofi agrees to affordable pricing, warning that a major outbreak of the virus could cripple their budgets.Sanofi, meanwhile, raked in $10.2 billion in sales from April through June, according to quarterly earnings announced hours before Sanders introduced his bill. A company spokeswoman reached by HuffPost could not immediately comment on the legislation.Sanders, who unsuccessfully pushed a similar fair drug pricing bill 20 years ago, has been a vocal opponent of the Army’s arrangement with Sanofi. In March, he thrust the deal into the national spotlight with an op-ed in The New York Times, calling on President Donald Trump to fulfill his pledge to “make only the best deals on behalf of the American people” by securing price protections for the Zika vaccine.The deal has drawn the ire of other lawmakers. On Monday, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) announced companion legislation to Sanders’ bill in the House, his spokeswoman told HuffPost. Earlier this month, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) had added language to the defense bill directing the Defense Department to break pricing monopolies when the cost of a taxpayer-funded drug is higher than the median price charged in countries with at least half the per capita income of the U.S. Based on 2016 figures, that would apply to Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada and Australia. The Senate Armed Services Committee unanimously approved the directive.Last Wednesday, Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) introduced a similar amendment in the Department of Health and Human Services spending bill making its way through the House of Representatives.Sanders’ bill faces dim prospects of becoming law. The deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry has cultivated powerful allies in both parties, despite Democrats’ recently released platform taking aim at drug prices. In January, 13 Democrats joined 39 Republicans to vote down a bill designed to lower prescription drug prices. Among them was Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a rising star in the party with potential 2020 presidential ambitions, who said during an NPR interview last month that he put a “pause” on fundraising from drug companies because “it arouses so much criticism.” (He later joined onto a joint effort with Sanders to support the import of lower-cost prescription drugs from overseas.)The bill seems unlikely to find support in the White House, despite Trump’s campaign trail promises to crack down on drug pricing. Rather than pushing for legislation, the administration is weighing an executive order that would strengthen monopoly rights for pharmaceutical companies overseas, eliminate discounts for low-income hospitals and speed up drug approvals by the Food and Drug Administration, Kaiser Health News reported in June. Bloomberg Gadfly’s health industry columnist described the order as being “more like a pharma wish list than a menu of onerous demands.”Plus, no president since George H.W. Bush has intervened to lower prices on government-backed drugs. Still, Sanders’ bill sets the stage for a larger debate over drug pricing, particularly because it targets federal agencies as well as nonprofits funded by federal grants. If such a law were in place, the government would have more power to regulate major new technologies like CRISPR, the gene-engineering technique that, according to reports this month, has been used to edit a human embryo. “This is a really big deal,” Jamie Love, the director of KEI, told HuffPost on Monday morning. “This means that the public, who pays for the research and development of a number of drugs, vaccines and other medical technologies, will pay lower prices for inventions that they subsidized.”This article was updated to include DeFazio’s bill.

Ben Ray Luján.",2017-07-31,Rep. Ben Ray Luján speaks in Washington D.C. in June 2016. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597f6d69210000a31afc973d.jpeg?cache=qyVtgxeBKV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has angered progressives for pledging to support anti-choice democratic candidates. “There is not a litmus test for Democratic candidates,” Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) said in an interview with the Hill. “As we look at candidates across the country, you need to make sure you have candidates that fit the district, that can win in these districts across America.” Luján emphasized that the DCCC’s major focus is to get more Democrats in office ― and if that comes at the cost of candidates with anti-choice agendas, so be it.“To pick up 24 [seats] and get to 218, that is the job,” he said. “We’ll need a broad coalition to get that done ... We are going to need all of that, we have to be a big family in order to win the House back.”According to the Hill, the DCCC will continue to fund candidates who oppose abortion. Luján’s comments echoed those of some of his fellow Democratic party leaders.Back in May, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said that the Democratic party should welcome candidates who oppose abortion rights.“I grew up in ... a very devout Catholic family, fiercely patriotic, proud of our town and heritage, and staunchly Democratic,” she told the Washington Post. “Most of those people — my family, extended family — are not pro-choice. You think I’m kicking them out of the Democratic Party?” Pelosi’s comments came shortly after former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and DNC chair Tom Perez backed then-mayoral candidate Heath Mello in spite of Mello’s anti-choice legislative background ― their comments and support of centrist candidate sparked rage in many on the left, and the sentiment continues to do so. NARAL Pro-Choice America national campaigns director Mitchell Stille said that the DCCC’s most recent comments about supporting anti-choice candidates show a major weakness in the organization.“Throwing weight behind anti-choice candidates is bad politics that will lead to worse policy,” Stille said. “Economic security isn’t possible without reproductive freedom. Gender equality isn’t possible without reproductive freedom. Families of all political leanings understand that ― it’s time people in ‘this town’ caught up.”Planned Parenthood had a similar respons, telling HuffPost that economic equality cannot happen without access to reproductive health care. “Let’s be clear: Supporting reproductive rights, including abortion, is central to expanding economic opportunity to all Americans,” a spokesperson for the organization said. “As a nonpartisan organization, Planned Parenthood will hold any political party, any candidate for public office, and any elected official accountable for not standing up for reproductive rights.”This article has been updated to include comment from Planned Parenthood.

Genres and artists that don’t generally make appearances in these playlists show up in force. In the list below, we’ll recap the obvious hits and leftfield picks alike.Rap tracks generally meet with mixed success in the gym—as their lower tempos make them great for strength routines but ill-suited to cardio. Given this divided audience, they don’t often garner enough votes to crack the monthly top 10 list—but featuring French Montana, Lil Wayne, and Big Sean prove to be exceptions this time around. Equally unlikely are inclusions from Shania Twain (who hadn’t released an album in 15 years) and James Blunt (who’s best known as a balladeer)--yet both turn up.In with these unlikely favorites, you’ll find a Spanish language collaboration between Jennifer Lopez and Gente de Zona, a new single from The Killers, and a remix from Imagine Dragons.

Executive producer Matt Warburton was also on hand to let fans know what to expect from Kaling’s character. “I think she’s going to learn a little bit more about how to be a good, involved parent,” Warburton said, according to People. “We have a really funny episode where Julie Bowen plays a rival mother who thinks that Mindy’s not doing that great of a job.”Added Kaling, ″[It’s] a little bit about mom-shaming and that’s cool. [A] lot those juicy ripped-from-the-blogger-headline story lines.”“The Mindy Project” has tackled hot-button topics around motherhood in the past. In one 2015 episode, Kaling’s character contemplates not going back to work after maternity leave and gets shamed for breastfeeding in public. The show’s star made headlines earlier this month with the news that she is reportedly expecting her first child. Though Kaling has yet to comment on the reports, her “A Wrinkle in Time” co-star Oprah Winfrey said the actress shared the news with her at Disney’s D23 expo this month.“My mouth dropped,” Winfrey told People. ”‘What did you just say?’ she said, ‘Oh, Oprah, I don’t think you know.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597de520210000a134fc94b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CARACAS/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela, July 30, (Reuters) - P rotesters clashed with security forces on Sunday as Venezuelans broadly boycotted an election for a constitutional super-body that unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro vowed would begin a “new era of combat” in the crisis-stricken nation.Maduro, widely disliked for overseeing an economic collapse during four years in office, has pressed ahead with the vote to create the all-powerful assembly despite the threat of U.S. sanctions and months of opposition protests in which more than 115 people have been killed.Critics say the assembly will allow Maduro to dissolve the opposition-run Congress, delay future elections and rewrite electoral rules to prevent the socialists from being voted out of power in the once-thriving OPEC nation.Opposition parties are sitting out what they call a rigged election, leaving streets deserted and polling stations largely empty and dealing a blow to the legitimacy of the vote.Anti-Maduro activists erected barricades on roads around the South American country and scuffles broke out with security forces who moved in quickly to disperse hooded demonstrators. In what could be the spread of deadlier tactics, a bomb exploded in Caracas and injured a group of police officers.The opposition has vowed to redouble its resistance and U.S. President Donald Trump has promised broader economic sanctions against Venezuela after the vote, suggesting the oil-rich nation’s crisis is set to escalate.“Even if they win today, this won’t last long,” said opposition supporter Berta Hernandez, a 60-year-old doctor, in a wealthier Caracas district. “I’ll continue on the streets because, not long from now, this will come to an end.”Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader narrowly elected in 2013, has accused right-wing governments of trying to sabotage “21st century Socialism.”“The ‘emperor’ Donald Trump wanted to halt the Venezuelan people’s right to vote,” said Maduro, as he rapidly voted at 6 a.m. in a low-income area of the capital Caracas that has turned on the government.“A new era of combat will begin. We’re going all out with this constituent assembly,” he added.But with polls showing some 70 percent of Venezuelans oppose the vote, the country’s 2.8 million state employees are under huge pressure to participate ― with some two dozen sources telling Reuters they were being threatened with dismissal.The opposition said participation was at a paltry 7 percent by mid-afternoon.‘SLAP MADURO’Fueling anger against Maduro is an unprecedented economic meltdown in the country of some 30 million people, which was once a magnet for European migrants thanks to an oil boom that was the envy of Latin America.But after nearly two decades of Socialist Party rule, currency and price controls have asphyxiated businesses.Millions of Venezuelans now struggle to eat three times a day due to product shortages and runaway inflation that has put basics like rice or flour out of reach.“Sometimes I take bread from my mouth and give it to my two kids,” said pharmacy employee Trina Sanchez, 28, as she waited for a bus to work. “This is a farce. I want to slap Maduro.”To show the massive scale of public anger, the opposition earlier this month organized an unofficial referendum over Maduro’s plan.A strong turnout of more than 7 million voters overwhelmingly rejected the constituent assembly and voted in favor of early elections.But democratic pathways to political change have been systematically blocked. The opposition’s bid last year to hold a recall referendum against Maduro was nixed, regional elections have been postponed and the president has repeatedly ignored Congress.As global condemnation mounted, the United States last week sanctioned 13 Socialist Party leaders, in part as a response to the election, and neighboring Colombia has said it will not recognize the results of Sunday’s vote.BOMB BLASTIn Sunday’s gravest incident, a bomb went off as a group of police officers on motorbikes sped past Caracas’ Altamira Plaza, an opposition stronghold. Several officers suffered burn injuries, according to a Reuters witness.Clashes were also reported in the volatile Andean state of Tachira, where witnesses told Reuters an unidentified group of men had showed up at two separate street protests and shot at demonstrators.Authorities confirmed six deaths over the weekend, including the killing of a candidate to the assembly during a robbery, although opposition lawmakers said the toll was higher.The candidate, Felix Pineda, 39, was shot dead during a robbery at his home on Saturday night in the jungle state of Bolivar, the state prosecutor’s office said. Bolivar’s Socialist Party governor, Francisco Rangel, said the death was a “political hit job” and blamed it on the opposition.Supporters of “Chavismo,” the movement founded by late leader Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s more charismatic predecessor who enjoyed high oil prices for much of his mandate, said they wanted to halt the unrest.“The (opposition) wants deaths and roadblocks and the government wants peace,” said Olga Blanco, 50, voting for candidates to the assembly at a school in Caracas.The assembly is due to sit within 72 hours of results being certified, with government loyalists such as powerful Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello and Maduro’s wife and son expected to win seats.“We have decided to be free, nothing else matters,” said Cabello, who could be the next assembly president amid rumors of power struggles within the ruling party.

We’re going all out with this constituent assembly,” he added.But with polls showing some 70 percent of Venezuelans oppose the vote, the country’s 2.8 million state employees are under huge pressure to participate ― with some two dozen sources telling Reuters they were being threatened with dismissal.The opposition said participation was at a paltry 7 percent by mid-afternoon.‘SLAP MADURO’Fueling anger against Maduro is an unprecedented economic meltdown in the country of some 30 million people, which was once a magnet for European migrants thanks to an oil boom that was the envy of Latin America.But after nearly two decades of Socialist Party rule, currency and price controls have asphyxiated businesses.Millions of Venezuelans now struggle to eat three times a day due to product shortages and runaway inflation that has put basics like rice or flour out of reach.“Sometimes I take bread from my mouth and give it to my two kids,” said pharmacy employee Trina Sanchez, 28, as she waited for a bus to work. “This is a farce. I want to slap Maduro.”To show the massive scale of public anger, the opposition earlier this month organized an unofficial referendum over Maduro’s plan.A strong turnout of more than 7 million voters overwhelmingly rejected the constituent assembly and voted in favor of early elections.But democratic pathways to political change have been systematically blocked. The opposition’s bid last year to hold a recall referendum against Maduro was nixed, regional elections have been postponed and the president has repeatedly ignored Congress.As global condemnation mounted, the United States last week sanctioned 13 Socialist Party leaders, in part as a response to the election, and neighboring Colombia has said it will not recognize the results of Sunday’s vote.BOMB BLASTIn Sunday’s gravest incident, a bomb went off as a group of police officers on motorbikes sped past Caracas’ Altamira Plaza, an opposition stronghold. Several officers suffered burn injuries, according to a Reuters witness.Clashes were also reported in the volatile Andean state of Tachira, where witnesses told Reuters an unidentified group of men had showed up at two separate street protests and shot at demonstrators.Authorities confirmed six deaths over the weekend, including the killing of a candidate to the assembly during a robbery, although opposition lawmakers said the toll was higher.The candidate, Felix Pineda, 39, was shot dead during a robbery at his home on Saturday night in the jungle state of Bolivar, the state prosecutor’s office said. Bolivar’s Socialist Party governor, Francisco Rangel, said the death was a “political hit job” and blamed it on the opposition.Supporters of “Chavismo,” the movement founded by late leader Hugo Chavez, Maduro’s more charismatic predecessor who enjoyed high oil prices for much of his mandate, said they wanted to halt the unrest.“The (opposition) wants deaths and roadblocks and the government wants peace,” said Olga Blanco, 50, voting for candidates to the assembly at a school in Caracas.The assembly is due to sit within 72 hours of results being certified, with government loyalists such as powerful Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello and Maduro’s wife and son expected to win seats.“We have decided to be free, nothing else matters,” said Cabello, who could be the next assembly president amid rumors of power struggles within the ruling party.

49,POLITICS,Let’s Wish Medicare And Medicaid A Happy Birthday By Fighting To Protect And Expand Them,"Nancy Altman and Linda Benesch, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lets-wish-medicare-and-medicaid-a-happy-birthday-by_us_597de421e4b09982b737657d,"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. Fifty-two years later, both programs stand",2017-07-30,<p>President Lyndon B. Johnson signs Medicare and Medicaid into law.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597de6d015000029008b4342.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. Fifty-two years later, both programs stand as shining examples of government at its best. Over the last half-century, Medicare and Medicaid have efficiently provided access to high quality, affordable health care to seniors, people with disabilities and others who qualify.Our nation should, at long last, build on these successful programs by expanding their coverage and benefits. We should ensure that every American, from cradle to grave, has access to high quality, affordable health care as a matter of right.Outrageously, while we fight for universal health insurance, we are in danger of losing the foothold towards the goal of universality that these two vital programs have provided. Republicans in Congress and the White House think that the best way to wish Medicare and Medicaid “happy birthday” is to kill both programs. It is clear that their recent failed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and destroy Medicaid in the process has not ended their quest to take health care away from millions of Americans so that private, for-profit insurance companies and their multi-millionaire CEOs can get even richer.Conservatives have opposed the concept behind Medicare and Medicaid since long before they existed. President Franklin D. Roosevelt initially intended to include universal, government-provided health insurance in the Social Security Act of 1935. But the forerunners of today’s Republicans were vehemently opposed, so he was forced to abandon the idea to save the rest of the bill. His successor, Harry Truman, took up the mantle and made a valiant effort to pass universal health care. Truman, too, was blocked by right-wing politicians and corporations.Lyndon Johnson, a pragmatic and shrewd politician, was not going to let the same thing happen to his own health care proposal. He and his allies decided that it was best to start incrementally — to focus on seniors and low-income Americans, where the need was greatest. Johnson’s intention was always for these programs to be a starting point that could be expanded until every American had affordable, high quality health care.Unfortunately, soon after those landmark accomplishments, American politics took a rightward, anti-government turn. Richard Nixon did expand Medicare to cover Americans with disabilities, but after that, progress stalled for decades. That changed in the Obama administration, when Democrats expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. Finally, Johnson’s vision was moving closer to reality.But Republican backlash was swift and brutal. Despite the harm inflicted on millions of their own people, over a dozen GOP led states turned their back on federal dollars and refused to expand Medicaid. Denying Medicaid expansion wasn’t enough for the Republicans, though. Donald Trump ran on promises to protect Medicare and Medicaid, along with Social Security, but those are proving to be just more Trump lies. Now that the GOP has control of Congress and the White House, they are determined to end Medicare and Medicaid entirely.Their first attack on Medicaid was Trumpcare, the so-called “health care” bill that was actually just a plan to take people’s health care away to fund tax breaks for the wealthy. While often misleadingly described as an “Obamacare repeal bill,” Trumpcare’s cuts to Medicaid didn’t just end the program’s expansion. It cut overall funds for the program so deeply and so radically changed the program’s structure, that Medicaid as we know it would have been destroyed. The goal was to use the cover of repealing and replacing Obamacare to also repeal and replace the Medicaid portion of Lyndon Johnsoncare!Fortunately, the American people rose up in massive protest against Trumpcare, and thankfully, it has now been defeated in several iterations — although we must remain vigilant, for this Zombie destroyer-of-health-care has risen from the dead over and over. Furthermore, a second plan for massive cuts to both Medicare and Medicaid is already on the horizon, in the form of the House Republican budget.That plan would slash Medicare by $487 billion and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion. It raises the Medicare retirement age, the exact opposite of what we should be doing as Americans in their early sixties face crippling health care costs. Even worse, it ends the program entirely by privatizing it so that seniors would get an inadequate voucher and be forced to purchase insurance on the private market. A program called “Medicare” would still exist, but it would bear no resemblance to today’s guaranteed benefit.The good news is that the Trumpcare fight has shown the power of the Resistance. Despite control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republicans lacked the political muscle to pass their bill destroying Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. As long as the American people stay watchful and engaged, all of us, together, will be able to beat back future attacks on Medicare and Medicaid as well.At the same time that we continue to resist, we should also push for our competing vision. Medicare was intended to be simply the first step toward Medicare for All. Half a century ago, we took the first and hardest step — covering seniors and people with disabilities, the people with the highest average medical costs. It is well past time to lower the Medicare age until everyone is covered.Democrats should honor their party’s legacy, and fight to protect and expand Medicare, as they have successfully expanded Medicaid through the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, and protected it through the defeat of Trumpcare. If they carry that banner loudly, proudly, and collectively going forward, voters in 2018 will see which Party is fighting for them, and which Party is fighting for their donors, which Party understands that health care should be a right, and which Party thinks it is a privilege for those wealthy enough to afford it.Democrats need to make it clear that they are the Party that will make the vision of guaranteed health care for all Americans — President Lyndon Johnson’s vision, that began the day he signed Medicare and Medicaid into law — a reality.Email your Members of Congress to tell them that now is the time to expand Medicare."
50,POLITICS,Nissan Launches Anti-Union Blitz Ahead Of Pivotal UAW Election,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nissan-launches-anti-union-blitz-ahead-of-pivotal-election-in-the-south_us_597e11d0e4b02a8434b7019d,"As the United Auto Workers seek a foothold in the region, the automaker is telling its Mississippi employees that a ""yes"" vote could jeopardize everything they have.",2017-07-30,Nissan workers will vote this week in a potentially landmark union election at a plant in Mississippi.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597e1a321a00008381dc130a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, managers at the Nissan manufacturing plant in Canton, Mississippi, pulled workers off the floor and into large group meetings. Using slides to make their case, they tried to show employees all the bad things that can happen after unionizing.“They’re telling you you’re gonna lose this, you’re gonna lose that. You may go on a strike, and if you go on a strike, you’ll be replaced by a replacement worker,” said Michael Carter, a 14-year veteran at the facility who supports the union. “It’s a lot of fear and intimidation.”These “roundtable” talks, as they’re known inside the plant, are a sign of the extraordinarily high stakes in the upcoming union election slated for this Thursday and Friday. If the United Auto Workers manage to win a majority at the Canton facility, it will give the Detroit-based union a few thousand new members and a strong toehold in the Southern auto industry. Many manufacturers have drifted to the region in recent years to take advantage of the lower wages and union-free workforces. The area has generally been difficult territory for labor organizing. In Mississippi, just 6.6 percent of workers belong to a labor union, compared with 10.7 percent nationally.At the Nissan plant, supervisors have worn “vote no” t-shirts to work in recent days, and in some cases held one-on-one talks with employees to discourage them from joining the UAW, according to workers. Videos are running on loop in the plant’s break areas, painting unions in a bad light. “It costs a lot of money to join a union!” the video asserts.The election is the culmination of a years-long campaign by the UAW. The union has enlisted civil rights and community groups in its case, as most of the plant employees are African-American. Nissan, in turn, has tried to rally Mississippi businesses against the union, and some politicians have joined them. The Japanese-based automaker has been airing anti-UAW advertisements in the local television market to reach the friends and families of workers. The state’s Republican governor, Phil Bryant, spoke out on Thursday and urged the workers to reject the union. No one disputes that the Nissan plant has been good for Canton. Since opening in 2003, the facility that now produces the Titan pickup and Murano SUV has provided some of the best-paying blue-collar jobs in an area known for low pay. For those without a college degree, it’s hard to beat a job on the factory floor in Canton. The case made by Nissan and its proxies is simple: Why spurn the town’s benefactor and create uncertainty by bringing in the UAW?“Nissan is the best thing that has happened to Mississippi in a lot of years,” said Tony Hobson, a Canton employee who plans to vote against unionizing. “It’s been life-changing. We don’t need an outside entity to come in and tell us how to live.”But for Twina Scott, a pro-union employee and mother of two, the rejoinder is just as simple: Nissan has broken promises in the past, she said, and workers like her want a mechanism to hold the company accountable. Scott points to a frozen pension plan and rising health care costs. She says she was told when she took the job that she would hit a pay rate of $25 per hour after five years. She is now at $26 per hour ― after 14 years. Carter said he was given the same timetable when he started.Scott said she is tired of hearing she should simply feel grateful to work for Nissan.“What I know is we need a voice in that plant,” said Scott, 47. “We need job security. We need our pension back. We need a safe working environment. We need a better wage, especially for the transitional workers.”The plant’s “transitional” workers are the ones who start out as temps technically employed by outside firms. The Canton facility’s reliance on a large, lesser-paid temporary workforce ― who toil right alongside the permanent employees ― bucks the image of auto plants as overflowing with high-paying, stable jobs. The two-tier system has been a source of acrimony within the plant for years, with many workers feeling that the company strategically plays the two groups off one another. The temps will not be able to cast ballots in the election. But many former temps who’ve transitioned and now collect Nissan paychecks will be voting. Those who support the UAW hope a union contract could limit the company’s use of short-term employees and lift working standards for everyone. As Scott put it, “I work right across from [a temp] every single day, and he works just as hard as I do.” Roughly four thousand employees will be allowed to vote at the factory, where the workforce totals about 6,000. The UAW needed to round up signatures of at least 30 percent of the eligible workers in order to file for an election, though unions typically don’t take that step without a strong majority. The labor group has declined to say how many workers signed union cards. A win for the UAW would redeem the union after its bitter loss at the Volkswagen auto plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 2014. Although the mission in that election was the same as in Canton ― to unionize a foreign auto “transplant” in the South ― the dynamic was quite different. While Republican politicians and conservative groups campaigned against the UAW, Volkswagen itself took a neutral position and didn’t oppose the union. The UAW still lost by a vote of 712 to 626, though it later unionized a smaller group of employees.Nissan, on the other hand, has carried out an aggressive anti-union campaign that the UAW says has crossed legal lines. The general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that serves as referee in labor disputes, has agreed with the union. Over the past two years, the board’s general counsel filed a host of what are known as unfair labor practice charges against the company, accusing managers of threatening workers with layoffs and even a plant closure if they approved the union. (It’s illegal for an employer to say workers will lose their jobs due to unionization.)Those cases have not yet been resolved. Given the atmosphere in the plant, the UAW may file more allegations of unfair labor practices before workers cast ballots, which is not uncommon in heated elections. It’s also possible the union will argue the election has been tainted by the managers’ actions, requesting that the vote be pushed back. Nissan said it anticipates the election will go forward as planned.  Rodney Francis, the plant’s human resources director, said in an interview that the company was not trying to intimidate workers. Many people in the area don’t understand everything that unionizing entails, Francis said, so Nissan wanted to make sure workers had all the facts. He denied that one-on-one meetings with managers might feel coercive.“We’re trying to give them information,” Francis said. “I can tell you I’ve been on the floor talking to technicians and supervisors, everybody ― they’re craving more information.”And yet that information comes with a distinct point of view. “We don’t think [a union] is in the best interest of our employees,” Francis acknowledged. “If you look at the track record, there’s a history of layoffs and strikes and that kind of thing. We’re communicating that.”Nissan and its allies have tried to use Detroit’s hardships as a baleful warning against organizing. Kristina Adamski, a Nissan spokeswoman, noted that she was born and raised in the union-strong Detroit area and previously worked for General Motors and Ford.The Detroit community is “not doing well because of plant closures,” she said in an interview. “We want to make sure that Canton continues to stay competitive in the global market.” (Detroit-based G.M. and Ford hit record sales in recent years, though that market has slowed in 2017.)Hobson said he has been making the same case to his colleagues who are on the fence. He even made an anti-UAW t-shirt in which the union’s acronym stands for something else: “Unemployed auto workers.”Carter, who works in the plant’s body shop, said the company seems to equate a vote for the UAW with “turning your back on Nissan.” This can be a persuasive message for someone who was making $8 an hour in a previous job, he said. “You give them $25, they think, ’I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize my $25,’” Carter said.In Carter’s estimation, that’s the wrong line of thinking.“We understand, they provide a lot of jobs,” Carter said. “But at the same time, you can’t mistreat the people in there who are helping you make a profit. We gave Nissan every chance to change and they didn’t.”"

Ball began dating the 53-year-old Scaramucci in 2011 and they are believed to have gotten married in 2014, according to the Post. They have two children together, one of whom was born prematurely this past Monday.Ball’s lawyer, Jill Stone, on Saturday confirmed the divorce story to The New York Daily News, but shot down rumors that Scaramucci’s “naked ambition” and desire to be a fixture in President Donald Trump’s administration drove a wedge between the couple.“Whoever decided to state that that was the cause, that has nothing to do with her filing for divorce,” Stone told the paper, declining to get into specifics.“It’s a private matter,” Stone said. “She’s focusing on the children. She really doesn’t have a comment at this time. She’s not going to turn this into a circus.” Ball filed for divorce on July 6 in New York’s Nassau County Supreme Court, according to a Post Page Six story on Saturday. On Monday, Ball gave birth to James Scaramucci two weeks before the child’s due date. Weighing 5 pounds, 13 ounces at birth, the boy is currently in a neonatal intensive unit, according to the paper.HuffPost reached out for comment to Ball via Facebook, to Scaramucci via Twitter and to White House press office via email. No responses have yet been received.Scaramucci, who had a previous marriage end in divorce, posted two recent tweets that seemed to refer to the reports of domestic discord with Ball. The first came a short time after the Post’s story.The second came Saturday morning.The Post said that Scaramucci had shed his wedding ring recently or was wearing it on his right hand.“Deidre is not a fan of Trump, and she hasn’t exactly been on board and supportive of Anthony and his push to get” a White House job, an anonymous source reported as close to Scaramucci told the paper.Leonard Sperber, the lawyer hired for Scaramucci’s first divorce, told the Daily News he had “no authority to comment on anything,” including whether or not he had been retained a second time.Ball’s LinkedIn profile lists her as vice president of investor relations for SkyBridge Capital, an asset management business formerly run by her husband.He sold his interest in the business this year in preparation for a job in the Trump White House. After initially serving in a post at the Export-Import Bank, he was appointed to his communications job on July 21, sparking the resignation of press secretary Sean Spicer.On Thursday, the New Yorker magazine published a profanity-laced interview with Scaramucci in which he attacked in vulgar terms then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist. Priebus resigned from his job Thursday night and on Friday Trump named as his replacement John Kelly, who had been secretary of the Homeland Security Department."

Susan Collins said that she would not be swayed by President Donald Trump’s apparent threats to pull the plug on key Obamacare funds, including subsidies for members of Congress and their staff.In a Sunday interview with Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Collins first said that even if Trump cut off Congress’ subsidies, it would not change her mind about opposing the health care repeal.Tapper then asked whether if cuts to cost sharing reduction payments, or CSRs, that the federal government provides for low-income people would affect her decision.“It would not affect my vote on health care but it’s an example of why we need to act ― to make sure that those payments, which are not an insurance company bailout, but rather help people who are very low income afford their out-of-pocket costs toward their deductibles and their co-pays,” Collins said in response.Trump tweeted on Saturday that he would end “BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress” if Congress did not act to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Although Trump did not make clear what he meant, he implied that he would withhold CSRs, which the federal government provides insurers to subsidize the coverage of people with incomes under 250 percent of the poverty level who buy plans on the Obamacare insurance exchanges. He also appeared to threaten the funding that the federal government uses to subsidize the cost of coverage for members of Congress and their staff, who are required to purchase the insurance of the Washington, D.C, Obamacare exchange.Instead, Collins said she favors developing multiple pieces of legislation in the relevant Senate committees to address Obamacare’s flaws, noting that the Obamacare exchanges are “collapsing” in some areas.Collins received a spontaneous round of applause at the airport in Bangor, Maine, on Friday from constituents pleased that she opposed the Obamacare repeal. Collins told CNN’s Tapper on Sunday that the warm reception was “encouraging and affirming.”Collins resisted virtually every iteration of repeal that the Senate considered in recent months. Early Friday morning, she joined fellow Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and John McCain (Ariz.) in voting down the so-called “skinny” repeal bill, which would have eliminated Obamacare’s individual insurance mandate and the requirement that large companies provide insurance to their employees.Collins’ steadfastness has not discouraged the president or senior Trump administration officials from threatening to torpedo the exchanges through moves like cutting off the CSRs.Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, suggested in an interview on “Fox News Sunday” that Trump was seriously considering halting the payments.“He’s going to make that decision this week and that’s a decision that only he can make,” she said to host Chris Wallace.Also on Sunday, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney affirmed that it was official White House policy that Congress should not enact any new legislation, including a raise of the debt ceiling, until Congress repeals Obamacare. He did not explicitly say whether that meant that the White House would not sign any such legislation.“Go and poll the American public and find out what the most important issue is to them right now, and it’s health care,” Mulvaney said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union. “So, in the White House’s view, they can’t move on in the Senate.”"

He then asked her to clarify whether she would answer to Kelly, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general who previously helmed the Department of Homeland Security for Trump.“I will do whatever the president and our new chief of staff, Gen. Kelly, will ask me to do,” Conway replied.“I’m always a protocol-and-pecking-order kind of gal,” Conway added. “I’m a very deferential person. I never addressed the president, even when he was a candidate ― as close as we are, as boss and employee, I’ve never addressed him by his first name. I always address people like Gen. Kelly as sir.”Wallace pressed her on the matter, asking again if that meant Conway has been told to report to Kelly going forward.“I will speak with Gen. Kelly and the president about that as, I’m sure, Anthony Scaramucci will,” she said, referring to the controversial new White House communications director.Trump announced Kelly’s selection on Friday afternoon, following Reince Priebus’ resignation as chief of staff. The embattled Priebus left after Scaramucci had been lambasting him in the press, suggesting Priebus was responsible for leaks of sensitive information to journalists. Scaramucci, in a profanity-laced New Yorker magazine interview published Thursday, also labeled Priebus, the former head of the Republican National Committee a “paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.”Critics have attributed the dysfunction at the White House to Trump’s freewheeling management style in which many top aides enjoy direct access to him. Priebus, for example, was undercut by the considerable influence of chief strategist Steve Bannon and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. In a subsequent interview on “Fox News Sunday,” Wallace asked House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) whether Kelly’s appointment would restore discipline to the White House.“I hope so,” Pelosi said.Pelosi said she planned to meet with Kelly later in the day and had worked with him while he was secretary of Homeland Security. She alluded to the confusion that has surrounded the chain of command in the West Wing.“It’s a very important position: the chief of staff to the president of the United States. And it has to be recognized that he is the chief of staff,” she said."

It’s a troublesome creek—but we were a troublesome family.Grandpa, grandpa, my kids shout at me, tugging at my shirt. At the creek, I play a game with my grandkids: What’s that? Burdock. What’s that? Chickory! Let’s make some coffee. What’s that? Wine berries. Elder. Plantain. What’s that? Chickweed. Ah, the jewel of our green salad, so rich in vitamin C that the pioneers ate it to ward off scurvy. Another gift from the native people.And then, there was our water, the creek: a-ma a-wa-ya.What a wonder now: The native fish have returned to the creek.This all seems so beautiful tonight, just another beautiful evening, hot evening, in the serenity of this place of academia and Appalachian hollers.So, it’s hard to explain what led to the “great crisis.” You see, everyone said it would never happen. A megadrought has about the same chance of happening as the Chicago Cubs making it into the World Series, they said. It’ll never happen. The news reports about climate change came like tourists, and we just acknowledged them; tried to tolerate their inconvenience to our roads and lives, but we didn’t really pay attention. The temperatures rose. The warnings kept coming. The Paris climate summit agreed that if temperatures went beyond 1.5C or 2 degrees Celsius, we would have set in motion a chain of events from CO2 and methane emissions that we could not survive, and yet we arrived at 1.5 degrees higher in the fall of 2016, and it didn’t even make the headlines. The drought came. And we announced we could mitigate climate change—adaptation, we called it. But what if you are adapting to a failed system? And the drought lasted. And lasted. And lasted. The creek—the water. You must understand the water. You must understand our watershed. The Cherokee warned us. An elder had asked the question back in the 1980s: The question is whether we do the right thing now or wait until the expense shall have increased a hundredfold.When the fires came, there was no time to debate whether the rangers had done the right thing in conservation, whether the forests were too dense, why forest fires in Appalachia had increased by 75 percent in intensity and heat. When a fire lays waste to your home, the chatter ends, and you have two choices: You leave town, or you pick up the pieces and rebuild. And Boone was laid to waste…A crisis is never a crisis until it’s validated by disaster—and that is exactly what happened when the megadrought and fires hit Boone. It was 2017—I forget now, the year doesn’t matter. We were slightly distracted by the darkness of Sauron that had entered the White House. At first, we waited for city hall to act. I mean, come on, we elected these people, fix the world now. It’s your job, not mine. I mean, I recycled my bottles—when I remembered to load them in the car. I know it’s hard to imagine—but we didn’t have curbside recycling and composting in those days. My wife drove a Prius, and we bought organic (most of the time, well, sometimes, well, at least the first week of the month when we could afford it). But we knew we were part of the problem—that 60% of the grid, burning fossil fuels, came from coal. We didn’t pay attention to the drought, the retreating land. We were just trying to do less bad. Be sustainable, you know. That was a comforting word, disingenuous at best, as if a burning stack of wood was sustainable. We knew nothing was sustainable. My grandchildren don’t believe me when I tell them about my generation in the year 2017. They mock me. Grandpa, you burned toxic fossil fuels, even though you knew it had a huge health and environmental cost and produced the highest CO2 emissions…and you knew Germany and Scotland and Denmark already had 100% renewable energy regions? You imported 90% of your food in Boone? You couldn’t even eat the fish in your river because of mercury and other problems? Grandma said you ate asparagus imported from Chile? And tomatoes picked by the hands of a 7-year-old migrant worker in Mexico? Yes, yes yes…but we changed. Thanks to the “great crisis,” the great drought and fire. And thanks to Blue Ridge Women in Agriculture. We were standing in line for rations—you see the fire had knocked out the roads of commerce, the food stores. And these women were smiling, just beaming. They didn’t need rations. They brought boxes of food from a farm. And so did another man, and the folks from the Food Hub and the Gardens at Hospitality House, and then App State students arrived with load after load. And then, Miriam Alarcon from la tienda arrived and said, ellos tienen que comer. I will make tamales. And the Farm Café, we’ll help cook. And we’ll do it for free.And then Mary from Junaluska said: Can I get a few hands to help me with my garden. I have plenty to share.Mary smiled at the crowd. It’s time to sit down together and eat and talk about our future—as we have always done. You see, real pioneers know that there were never any rugged individualists in our parts. Land was tilled together; barns raised together; wells sunk together; all with food and drink. And everyone set a table. And the table grew. And people brought food. And a food truck arrived. And the table grew across main street, across the creek. And Boone came together at the same table, native and newcomer, rich and poor, transplants all the way from Raleigh and Rochester and Blowing Rock and Brooklyn hippies from Asheville, for a table that grew 3-miles long.And then I heard a voice: it was Laura England , the great environmental justice hero in our town, and she stood up with her glass, rang a bell, silenced the table, and said: It’s time for Boone and App State to rethink our ways in an age of climate change, to rethink ways that regenerate our energy, our food, our land, our ways of getting around--beyond sustainability, we must heal our damage to this land. We must begin the process of healing. We need to go back to our roots as a garden on the creek.Act II: The Laboratory Listen to this beautiful letter from Mrs. King to her sisters. “From this day forward, a new era will commence in the destinies of our land. We are no longer dependent upon others for our imports nor are we subjected to the labor and expense of drawing across the country all articles brought from abroad. From this day forward, blessed with this beautiful creek and forest, we shall depend upon ourselves for our livelihood.” This town—the great garden, would become self-sufficient.We lived in an agropolis in those days. A circular town with a creek, houses adjoined by gardening, ducks and dairy, surrounded by woods, surrounded by three-tier diversified farms and livestock. Agropolo—what you see in Italy today. La citta, circondata dall’agricola, allevamenti, le vacche, le pecore, poi il bosco. This is why we spend thousands of dollars and love to tour Italy-- this ancient, beautiful rapport between people, the city and nature. Oh, look, people hang out their laundry. Take a photo, Bill. Look at those buildings made from rock and stone and wood that last centuries, not dry wall years. Walking. Walking. Eating real food from the open markets. Oh, Agnes, I’ve never eaten so much food and drank so much wine—and I still lost weight.Who has a problem with that? Well, Thomas Edison and Mr. Francis Peabody the coal baron did. So did Wall Street, bankrolling their coal fired plants and factories. Keeping the dirty secret of coal mines and their burial grounds from the world. Henry Ford had a problem with it, too, and built his cars, as we took a dragline to our communities, widened the roads, built the suburbs, segregated ourselves from people who didn’t look like us, and created the Petropolis. Petro-towns. Petroleum states of mind.The circle was gone. The road became linear. We brought in our energy, we spewed out the waste, like coal ash. We brought in our food and goods, we spewed out the waste and created landfills. For every bag of grocery, we had six bags of plastic. We started cutting our grass in tidy squares and using pesticides to stamp out evil weeds. We forgot where our electricity came from; where did our water come from; where did our waste go?We lost the circular metabolism of the town---in all the cities in our country. But Boone was special. No other town has such a connection to nature as Boone. No other town on draws people from around the world for the wonder of its natural heritage. And compared to other towns, Boone had already done so much. We had already maintained a commitment to environmental protection. We had committed to going 100 % renewable. We had a legacy of environment action and sustainability. We loved these mountains, this valley of wonder, this creek. We understood the need to check uncontrolled development. But did we also lose contact with our role as part of this nature—not simply keepers of the gate, photographers of its beauty; to realize that humankind has not woven the thread of life, we are just a thread in it.Did we lose our connection to the medicinal plants, the oaks, the native foods, the creek? Of course, we weren’t the only people facing this realization. Back in the 1990s, the Germans, among others, began to rethink this linear relationship, especially with their energy. And they asked a simple question: Why don’t we produce our own energy, especially electricity? In the US, of course, there were plenty of reasons---namely, the powerful lobbies of big utilities and oil and coal companies whose profits depended on subsidized fossil fuels. Yet, the Germans, thanks to the ragtag efforts of the Greens, passed a feed-in tariff, the first seed of energy independence. The first step back to the Ecopolis. Feed-in tariff? The excess energy you produce, you can sell back to the grid. And here in North Carolina, we kinda understand this, as the utility giants made an attempt to end solar buybacks and maintain its monopoly. But the writing was already on the wall—or rooftops rather. The solar panels kept spreading, across rooftops, doctor’s offices, churches, parking lots, and the Boone Community Solar Station and Clean Energy Boone project, in a kind of decentralized revolution that couldn’t be stopped. We could finally beat Duke on our own decentralized term.We set benchmarks, that were soon written into city ordinances; that new campus and community buildings had to produce 20 then 40 % of their electricity through energy efficiency and solar; while older buildings would be retrofitted with the same.That Boone residents became a people of the sun, recognizing that the true cost of their electricity from a coal-fired or fracking gas plant had been astronomical to their lives, if we tallied all the external costs from the fallout of toxic air and the water among those just across the mountains in central Appalachia where the coal mines toppled their homes and ways into the valleys; the emergency room bills of coal ash; the drain of climate chaos on budgets that could no longer cover the fires and floods; nature’s tax on the 3rd worst contributor of CO2 and methane emissions in the nation.That the stone age didn’t end because we ran out of stones, but because we learned to live in a different way. Or as Harvard Ayers, the founder of Appalachian Voices, reminded everyone: the Energy Solution Comes Up Every Morning.So, to make the first step, we decided to create a model eco district, based on 100% renewable energy and the highest energy efficiency standards, as a living laboratory for the residents to not only envision but experience a clean energy way of living. An ordinance was passed for Net Zero Energy Building development, and two goals adopted: a requirement for on-site renewable energy, energy efficiency standards of 70 percent below the regional average EUI, built-in recycling and composting; integrated edible landscaping; and water infiltration features surrounded by food-bearing plants.We decided, as a town, to move neighborhood by neighborhood, from town to campus, from being a Petropolis to cultivating an Ecopolis.We sent an Appalachian down under. She returned: Do you know that a decade ago, Adelaide, Australia hired a “thinker in residence,” then convened the town to rethink its use of energy, food, transportation, waste and urban design, and then committed to a regenerative city, put solar panels on 120,000 households, and created the model Lochiel community, among other neighborhoods, that are 100% renewable energy? Do you know that there are hundreds of 100% renewable energy communities in Denmark and Germany, like the Vaudan district in Frieburg. Dark, dreary, cold, miserable, cold, dark, dreary Germany got 60% of its electricity from clean energy last Oct 3rd—and 65% of it came from small decentralized producers.Boone realized it had an incredible opportunity: Downtown was launched as the first EcoDistrict, as a walkable neighborhood, along the creek, with its solar-lit walking paths, solar sculptures and green infrastructure and gardens. Rain harvesting and collecting was mandatory on all buildings, saving so much money, and soon it became a national attraction.Once the car-free pedestrian zone was established, the electric tram came next to deal with the traffic. And just like the Vauban eco district in Frieburg, Germany, the residents in the Boone EcoDistrict ultimately concluded they didn’t need cars to get to campus, to work, the market, the dentist, the theatre, a restaurant, and a trail head. Within 3 years of living in Vauban, 80% of the residents gave up their cars.But it wasn’t as simple as just putting solar panels up. It needed to be a life style change. And it had to involve me.Now, I didn’t want to live in Boone’s first EcoDistrict. It was my wife. She’s like, we gotta do something about this climate change. And I’m like, can we wait until the game’s over? This is a big game. App State is in the quarter finals of March Madness. We can finally beat Duke. And she turned off the TV. Climate change ain’t no game, she said: Do you know where your electricity comes from? And I said, yeah, the plug, can you turn the frickin’ game back on? And she said, no, not until you realize your juice comes from a frickin’ utility company and while they get brownie points for solar energy credits, they mainly burn fossil fuels like coal and fracked-up gas that release global warming-inducing methane that makes CO2 emissions look like cool whip. So, no game until you get off the grid.She wasn’t done. But there’s a catch, she added. We got to use less energy—a load limit, we gotta commit to a capacity-based tariff. You gotta get rid of your electric toothbrush, your mixer, and your large screen TV. She said: This is your new batting average: 2,000 watts a day. That’s all you’re getting—a bunch of Swiss people figured it out. That’s all you can consume to keep this Titanic planet from going down. Capito? 2,000 watts.Just out of curiosity, I said, how many of them watts do I typically use now? 12, 000 watts, she said, so open the windows and start getting some fresh air and light.Of course, the EcoDistrict had to pay more to retrofit homes, build more efficient and smaller homes, commit to green roofs, solar water heaters or revamp some of the area for geothermal, and energy efficiency measures. But the savings paid off.Still, it wasn’t enough to generate our own electricity and reduce our carbon emissions. The answer wasn’t just blowing in the wind. It was also under our feet.Act III: FoodSo, we moved into the Ecopolis EcoDistrict. It required some adjustments. Energy efficiency means density, and walkable neighborhoods. We sold our car. It was like selling our dog. I saw our SUV disappear into the wide lanes near the Tangier outlet mall, getting smaller and smaller in the distance. We learned to walk or bike in cold weather―and like it. We had to give up our 2,500 square foot home and grass lawn.Windows opened. And we had neighbors, lots of neighbors. One neighbor, Javier de Guatemala, was always badgering me to do more in the community garden.Oye, como amanecio, have started your gringo kale garden yet? Those gringo professors from Raleigh across the street are already into their 3rd harvest. And his wife was always shouting for food—oye Javier, traigame mas huevos. That would make Javier turn to me: You’re not buying huevos, are you? It’s really stupid to buy huevos when you can send your kid to collect them in the chicken coop. His kid taught my kid how to use goats instead of the lawn mower.My other neighbor, 87-year old Lisa, kept talking about hoop dreams―-those hoop houses that allow for year-round gardening. In hot and sunny Detroit, an urban agriculture ordinance led to a widespread revival of urban farming, throughout the year. In London, thanks to breakthroughs in hydroponics and LED light advances, organic vegetables were grown in underground bomb shelters and delivered to restaurants within hours.We created an edible trail from one end of town to the other, all the way threw the campus, where anyone could get an entire meal by picking. I preferred the berries trail. We learned about being a healthy community, not medical community. We built a farm-acy, from medicinal herbs. To recognize the time spent outside and in the soil as part of our daily workout and stress relief—no less important than the gym or yoga.You see this patch of our community garden, Sarah my neighboor, told me one day: 10 by 10 can get the nutrients for your family through much of the year. You just have to learn the stories of the food, he said ―-like our grandparents.In the year of the great crisis, we set local food benchmarks: we imported 90% of our food back then, but within 5 years, we imported only 50%, then only 25 %, and now we produce 75% of our food. But we also knew urban farming, even with the breakthroughs, would not feed everyone in our cities.In a regenerative city like Adelaide, in those days, a diverse semi-urban farm belt surrounds the city as a food network to meet local demands. With a “zero waste” strategy, 180,000 tons of compost are converted annually from urban organic waste, with 50,000 acres of nearby land dedicated to vegetable and fruit crops. Again, the circular function, circular metabolism of a city. The food comes daily into the center markets, consumes, resuses the waste as compost. Solar buses deliver the goods.Here’s the punch line: Regenerative organic farming, including diversified crops and rotation, veggie mulching, organic compost, doesn’t just produce food. As the Rodale Institute recently showed in a study, regenerative organic farming is crucial in soil carbon sequestration. Farmers can play a huge role—perhaps more than anyone—in regenerating our soil and reducing CO2 emissions. We’ve lost 80 percent of the carbon stock in our soils. We need to bring it back to the dusty soil.Which brings us to our crap. It was a great day when Boone and App State signed the Zero Waste Ordinance. No more landfills—no more trucking our crap down the mountain to other communities. If the college town of Boulder Colorado could commit to reducing their waste by 85%, emphasizing a closed-loop production and consumption system, mandating obligatory recycling, composting and reuse, we could do the same.And gain from it. You’re feeding the food, said Jenny, our Composter-in Residence, a new appointment at the campus. And reducing your methane emissions in the process.Blooming like a garden, the EcoDistrict unfolded like a recipe.My other neighbor showed me his row of veggies in a hoop house that looked like a quilt, with carrots, peas, beans, bell peppers, potatoes, cabbage and cloves—what he called the Boone sambusa.Act IV: Restoration Perhaps before we could say what kind of regenerative city we wanted, we had to ask: What kind of town do we want?? What kind of campus do we want? What kind of sign are we putting out to the world on our roads—national champions of what? Football.Then perhaps we can learn from China or the New England Patriots and put solar panels on our stadiums, Solar Brewer Stadium—that if 40,000 people can fill a stadium to watch overgrown men chase a pig skin, perhaps we can use that opportunity to generate our electricity –like Brazil, where kinetic panels have been installed in the soccer stadiums to convert energy into electricity.What is our relationship with our creek and forest? Our mountains. Are we still mountain people. Does the land still determine our way of life, and inspire us. Daniel Boone once wrote: Nature is here, a series of wonders, and a fund of delight. What can we learn from it?Do we really live in the town inspired by an explorer like Daniel Boone?What is our relationship with our communities? Did we recognize Boone as a smorsgaboard―-where all of our cultures are recognized. Where biodiversity and human diversity run together, not separated by walls. That the trails of our ways were first shaped by the Cherokee and other indigenous peoples.That the banjo came from Africa, with Africans; like the guitar, brought up by black railroad workers. That African American guitarist Leslie Riddle from Burnsville collected the tunes for the Carter Family and helped to launched country music; that Nina Simone, from the woods of western North Carolina, forever reminded us that black lives matter, that it is beautiful to be young, gifted and black?How could we put the roots of culture back into our neighborhoods? Culture. From the Latin root, colere. Cultivare. Cultivate. Food. Nature. Diversity. Restoration. Regeneration.By restoring our relationship with nature—not simply in a series of more parks and ball fields, but a deeper commitment to healing and restoring our surroundings—we also found our sense of place, our sense of community. Adelaide planted 3 million mainly trees—that’s stunning—not only as a carbon sink, but as a roadmap on how we orient our lives.How do we move beyond doing less bad, and actually do something that enhances rather than harms our environment. To create an economy that replenishes the natural resources we consume. Like hemp products, for example. To give a new framework and vocabulary to our times—to begin the process of regeneraton. To begin the healing process. That climate action was not just about pulling the plug, but it was first and foremost about pulling back the carbon into the soil.The soil will save us, my grandkids kept repeating in their mantra. The soil will save us.To marvel at restoring a self-sustaining, and resilient riparian ecosystem, and thriving creek. At that same long table, always with food, we asked ourselves: How do we heal or restore our waterways and neighborhoods, the new strata of segregation? How do we protect our water; how do we make sure those who can least afford the changes in electricity rates, the cost of food, the vector-borne illness from climate change, are in the forefront of our plans?The EcoDistrict in Boone and App State began the process of answering some of those questions of who we are today in Boone in different ways.We grappled with some hard truths. No true EcoDistrict could emerge without inclusionary zoning—and low income units mixed with higher income—older communities with new communities. Indigenous Immigrants. Urban immigrants. And my people—hillbillies all. And most importantly, senior citizens, the ranks who bring so much experience and wisdom and chutzpah.That App State could continue the process of creative the regenerative campus—introducing each first year of students to a required curriculum that simply asks the question: What’s your connection to Boone; to provide opportunities to live in dorms generated by 100 renewable energy like Berea College, gain credit for cultivating food on campus, and composting, and planting soil carbon sequestration projects; realizing, finally, what their connection is to Boone—and where their electricity comes from, where their water comes from, where their food comes, and where their waste goes.In 2017, in the year of the great crisis, a new opportunity opened up down by the creek. The Chancellor of App State and the Mayor of Boone put up their homes as showcases of permaculture and 100 renewable energy, and then together they cut the ribbon for the region’s first Climate Arts Center, a place to bring together our legacy of the arts and Appalachia and hold public events, workshops and community discussions on how climate action is “a central priority in strategic planning” and daily life.Just like my ancestors in Indian Gardens—we had to re-envision ourselves. Regenerate ourselves. In order to survive. In order to thrive.We didn’t just envision the future; we cultivated it, ate it, and took comfort in it.I tell my grandkids that the regenerative city in Boone and App State didn’t happen overnight. It took ages just to talk it out, across the long table. But every day, new breakthroughs reminded us that we needed to think anew, and recognize watershed events as turning points. To not defer the pressing realities and mounting costs of climate change, but embrace them as opportunities.How many droughts and fire did it take? How many billions did we have to lose before we acted? How many lives?Economics lose meaning when we calculate the price of our own demise, of the declining hopes of our own futures and that of the next generations.The best way for my grandkids to learn this, like my generation of crisis, was to talk to our new neighbors from Mexico who left drought conditions and understood foodways in an age of adaptation.To walk in the ways of the Cherokee, and see their own challenge to adapt to changes, and create a restorative society. That the past is always a presence, as Mexican poet Octavio Paz once wrote, and the spirits of the past—of the people, and the land, the creek —still speak to us, if we listen.And then I asked my kids the same question we asked ourselves during the great crisis: How can you be a catalyst for this regenerative city? What is my role—and the role of artists, innovators, engineers, entrepreneurs, and the retired? What is growing in my garden. And can I walk there? Where does your electricity come from?It could begin with a simple act, like that of a concerned school parent, who worked to get the schools to halt the use of toxic pesticides on school grounds, and start using goats.There are so many examples, but I keep seeing this image in Boone: The endless line of volunteers trying to stop a forest fire. A struggle of resilience―-but resilience, in this situation, was a state of loss, surrender and ultimately ruin. After the great crisis in 2017, we asked those same people who were heroes in a vain attempt to hold back a fire, to do the same for climate action now, in a real and possible way. To create the regenerative city, and the regenerative campus.So, back to our family reunion at Indian Gardens. The grandkids laugh. At the creek, I play a game with my grandkids: What’s that? Burdock. What’s that? Chickory! Let’s make some coffee. What’s that? Wine berries. Elder. Plantain. What’s that? Chickweed. Ah, the jewel of our green salad, so rich in vitamin C that the pioneers ate it to ward off scurvy. Another gift from the native people.And then, there was our water, the creek."

57,POLITICS,Tom Price Open To Waiving Obamacare's Individual Mandate,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-price-waiving-individual-mandate_us_597df94de4b02a4ebb760112,The move by the Health and Human Services secretary would hobble the Obamacare exchanges.,2017-07-30,Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price attends a listening session on health care reform at the White House on June 20.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597df98515000021008b4351.jpeg?cache=V1N6QRLkG9&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price would not rule out Sunday the possibility of using his regulatory authority to waive the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate that requires all Americans to buy health insurance or pay a tax.“All things are on the table to try to help patients,” Price told Martha Raddatz on ABC’s “This Week.”Price, who President Donald Trump jokingly suggested last week he would fire if efforts to repeal the act failed, claimed that the mandate was contributing to higher health care costs.“The individual mandate is actually one of those things that is driving up the cost for the American people in terms of coverage,” Price said.The mandate may result in higher individual costs for Americans who previously went without health insurance or purchased bare-bones plans eliminated by the Affordable Care Act ― commonly known as Obamacare. But it also almost certainly functions as a check on overall costs for people who get their coverage on Obamacare’s individual insurance exchanges by bringing healthy people into the risk pool.Eliminating the mandate unilaterally is liable to create chaos in the individual exchanges as insurers scramble to offset the departure of healthy enrollees.That’s why the insurance industry trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans wrote a letter to Congress opposing the so-called “skinny” repeal bill that the Senate rejected early Friday morning. The legislation would have abolished the individual mandate and the rule requiring large employers to offer their employees coverage.“Eliminating the individual coverage requirement by itself will likely result in fewer people covered and a deterioration of the risk pool, which will increase premiums,” AHIP wrote.Significant evidence exists that one of the problems facing Obamacare is that the fine for violating the individual mandate is too modest to encourage enrollment, leading to a disproportionate ratio of sicker Americans in the exchanges. Insurers have responded by driving up premiums to offset the costs of coverage and withdrawing from some high-cost areas. California, a state that invested heavily in enrolling people in its Covered California exchange, has had much more success building a balanced risk pool and limiting cost growth.Price also suggested he was open to undoing other regulations that encourage enrollment in the Obamacare exchanges, even as he claimed that allowing the exchanges to “implode” was “not the right thing to do.”“We’re gonna look at every single one of those rules and regulations, all 1,442 of them, and determine, does it drive up costs or does it drive down costs? Does it help patients or does it hurt patients?” Price said. “And when it drives up costs and hurts patients, we’re gonna move in the other direction.”Price has already taken action to effectively discourage enrollment in the Obamacare exchanges. Under his leadership, HHS has used funds earmarked for promoting the Affordable Care Act to blast it on social media and downplay the law’s benefits on the federal agency’s website, The Daily Beast reported.Price declined to comment on the possibility that HHS would withhold cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers that subsidize exchange plans for Americans with incomes under 250 percent of the federal poverty level. He said his status as the defendant in House Republicans’ lawsuit challenging the payments precluded him from addressing it.Trump implied on Saturday that he would hold the payments hostage to a successful Obamacare repeal bill. Previous threats not to proceed with the payments sent tremors through the insurance markets. Ending them would prompt insurers to increase premiums for typical plans by 19 percent, on average, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, and create major disorder in the exchanges."
58,POLITICS,Leader Of Voter Fraud Probe Really Doesn't Want To Release Trump Meeting Documents,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kris-kobach-trump-meeting_us_597cafc3e4b02a4ebb75c94a,Kris Kobach said making the documents public would undermine his work on the panel.,2017-07-29,The ACLU wants the documents pictured above made public.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597cb2d815000021008b4256.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) continued to fight releasing documents from a meeting with President Donald Trump in November, saying that the public did not need to see them and that disclosing them would impede his ability to serve on Trump’s commission to investigate voter fraud. Kobach, who has lent support to Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud and exaggerated instances of it in the past, made the argument with his lawyer in a Friday court filing as part of an ongoing lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union over a Kansas law requiring people to prove their citizenship to vote. As part of the lawsuit, the ACLU is requesting a Kansas federal judge unseal documents that Kobach was photographed holding when he met with Trump in November 2016, as well as a draft amendment to federal voting law, which circulated in his office. The documents contain potential amendments to the National Voter Registration Act, a 1993 law requiring motor vehicle and some other state agencies to provide opportunities to register to vote.The public release of the documents would be significant because Kobach is the de facto leader of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, a probe Trump convened in May to investigate election confidence. Trump and Kobach have promised a neutral investigation, but critics say the panel is an effort to substantiate Trump’s claims of widespread voter fraud and lay the groundwork for restrictive voting laws. Documents that show Kobach attempting to change federal law to impose more restrictive voting policies could substantially undermine the perception of impartiality.A separate email made public as part of the lawsuit revealed Kobach was already working on an attempt to amend NVRA the day after Trump was elected.In the filing, Kobach, who is also running for governor of Kansas for 2018, seemed aware that releasing the documents would impact his work on the commission.“It would undermine Secretary Kobach’s interest in fulfilling his appointed duty and responsibilities on the Presidential Election Commission which include being able to advise the President privately on matters within the purview of the Commission,” Kobach and his lawyer wrote. “The public broadcast of the Secretary’s documents related to these meetings with the President would hinder his ability to confidently advise the President.”ACLU lawyers sought the documents because they say an attempt to amend NVRA would be a concession by Kobach that federal law, as written, does not allow the state to impose a proof of citizenship requirement. Kobach initially refused to turn over the documents to ACLU lawyers, saying they were irrelevant, but only did so after a U.S. magistrate judge forced him to do so. Those documents are currently under a protective seal from the court and not available to the public.The magistrate judge also sanctioned Kobach with a $1,000 fine last month for misleading the court about the contents of the documents. In denying Kobach’s appeal of the sanctions, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson noted Kobach had a pattern of misleading statements before the court.Beyond hindering his work on the commission, Kobach said in the Friday filing the documents were irrelevant to the central claims in the lawsuit and the ACLU only wanted them to be made public because the group wanted to fundraise off of them. Kobach also said the documents were protected by Kansas state law and disclosing would make it more difficult for him to give candid advice on sensitive matters in the future.In its own filing earlier this month, ACLU lawyers said Kobach had no basis for keeping the documents shielded from public view and the “public has a presumptive right of access to judicial records and a well-recognized interest in understanding disputes presented in federal litigation, particularly those regarding matters of paramount public concern, such as access to the franchise.”"
59,POLITICS,Federal Judge Says Alabama Doesn't Have To Tell Felons They May Now Be Able To Vote,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-felon-moral-turpitude_us_597ce859e4b02a4ebb75d693,Voting advocates say a recent change in state law is likely to cause confusion.,2017-07-29,Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) says his office doesn't have to take action to educate felons who may have been confused about whether or not they're eligible to vote.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597ceaef1a00009bc1dc11fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alabama election officials don’t have to immediately educate impacted people about a change in state voting qualifications that clarified tens of thousands of felons have the right to vote, a federal judge ruled Friday.The ruling came in response to a request from lawyers from the Campaign Legal Center, on behalf of 10 voters over a law that prohibited anyone who committed a “felony of moral turpitude” from voting. In May, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed a law defining exactly which offenses constituted a crime of moral turpitude, earning widespread praise. But Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill (R) told HuffPost in June the state wouldn’t undertake any effort to target people affected by the change and let them know they’re now eligible to vote.The Southern Poverty Law Center estimates the changes could affect thousands of potential voters.Campaign Legal Center lawyers said that the overhaul would cause confusion among people who previously had been told they could not vote, but under the clarified law were now clearly eligible. Ahead of a Monday registration deadline for a special election for the U.S. Senate, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction requesting the state promote the changes in eligibility. It also requested it automatically reinstate and notify those who had been told they couldn’t vote in the past two years, but were clearly eligible.In a 35-page ruling, W. Keith Watkins, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, who is the chief U.S. district judge for the middle district of Alabama, said by instructing election registrars to comply with the clarified moral turpitude law, the state had taken enough action. The plaintiffs in the case hadn’t shown they faced irreparable injury, he said, and weren’t being denied the ability to vote.“There is no evidence, however, that Defendants have denied any eligible HB 282 voter’s application to register to vote or have engaged in any type of prohibitive tactic,” Watkins wrote in his ruling, referring to the new Alabama law. “Instead, the evidence demonstrates that the county registrars, at the direction of the Alabama Secretary of State, are adhering to HB 282 and are permitting individuals to register whom HB 282 does not disqualify. Plaintiffs, who are eligible HB 282 voters, cannot claim irreparable harm when they have been granted the right to vote.”Danielle Lang, a lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center in the case, told HuffPost in June education and outreach would be crucial to the success of the new law. Because there was previously no universal definition of a felony of moral turpitude, local officials had wide discretion in the past to tell people they were ineligible to vote. That means now there may be many people who were previously told they were ineligible to vote, who are in fact now eligible, who won’t know about the change unless they closely follow the legislative process. Some of these voters told the court they wouldn’t have known they were now eligible to vote if lawyers hadn’t contacted them. “This is confusion that was wrought by the state,” she said. “Under this newfound definition, it turns out [some] do have the right to vote. I don’t see how anyone would know that unless they’re kind of legislative junkies,” Lang told HuffPost in June.But Watkins said there had been widespread public reports about the changes and it would be too much of a burden on the secretary of state’s six-person election staff to find the affected voters and then send out mailings targeting them. Lawyers hadn’t shown evidence that any of the 10 plaintiffs in the case had been blocked from voting because they didn’t know about changes to the law. Absent state action, the Alabama chapter of the ACLU and Legal Services Alabama are offering clinics this summer to help educate people about the changes."

But after reading media reports claiming that a young gay couple had participated in the U.K.’s first gay Muslim wedding earlier this month, Lahore wanted to speak out.She didn’t begrudge the couple their happiness. But she did want to point out that this was not the U.K.’s first gay Muslim wedding ― not by a long shot.Jahed Choudhury and Sean Rogan’s marriage in Walsall made headlines in a number of British and global publications, including this one. Choudhury, a 24-year-old, told The Express and Star that he hopes his wedding will “show the whole world that you can be gay and Muslim.” The local paper claimed it was “the first U.K. same-sex marriage involving a Muslim.” But Lahore told HuffPost that this was a mischaracterization. She said that Britain’s queer Muslim community is flourishing. Dozens of queer British Muslims have tied the knot since same-sex marriage was legalized in the U.K. in 2014. And before that, some couples chose to have civil unions.“There have been countless queer Muslim and gay Muslim weddings in the U.K.,” Lahore said. “And this young gentlemen, as amazing as it is that he wants to come out so publicly about his marriage, for him to claim it’s the first one is totally inaccurate.” Lahore became something of a spokesperson for queer British Muslims after appearing in a Channel 4 documentary on Muslim drag queens. She said that she’s probably attended at least 50 queer Muslim weddings in her life ― including her own. Lahore was given away by her mom during a civil union with a gay Muslim man in 2009. In 2014, the pair decided to get legally married. Lahore said her relationship with her ex-husband ended amicably last year after she began living and presenting as her authentic self as a woman. Lahore said queer Muslim weddings in the U.K. tend to be joyous celebrations of the couples and cultures that are coming together. Some queer Muslims of South Asian heritage incorporate traditional wedding practices into their celebration ― like painting the hands and feet with henna or participating in a rukhsati, a ceremony that marks the departure of a child to their new home. She said that queer Muslims tend to think of marriage as a big celebration ― and something of an accomplishment.“When you’re growing up in a South Asian context, marriage is such a milestone,” Lahore said. “This sort of psyche and part of the culture has definitely filtered into the queer Muslim space.”“I’ve heard the phrase quite often of I wish someone would arrange my gay or queer wedding,” she added. In addition to getting married, queer Muslims in Britain have developed unique ways to express their faith. They’ve come together to form charities and advocacy organizations. They’ve also gathered in inclusive mosque spaces where people can pray and read the Quran together. Lahore said that when she first came out to her parents as gay, they had a hard time accepting her sexuality. Over the years, she felt that she had to choose one or the other ― either her sexuality or her faith. As a teenager, she tried to reject Islam completely, but said she “always ended up feeling unfulfilled.” Then, she went through a phase of rejecting her queerness, and again found that a part of her was left unfulfilled. “I think for me, coming out to my parents, being honest, finding a need to express authenticity, allowed me to intertwine and reconcile both of my identities,” she said. “A lot of that came together the day I got married.”She said that the marriage actually helped soothe her relationship with her parents.“They realized this wasn’t a phase and wasn’t something I was going to snap out of,” Lahore said. “If anything, the union actually made my parents see that this was serious, that my relationship with my partner is legitimate ... Marriage holds such an importance in both their religion and their culture that my partnership really cemented who I was and my relationship with my parents.”Lahore came out to her family as a trans woman earlier this year, a few months after making the decision to transition.She said she feels by that time, her parents’ views about sexuality and gender identity had expanded.“I feel that my parents had grown in their understanding of gender and sexuality through our ongoing discussions about what it meant for me, initially as a gay man, then as a Drag Queen and now as a trans woman,” Lahore saidShe also said that the concept of being genderqueer isn’t foreign in South Asian culture, because of the centuries-old presence of a community of transgender individuals known a hijras. In Pakistan, for example, being gay is illegal and transgender people face discrimination and violence. Still, the country has awarded some basic rights to hijras, like allowing them to get national identity cards as a “third sex.” “We must take into context the significant impact that Hijras and trans women have had on Pakistani culture and society; indeed I feel it was easier for my parents to understand my trans identity than when I came out as a gay man,” she said.Watch Asifa Lahore’s music video about love and acceptance below.Today, Lahore proudly identifies as a Muslim ― and tries her best to keep the faith’s five pillars.“It hasn’t been easy, but I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m really comfortable in my search for authenticity. For me, Islam is honesty, Islam is being honest to myself about who I am, it’s me being closer to God, to people, to humanity really.” "

True confidence",2017-07-29,<p>True confidence—as opposed to the false confidence people project to mask their insecurities—has a look all its own. Dr. Travis Bradberry explains the hallmarks of true confidence.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597123ab2100001400fc7f7b.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Confidence takes many forms, from the arrogance of Floyd Mayweather to the quiet self-assurance of Jane Goodall. True confidence—as opposed to the false confidence people project to mask their insecurities—has a look all its own.When it comes to confidence, one thing is certain: truly confident people always have the upper hand over the doubtful and the skittish because they inspire others and they make things happen.Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t—you’re right. - Henry Ford Ford’s notion that your mentality has a powerful effect on your ability to succeed is manifest in the results of a recent study at the University of Melbourne that showed that confident people went on to earn higher wages and get promoted more quickly than anyone else.Learning to be confident is clearly important, but what is it that truly confident people do that sets them apart from everyone else?I did some digging to uncover the 12 cardinal habits of truly confident people so that you can incorporate these behaviors into your repertoire.1. They Get Their Happiness from Within Happiness is a critical element of confidence, because in order to be confident in what you do, you have to be happy with who you are.People who brim with confidence derive their sense of pleasure and satisfaction from their own accomplishments, as opposed to what other people think of their accomplishments. They know that no matter what anyone says, you’re never as good or as bad as people say you are.2. They Don’t Pass Judgment Confident people don’t pass judgment on others because they know that everyone has something to offer, and they don’t need to take other people down a notch in order to feel good about themselves. Comparing yourself to other people is limiting. Confident people don’t waste time sizing people up and worrying about whether or not they measure up to everyone they meet.3. They Don’t Say Yes Unless They Really Want ToResearch conducted at the University of California in Berkeley shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Confident people know that saying no is healthy, and they have the self-esteem to make their nos clear. When it’s time to say no, confident people avoid phrases such as “I don’t think I can” or “I’m not certain.” They say no with confidence because they know that saying no to a new commitment honors their existing commitments and gives them the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.4. They Listen More than They SpeakPeople with confidence listen more than they speak because they don’t feel as though they have anything to prove. Confident people know that by actively listening and paying attention to others, they are much more likely to learn and grow. Instead of seeing interactions as opportunities to prove themselves to others, they focus on the interaction itself, because they know that this is a far more enjoyable and productive approach to people.5. They Speak with CertaintyIt’s rare to hear the truly confident utter phrases such as “Um,” “I’m not sure,” and “I think.” Confident people speak assertively because they know that it’s difficult to get people to listen to you if you can’t deliver your ideas with conviction.6. They Seek Out Small VictoriesConfident people like to challenge themselves and compete, even when their efforts yield small victories. Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. The increase in androgen receptors increases the influence of testosterone, which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle future challenges. When you have a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months.7. They ExerciseA study conducted at the Eastern Ontario Research Institute found that people who exercised twice a week for 10 weeks felt more competent socially, academically, and athletically. They also rated their body image and self-esteem higher. Best of all, rather than the physical changes in their bodies being responsible for the uptick in confidence, it was the immediate, endorphin-fueled positivity from exercise that made all the difference.8. They Don’t Seek AttentionPeople are turned off by those who are desperate for attention. Confident people know that being yourself is much more effective than trying to prove that you’re important. People catch on to your attitude quickly and are more attracted to the right attitude than what, or how many, people you know. Confident people always seem to bring the right attitude.Confident people are masters of attention diffusion. When they’re receiving attention for an accomplishment, they quickly shift the focus to all the people who worked hard to help get them there. They don’t crave approval or praise because they draw their self-worth from within.9. They Aren’t Afraid to Be WrongConfident people aren’t afraid to be proven wrong. They like putting their opinions out there to see if they hold up because they learn a lot from the times they are wrong and other people learn from them when they’re right. Self-assured people know what they are capable of and don’t treat being wrong as a personal slight.10. They Stick Their Necks OutWhen confident people see an opportunity, they take it. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, they ask themselves, “What’s stopping me? Why can’t I do that?” and they go for it. Fear doesn’t hold them back because they know that if they never try, they will never succeed.11. They Celebrate Other PeopleInsecure people constantly doubt their relevance, and because of this, they try to steal the spotlight and criticize others in order to prove their worth. Confident people, on the other hand, aren’t worried about their relevance because they draw their self-worth from within. Instead of insecurely focusing inward, confident people focus outward, which allows them to see all the wonderful things that other people bring to the table. Praising people for their contributions is a natural result of this.12. They Aren’t Afraid to Ask for HelpConfident people know that asking other people for help won’t make them seem weak or unintelligent. They know their strengths and weaknesses, and they look to others to fill the gaps. They also know that learning from someone with more expertise is a great way to improve.Bringing It All TogetherBuilding confidence is a journey, not a destination. Please share your thoughts on the matter in the comments section as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more from me? Check out my book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."

With President Donald Trump in the White House and all but one congressional special election on the books, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is turning its attention to down-ballot races in unexpected areas like Birmingham.Randall Woodfin, a 36-year-old school board member and city prosecutor, landed on the national progressive radar when he picked up the influential endorsement of Our Revolution ― the political organization created to carry on the legacy of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign ― for his bid to govern the Southern city of 212,000. Collective PAC, a political action committee that supports black candidates at all levels of government, also endorsed him. Should Woodfin win, he would be the youngest mayor of Birmingham in decades.Woodfin sees himself as part of a new generation of liberal leaders sweeping to power in Southern cities. In May, 34-year-old progressive attorney and activist Chokwe Antar Lumumba pulled off a surprise win in the Democratic mayoral primary in Jackson, Mississippi, cruising to victory in the general election the following month.“In these urban areas of the Southeast ― this is where the revolution starts,” Woodfin said in an interview in Washington earlier this month.Woodfin, a dapper, bearded bachelor, was visiting the nation’s capital to attend a fundraiser organized by fellow alumni of Morehouse College, the historically black institution in Atlanta. He has made similar trips to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Memphis, Houston and New York, and plans to make a stop in South Carolina as well.The soft-spoken Woodfin casts himself to audiences dismayed by the November election results as a high-return investment for people looking to do their part to counter Trump. Southern cities, he said, are “the frontline resistance to Trump policies.” Mayors often have broad authority to improve infrastructure, enact community-friendly policing policies and tackle poverty in ways that offset the federal government’s regressive agenda, he said. In heavily Democratic Birmingham, local elections are nonpartisan, but invariably come down to a battle between Democrats. Woodfin is one of 11 people trying to unseat two-term city mayor William Bell, a fellow African-American Democrat. The 68-year-old Bell has served in elected city posts since 1979 ― two years before Woodfin was born.If none of the candidates break 50 percent in the Aug. 22 election, there will be a runoff on Oct. 3. It’s expected to be a tough race; in addition to Woodfin, Chris Woods, a 42-year-old construction contractor who has accused Bell’s administration of demanding “pay to play” kickbacks, is considered a serious contender, as is community activist Frank Matthews, 61.There is no public polling in the race, but if fundraising is any indicator, Woodfin’s campaign pitch and aggressive ground game ― they claim to have knocked on over 35,000 doors ― are paying off. As of the end of June, he had raised $206,000 from more than 2,000 individual contributions. His June fundraising haul exceeded Bell’s by nearly $10,000, according to the candidates’ monthly disclosures. The average donation was $36.50, according to the campaign.Woodfin has proposed several sweeping progressive reforms, including the creation of a scholarship program that would provide public high school graduates with free tuition at two- or four-year programs at community colleges in Jefferson County, where Birmingham is located. He is calling it the “Fred Shuttlesworth Opportunity Scholarship,” in memory of the Birmingham civil rights leader who withstood beatings, bombings and imprisonment.Woodfin says his experience as both a young, black man with deep roots in Birmingham and as a prosecutor gives him the perspective necessary to ensure public safety while doggedly fighting for police accountability and criminal justice reform.That experience could prove useful in a city where the number of annual murders exceeded 100 in 2016 for the first time in a decade, and where community relations with law enforcement remain delicate.Bill Dawson, a veteran civil rights and criminal defense attorney in Birmingham, said that Woodfin is not like other prosecutors.“I always found him to be reasonable and understanding of the problems that people have,” said Dawson, who has not endorsed a candidate in the race.Woodfin said he is interested in addressing root causes of crime, which he identifies as the absence of hope and opportunity among young men in low-income neighborhoods. He also wants to find the resources to recruit and retain talented police officers who understand those challenges.Woodfin plans to reopen shuttered community recreation centers and equip them to provide job training, encourage schools to incorporate conflict resolution in their curricula and provide a tax credit to city businesses that hire ex-offenders. His most ambitious crime prevention proposal is the creation of a summer jobs program for city teenagers, modeled on a similar effort former Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry pioneered in 1979.Looking for wins in the wake of November’s election, progressive groups have found more success in state and local races than at the congressional level. Major victories for so-called “Berniecrats” include Larry Krasner’s win in the Democratic primary for Philadelphia’s district attorney; Christine Pellegrino’s upset special election win for a State Assembly seat in a New York district that voted for Trump; and Lumumba’s election in Jackson, Mississippi.Our Revolution, which backed Lumumba, has now endorsed both Woodfin and Georgia state Sen. Vincent Fort, a Sanders supporter running for mayor of Atlanta this November.“The American people, whether they live in Atlanta, Georgia, or they live in Birmingham, Alabama ... are demanding more of their elected officials and they are demanding it at all levels of government,” said Our Revolution President Nina Turner. But Woodfin’s bid also highlights some of the limits of progressive governance at the city level, as ambitious projects that capture the liberal imagination can be thwarted at the state level. Birmingham approved a new minimum wage of $10.10 per hour in February 2016, only to have it invalidated by Alabama’s Republican governor and state legislature two days later.Woodfin says he wants Birmingham to go even further by instituting a $15 per hour minimum wage. At the very least, he’ll make that the standard for city employees and restore so-called “longevity” pay bumps, which were eliminated in 2010 amid budget cuts.These proposals come with price tags, of course, but Woodfin says the money is there if the city is willing to adjust its priorities. “There’s not a shortage of funding in Birmingham,” Woodfin said. “There’s a shortage of priorities and a vision to move the city forward with tax dollars in an appropriate and transparent way.” He argues the current mayor’s 101-person staff is gratuitously large, and that the administration has been too willing to issue bonds to finance expensive downtown infrastructure projects while ignoring public resources like libraries. Bell spokeswoman April Odom vehemently defended the mayor’s record, insisting that Woodfin’s characterization of the mayor’s staff size is completely dishonest. Odom noted that many of the projects Bell has financed, such as the Negro Southern League Museum and the Birmingham Crossplex, a massive athletic facility, have had to be staffed out of the mayor’s office because “there is no other mechanism in place to fund the positions.” Odom credited Mayor Bell’s decision to invest $200 million in infrastructure projects with the creation of thousands of new businesses and jobs that generated an influx of new tax revenue. She also said that Bell is open to enacting a $15 minimum wage for city employees and restoring longevity pay, but that it is “a matter of how would it be paid for” ― and any increases in city employee pay requires the approval of the Jefferson County Personnel Board, which is far more conservative than Birmingham’s government.Even Bell’s critics acknowledge that he has presided over the revitalization of a once sleepy downtown area. Birmingham is experiencing the same revival sweeping cities across the country, as largely white, middle-class young professionals and families opt to return to the city centers their parents and grandparents departed en masse.  The mayoral race appears to hinge on who is best equipped to harness the city’s new energy in a way that does not leave behind the city’s predominantly black, working-class and low-income residents. From 2010 to 2015, as the city’s budget swelled with new revenue, its poverty rate climbed from 26.4 percent to 30.9 percent, according to census data.Woodfin professed his respect for the generation of Birmingham political leaders that preceded him, but accused those leaders of holding on to power for too long. “A certain generation is unwilling to let the torch of leadership go,” he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated incorrectly that Woodfin would be Birmingham’s youngest elected mayor, if elected.

With President Donald Trump in the White House and all but one congressional special election on the books, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is turning its attention to down-ballot races in unexpected areas like Birmingham.Randall Woodfin, a 36-year-old school board member and city prosecutor, landed on the national progressive radar when he picked up the influential endorsement of Our Revolution ― the political organization created to carry on the legacy of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign ― for his bid to govern the Southern city of 212,000. Collective PAC, a political action committee that supports black candidates at all levels of government, also endorsed him.

66,ENTERTAINMENT,Satirist-In-Chief: Anthony Atamanuik Mines Trump's Darkness For Comedic Gold,Adam Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-atamanuik-mines-trump-darkness-for-comedic-gold_us_5978aa1be4b0c95f3760a0fd,"His savage executive parody on ""The President Show"" is as disturbing as it is hilarious.",2017-07-29,"Anthony Atamanuik as Donald Trump on ""The President Show.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/597a0e811a00008381dc0d62.jpeg?cache=SVfG7tMm5j&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"It’s the president’s birthday! And what better way to celebrate than with a surprise party?Except at this surprise party, all that awaits the guest of honor is an empty Queens diner, a few balloons and a cake. The attendees, with the exception of the party’s organizer, the vice president, are missing in action. After only a few minutes, the commander-in-chief has had enough. With a temper as short as the guest list, his disappointment explodes into an orange rage. He smashes the cake to bits, throwing what’s left of the frosty carcass onto the floor.At what should be a joyful gathering, the devastated president dictates a twisted executive order to his No. 2: “Lick it up!” Thus, a pious man, who normally reserves time on his knees for prayer, reluctantly bends down to do as told, “like a dog.”“Happy birthday, Mr. President” never felt so disquieting.This isn’t a moment from the real life of President Donald J. Trump (as hard as it may be to believe), but part of a fictitious segment called “Donny Goes Home” from “The President Show,” the Comedy Central series starring Anthony Atamanuik with Peter Grosz playing Vice President Mike Pence.Atamanuik, with his pitch-perfect Trump impression, is at the center of something unlike anything else on TV: a comic send-up that imagines the now president and former “Apprentice” star hosting another TV show, this one a weekly late-night series in which he holds court with the American people directly from the Oval Office. It’s a bizarro fireside chat perfectly suited for an unhinged political reality.The kind of grotesque caricature of Trump in “Donny Goes Home” isn’t the exception to the show, but the rule.“I like the darkness,” explained Atamanuik, the show’s creator and star.In an interview with HuffPost, the comedian broke down why such unsettling material can be so valuable.“We don’t have to look at the bad things. We don’t have to look at our history,” Atamanuik asserted. As he put it, American citizens safely ignore the “ill that our society is built on,” preferring to remain in a state of blissful ignorance and repression. By addressing this ill head-on and “putting a fun spin” on it, Atamanuik said it’s possible to understand it in a deeper way and “have ownership and authorship over how it gets presented.”The Upright Citizens Brigade veteran often explored uncomfortable themes in his shows at the New York City improv theater.“Some things were very dark,” he explained. “I delighted in showing sort of the dark edges of us and our society and myself and ideas, you know, that circulate in our world now.”His penchant for deconstructing the disturbing with humor, a thread that runs from his time at UCB to his current show’s fictitious Oval Office, all started in Atamanuik’s native Massachusetts. Born in the town of Topsfield and raised in the city of Chelsea, his family lived in a double-decker house — he lived downstairs with his mother and stepfather, who were often away teaching and studying for a doctorate, respectively, while his grandparents lived upstairs. He spent a good amount of time with his grandparents, who owned what was ― in the early 1980s ― a cutting-edge technology: cable TV.“I’m like weirdly almost multi-generational because I spent so much time with [my grandparents], so like I watched ‘Burns and Allen’ and ‘Dick Van Dyke’ and ‘Your Show of Shows,’” Atamanuik recollected.Even in this classic comedy fare, Atamanuik recognized a disconcerting edge.“If you go back and actually watch a lot of those, they’re very dark. You know, ‘Jack Benny’ is a dark show,” he said. “There’s a lot of darkness there. It’s just wrapped in very sort of light, smart writing.”As a young kid stewing in both classic and modern television, he began to develop his own personal comic idols. “I was a huge fan of, like, Marty Feldman and Gilda Radner and Madeline Kahn and all the Mel Brooks movies, and you know, ‘The Twelve Chairs,’ which barely anybody knows.”Besides the comedy he was consuming at home, Atamanuik started to find outlets for his own early attempts at performance, too, doing stand-up in the junior high talent show, always setting his ambitions toward something in “acting or film or comedy.”He wound up at Emerson College in Boston and, through a school program, landed a job in the mid-’90s at the internet division of The Jim Henson Company in Los Angeles. It was there that the budding entertainer began to find artistic inspiration, again from the past.“I actually used to watch a lot of Jim Henson’s short films that are not available,” he recalled.Watching old material by Henson and Frank Oz, he was enthralled by their “funny art, punk, comedy” material, describing the two as “acid heads” in their tone. Inspired by the legends behind the Muppets, he began to envision an artistic path for himself through comedy, becoming less interested in making his way through the tedious hierarchy of the motion picture industry.In 2000, Atamanuik moved to New York, where he eventually landed at the UCB theater after a year-and-a-half stint of classes at the now-defunct Gotham City Improv, “because the classes were $50 cheaper than UCB.” He’d seen shows at UCB starring future collaborators like Curtis Gwinn, John Gemberling and “President Show” executive producer Adam Pally, and had been impressed by how “cool” the place was. He took classes there and wound up on a Harold improv team, performing three to four times a week while waiting tables to pay the bills.Atamanuik ended up joining the existing improv team Death by Roo Roo, which included Gemberling, Gwinn and Pally, along with Brett Gelman, Jackie Clarke and Neil Casey.“Not to be too grandiose,” said Atamanuik, “but that was, I think, one of the best improv teams that’s existed.”Another of his exploits at UCB was the recurring “Tony & Johnny Show!,” which Atamanuik said was billed as “the worst variety show you’ll ever see.” Onstage, Atamanuik and “Johnny” Gemberling explored dark themes and had stand-up comics fill in empty spots of time. Some of those performers, such as Rae Sanni and Noah Garfinkel, wound up on the writing staff of “The President Show.”By Atamanuik’s account, the show was made up of “sort of punk rock stuff” that sometimes “alienated the audience,” including a sketch that parodied “The Nutty Professor” starring a character named “Buddy Fuck” (a take on “Buddy Love”) that satirized Catholic molestation scandals. For the performers, “The Tony & Johnny Show!” was “a resource center where everyone showed up and just tried out shit.”All of the comedian’s past performing experiences came together in a way he couldn’t have envisioned in 2015. Atamanuik, by then a veteran improviser, was performing in UCB’s flagship improv show, “ASSSSCAT,” when someone in the audience threw out a suggestion: “Mr. President.” Trump had announced his candidacy about two months prior, and Atamanuik took the cue as an opportunity to do what, at the time, was his best version of The Donald.“I did probably a very poor man’s sort of generalized version of Donald Trump,” he said.Soon after, UCB New York’s artistic director, Shannon O’Neill, approached him about doing a one-man show starring the brash businessman and then–presidential candidate. He put the show together in a week.“I didn’t even look like him. I wore a surfer wig, a blue suit and, like, bronzer I bought at a CVS,” he said.He wrote the show, entitled “Trump Dump,” imagining how policies Trump had been proposing at the time would come to their logical ends. Naturally, the show concluded with a Trump-initiated nuclear war.The character, as the comedian played him onstage, had a perspective fluctuating between that of Trump and that of Atamanuik ― but always with Atamanuik behind the mental control panel. It was “mixing and free-styling” in real-time.“I wouldn’t disappear,” he said. “I would just simply allow another part of myself to show up.”Atamanuik struck a chord with his savage impersonation of the reality TV show host. He soon portrayed the character in a mock debate at UCB, facing off against Bernie Sanders, played with pitch-perfect curmudgeon flair by master impressionist James Adomian. The pair was a hit. They took their cartoonish duo on the road across the country, onto a Fusion TV special and on the late-night Comedy Central show “@midnight.”During the debate tour, Atamanuik spotted HuffPost’s Global Editorial Director Howard Fineman at a bar in Manchester, New Hampshire. Being a political “fanboy,” he approached the frequent MSNBC commentator, introduced himself and invited Fineman to one of his mock face-offs. Fineman wound up moderating a live recording of “Trump vs. Bernie” in Brooklyn, and currently serves as Senior Political Consultant on “The President Show.”“Anthony is not only a great comedian, impersonator and improv guy, he’s a political junkie who knows the minute-by-minute stuff, the morality of the issues, and the history,” said Fineman.Sometimes the depth of Atamanuik’s political knowledge catches the political guru by surprise.“He tells me things about, say, Richard Nixon, that I don’t know. Or voting rights. Or the budget,” Fineman added.He pointed out something central about Atamanuik’s presidential portrayal. “Improv has given him an acute feel for the personalities of politicians, who, after all, are live performers,” noted Fineman. “All of that is why his Trump is so layered, funny and unnervingly spot-on.”And indeed, Atamanuik captures something that’s so deep and dark about the current president, it’s uncanny.The actor, in developing characters, picks three or so essential attributes that he finds interesting and uses his improvisation skills to shape them. With Trump, he treated the role like any other part, watching the candidate’s rallies and reading up on him.Atamanuik also reached into his own past, mining personal experiences to render the unflattering personality quirks of his fictitious chief executive.“I had a period of my life when I was a young guy, and like any young person, I screwed up, like anyone did, and I definitely got a little into harder narcotics, and I was moving around with a lot of women,” Atamanuik said. “Kind of going over the edge.”“So I understood that sense of indulgence and entitlement and I understood the idea of recklessness and not worrying about what the impact of your behavior is, you know, on other people, and just simply pushing forward,” he continued. “I understood, as you would say, being ‘braggadocious.’”“Braggadocious” is certainly an operative word in any discussion of the current president, and Atamanuik saw it in his past self as well as in others. In the mid-2000s, he worked at a Times Square pizzeria, where the owner displayed some of that Trump-like self-regard.“He was very Trump-y, just very sort of grandiose, and wanted everyone to love him, and ... didn’t really know what he was doing, didn’t know how to run a business, but he traded purely on his personality,” Atamanuik recalled. “And so I sort of borrowed from my experience, and I borrowed from my own psyche, and sort of also watched him.”Atamanuik’s Trump, like the real thing, is a deeply insecure figure ― an immature child with the confidence of a god and a shocking level of selfishness. His complete lack of impulse control is always on full display, as exemplified by the aptly-named “President Show” segment “Screaming at the TV!,” in which Atamanuik’s Trump literally watches TV news clips and yells at the television set like an angry second-grader ― an absurd premise drawn straight from the real thing.Ultimately, the point of the exercise, whether Atamanuik was debating onstage or, as he is now, sitting behind the desk in his televised Oval Office, is to defang Trump, now at the pinnacle of power.“The most important thing is to litigate him, rob him of his macho identity and try to replace it with the person who I think he is, which is a little more weak and petty and a little more self-involved and self-loathing,” he explained.The mission statement, combined with Atamanuik’s buffoonish impression, makes for a character that is equal parts repulsive and endearing.On Nov. 8, 2016, an American day that will live in infamy, Atamanuik was in Trump-mode, appearing on ABC’s “The View” election night special in character. Once the direction of the evening became clear, Atamanuik had to throw all his material ― built around an assumed Hillary Clinton victory ― out the window and take an improvised detour. This wasn’t how the night was supposed to go.“I kind of shut down for like three or four weeks [after Trump’s election],” he remembers. “I mean, my wife can tell you. I’d sit in the house and play video games for weeks and just was like, what am I gonna do?”For Atamanuik, Trump was never a character he wanted to be stuck with. Optimistically, he’d hoped to depart from the repugnant businessman-turned-politician, perhaps parlaying his recent successes into a chance to take something like “The Tony & Johnny Show!” to the small screen.Even while achieving success by taking Trump on the road and on TV, he felt it was in some ways a “deal with the devil,” where he was profiting from the exploitation of Trump’s clown show, although not in the deeply self-serving way that TV news outlets were profiting from Trump’s daily slime.“It’s not lost on me that I, too, was a participant in that,” Atamanuik said.But by using Trump as a vessel to satirize and critique a broad set of issues, including the hypocrisy of cable news–owning corporate conglomerates and liberal self-righteousness, Atamanuik was able to make peace with his creation.“I have no issue with turning to my own kind, you know, saying to people who agree with me, ‘You guys have your head in the sand,’” he said.Atamanuik was ultimately able to keep his “nose clean” by finding a balance that utilized the character for the greater good. “I didn’t use my Trump to reinforce him. I used my Trump to co-opt him to put a message out that actually undermined him,” he explained.When it comes to Trump loyalists, Atamanuik has no illusions. He knows from talking with Republican family members and right-wing guests on his show the value of civil communication, but there are some people that he will never reach.“I know some hard-core sort of, like, blind, crazy Twitter-troll Trumper is not going to see what I see,” he admitted.Nevertheless, if there are open minds on the other side, he hopes to impart the basic hypocrisy that underlies Trump’s presidency.“I can say to someone, ‘Hey listen, I don’t think we need to change what you think, or what you feel or how you see the world,’ because that’s not my job, but what I can say is that the person who you’re putting your eggs in their basket ... they’re not doing the thing that you wanna do to even represent your ideals.”After some post-election wallowing, Pally, his old Death by Roo Roo friend, shook him out of it backstage during an “ASSSSCAT” performance, encouraging him to do something with the Trump character.Together with Pally and Grosz, Atamanuik talked out a project, and the group pitched it around. It would be a weekly late-night show hosted by “the president” and set in the White House, actively satirizing the current administration. A supportive Comedy Central picked it up, and “The President Show” was born.When it came time to put together a writing staff, Atamanuik knew how important it was to have a diverse group behind the scenes. He wanted to have “every voice represented” if they were to effectively tackle the Trump administration.“I wanted at least an equal or majority-female writing staff because I think women understand Trump’s voice so much,” he reasoned.Atamanuik recalled complimenting his head writer, Christine Nangle, on how well she writes the president’s utterances, and her explaining how often she hears Trump’s voice in other men. “They hear it from every man they meet, basically,” he said.In his estimation, the team makes the show the “antithesis” of the real White House. “We’re like a diverse, connected group of people, of artists, of every stripe, and every person in that building makes the show good, and without them I’m no good.”Before “The President Show,” Atamanuik worked for years in a small role on “30 Rock,” which he saw as a kind of graduate school in working on TV.“From Tina Fey as a boss, I took that you’re respectful of people, you’re respectful of your writers, you’re friendly with everyone, you approach people with loving kindness,” he noted. Now that he has his own show, he doesn’t understand why anyone would want it otherwise.“This is your opportunity to make this great thing with these people,” Atamanuik said. “Why would you approach it in any other way than with complete openness and love?”Watching the show, it’s clear that this approach works creatively. And with evidently solid ratings, a pleased Comedy Central recently ordered a fresh round of episodes.A week working on “The President Show” is full of long hours and constant change. The news cycle, turning over every 24 hours with a new horror or deranged tweet, keeps Atamanuik and the show’s writers on their feet right up until the moment cameras roll.“We’ve had things [go] into the prompter five minutes before we taped,” the comedian revealed. He called the writing process for the show “sedimentary,” explaining that, as the week progresses, “we basically write five shows and layer them on top of each other.”While the in-studio portions are pre-written, each week contains a new pre-recorded field piece, such as the aforementioned “Donny Goes Home,” in which Atamanuik’s Trump revisits his childhood Queens neighborhood. These pieces are a weekly showcase for Atamanuik’s brilliant improvisation talents, as well as those of Grosz, whose Pence is the Ed McMahon to Trump’s Johnny Carson.But even during the writing process, his improv skills come into play. Often, in a throwback to his days touring for the “Trump vs. Bernie” debates, he’ll stand behind a podium improvising while his writers take and give notes. This official-seeming touch extends to the entire operation.“I said early on let’s just treat this like an alternate White House,” Atamanuik explained. “So like my office is technically like the Oval Office, and my EPs are my closest advisers, and the writers are in the Cabinet, you know? And not that we play, you know, role playing, but we try to sort of just approach it that way.”Atamanuik even gets daily briefs and sees the actual president’s daily schedule, trying to get as close to the real thing as he can so the show, as absurd as it is, is grounded in reality. In strange instances of life imitating art, then imitating life, Atamanuik has even made eerie, inadvertent predictions on the show that have come to pass in Washington.In the show’s first episode, for example, Atamanuik, as Trump, quipped: “I’m the president, can you believe it?” Then, exactly one week later, in a Rose Garden address celebrating the passage of a House health care bill, the real-life Trump exclaimed, “Hey, I’m president! Can you believe it?”Atamanuik took the cue and began using the phrase to kick off every episode.“The President Show” writers come up with an explicit theme for each week’s episode, which the fake Trump lays out during his opening press conferences. These days, even though distractions are too multitudinous to count, Trump’s real administration does the same, whether it be “Infrastructure Week” or “Energy Week.” On a recent episode, Atamanuik’s team again took advantage of reality mimicking fiction by simply parroting the same theme as the White House, “Made in America.”The tonal blend of real current events and warped, live-action cartoon, the on-set camaraderie, and the lessons and sensibilities from Atamanuik’s past and the political present combine to make for a piece of entertainment that is less traditional and more “punk rock,” as Atamanuik might put it. From his perspective, it’s subversively sneaking “basement art house comedy” onto corporate-owned TV ― a renegade, UCB-like performance beamed into American living rooms via Viacom.Reveling in his current success and enjoying the high-profile platform, Atamanuik isn’t thinking too much about what comes next in his comedic journey.“I mean, I’m generally in the present, because that’s, you know, sort of improv 101: Stay in the present. And also just that life is too overwhelming to try to think about more than that.”In a time of “alternative facts” and unprecedented cynicism, Atamanuik and his merry band of pranksters are doing something entirely uncynical. Even joyful.“We’re having a great time,” he affirmed. After watching him and his skilled TV family take on Trump each week, that much is crystal clear.“People seem to like it,” he observed. “So that’s good.”"

And what better way to celebrate than with a surprise party?Except at this surprise party, all that awaits the guest of honor is an empty Queens diner, a few balloons and a cake. The attendees, with the exception of the party’s organizer, the vice president, are missing in action. After only a few minutes, the commander-in-chief has had enough. With a temper as short as the guest list, his disappointment explodes into an orange rage. He smashes the cake to bits, throwing what’s left of the frosty carcass onto the floor.At what should be a joyful gathering, the devastated president dictates a twisted executive order to his No. 2: “Lick it up!” Thus, a pious man, who normally reserves time on his knees for prayer, reluctantly bends down to do as told, “like a dog.”“Happy birthday, Mr. President” never felt so disquieting.This isn’t a moment from the real life of President Donald J. Trump (as hard as it may be to believe), but part of a fictitious segment called “Donny Goes Home” from “The President Show,” the Comedy Central series starring Anthony Atamanuik with Peter Grosz playing Vice President Mike Pence.Atamanuik, with his pitch-perfect Trump impression, is at the center of something unlike anything else on TV: a comic send-up that imagines the now president and former “Apprentice” star hosting another TV show, this one a weekly late-night series in which he holds court with the American people directly from the Oval Office. It’s a bizarro fireside chat perfectly suited for an unhinged political reality.The kind of grotesque caricature of Trump in “Donny Goes Home” isn’t the exception to the show, but the rule.“I like the darkness,” explained Atamanuik, the show’s creator and star.In an interview with HuffPost, the comedian broke down why such unsettling material can be so valuable.“We don’t have to look at the bad things. We don’t have to look at our history,” Atamanuik asserted. As he put it, American citizens safely ignore the “ill that our society is built on,” preferring to remain in a state of blissful ignorance and repression. By addressing this ill head-on and “putting a fun spin” on it, Atamanuik said it’s possible to understand it in a deeper way and “have ownership and authorship over how it gets presented.”The Upright Citizens Brigade veteran often explored uncomfortable themes in his shows at the New York City improv theater.“Some things were very dark,” he explained. “I delighted in showing sort of the dark edges of us and our society and myself and ideas, you know, that circulate in our world now.”His penchant for deconstructing the disturbing with humor, a thread that runs from his time at UCB to his current show’s fictitious Oval Office, all started in Atamanuik’s native Massachusetts. Born in the town of Topsfield and raised in the city of Chelsea, his family lived in a double-decker house — he lived downstairs with his mother and stepfather, who were often away teaching and studying for a doctorate, respectively, while his grandparents lived upstairs. He spent a good amount of time with his grandparents, who owned what was ― in the early 1980s ― a cutting-edge technology: cable TV.“I’m like weirdly almost multi-generational because I spent so much time with [my grandparents], so like I watched ‘Burns and Allen’ and ‘Dick Van Dyke’ and ‘Your Show of Shows,’” Atamanuik recollected.Even in this classic comedy fare, Atamanuik recognized a disconcerting edge.“If you go back and actually watch a lot of those, they’re very dark. You know, ‘Jack Benny’ is a dark show,” he said. “There’s a lot of darkness there. It’s just wrapped in very sort of light, smart writing.”As a young kid stewing in both classic and modern television, he began to develop his own personal comic idols. “I was a huge fan of, like, Marty Feldman and Gilda Radner and Madeline Kahn and all the Mel Brooks movies, and you know, ‘The Twelve Chairs,’ which barely anybody knows.”Besides the comedy he was consuming at home, Atamanuik started to find outlets for his own early attempts at performance, too, doing stand-up in the junior high talent show, always setting his ambitions toward something in “acting or film or comedy.”He wound up at Emerson College in Boston and, through a school program, landed a job in the mid-’90s at the internet division of The Jim Henson Company in Los Angeles. It was there that the budding entertainer began to find artistic inspiration, again from the past.“I actually used to watch a lot of Jim Henson’s short films that are not available,” he recalled.Watching old material by Henson and Frank Oz, he was enthralled by their “funny art, punk, comedy” material, describing the two as “acid heads” in their tone. Inspired by the legends behind the Muppets, he began to envision an artistic path for himself through comedy, becoming less interested in making his way through the tedious hierarchy of the motion picture industry.In 2000, Atamanuik moved to New York, where he eventually landed at the UCB theater after a year-and-a-half stint of classes at the now-defunct Gotham City Improv, “because the classes were $50 cheaper than UCB.” He’d seen shows at UCB starring future collaborators like Curtis Gwinn, John Gemberling and “President Show” executive producer Adam Pally, and had been impressed by how “cool” the place was. He took classes there and wound up on a Harold improv team, performing three to four times a week while waiting tables to pay the bills.Atamanuik ended up joining the existing improv team Death by Roo Roo, which included Gemberling, Gwinn and Pally, along with Brett Gelman, Jackie Clarke and Neil Casey.“Not to be too grandiose,” said Atamanuik, “but that was, I think, one of the best improv teams that’s existed.”Another of his exploits at UCB was the recurring “Tony & Johnny Show!,” which Atamanuik said was billed as “the worst variety show you’ll ever see.” Onstage, Atamanuik and “Johnny” Gemberling explored dark themes and had stand-up comics fill in empty spots of time. Some of those performers, such as Rae Sanni and Noah Garfinkel, wound up on the writing staff of “The President Show.”By Atamanuik’s account, the show was made up of “sort of punk rock stuff” that sometimes “alienated the audience,” including a sketch that parodied “The Nutty Professor” starring a character named “Buddy Fuck” (a take on “Buddy Love”) that satirized Catholic molestation scandals. For the performers, “The Tony & Johnny Show!” was “a resource center where everyone showed up and just tried out shit.”All of the comedian’s past performing experiences came together in a way he couldn’t have envisioned in 2015. Atamanuik, by then a veteran improviser, was performing in UCB’s flagship improv show, “ASSSSCAT,” when someone in the audience threw out a suggestion: “Mr. President.” Trump had announced his candidacy about two months prior, and Atamanuik took the cue as an opportunity to do what, at the time, was his best version of The Donald.“I did probably a very poor man’s sort of generalized version of Donald Trump,” he said.Soon after, UCB New York’s artistic director, Shannon O’Neill, approached him about doing a one-man show starring the brash businessman and then–presidential candidate. He put the show together in a week.“I didn’t even look like him. I wore a surfer wig, a blue suit and, like, bronzer I bought at a CVS,” he said.He wrote the show, entitled “Trump Dump,” imagining how policies Trump had been proposing at the time would come to their logical ends. Naturally, the show concluded with a Trump-initiated nuclear war.The character, as the comedian played him onstage, had a perspective fluctuating between that of Trump and that of Atamanuik ― but always with Atamanuik behind the mental control panel. It was “mixing and free-styling” in real-time.“I wouldn’t disappear,” he said. “I would just simply allow another part of myself to show up.”Atamanuik struck a chord with his savage impersonation of the reality TV show host. He soon portrayed the character in a mock debate at UCB, facing off against Bernie Sanders, played with pitch-perfect curmudgeon flair by master impressionist James Adomian. The pair was a hit. They took their cartoonish duo on the road across the country, onto a Fusion TV special and on the late-night Comedy Central show “@midnight.”During the debate tour, Atamanuik spotted HuffPost’s Global Editorial Director Howard Fineman at a bar in Manchester, New Hampshire. Being a political “fanboy,” he approached the frequent MSNBC commentator, introduced himself and invited Fineman to one of his mock face-offs. Fineman wound up moderating a live recording of “Trump vs. Bernie” in Brooklyn, and currently serves as Senior Political Consultant on “The President Show.”“Anthony is not only a great comedian, impersonator and improv guy, he’s a political junkie who knows the minute-by-minute stuff, the morality of the issues, and the history,” said Fineman.Sometimes the depth of Atamanuik’s political knowledge catches the political guru by surprise.“He tells me things about, say, Richard Nixon, that I don’t know. Or voting rights. Or the budget,” Fineman added.He pointed out something central about Atamanuik’s presidential portrayal. “Improv has given him an acute feel for the personalities of politicians, who, after all, are live performers,” noted Fineman. “All of that is why his Trump is so layered, funny and unnervingly spot-on.”And indeed, Atamanuik captures something that’s so deep and dark about the current president, it’s uncanny.The actor, in developing characters, picks three or so essential attributes that he finds interesting and uses his improvisation skills to shape them. With Trump, he treated the role like any other part, watching the candidate’s rallies and reading up on him.Atamanuik also reached into his own past, mining personal experiences to render the unflattering personality quirks of his fictitious chief executive.“I had a period of my life when I was a young guy, and like any young person, I screwed up, like anyone did, and I definitely got a little into harder narcotics, and I was moving around with a lot of women,” Atamanuik said. “Kind of going over the edge.”“So I understood that sense of indulgence and entitlement and I understood the idea of recklessness and not worrying about what the impact of your behavior is, you know, on other people, and just simply pushing forward,” he continued. “I understood, as you would say, being ‘braggadocious.’”“Braggadocious” is certainly an operative word in any discussion of the current president, and Atamanuik saw it in his past self as well as in others. In the mid-2000s, he worked at a Times Square pizzeria, where the owner displayed some of that Trump-like self-regard.“He was very Trump-y, just very sort of grandiose, and wanted everyone to love him, and ... didn’t really know what he was doing, didn’t know how to run a business, but he traded purely on his personality,” Atamanuik recalled. “And so I sort of borrowed from my experience, and I borrowed from my own psyche, and sort of also watched him.”Atamanuik’s Trump, like the real thing, is a deeply insecure figure ― an immature child with the confidence of a god and a shocking level of selfishness. His complete lack of impulse control is always on full display, as exemplified by the aptly-named “President Show” segment “Screaming at the TV!,” in which Atamanuik’s Trump literally watches TV news clips and yells at the television set like an angry second-grader ― an absurd premise drawn straight from the real thing.Ultimately, the point of the exercise, whether Atamanuik was debating onstage or, as he is now, sitting behind the desk in his televised Oval Office, is to defang Trump, now at the pinnacle of power.“The most important thing is to litigate him, rob him of his macho identity and try to replace it with the person who I think he is, which is a little more weak and petty and a little more self-involved and self-loathing,” he explained.The mission statement, combined with Atamanuik’s buffoonish impression, makes for a character that is equal parts repulsive and endearing.On Nov. 8, 2016, an American day that will live in infamy, Atamanuik was in Trump-mode, appearing on ABC’s “The View” election night special in character. Once the direction of the evening became clear, Atamanuik had to throw all his material ― built around an assumed Hillary Clinton victory ― out the window and take an improvised detour. This wasn’t how the night was supposed to go.“I kind of shut down for like three or four weeks [after Trump’s election],” he remembers. “I mean, my wife can tell you. I’d sit in the house and play video games for weeks and just was like, what am I gonna do?”For Atamanuik, Trump was never a character he wanted to be stuck with. Optimistically, he’d hoped to depart from the repugnant businessman-turned-politician, perhaps parlaying his recent successes into a chance to take something like “The Tony & Johnny Show!” to the small screen.Even while achieving success by taking Trump on the road and on TV, he felt it was in some ways a “deal with the devil,” where he was profiting from the exploitation of Trump’s clown show, although not in the deeply self-serving way that TV news outlets were profiting from Trump’s daily slime.“It’s not lost on me that I, too, was a participant in that,” Atamanuik said.But by using Trump as a vessel to satirize and critique a broad set of issues, including the hypocrisy of cable news–owning corporate conglomerates and liberal self-righteousness, Atamanuik was able to make peace with his creation.“I have no issue with turning to my own kind, you know, saying to people who agree with me, ‘You guys have your head in the sand,’” he said.Atamanuik was ultimately able to keep his “nose clean” by finding a balance that utilized the character for the greater good. “I didn’t use my Trump to reinforce him. I used my Trump to co-opt him to put a message out that actually undermined him,” he explained.When it comes to Trump loyalists, Atamanuik has no illusions. He knows from talking with Republican family members and right-wing guests on his show the value of civil communication, but there are some people that he will never reach.“I know some hard-core sort of, like, blind, crazy Twitter-troll Trumper is not going to see what I see,” he admitted.Nevertheless, if there are open minds on the other side, he hopes to impart the basic hypocrisy that underlies Trump’s presidency.“I can say to someone, ‘Hey listen, I don’t think we need to change what you think, or what you feel or how you see the world,’ because that’s not my job, but what I can say is that the person who you’re putting your eggs in their basket ... they’re not doing the thing that you wanna do to even represent your ideals.”After some post-election wallowing, Pally, his old Death by Roo Roo friend, shook him out of it backstage during an “ASSSSCAT” performance, encouraging him to do something with the Trump character.Together with Pally and Grosz, Atamanuik talked out a project, and the group pitched it around. It would be a weekly late-night show hosted by “the president” and set in the White House, actively satirizing the current administration. A supportive Comedy Central picked it up, and “The President Show” was born.When it came time to put together a writing staff, Atamanuik knew how important it was to have a diverse group behind the scenes. He wanted to have “every voice represented” if they were to effectively tackle the Trump administration.“I wanted at least an equal or majority-female writing staff because I think women understand Trump’s voice so much,” he reasoned.Atamanuik recalled complimenting his head writer, Christine Nangle, on how well she writes the president’s utterances, and her explaining how often she hears Trump’s voice in other men. “They hear it from every man they meet, basically,” he said.In his estimation, the team makes the show the “antithesis” of the real White House. “We’re like a diverse, connected group of people, of artists, of every stripe, and every person in that building makes the show good, and without them I’m no good.”Before “The President Show,” Atamanuik worked for years in a small role on “30 Rock,” which he saw as a kind of graduate school in working on TV.“From Tina Fey as a boss, I took that you’re respectful of people, you’re respectful of your writers, you’re friendly with everyone, you approach people with loving kindness,” he noted. Now that he has his own show, he doesn’t understand why anyone would want it otherwise.“This is your opportunity to make this great thing with these people,” Atamanuik said. “Why would you approach it in any other way than with complete openness and love?”Watching the show, it’s clear that this approach works creatively. And with evidently solid ratings, a pleased Comedy Central recently ordered a fresh round of episodes.A week working on “The President Show” is full of long hours and constant change.

Trump (as hard as it may be to believe), but part of a fictitious segment called “Donny Goes Home” from “The President Show,” the Comedy Central series starring Anthony Atamanuik with Peter Grosz playing Vice President Mike Pence.Atamanuik, with his pitch-perfect Trump impression, is at the center of something unlike anything else on TV: a comic send-up that imagines the now president and former “Apprentice” star hosting another TV show, this one a weekly late-night series in which he holds court with the American people directly from the Oval Office.

We don’t have to look at our history,” Atamanuik asserted. As he put it, American citizens safely ignore the “ill that our society is built on,” preferring to remain in a state of blissful ignorance and repression. By addressing this ill head-on and “putting a fun spin” on it, Atamanuik said it’s possible to understand it in a deeper way and “have ownership and authorship over how it gets presented.”The Upright Citizens Brigade veteran often explored uncomfortable themes in his shows at the New York City improv theater.“Some things were very dark,” he explained. “I delighted in showing sort of the dark edges of us and our society and myself and ideas, you know, that circulate in our world now.”His penchant for deconstructing the disturbing with humor, a thread that runs from his time at UCB to his current show’s fictitious Oval Office, all started in Atamanuik’s native Massachusetts. Born in the town of Topsfield and raised in the city of Chelsea, his family lived in a double-decker house — he lived downstairs with his mother and stepfather, who were often away teaching and studying for a doctorate, respectively, while his grandparents lived upstairs. He spent a good amount of time with his grandparents, who owned what was ― in the early 1980s ― a cutting-edge technology: cable TV.“I’m like weirdly almost multi-generational because I spent so much time with [my grandparents], so like I watched ‘Burns and Allen’ and ‘Dick Van Dyke’ and ‘Your Show of Shows,’” Atamanuik recollected.Even in this classic comedy fare, Atamanuik recognized a disconcerting edge.“If you go back and actually watch a lot of those, they’re very dark. You know, ‘Jack Benny’ is a dark show,” he said. “There’s a lot of darkness there.

Inspired by the legends behind the Muppets, he began to envision an artistic path for himself through comedy, becoming less interested in making his way through the tedious hierarchy of the motion picture industry.In 2000, Atamanuik moved to New York, where he eventually landed at the UCB theater after a year-and-a-half stint of classes at the now-defunct Gotham City Improv, “because the classes were $50 cheaper than UCB.” He’d seen shows at UCB starring future collaborators like Curtis Gwinn, John Gemberling and “President Show” executive producer Adam Pally, and had been impressed by how “cool” the place was. He took classes there and wound up on a Harold improv team, performing three to four times a week while waiting tables to pay the bills.Atamanuik ended up joining the existing improv team Death by Roo Roo, which included Gemberling, Gwinn and Pally, along with Brett Gelman, Jackie Clarke and Neil Casey.“Not to be too grandiose,” said Atamanuik, “but that was, I think, one of the best improv teams that’s existed.”Another of his exploits at UCB was the recurring “Tony & Johnny Show!,” which Atamanuik said was billed as “the worst variety show you’ll ever see.” Onstage, Atamanuik and “Johnny” Gemberling explored dark themes and had stand-up comics fill in empty spots of time. Some of those performers, such as Rae Sanni and Noah Garfinkel, wound up on the writing staff of “The President Show.”By Atamanuik’s account, the show was made up of “sort of punk rock stuff” that sometimes “alienated the audience,” including a sketch that parodied “The Nutty Professor” starring a character named “Buddy Fuck” (a take on “Buddy Love”) that satirized Catholic molestation scandals. For the performers, “The Tony & Johnny Show!” was “a resource center where everyone showed up and just tried out shit.”All of the comedian’s past performing experiences came together in a way he couldn’t have envisioned in 2015.

It was “mixing and free-styling” in real-time.“I wouldn’t disappear,” he said. “I would just simply allow another part of myself to show up.”Atamanuik struck a chord with his savage impersonation of the reality TV show host. He soon portrayed the character in a mock debate at UCB, facing off against Bernie Sanders, played with pitch-perfect curmudgeon flair by master impressionist James Adomian. The pair was a hit. They took their cartoonish duo on the road across the country, onto a Fusion TV special and on the late-night Comedy Central show “@midnight.”During the debate tour, Atamanuik spotted HuffPost’s Global Editorial Director Howard Fineman at a bar in Manchester, New Hampshire. Being a political “fanboy,” he approached the frequent MSNBC commentator, introduced himself and invited Fineman to one of his mock face-offs. Fineman wound up moderating a live recording of “Trump vs. Bernie” in Brooklyn, and currently serves as Senior Political Consultant on “The President Show.”“Anthony is not only a great comedian, impersonator and improv guy, he’s a political junkie who knows the minute-by-minute stuff, the morality of the issues, and the history,” said Fineman.Sometimes the depth of Atamanuik’s political knowledge catches the political guru by surprise.“He tells me things about, say, Richard Nixon, that I don’t know. Or voting rights. Or the budget,” Fineman added.He pointed out something central about Atamanuik’s presidential portrayal. “Improv has given him an acute feel for the personalities of politicians, who, after all, are live performers,” noted Fineman. “All of that is why his Trump is so layered, funny and unnervingly spot-on.”And indeed, Atamanuik captures something that’s so deep and dark about the current president, it’s uncanny.The actor, in developing characters, picks three or so essential attributes that he finds interesting and uses his improvisation skills to shape them. With Trump, he treated the role like any other part, watching the candidate’s rallies and reading up on him.Atamanuik also reached into his own past, mining personal experiences to render the unflattering personality quirks of his fictitious chief executive.“I had a period of my life when I was a young guy, and like any young person, I screwed up, like anyone did, and I definitely got a little into harder narcotics, and I was moving around with a lot of women,” Atamanuik said. “Kind of going over the edge.”“So I understood that sense of indulgence and entitlement and I understood the idea of recklessness and not worrying about what the impact of your behavior is, you know, on other people, and just simply pushing forward,” he continued. “I understood, as you would say, being ‘braggadocious.’”“Braggadocious” is certainly an operative word in any discussion of the current president, and Atamanuik saw it in his past self as well as in others. In the mid-2000s, he worked at a Times Square pizzeria, where the owner displayed some of that Trump-like self-regard.“He was very Trump-y, just very sort of grandiose, and wanted everyone to love him, and ... didn’t really know what he was doing, didn’t know how to run a business, but he traded purely on his personality,” Atamanuik recalled. “And so I sort of borrowed from my experience, and I borrowed from my own psyche, and sort of also watched him.”Atamanuik’s Trump, like the real thing, is a deeply insecure figure ― an immature child with the confidence of a god and a shocking level of selfishness. His complete lack of impulse control is always on full display, as exemplified by the aptly-named “President Show” segment “Screaming at the TV!,” in which Atamanuik’s Trump literally watches TV news clips and yells at the television set like an angry second-grader ― an absurd premise drawn straight from the real thing.Ultimately, the point of the exercise, whether Atamanuik was debating onstage or, as he is now, sitting behind the desk in his televised Oval Office, is to defang Trump, now at the pinnacle of power.“The most important thing is to litigate him, rob him of his macho identity and try to replace it with the person who I think he is, which is a little more weak and petty and a little more self-involved and self-loathing,” he explained.The mission statement, combined with Atamanuik’s buffoonish impression, makes for a character that is equal parts repulsive and endearing.On Nov. 8, 2016, an American day that will live in infamy, Atamanuik was in Trump-mode, appearing on ABC’s “The View” election night special in character. Once the direction of the evening became clear, Atamanuik had to throw all his material ― built around an assumed Hillary Clinton victory ― out the window and take an improvised detour. This wasn’t how the night was supposed to go.“I kind of shut down for like three or four weeks [after Trump’s election],” he remembers. “I mean, my wife can tell you. I’d sit in the house and play video games for weeks and just was like, what am I gonna do?”For Atamanuik, Trump was never a character he wanted to be stuck with. Optimistically, he’d hoped to depart from the repugnant businessman-turned-politician, perhaps parlaying his recent successes into a chance to take something like “The Tony & Johnny Show!” to the small screen.Even while achieving success by taking Trump on the road and on TV, he felt it was in some ways a “deal with the devil,” where he was profiting from the exploitation of Trump’s clown show, although not in the deeply self-serving way that TV news outlets were profiting from Trump’s daily slime.“It’s not lost on me that I, too, was a participant in that,” Atamanuik said.But by using Trump as a vessel to satirize and critique a broad set of issues, including the hypocrisy of cable news–owning corporate conglomerates and liberal self-righteousness, Atamanuik was able to make peace with his creation.“I have no issue with turning to my own kind, you know, saying to people who agree with me, ‘You guys have your head in the sand,’” he said.Atamanuik was ultimately able to keep his “nose clean” by finding a balance that utilized the character for the greater good. “I didn’t use my Trump to reinforce him. I used my Trump to co-opt him to put a message out that actually undermined him,” he explained.When it comes to Trump loyalists, Atamanuik has no illusions. He knows from talking with Republican family members and right-wing guests on his show the value of civil communication, but there are some people that he will never reach.“I know some hard-core sort of, like, blind, crazy Twitter-troll Trumper is not going to see what I see,” he admitted.Nevertheless, if there are open minds on the other side, he hopes to impart the basic hypocrisy that underlies Trump’s presidency.“I can say to someone, ‘Hey listen, I don’t think we need to change what you think, or what you feel or how you see the world,’ because that’s not my job, but what I can say is that the person who you’re putting your eggs in their basket ... they’re not doing the thing that you wanna do to even represent your ideals.”After some post-election wallowing, Pally, his old Death by Roo Roo friend, shook him out of it backstage during an “ASSSSCAT” performance, encouraging him to do something with the Trump character.Together with Pally and Grosz, Atamanuik talked out a project, and the group pitched it around. It would be a weekly late-night show hosted by “the president” and set in the White House, actively satirizing the current administration. A supportive Comedy Central picked it up, and “The President Show” was born.When it came time to put together a writing staff, Atamanuik knew how important it was to have a diverse group behind the scenes. He wanted to have “every voice represented” if they were to effectively tackle the Trump administration.“I wanted at least an equal or majority-female writing staff because I think women understand Trump’s voice so much,” he reasoned.Atamanuik recalled complimenting his head writer, Christine Nangle, on how well she writes the president’s utterances, and her explaining how often she hears Trump’s voice in other men. “They hear it from every man they meet, basically,” he said.In his estimation, the team makes the show the “antithesis” of the real White House. “We’re like a diverse, connected group of people, of artists, of every stripe, and every person in that building makes the show good, and without them I’m no good.”Before “The President Show,” Atamanuik worked for years in a small role on “30 Rock,” which he saw as a kind of graduate school in working on TV.“From Tina Fey as a boss, I took that you’re respectful of people, you’re respectful of your writers, you’re friendly with everyone, you approach people with loving kindness,” he noted. Now that he has his own show, he doesn’t understand why anyone would want it otherwise.“This is your opportunity to make this great thing with these people,” Atamanuik said. “Why would you approach it in any other way than with complete openness and love?”Watching the show, it’s clear that this approach works creatively. And with evidently solid ratings, a pleased Comedy Central recently ordered a fresh round of episodes.A week working on “The President Show” is full of long hours and constant change. The news cycle, turning over every 24 hours with a new horror or deranged tweet, keeps Atamanuik and the show’s writers on their feet right up until the moment cameras roll.“We’ve had things [go] into the prompter five minutes before we taped,” the comedian revealed. He called the writing process for the show “sedimentary,” explaining that, as the week progresses, “we basically write five shows and layer them on top of each other.”While the in-studio portions are pre-written, each week contains a new pre-recorded field piece, such as the aforementioned “Donny Goes Home,” in which Atamanuik’s Trump revisits his childhood Queens neighborhood. These pieces are a weekly showcase for Atamanuik’s brilliant improvisation talents, as well as those of Grosz, whose Pence is the Ed McMahon to Trump’s Johnny Carson.But even during the writing process, his improv skills come into play. Often, in a throwback to his days touring for the “Trump vs. Bernie” debates, he’ll stand behind a podium improvising while his writers take and give notes. This official-seeming touch extends to the entire operation.“I said early on let’s just treat this like an alternate White House,” Atamanuik explained. “So like my office is technically like the Oval Office, and my EPs are my closest advisers, and the writers are in the Cabinet, you know? And not that we play, you know, role playing, but we try to sort of just approach it that way.”Atamanuik even gets daily briefs and sees the actual president’s daily schedule, trying to get as close to the real thing as he can so the show, as absurd as it is, is grounded in reality. In strange instances of life imitating art, then imitating life, Atamanuik has even made eerie, inadvertent predictions on the show that have come to pass in Washington.In the show’s first episode, for example, Atamanuik, as Trump, quipped: “I’m the president, can you believe it?” Then, exactly one week later, in a Rose Garden address celebrating the passage of a House health care bill, the real-life Trump exclaimed, “Hey, I’m president! Can you believe it?”Atamanuik took the cue and began using the phrase to kick off every episode.“The President Show” writers come up with an explicit theme for each week’s episode, which the fake Trump lays out during his opening press conferences. These days, even though distractions are too multitudinous to count, Trump’s real administration does the same, whether it be “Infrastructure Week” or “Energy Week.” On a recent episode, Atamanuik’s team again took advantage of reality mimicking fiction by simply parroting the same theme as the White House, “Made in America.”The tonal blend of real current events and warped, live-action cartoon, the on-set camaraderie, and the lessons and sensibilities from Atamanuik’s past and the political present combine to make for a piece of entertainment that is less traditional and more “punk rock,” as Atamanuik might put it. From his perspective, it’s subversively sneaking “basement art house comedy” onto corporate-owned TV ― a renegade, UCB-like performance beamed into American living rooms via Viacom.Reveling in his current success and enjoying the high-profile platform, Atamanuik isn’t thinking too much about what comes next in his comedic journey.“I mean, I’m generally in the present, because that’s, you know, sort of improv 101: Stay in the present. And also just that life is too overwhelming to try to think about more than that.”In a time of “alternative facts” and unprecedented cynicism, Atamanuik and his merry band of pranksters are doing something entirely uncynical. Even joyful.“We’re having a great time,” he affirmed. After watching him and his skilled TV family take on Trump each week, that much is crystal clear.“People seem to like it,” he observed. “So that’s good.”"

There was information that he had been radicalized,” he said.“As far as we know ... there were no grounds to assess him as an immediate danger. He was a suspected Islamist and was recorded as such in the appropriate systems, not as a jihadist but as an Islamist.”Prosecutors said the attacker pulled a 20-centimetre knife from a shelf at the supermarket and stabbed three people inside and four outside before passers-by threw chairs and other objects at him, allowing police to arrest him.A 50-year-old man died of his injuries. None of the other six people injured in the attack is in a life-threatening condition.Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term in office in September. Her decision in 2015 to open Germany’s doors to more than one million migrants has sparked a debate about the need to spend more on policing and security.Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri, who could not be deported because he lacked identification documents, carried out his attack at a Christmas market in Berlin in December after security agencies stopped monitoring him because they could not prove suspicions that he was planning to purchase weapons.(Reporting by Frank Witte in Hamburg; Writing by Joseph Nasr in Berlin; Editing by Andrew Bolton)"
