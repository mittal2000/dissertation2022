Bland, 28, had just moved to Texas to start a new job when she was pulled over for failing to signal in July 2015. The routine traffic stop led to the officer forcibly removing her from her vehicle and arresting her after he said that she assaulted him. She was taken to jail and, three days later, found dead in her cell. Investigators reported that her autopsy findings were consistent with suicide. Bland’s family received a $1.9 million wrongful death settlement in September. It was the first time the family testified in court since Bland’s death, as lawmakers only meet once every two years. About 35 people signed up to testify on the bill. Bland’s mother was the final witness.“I need this bill to move forward so that it will prove to people who say that Texas is the most awful state to live in. And to me that’s true, because Texas is a place of pain for me,” she told lawmakers. “So I need you to think about what you have the power and ability to do today.”Reed-Veal, who lives in Chicago, stressed to the House homeland security committee that the bill aims to ensure that cops aren’t abusing their power against citizens and that it is not an anti-police bill. The legislation is up against some opposition from local police associations, which oppose provisions in the Sandra Bland Act that will prohibit cops from arresting those who commit low-level misdemeanors that are punishable only by fines, The Associated Press reported. In addition, Republicans have prioritized police protections after the sniper killing of five Dallas officers in July. Houston Democrat Garnet Coleman, the author of the legislation, admitted the bill was filed with a “bias against police.” But he said that he wants to work with law enforcement groups to negotiate changes. “This isn’t a punitive bill on the police or peace officers,” Coleman told the Chronicle. “But do we want to get at things that have been pervasive in law enforcement? Yeah, we do.”The bill has less than two months to make it to Gov. Greg Abbott before the Texas Legislature adjourns until 2019."

2,ARTS & CULTURE,Sylvia Plath Alleged Abuse By Ted Hughes In Unpublished Letters,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sylvia-plath-ted-hughes-abuse_us_58ee2829e4b0ca64d91adb2e,One letter reportedly claims that her husband beat her just days before she suffered a miscarriage.,2017-04-12,"Sylvia Plath, who died at 30 in 1963, reportedly made shocking allegations about her husband in the years before her death.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee2c721b0000330016b1a6.jpeg?cache=Cgtsx2hIO2&ops=crop_8_422_2218_1610%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The tumultuous marriage between Sylvia Plath and British poet Ted Hughes is the stuff of literary legend. Now evidence has surfaced suggesting that the union’s problems went far deeper than infidelity and heartbreak.According to The Guardian, unpublished letters Plath sent to her former therapist, Dr. Ruth Barnhouse, allege that Hughes beat her just days before she miscarried their second pregnancy. Another letter alleges that her husband told her that he wished she were dead.The letters, dated between February 1960 and February 1963, span the turbulent end of her marriage. In 1962, Plath discovered that Hughes had been carrying on an affair with Assia Wevill, a friend of theirs. The couple separated by the end of 1962, while Wevill and Hughes continued their romance more openly. On February 11, 1963, Plath died by suicide.Though the couple had been separated, Plath’s death left her husband in control of her literary legacy. He oversaw the publication of her poetry, including her famous and searing collection Ariel, much of which was written in the final years of her life. Scholars have been left to pick through her raw, impassioned verses for clues as to her psychological state, as more personal descriptions of her later years have been elusive. Hughes claimed her journals from the years immediately preceding her death had been lost, later telling The Paris Review that he did destroy “one journal that covered maybe two or three months, the last months. And it was just sad. I just didn’t want her children to see it, no. Particularly her last days.”Dr. Barnhouse also claimed, before her death, that she had destroyed her letters from Plath. Instead, says feminist scholar Harriet Rosenstein, Barnhouse gave them to her as material for a never-completed biography of the poet. Last month, Rosenstein put them up for sale, via bookseller Ken Lopez, as part of a large archive, priced at $875,000, assembled during her research for the nascent book. The letters to Dr. Barnhouse run to 45 pages, Lopez told The Telegraph, and contain “very dramatic and very personal” revelations.Though the exact content of the letters remain unpublished, several Plath scholars told The Guardian that they’re eager to unpack these long-lost personal writings. “These letters look as though they could fill certain gaps in our knowledge,” biographer Andrew Wilson said.Carol Hughes, the widow of Ted Hughes, stated to The Guardian that “The claims allegedly made by Sylvia Plath [...] are as absurd as they are shocking to anyone who knew Ted well.”Many Plath fans, however, have long held Hughes culpable in his wife’s emotional deterioration and eventual suicide. Hughes, who died in 1998, took pains to obscure or downplay his late wife’s more shocking journals and verses, telling The Paris Review that “[s]he thought of her journals as working notes for some ultimate novel” rather than faithful accounts of her life. The allegations contained in her letters to her former psychiatrist, which reportedly detail physical as well as emotional abuse, only stand to deepen the long-standing antagonism of feminist readers toward Hughes."

Melding his established talents with his passion for philanthropy, the 50-year-old designer has given a hotel suite in one of Los Angeles’s storied boutique hotels a super-glam makeover for an amazing cause. The (RED)-inspired suite at the Andaz West Hollywood, which began welcoming guests March 9, is aimed at giving its occupants “the most glamorous, luxurious vacation they could ever imagine,” he said. But, as Adler told The Huffington Post, the new suite represents more than just rest and relaxation. Thirty percent of the room rate, which ranges from $519 to $849 a night, will be donated to (RED), the HIV/AIDS advocacy organization founded by U2’s Bono and Bobby Shriver. While Adler supports a number of humanitarian causes, including cancer research and animal rescue efforts, he believes the fight against HIV/AIDS remains critical. “I came of age during the AIDS crisis,” he told HuffPost, “and my hubby Simon Doonan lost so many friends and coworkers to the disease, so it’s a cause that remains close to my heart.”Like many Los Angeles hotspots, the Andaz West Hollywood is perhaps most associated with celebrity clientele. Part of the Hyatt Hotels and Resorts family, the hotel was previously known as the Continental Hyatt House but dubbed the “Riot House,” and a favorite hangout for The Rolling Stones and The Doors in the 1960s and ‘70s. (Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant’s iconic “I am a golden god” photo, which later inspired a scene in 2000’s “Almost Famous,” was snapped from one of the hotel’s balconies.) Adler said he nodded to that rock ‘n’ roll history in his design for the suite. “I wanted to create a suite that was louche and luxurious and a little bit sybaritic... I want every space I design to have a sense of place and to make you feel like the most eccentric, glamorous version of yourself.”Maryam Banikarim, who is Hyatt’s chief marketing officer, told HuffPost that Adler’s “eclectic” style was the “perfect” choice for the suite. We’ve had a long relationship with (RED) – there’s a lot of great history there and we’ve been looking for ways to collaborate for quite some time,” she said. Adler, she added, “was totally into the rock ‘n roll history of the hotel and was super passionate about getting involved.”In the end, Adler said he’ll be proud if the suite reinvigorates guests’ fervor in the fight against HIV/AIDS, even in some small way. “The biggest misconception,” he said, “is that it’s over.”Take a peek inside the Andaz (RED) suite below.

6,ENTERTAINMENT,Colbert Staff Throws Pizza Parties When It Crushes 'Tonight Show' Ratings,Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-colbert-staff-pizza-beat-jimmy-fallon-ratings_us_58ee37d4e4b0df7e20471e16,The show’s political tone has given it an edge over its competition.,2017-04-12,Stephen Colbert has been edging out late-night host Jimmy Fallon in the ratings wars for weeks now.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee3b261800002100b5f40e.jpeg?cache=y9lcLdGO8J&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A year ago, Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” was lagging behind Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show” by more than 1 million viewers.Since President Donald Trump’s election in November, however, American viewers seem to prefer Colbert’s brand of politically-charged humor to Fallon’s lighthearted jokes. “Late Show” ratings have been up ever since they began inching above Fallon’s numbers in January.As a result, Colbert’s staff has been enjoying some top-notch grub.The staff is rewarded with pizza on Tuesdays if it beats Fallon ― the usual champion ― in Nielsen’s ratings, according to The New York Times. That means they’ve been chowing down on some cheesy goodness for the past 10 weeks.“Throughout the offices of ‘The Late Show,’ staff members could be heard saying, ‘Pizza! Pizza!’” observes the Times in its profile on Colbert. Fallon’s “Tonight Show” received strong backlash in September when the host invited Trump on his show. Rather than confronting the then–Republican nominee about his campaign, built on xenophobic promises, the awkward interview featured softball questions and Fallon tousling Trump’s hair.In contrast, “The Late Show” has been relentless in its lampooning of the president and his administration ― apparently satisfying audience demand for political talk. (The late-night host also shared his very raw reaction to Trump’s win during a live special of his show.)But Colbert told the Times that he doesn’t think his ratings spike has had anything to do with Fallon’s lackluster Trump interview. “The theory that that hair tousle made a difference is based on the supposition that Jimmy’s fans went to him for political acumen,” Colbert told the Times. “I don’t think so. They go there for fun. They go there for his nature, his spirit.”Aw, just steal a pizza our hearts, Colbert!"
7,RELIGION,Suspect Charged In Vandalism Of Jewish Community Center During Passover,Hayley Miller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazi-jewish-community-center-church-passover_us_58ee2a6ee4b0df7e2046fc85,A church located a mile down the road was also defaced with anti-Semitic graffiti.,2017-04-12,"A man scrubs anti-Semitic graffiti from the Jewish Community Center of Northern Virginia in Fairfax, Virginia, on April 11, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee35941800002000b5f3f4.jpeg?ops=crop_1270_1763_1754_1187%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Authorities have arrested a suspect in connection with the anti-Semitic graffiti spray-painted on a Jewish community center and a church in northern Virginia earlier this week during Passover.Dylan M. Mahone, 20, of Annandale, Virginia, has been charged with two counts of felony destruction of property, according to a Fairfax County Police Department statement released on Thursday.Mahone is accused of defacing the Jewish Community Center of Northern Virginia, in Fairfax, and Little River United Church of Christ, in Annandale, by spray-painting swastikas and hate speech on the buildings’ exteriors and surrounding properties.Mahone’s arrest was part of an investigation initiated by the Northern Virginia Community College Police on March 20 for anti-Semitic flyers that were posted on the school’s campus.Local police were alerted around 7 a.m. on Tuesday that swastikas and hate speech had been spray-painted on the grounds of the two religious centers. They believe the buildings were defaced between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. Tuesday.Jeff Dannick, the executive director of JCCNV, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the vandalism, adding that the timing of the attack was especially unsettling.“During Passover, when the Jewish community around the world is celebrating a time of freedom for our people as well as those who are affected by hate today, a crime like this heightens the reason that organizations like our own exist to bring communities together through messages and actions of peace, acceptance and inclusion,” Dannick said in a statement on Tuesday.Despite the hateful nature of the vandalism, which was the first anti-Semitic attack against JCCNV in 27 years, Dannick remains optimistic about the center’s future and said he’s “very confident” in the ability of the FBI and local police to conduct thorough investigations into the matter.“I don’t feel like we’re in danger per se, but I feel like we’re in very, very confusing and frightening times,” Dannick said. “We’re determined to maintain [JCCNV] as a warm and welcoming place. We’re not going to be deterred from continuing to do what we do.” Little River United Church of Christ was defaced during Holy Week in the days leading up to Good Friday and Easter. The Reverend David Lindsey said the vandalism was “heartbreaking” but not terribly surprising, given the church’s progressive stance on social issues and its long history of inclusivity.He said the exterior classroom walls of a preschool were desecrated, as well as several other areas of the property. Someone spray-painted over a banner that read “Honor God. Say NO to anti-Muslim bigotry” with the words “Jesus knows no traitors.”“To me, saying ‘no’ to bigotry sounds pretty reasonable,” Lindsey said. “But saying anything in support of Muslims and, in some cases, in support of the Jewish community, will cause folks with white supremacist or Nazi sympathies to target you for an attack.”A power-washing company began removing the graffiti on Tuesday, and dozens of volunteers came to the church Wednesday to help clean.The Jewish community has experienced a rise in anti-Semitic abuse in recent months. Since the start of 2017, at least 80 JCCs in the U.S. and 10 Jewish day schools have received a total of more than 120 bomb threats. A 19-year-old Israeli-American accused of making the majority of the threats was arrested last month. In February and March, vandals knocked over hundreds of headstones in Jewish cemeteries in New York, Pennsylvania and Missouri. Not even Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and close confidant, is immune from the apparent surge in anti-Semitism. He’s been targeted by internet trolls in a wave of online attacks since assuming more responsibility in Trump’s administration.A community vigil at the church, in coordination with JCCNV, is scheduled for Saturday at 7:30 p.m. All are welcome to attend, Lindsey said.“Not that you ever want anything like this to happen, but there’s some hope in the midst of this that we’ll build deeper bonds of community,” Lindsey said. “God’s love is for everyone. ... Attacks like this are not going to stop us.”This story was updated with news of Dylan M. Mahone’s arrest."

Smithsonian officials invited South Carolina resident Isabell Meggett Lucas and her family to look at the small two-room cabin where she was born, which is now on view in the museum’s “Slavery and Freedom” exhibit, according to NBC News. The cabin, where Lucas’ family of 11 lived during her childhood, once stood on a plot on Edisto Island, South Carolina. It was originally owned by Point of Pines Plantation slave owner Charles Bailey, who housed slaves in it from 1853 until 1861. Lucas, who lived in the cabin from birth to age 19, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that she hadn’t known as a child that it had once been a slave cabin ― it was simply home. “It’s my home. We all lived there together and we were happy,” Lucas said.The full-circle nature of Lucas and her family’s visit isn’t lost on the people behind the exhibit. “This is the most beautiful thing that could’ve happened ― the Meggetts coming forward and visiting us and sharing these stories with us,” said Nancy Bercaw, a curator for the museum.The Smithsonian’s Museum of African American History and Culture opened to the public in September."

Critics say these laws, a relic of the failed war on the drugs, are unnecessary, costly and inhumane. But Jeff Sessions did not fully get on board with reform when he was a prosecutor or when he was a senator. And now that he’s U.S. Attorney General, Sessions could require federal prosecutors to seek the most serious charge in every case ― which may trigger lengthy mandatory minimum sentences for low-level defendants. The Obama administration’s Justice Department elected to no longer pursue mandatory minimums for certain low-level drug offenders, and it touted in 2015 that federal drug prosecutors were moving away from seeking minimums “at record rates.” Those changes contributed to a drop in the federal prison population for the first time in decades at a time when the system was facing an overcrowding crisis. However, Sessions is expected to go in a different direction. He’s tapped Steven Cook, a prosecutor who says the federal criminal justice system is working just fine, for a key role in Sessions’ new Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety, which will re-evaluate the federal government’s response to crime. As The Washington Post reports, Cook previously headed the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, a group that opposed Obama administration efforts to implement sentencing reforms. Sessions and Cook could re-emphasize the deployment of the across-the-board sentences Congress established for certain federal crimes, rather than allow prosecutors more discretion in charging decisions. Mandatory minimums are controversial because they amount to a one-size-fits-all approach to punishment — which exacerbates racial disparities in sentencing. And they don’t allow judges to take individual circumstances into account. A 46-year-old man who allegedly sold $1,800 worth of painkillers to an informant, for example, faced a minimum 25-year prison sentence under Florida law in 2013. A 17-year-old who sold crack was sentenced to life in federal prison until his sentence was commuted by Obama (He now works as a school counselor).Critics blame these laws for ballooning prison populations and for costs to taxpayers. This includes a growing number of Republicans. Conservative Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) have all supported legislation that would reform mandatory minimum sentences. The American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative nonprofit, also has a model policy for states that gives judges discretion to depart from these sentences for certain nonviolent offenders.  “Sessions is grossly out of step with the rest of the party,” said Jessica Jackson Sloan, a human rights attorney who oversees #cut50, a bipartisan initiative to reduce mass incarceration. “It’s very alarming to us to suddenly see that Sessions ... is actually in favor of mandatory minimums and pushing for them so hard,” she added. The attorney general came up as a federal prosecutor in Alabama during the 1980s, a time when the government was starting to take an aggressive approach to drug sentencing. The federal prison population subsequently ballooned from 24,640 inmates in 1980 to 219,298 by 2013. Sessions has pointed to this experience as influencing his views.  “When mandatory minimums are either eliminated or reduced substantially, it reduces the ability of law officers to negotiate and protect the public,” Sessions said at a Senate hearing in 2015. “I’ve been there, I’ve prosecuted cases.”  The DOJ declined to comment on Sessions’ plans for mandatory minimums, but he is known as a criminal justice hardliner: As Alabama attorney general, he called chain gangs “constitutional and proper.” While he backed legislation that lowered, but did not eliminate, the sentencing gap between crack and powder cocaine (which resulted in severe racial disparities), Sessions has largely opposed broader sentencing reforms.It’s clear that President Donald Trump and Sessions are on the same page when it comes to pushing tough-on-crime policies. “If any other Republican presidential candidate won, you’d be looking at a different department,” said Kevin Ring, president of of Families Against Mandatory Minimums.Ring is a former GOP aide on Capitol Hill who was convicted in connection with the Jack Abramoff influence-peddling scandal scandal and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. (Federal prosecutors had asked for much longer). He noted that some reform advocates on the right had been taking a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration, with several hoping that the president would be “malleable” on criminal justice issues. But that’s beginning to shift, he said.“I think people are going through the stages of grief,” Ring said. “Everyone has been so excited about playing offense, trying to pass reform at the federal and state level, that the idea that we’re going to spend four years playing defense has made people want to focus more on state work because that’s where you can actually effect some positive change.” Right on Crime, a conservative criminal justice group, is “definitely not throwing in the towel on federal reform,” said crime policy director Marc Levin. The group and other organizations recently wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee requesting that U.S. Attorney nominees answer questions about their views on key criminal justice issues, Levin said. He noted they’ve had some “good discussions with some folks at the White House,” and claimed that criminal justice reform has support from Trump associates including the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.The Huffington Post reached out to several other prominent conservatives who have advocated for criminal justice reform about Sessions’ views. The offices of Sens. Cornyn, Paul and Lee did not respond to a request for comment. Mark Holden, general counsel for Koch Industries, declined to comment. Spokespeople for Gingrich and Grover Norquist — who last month advocated in support of ending mandatory minimums in Nebraska — also did not respond to requests for comment.Jackson Sloan, the human rights attorney, said it “probably makes more sense for conservatives to work behind the scenes, rather than attacking a leader in their own party’s administration outright.” But at some point, she added, “it becomes obvious that they’re on different sides of the fence.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, as Eastern Europeans who had fought the Soviet Union — many as part of explicitly Nazi or fascist-aligned groups — immigrated to the U.S., GOP officeholders sought their support.Gorka isn’t unique: He “represents a long history, a century, of these types of personalities being given personal status that they never should have earned based on their ideology and their history and their affiliations,” said Russ Bellant, a former reporter who helped expose a previous wave of fascist-aligned GOP officials.In 1968, Richard Nixon, who hoped to get elected by riding the backlash against recent civil rights advances, rapidly changing cultural norms among the youth and anti-authority riots, began aggressively courting recent immigrants who had fled Eastern Europe as the Soviet Union tightened its grip on the region in the 1940s and ‘50s. The Cold War had led the U.S. government to overlook the fascist affiliations of some of these immigrants.Laszlo Pasztor, who came to the U.S. from Hungary during this period, helped set up the National Republican Heritage Groups Council to organize immigrants from Eastern Europe for Nixon in 1968. After Pasztor’s success in that election, Nixon made the council a permanent feature of the Republican National Committee.But Pasztor, who had served two years in a Hungarian prison for his role as a Nazi collaborator, had deep ties to the fascist right. He had served as a youth member of the Arrow Cross Party, the fascist Hungarian regime that collaborated with Nazi Germany from 1944-45, and as a diplomat in Germany. (This is the same Arrow Cross whose recent symbolic re-emergence in right-wing Hungarian politics Gorka has defended.) In his new role leading ethnic outreach, Pasztor would go on to recruit a number of Eastern European immigrants with similar backgrounds.The famed investigative reporter Jack Anderson and his partner Les Whitten were the first to bring attention to the background of those helping get out the vote for Nixon in these white ethnic communities.In a 1971 article titled “Nixon Appears a Little Soft on Nazis,” Anderson revealed Pasztor’s fascist past and, with a tip from Democratic National Committee official William Quinn, exposed another council member, Dr. Joseph Pauco, a Slovakian who was editor-in-chief of a pro-Nazi paper in the 1940s. Anderson also named two other emigres with pro-Nazi histories who had visited Nixon in the White House or received written praise from the president.At the time, the Anti-Defamation League, the leading Jewish group opposed to anti-Semitic prejudice, asked for Pauco’s removal, calling it “inconceivable that a person with Pauco’s appalling record should hold a high level post with the Republican National Committee.”Pauco resigned. Pasztor pleaded with Whitten that he was trying to weed out fascist elements in the ethnic council and stayed on.But in 1988, investigative reporter Bellant took another look at Pasztor’s council and discovered little had changed. Bellant revealed six more members of the ethnic council who had past ties to pro-fascist, pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic political groups.“I think it was really important that Americans know that these people with these war crimes backgrounds were brought into the United States and elevated to leadership,” Bellant, who is now a political activist in Detroit and former Democratic Party candidate for city council, told The Huffington Post. “It’s not just the records of the people themselves but who brought them in and elevated them.”The ADL and Jewish lawyer Alan Dershowitz called for George H.W. Bush, then the Republican presidential nominee, to dismiss people with pro-Nazi pasts from the RNC’s council. At the time, Jewish groups were concerned about continued funding for the Office of Special Investigations in the Department of Justice, which sought to expose and prosecute ex-Nazis living in the U.S. Some of the former Nazi-linked emigres identified by Bellant had been outspoken in their opposition to the office. (The Office of Special Investigations eventually moved on in 2003 to investigate individuals involved in post-World War II human rights abuses and then merged into a new office in 2010.)“It is not enough to accept the resignations of a few handfuls of bigots after they are publicly exposed,” Dershowitz wrote in an op-ed. “The Republican Party must forever rid itself of this cancer within the body politic. There is no room within either major American party for Nazi collaborators or sympathizers.”Pasztor and the others on the campaign with similar past ties to Nazi Germany or fascist politics resigned their positions on the campaign. Bush accepted the resignations, but blamed them on dirty politics practiced by his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis.“We are resigning today from the ‘Coalition of American Nationalities’ and removing ourselves from the controversy because we have been attacked unfairly by George Bush’s political opponents,” the emigres said in a statement in September 1988. In Gorka, the Republican Party now boasts a White House with a national security aide who has clear ties to the next generation of far-right-wing European politics. Gorka has been pictured wearing a medal of the Hungarian Order of Heroes, also known as the Vitézi Rend. The Vitézi Rend is a controversial right-wing group that collaborated with the Nazis in World War II; its members are not allowed to immigrate to the United States. Gorka says that he wears the medal in honor of his late father, Paul Gorka, who received it as “a declaration for his resistance to a dictatorship.” But members of Vitézi Rend claim Gorka is a sworn member, a position he gained from his father’s membership. Gorka denies this. When he worked in Hungarian politics, Gorka was closely associated with far-right, anti-Semitic political parties, including founding his own party with two former members of the openly anti-Semitic Jobbik party. In 2007, he defended his party’s support for the Hungarian Guard, or Magyar Gárda, an anti-Semitic militia that uses the dress and symbols of the Arrow Cross Party. The Hungarian Guard was later banned by the country’s government for its violent and anti-Semitic actions.The new far-right European groups and parties that Gorka has participated in are perhaps best known for their bigotry against Muslims. But they also include anti-Semitic elements and venerate past symbols of native fascist movements that supported the Nazis in World War II.And Gorka is not the only person in the White House with far-right connections. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was intimately involved with far-right-wing parties in Europe when he led the far-right publication Breitbart. Bannon boosted the new far right, including France’s Marine Le Pen of the Front National, which was founded by her father, the Holocaust-denying anti-Semite Jean-Marie Le Pen. Bannon also boosted the Austrian Freedom Party, which was founded by ex-Nazis.Jewish groups and senators have either called for Gorka’s resignation or asked him to clarify his connections to anti-Semitic political parties and groups in Hungary. But they shouldn’t get their hopes up. After all, it took 20 years for the GOP to oust the last group of party officials credibly accused of fascist ties.And even then, these figures did not drift too far from power: When President George W. Bush hosted a 2006 White House screening of the film “Children of Glory,” which depicted events surrounding 1956 Hungarian revolt that was brutally crushed by the Soviet Union, his guest list included one Laszlo Pasztor.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

12,BLACK VOICES,Why Aren't There More Black Teachers? Racial Discrimination Still Plays A Role,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/teacher-racism-black-discrimination_us_58ebdcc2e4b0c89f912083dc,"“I think this is just another example of how ideas about race and racism, to be frank, are deeply embedded in the schools.""",2017-04-12,Having a black teacher in elementary school significantly increases the likelihood that a black student will graduate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee4abf1800002000b5f444.jpeg?cache=chtrqfV88D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Policy surrounding the nation’s shortage of black teachers tends to focus around recruitment or retention. However, new research suggests that those two issues are only part of the problem. The other culprit is blatant racial discrimination. A Harvard Educational Review study looks at the hiring patterns of one large unidentified public school district. Job applicants in this district apply to a central office before human resources sends the relevant resumes to school principals. Principals then set up interviews with applicants and decide to whom they want to extend an offer. In 2012, the black and white teachers who applied for jobs in the district were equally qualified, researchers found. However, white teachers received a disproportional number of job offers. Although 13 percent of job applicants were black, only 6 percent received offers. On the other hand, 70 percent of applicants were white, and 77 percent received offers. Black teachers disproportionately received job offers from schools with black principals. Black teachers were also disproportionately hired in schools with high rates of low-income and minority students. Hispanic and Asians candidates were hired at a proportional rate to the number of applicants, making the imbalance unique to black teachers. District leaders were shocked by the results, said study author and researcher Diana D’Amico, who is an assistant professor at George Mason University. The district prides itself on its effort to recruit minority applicants and “created this story that there’s not more black teachers because black individuals are not applying,” said D’Amico. At first, district leaders suggested that perhaps 2012 had been an unusual year for hiring. But D’Amico found no evidence of this. “I think this is just another example of how ideas about race and racism, to be frank, are deeply embedded in the schools,” said D’Amico. “The other thing is, if there are these racial assumptions that inhibit the hiring of black individuals, I wonder how those same perceptions influence teachers once they’re already in the system.”Indeed, minority teachers tend to have lower rates of retention than their white counterparts. Nationwide, during the 2012-2013 school year, the turnover rate for minority teachers was 19 percent, but only 15 percent for non-minority teachers. The lack of black teachers is a problem in this district and around the country. Although about 15 percent of American students are black, only 8 percent of American teachers are black. The stakes on this issue are high. Numerous studies have indicated that black teachers can have an enormous positive impact on black students. Having a black teacher in elementary school significantly increases the likelihood that a black student will graduate, a recent John Hopkins University study found. The impact is particularly acute for low-income black boys. For this demographic, having at least one black teacher from third through fifth grade reduced the likelihood of later dropping out of school by 39 percent. It’s unclear why having a black teacher early on in life would have such an immense impact on students in high school and beyond.“I speculate these teachers are probably just as good as other teachers but there’s something special about race match effect,” said study co-author and John Hopkins professor Nicholas Papageorge.“There has been a lot of scholarship and research on this idea of the role model effect. This idea that if you’re a poor black boy, you might not have a lot of contact with college educated folks who look like you, and spending a year with a teacher who is also black and who is college educated, might allow them to imagine themselves in that kind of a role, and shift their own expectations and aspirations,” Papageorge told the Huffington Post, although he does not know if the role model effect influenced his study. However, D’Amico thinks that the results of the latest study are problematic for both black and white students, since most black teachers were hired in minority schools. The fact that white students in some schools get nearly zero exposure to black teachers demands further interrogation, she says. “Black teachers are important for black kids, and that almost rationalizes the segregation we see,” said D’Amico. “Aren’t black teachers important for white students too?” "

With her sweet temper and charming sincerity, she became an audience favorite.Letterman also put his mother to work as a foreign correspondent of sorts for the show during the Winter Olympics in 1994, 1998 and 2002.

(You can find it on Amazon.)She went on: “I think it’s about the idea of mom and of a family. People are eager for families to be like they used to be. Even though there are lots of working moms and single-parent families now, you can still be a family in spite of the size and form it takes.” As Letterman, who turned 70 on Wednesday, prepared to retire from his longtime role as host in 2015, he aired a special Mother’s Day montage honoring Mengering. (Catch the clip, which includes a peek at Dave’s Mom’s beer-stocked fridge, below.)Late Tuesday, Letterman’s successor, Stephen Colbert, shared a heartfelt note of condolence over Twitter about Mengering, saying he feels “so grateful that Dave shared her with us.”"
14,POLITICS,White House Slams Russia For Trying To Cover Up Assad’s Chemical Attacks,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/russia-syria-coverup-chemical-attacks_us_58ed1c99e4b0ca64d919e2c4,Senior officials also suggest Russia must have known about the latest gas attack ahead of time.,2017-04-11,"People gather in Izmir, Turkey, on April 7 to remember the Syrians who died in the Assad regime's latest chemical attack.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ed212c1600002000657e59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― While U.S. intelligence has not yet concluded that Russia knew about Syria’s plan to gas civilians ahead of time, senior White House officials said Tuesday that Russia must be pushed on that question.Officials noted the years of close cooperation between the two militaries and the presence of Russian troops at Syrian military bases ― particularly the Shayrat air base that officials said was used to launch the April 4 nerve gas attack that killed close to 100.“We do think that it is a question worth asking the Russians,” said one official, who like the three others spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity. “How is it possible that their forces, who were co-located with the Syrian forces that planned, prepared and carried out this chemical weapons attack, at the same installation did not have foreknowledge?”The White House held the briefing to refute claims being pushed by Russia, Syria and their surrogates in the media ― including such websites as Infowars ― that the attack was either a hoax or the result of a Syrian government airstrike on a chemical weapons store under the control of rebels and terrorists.A second official said there was simply too much corroborating evidence available too quickly for it all to have been disinformation. “It’s just too massive for any intelligence organization to fabricate in that short a time,” the official said. “I think it’s clear the Russians are trying to cover up what happened there.”A four-page memo released Tuesday by the White House, based on declassified intelligence reports, said that Russia’s response to the gas attack is part of a longstanding pattern in Syria. “The Syrian regime and its primary backer, Russia, have sought to confuse the world community about who is responsible for using chemical weapons against the Syrian people in this and earlier attacks,” the memo stated.Officials at the briefing said the sarin gas attack was part of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad’s efforts to punish civilians in territory where rebel forces have been making progress and moving closer to government-held population centers and military bases.Assad previously used sarin and other chemical agents in 2013, leading then-President Barack Obama to threaten military strikes against Assad. Obama backed away from that idea when Congress failed to support it and Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons program. Thousands of pounds of banned weapons were subsequently removed and destroyed under that agreement, which included Russian participation in rounding up the weapons.The second official said Syria’s possession of sarin now calls into question how Russia performed that key role. “This is concerning since Russians were part of the deal where Syria was supposed to give up its chemical weapons. We do know Syria gave up a huge amount of its chemical weapons. Nevertheless, it is clear that Syria’s declaration was not complete,” the official said.The April 4 attack dramatically changed the United States’ public position on Syria. Just days before the strike, both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said that the United States was not concerned with Assad’s continued leadership and that it was up to the people of Syria to determine his fate. That posture reflected the views of President Donald Trump, who had campaigned on the idea of partnering with Russia and possibly Syria to fight the Islamic State terrorist group.The day after the attack, though, Trump said his views about Assad had changed. On the next night, the U.S. Navy launched a cruise missile attack on the Shayrat air base. And the White House’s position became that Assad cannot be part of Syria’s future."
15,POLITICS,Chemical Weapons Almost Certainly Killed Jewish Refugees The U.S. Could Have Taken In,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chemical-weapons-jewish-refugees_us_58ed253be4b0ca64d919f2a8,"So it might be time to rethink the administration's refugee policy, Sean Spicer.",2017-04-11,"Jewish refugees aboard the St. Louis attempt to communicate with friends and relatives in Cuba, who were permitted to approach the docked vessel in small boats.

It was a strange and unfortunate comparison, not least because a) Hitler definitely did use chemical weapons in the Nazis’ notorious gas chambers, and b) some number of Jewish refugees almost certainly died in those chambers during World War II after being turned away by the United States ― much the same way the U.S. is turning its back on Syrian refugees today.“You had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn’t even sink to using chemical weapons,” Spicer said Tuesday during the White House daily press briefing, while discussing yet another chemical attack on Syrian civilians last week. That attack killed almost 100 people and injured 400.The German dictator did, in fact, use gas chambers to exterminate millions of Jews and other people during the Holocaust. Thousands of them might have found refuge in the United States, had President Franklin Roosevelt’s administration not deemed them a threat to national security.In 1939, almost 1,000 refugees, nearly all of them Jewish, were literally denied entry to the U.S. when they approached Miami aboard a German ship called the St. Louis. More than 200 of them later died in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, a bill that would have allowed the U.S. to take in 20,000 Jewish refugee children never made it through Congress. It wasn’t until after the Holocaust ended that the U.S. started to view the assistance of Jewish refugees as a moral obligation.The decision to shoo away Jewish and Syrian refugees alike stems from the “America first” mentality. It was a slogan drummed up to oppose U.S. entry to World War II, created by the leading anti-Semites of the time. President Donald Trump’s electoral campaign revived it, using it to summarize his aim of putting the interests of Americans before those of anyone else.Trump has perpetuated poisonous rhetoric about Syrian refugees ― the very people whose plight he said just last week moved him to strike a Syrian air base. After calling for a Muslim ban during his campaign, Trump and his administration have twice attempted to prevent Syrian refugees from seeking safe haven in the United States. Both travel bans have been partially overturned in federal court, and refugee resettlement has resumed, at least for the moment.But thousands who are still in danger may have to wait months or years before the U.S. accepts their applications.The United States has historically been the No. 1 resettlement country in the world. But legal resettlement accounts for only a tiny fraction of the total number of refugees worldwide, which is higher than it’s been at any time since World War II. About 65 million people are displaced today, 21 million of whom are refugees living in foreign countries, according to the United Nations. "

And he said that’s just fine ― because lawmakers on the Hill are on track to get it done and Trump should just leave those Art of the Deal impulses in a trophy case at Mar-a-Lago.Republican leaders have claimed the White House was including Democrats in talks over spending bills for the rest of this year and for 2018, but Schumer said that was news to him.“I don’t know where they came up with that,” Schumer told reporters on a conference call, adding that he’d had one conversation with White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and that was to tell him Trump’s budget proposal was dead.“I told Director Mulvaney that I thought his budget was so far away from where both Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans — a number of them have called it dead on arrival — that his next year’s budget was sort of a non-starter,” Schumer said.Rather than try to push the White House’s vision, Schumer suggested Mulvaney and Trump leave it to the lawmakers.“I said to him that the best thing he can do is let the four corners ― House Republicans, House Democrats, Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats — negotiate this 2017 budget as well as the 2018 budget, and we might be able to come up with things,” Schumer said. “I said that to [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell as well, and he didn’t argue with me. I said I don’t even know who to negotiate with on 2017, given where their budget is. So there are no negotiations.” McConnell told reporters this past Friday, before Congress left for two weeks, that talks were proceeding and that Democrats would have to be involved in order to pass anything. He was optimistic they would.While Schumer and other top Democrats may not be hearing from the White House, the minority leader was similarly optimistic ― as long as Trump doesn’t decide to practice his art.“We can get this done. We Democrats want to get it done. We hope our Republican colleagues won’t insist on things that force a government shutdown,” Schumer said. “But I think talks are going pretty well right now, and the White House doesn’t have to throw a monkey wrench into it.”"

Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sacred-cod-documentary_us_58ed1547e4b0ca64d919d595,"“Here I am today, a recycler, a bike seller, a furniture maker. I’m 50 years old and I don’t know what the hell I am.""",2017-04-11,Filmmaker David Abel began reporting on the collapse of the cod industry for his day job at The Boston Globe. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ed1718150000210034af23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For 25 years, Sam Sanfilippo hauled nets full of cod from the waters off New England’s coast. Like generations before him, he fished the Gulf of Maine, which stretches south from Nova Scotia to Massachusetts’ scenic eastern tip, an inlet once teeming with so many fish that European settlers named it Cape Cod. But since 2014, when federal regulators cut the cod quota by about 95 percent, fishing jobs have disappeared.“Here I am today, a recycler, a bike seller, a furniture maker. I’m 50 years old and I don’t know what the hell I am,” Sanfilippo says in “Sacred Cod,” a new hour-long documentary slated to air Thursday on Discovery Channel. “I’m tired of dealing with Coast Guards, fish dealers, state police, environmental police,” he adds. “Everywhere you turn, you’re dealing with some sort of law enforcement agency and I don’t want to deal with it. I just want to make a living, an honest living.” The film chronicles the three-year fight between fishermen and federal officials determined to protect the cod population, which has declined by 80 percent over the past decade. Scientists say a combination of overfishing and global warming has prevented the cod from replenishing their schools. Fishermen, by contrast, have accused regulators of relying on bunk science for years. “This way of life that was so integral to our culture and our community is now essentially fading into history,” David Abel, one of the three filmmakers behind “Sacred Cod,” told The Huffington Post last week. “We are losing a whole industry and culture in some respect.”Abel produced the film and served as story director alongside award-winning Time photographer Steve Liss and Andy Laub, who edited, wrote and selected the soundtrack. Discovery Channel bought the documentary last September.The story centers on a familiar clash of interests: blue-collar workers feeling victimized by the decisions of federal bureaucrats, and questioning the science that informs regulations; the collapse of an industry steeped in regional heritage; the struggle to adapt to an economy where fewer and fewer workers spend their whole careers at one job; climate change, and the unwillingness of those whose livelihoods it puts at stake to accept the scientific consensus. For years now, fishermen have accused federal regulators of relying on faulty readings of fish populations. At one point in “Sacred Cod,” a fisherman grabs a cod the size of a small dog from one of his nets. “According to the government, these fish don’t exist,” he says. “We could do this all day long, all year long.” Last year, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) commissioned state scientists to perform their own survey. The state study included 10 times as many cod-detection stations as the earlier federal study, and it increased the time nets trawled the Gulf of Maine looking for cod by 50 percent. The scientists searched deeper waters and used actual fishing industry boats. They performed the survey once a month for a year, up from the federal researchers’ biannual schedule. “The survey took into account all of the fishermen’s concerns,” Abel said.The results, released this month, confirmed the federal finding that the cod population has shrunk by 80 percent over the past decade, reaching a historic low. “The bottom line is that the outlook of Gulf of Maine cod is not good,” Micah Dean, a scientist who oversaw the survey for the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, told Abel, who covered the findings for The Boston Globe, where he works. “What we’ve seen is a warning sign about the future of the fishery, and it’s a stark change from what we saw a decade ago.”Overfishing is just part of the problem. Over the past decade, temperatures in the Gulf of Maine warmed faster than in 99 percent of the rest of the world’s oceans, according to a study released last year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Under certain climate models, the water body could warm by between 5.4 degrees and 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. In 2014, one publication declared the Gulf of Maine “the poster child for global warming.” Faced with findings that back up federal estimates, fishermen have started questioning the very nature of the surveys themselves. Some have begun attacking the concept of random sampling ― the cornerstone technique behind most surveys ― insisting that a survey they themselves helped design was too fundamentally flawed to produce valid results.“They basically were saying it’s not legitimate because they weren’t sampling in the specific areas fishermen wanted them to sample,” Abel said. “An analogy that seems relevant to the basic idea is that if we lost 90 percent of the population of the U.S., but the remaining 10 percent was all in Boston. If you came to Boston looking for Americans, you’d say they’re all over the place.” The fishermen in “Sacred Cod” aren’t the only ones applying tunnel vision to a grim economic picture. President Donald Trump, who has dismissed climate change as “a hoax” and moved to gut federal programs meant to cut greenhouse gas emissions, vowed to boost the U.S. economy by bringing fossil fuels roaring back. In particular, he vowed to revive coal, by far the dirtiest fossil fuel. The coal industry has suffered as cleaner-burning natural gas devoured the electricity market and Chinese demand for U.S. exports nosedived. Yet many, including Trump, blame as-yet-unimplemented regulations by the Obama administration to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants. This, coal executives and their political allies declared, amounted to a “war on coal.” To the extent there was any truth to that idea, industry defeated regulations last month when Trump signed an executive order rolling back a raft of Obama-era climate policies. But even coal executives admit Trump’s policies won’t bring coal back. The advent of less-polluting energy sources, coupled with the depletion of coal seams in the places Trump claims his policies are meant to help, all but assure the fuel’s dimming prospects. The “war on cod” might pan out differently.“Fish populations replenish themselves if we don’t destroy their habitat or catch too many of them,” John Hocevar, who leads Greenpeace’s efforts on cod, told HuffPost. “Coal doesn’t grow back.” Still, he noted that the plight of frustrated, out-of-work cod fishermen echoes that of the coal miners who became such a focus of the last presidential election. “When people’s livelihoods are put at risk because the world is changing around them, they look for someone to blame,” Hocevar said. But “it’s rarely that simple.”“Sacred Cod” airs Thursday, April 13, at 9 p.m. EST/PST on Discovery Channel. "

The lawlessness, the abdication of the duty to enforce our immigration laws, and the catch-and-release practices of old are over.""",2017-04-11,Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday that the Department of Justice would devote more resources to crack down on immigration offenses.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ecd42c150000210034ade3.jpeg?cache=gum5iVYqj5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. attorneys around the country will devote more resources to prosecuting immigration offenses, including illegal re-entry to the country, document fraud, identity theft and smuggling undocumented immigrants across the border, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday. “For those that continue to seek improper and illegal entry into this country, be forewarned: This is a new era,” Sessions told Customs and Border Protection agents and officers in Nogales, Arizona, according to prepared remarks. “This is the Trump era. The lawlessness, the abdication of the duty to enforce our immigration laws, and the catch-and-release practices of old are over.”President Donald Trump vowed to stop unauthorized immigration and expel many undocumented people from the country, and he picked an ally in Sessions, who spent much of his Senate career advocating for tougher enforcement. Now he’s getting his chance and is shaping the Department of Justice’s mission to expand its emphasis on prosecuting undocumented immigrants. Every U.S. attorney’s office in the country ― even far from the border ― will now be required to have a person devoted to coordinating enforcement on immigration, Sessions announced. The policies he laid out are almost exclusively focused on non-violent crimes, such as illegally re-entering the country, entering a fraudulent marriage, document fraud and identity theft. U.S. attorneys will now be required to consider prosecution for each. Every adult apprehended at the border will be detained.Sessions painted the matter in stark terms, saying that gangs and cartels “turn cities and suburbs into war zones, that rape and kill innocent citizens, and who profit by smuggling poison and other human beings across our borders.”“Depravity and violence are their calling cards, including brutal machete attacks and beheadings,” Sessions said in prepared remarks. “It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.”When he delivered the speech, Sessions did not use the word “filth,” saying only “where we first take our stand.” The Department of Justice did not provide details on how these efforts will be funded and whether there will be additional resources so the renewed focus on immigration-related enforcement on nonviolent officials will not lead to lower levels of prosecutions and investigation of other crimes. DOJ spokesman Ian Prior said Trump’s “budget blue print made clear the Department’s commitment to public safety, combatting violent crime, drug trafficking, and illegal immigration” and that further details will be in the agency’s budget “this spring.”Sessions laid out several policy priorities in a memo to all federal prosecutors, titled “Renewed Commitment to Criminal Immigration Enforcement.” Prosecutors will be required to consider prosecution for people who transport or harbor unauthorized immigrants across the border, putting a priority on those who smuggle three or more individuals, he wrote.U.S. attorney’s offices will also crack down on individuals who illegally re-enter the U.S. without authorization. Re-entering the country after a prior removal will be referred for felony prosecution, “especially where indicators of gang affiliation, a risk to public safety, or criminal history are present,” he said. Attorneys must consider prosecution in every instance of an individual re-entering the country without authorization after being removed. They must also consider felony prosecution for individuals with two or more prior misdemeanor convictions for improper entry, or one or more prior misdemeanor convictions if there are certain circumstances, such as prior removals, felonies or gang affiliation, according to the memo. Government attorneys will also consider felony prosecution for individuals who get married to evade immigration laws, Sessions wrote. When possible in these cases, attorneys must pursue charges for document fraud and aggravated identity theft, with a two-year mandatory minimum sentence for the latter. Prosecutors will put a top priority on going after people who assault, resist or impede federal immigration officers, Sessions added. Sessions said the Department of Justice will also ramp up its hiring efforts for immigration judges ― adding 50 this year and 75 next year ― to cut current backlogs that lead to many undocumented immigrants waiting years to have their cases resolved. The attorney general, like other Trump administration officials and the president himself, tied a drop in unauthorized border crossings to the president’s immigration policies. Legal advocates believe part of that drop is due to CBP agents turning away asylum-seekers in violation of international law, which CBP denies. In addition to deportations, the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which is part of the Department of Justice, handles cases for asylum and other relief. “We will execute a strategy that once again secures the border; apprehends and prosecutes those criminal aliens that threaten our public safety; takes the fight to gangs like MS-13 and Los Zetas; and makes dismantlement and destruction of the cartels a top priority,” Sessions said in his speech, according to prepared remarks. “We will deploy a multifaceted approach in these efforts: we are going to interdict your drugs on the way in, your money on the way out, and investigate and prosecute your trafficking networks to the fullest extent of the law.”This article has been updated to reflect that Sessions veered slightly from prepared remarks.

Cost to taxpayers: $22 million.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ec633f1500001f00c78faf.jpeg?cache=w7DYbG5tW3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After racking up an estimated $22 million travel tab in less than three months, Donald Trump is well on his way to spending more in a single year than Barack Obama spent on travel during all eight years of his presidency.Trump has spent 21 days of his 80-day presidency at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, at an estimated cost of $21.6 million in travel and security expenses, CNN reported. In contrast, Obama spent a total of just under $97 million during his entire presidency, according to costs estimated by Judicial Watch.At Trump’s current pace, he will spend $99 million by the end of his first year in office. That would add up to close to $800 million if he served an eight-year term as Obama did.It’s not clear if Trump will continue his frequent trips to the Florida resort as the temperatures rise. Earlier this month, however, he changed his nickname for Mar-a-Lago from the “Winter White House” to the “Southern White House,” signaling that his trips down south wouldn’t be confined to the winter months.Trump’s frequent visits to South Florida have also taken a toll on the area. Last month, Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) asked Trump to help pay for the extra security his visits require, a service that has already cost the community $1.7 million.“Please step up to the plate and help us get this money back,’” said Frankel, per WPBF. “And if you’re unable to do that, consider curtailing your travel.” She suggested Camp David as an alternative.Florida lawmakers have also suggested imposing special taxes on Mar-a-Lago to help defray costs. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw estimated that Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping cost the community $250,000 in police overtime.Taxpayers are also footing the bill for a second presidential residence at Trump Tower in Manhattan, where first lady Melania and son Baron reside. NYPD officials estimated that they spend $500,000 a day on security, CNBC reported.Trump’s inflated travel expenditures have become a particularly touchy subject, given the extensive budget cuts he has proposed. Voters and politicians have even started comparing Mar-a-Lago costs to federal funds that could save a program destined for the chopping block.Trump has often boasted that he doesn’t need vacations and prefers to work. He even blasted Obama’s golfing in tweets some 26 times, and at campaign rallies. Security issues at Mar-a-Lago, which lacks the same protections and visitor vetting as the White House, have also raised concerns. In March, the Government Accountability Office agreed to examine the costs and security issues surrounding Trump’s frequent visits to Mar-a-Lago.Some critics claim that Trump’s frequent trips away from the White House serve to keep his activities far from the public eye. According to Politico, the president was seen chatting with the conservative billionaire Koch brothers, Charles and David, at the resort last weekend."

Video next shows him exiting the building and strolling around the parking lot.Fortunately for General and his family, he was later found resting in a nearby yard and an animal control officer returned him, the animal hospital said in a Facebook post.“He’s a little Houdini,” General’s owner, Travis Campbell, who dropped his pet off at the hospital as his family vacationed out of town, told ABC7 News. “When it comes to doors, he can get a lot of doors open.”As for how General was able to get out the back door, the animal hospital explained on Facebook that the door isn’t locked from the inside, but instead requires a keypad to open from the outside. When General opened it from the inside, he triggered an alarm, which is how they realized he had gotten out."

None of our handful of trips to the city had coincided with productions at the theater. Finally, though, the opera calendar and our travel calendar overlapped, and we spent three nights in Venice in the latter part of March. The show was Bizet’s Carmen, in a riveting production by the Catalan director Calixto Bieito. We’d seen it before, five years ago in London, but were knocked out anew by its power and intelligence. The (mostly) gritty sets, costumes and staging were quite a contrast with the glittering gilt ornamentation covering every square centimeter of the auditorium, whose lively acoustics enhanced the musical experience: We nearly jumped out of our seats at the overture’s opening cymbal crash. The Fenice is a blessedly small theater, and seats sell quickly, but anyone who’s fond of opera should get on line, see what’s playing and try to buy tickets – then, build a trip around the show.Luxurious AccommodationAnother of our unmet Venice wishes had been to stay at the Hotel Danieli, centered on the fourteenth-century Palazzo Dandolo and sprawling over three buildings along the Riva degli Schiavoni, a one-minute walk from Piazza San Marco and convenient to several useful water-bus lines. The vast lobby, with its galleries and stone staircases, used to be the palazzo’s internal courtyard; if you didn’t know it was old, you could be forgiven for thinking it the fantasy of a well-traveled nineteenth-century robber baron. (At the moment, part of the lobby is under refurbishment, so the space is not as expansive as it normally is.)We had a moment’s disappointment when we were told that our room was to be in the newest part of the hotel – “newest” meaning it was built in the 1940s – but were gleeful when we saw our lodgings. Along with the rest of the hotel, they’d been redone by the French designer Jacques Garcia, the author of some of our very favorite hotel décors, including at the Metropole in Monte Carlo and the Costes in Paris. Mr. Garcia has a way of making you feel bonelessly relaxed in his richly, deeply colored and finely detailed interiors, which fall somewhere along the path between a Parisian literary salon and a bordello de luxe. This part of the Danieli creates exactly that embracing feeling; the other, more traditionally decorated buildings do not moan “Garcia” quite so seductively. Whenever we got tuckered out with tourism, we’d spend a few minutes trying to figure out how the billowing draperies and extraordinarily complex tassels were conceived and manufactured.Members of the Danieli staff – from receptionists to concierges to waiters – are friendly, knowledgeable and forthcoming; the bar makes good drinks and post-opera sandwiches; and breakfast is served on a top-floor terrace with perfect views of San Giorgio Maggiore and its Palladian church of the same name. We had a grand time there.DiningBecause one evening was filled with opera, we ate only two real dinners on this trip (plus our late-night sandwiches at the hotel bar). The first was at a restaurant I had read about in The New York Times: Local. That brief review does a good job of conveying the background and spirit of the place, so I’ll limit myself to saying that we had a marvelous, interesting meal there, in which local produce was treated with skill, intelligence and respect. While combinations were innovative, with well-integrated hints of Asia (not really incongruous in Venice, much of whose wealth was long ago amassed through international trade), flavors were unfailingly clear and all that we ate was delicious, notably tortelli of artichoke with a light-handed accompaniment of capers and stracciatella (like a mixture of mozzarella and cream); and beautifully fatty, lightly smoked glazed eel from the Venetian lagoon with a mango-miso puree. Charming people work at Local, all of whom speak good English. Our second dinner was at a restaurant we had visited – twice – during our last stay in Venice, in 2014: Al Covo, which is not far from Local (or the Danieli), as it happens. It is operated by Cesare Benelli and his American wife, Diane Rankin, and its ample season-appropriate menu is always supplemented by treats from the market. On the night we were there, these included spider crab meat removed from the shell and simply dressed with great olive oil to bring out its subtle oceanic flavor; monkfish wrapped in paper-thin slices of pancetta and grilled; and the tiny soft-shell crabs called moeche. We ate them all, plus a dish of burrata, salsa verde and anchovies, and one of rigatoni in a deceptively simple sauce based on shreds of salt cod. That sounds like a lot of food, doesn’t it? And yes, it is unusual for us to order antipasti, pasta and a main course. But that’s the beauty of Al Covo: we did have an antipasto apiece, but our rigatoni and our monkfish were shared, and the deep-fried moeche were a mere tasting portion to start with. Our waiter suggested this approach (and indeed, tried to stop the people at the next table from over-ordering, which they did anyway), and also made it clear that if we didn’t like the wine we’d ordered, they’d swap it for something else. Good restaurants will often do that, no questions asked, but they don’t usually advertise the fact.For someone who’s in Venice for only a few days, these two restaurants plus some stand-up cichetti and one simple, totally traditional restaurant/trattoria/osteria/bacaro will cover the ground: unreconstructed Venetian cooking at a bacaro; tradition combined with imagination, all in a Venetian context, at Al Covo; and a more international approach to tradition at Local.* * *Hotel Danieli.

30,THE WORLDPOST,"Assad Is A Monster But If Trump Overthrows Him, Syria Will Likely Be Run By Terrorists","Graham E. Fuller, ContributorFormer Vice Chairman of the CIA’s National Intelligence Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-overthrow-assad-syria_us_58eb8f0ce4b05413bfe4a999,"If the U.S. topples Assad, it’ll create a power vacuum for warring extremists.",2017-04-11,"Assad during an interview with a Croatian newspaper. Damascus, Syria. April 6.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58eb9edd1500002000c7edf4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How should we understand U.S. President Donald Trump’s cruise missile barrage last week against a Syrian airbase? In one sense, it might be a tactical triumph for his administration: cruise missile attacks are popular with the American public as a form of retaliation, and they diverted attention from domestic political wrangling. It demonstrates for the first time the president’s willingness to oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin on a key issue. It also demonstrates presidential “resolve” during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit, and it sends a message to North Korea. Finally, it provides a one-time shot across the bow of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime. These are useful gains for Trump, as far as they go.Yet if this volley marks a new departure in actual American strategy in the Middle East, it moves us into treacherous waters. The Syrian agony poses a straightforward strategic question: which is worse, Assad or the opposition? Choosing between these two brutal sides is unpalatable. But there is a powerful case to be made that the motley grouping that makes up the armed opposition affects nearly all players far more negatively than the continuation of Assad’s ugly regime. Look at the opposition. It is made up of numerous rival and warring elements, many of whom are radical jihadis. One of the biggest is an offshoot of al Qaeda. The sad reality is that radical jihadis generally fight better than the democratic, pro-West reformers. If Assad, a secular nationalist, is overwhelmed by jihadi forces, we will most likely face a radical jihadi regime in his stead. More moderate secular politicians who might lead the country are divided, weak and unable to come to power except at U.S. gunpoint; they would face continued Sunni jihadi opposition as well Alawite opposition. And then consider that a jihadi victory over Assad would not necessarily even bring the civil war to an end. Warring jihadi factions would probably promote long-term sectarian cleansing and perpetuate a brutal civil conflict among themselves for years to come. A new jihadi regime might not even seek to eliminate ISIS. It would not be kind to its population. Under almost any circumstances, it would be hostile to the United States. Perhaps more seriously, its byproduct ― a massive refugee outflow ― would continue to shake the very heart of European political stability and invigorate proto-fascist forces there.If we support jihadis against Assad, we will be fighting to the last Syrian. Assad’s backing by Russia, Iran and other Shiite forces in the region will make toppling him very difficult. Do we care about Syrian lives and Syrian cities? A harsh peace under Assad would at least bring the war to an end. We speak eloquently of the tragic victims of the chemical attacks, the details and circumstances of which are still far from clear, but what of the effect of several more years of war? Or are all these Syrians expendable in the interests of our geopolitical ambitions?Assad, with help from his allies, is now in the process of extending final control over the country. So who benefits from a prolonged and unresolved war? Ask the people on the ground. Many Syrians who hate Assad actually fear a jihadi victory — and anarchy — even more.But of course the Syrian agony is not even primarily about Syria or its citizens at all. It’s basically another proxy war among more powerful forces. Yemen, which is currently being butchered and starved to death, is another example, in this case involving Saudi Arabia, Iran, the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates. The actual global geopolitical implications of the Yemen conflict are slight — although armchair strategists in Washington predictably spin reasons as to why Yemen is “vital” to U.S. interests.Forget Assad. A proxy war is what we are talking about, one fought over Syrian bodies. In reality, Washington’s real objectives focus on Russia and Iran in the Middle East. The U.S. is rightfully outraged at the use of chemical weapons — but Washington had no trouble with them when they were used extensively against Iran for years by Saddam Hussain in his war against Iran. America’s talk about democracy and human rights essentially provides cover for the strategic military goal of defeating Russia and Iran ― any talk of democracy or human rights is quite absent when it comes to our own strategic ties with Saudi Arabia or Egypt, for example.Yet how much are Iran and Russia really deadly foes to the U.S. in the Middle East? Washington, Moscow, Tehran and Beijing all share a common goal of eliminating ISIS and curtailing jihadi forces around the globe ― Muslim insurgents directly affect both Russia and China domestically. We all share a desperate need for Middle East stability to let the region cool down from the white heat of almost two decades of catastrophic military conflict and human tragedy. And finally we all share a desire that oil and gas flow to global consumers. These are significant interests. Democracy ranks pretty low alongside combatting the hunger, destruction and anarchy that the U.S. helped create. And yet Washington essentially still views the world through the zero-sum lens of a sole world superpower. “Full-spectrum dominance” still remains the Pentagon’s official global doctrine. As such, any suggestion of a win-win outcome is a formula that provokes U.S. distaste, suggesting a lowering of our unilateral guard. Note how our mainstream media excoriated U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for repeating that “win-win” formula at a recent press conference with his counterpart from China; the term apparently smacks of an alien or Chinese concept.The Trump administration, in one of its more rational moments, recently suggested that the U.S. no longer placed top priority on overthrowing Assad, for now. Obama in his last months had also come to recognize the need for softening his position on Assad.The geopolitical reality of the Middle East today is that the U.S. can no longer unilaterally call the shots. Too many other significant players also have major stakes there that cannot be ignored. There are nine conflicting parties in addition to the U.S.: Russia, Turkey, Iran, Kurds, Syrians, Saudis, Israelis, al Qaeda and ISIS. Russia ― after a 30-year interval following the chaos of the fall of the Soviet Union ― is back on the scene. Russia has been a player in the Middle East for centuries and was long the chief protector of Orthodox Christians. Moscow will not go away. Retaining dominant influence in Syria is a minor strategic advantage compared to the massive regional dominance still enjoyed by Washington in other Middle East states.Iran has had a close relationship with Syria for nearly 40 years. Its influence in Syria has, if anything, been vastly enhanced by the war against Assad. Once that is over, the military presence of Iran, Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militias will be greatly reduced.So what does this cruise missile barrage presage? Is Washington returning to its old and lame game of good jihadi, bad jihadi in Syria, and prioritizing Assad’s fall — and thus prolonging the proxy war? So far, it appears that Trump’s decision to bomb Syria is little more than a stop-gap measure designed to reduce the many rising pressures surrounding his administration. In military terms, it was a minor act, even if it served tactical purposes at that moment. But if it presages a major strategic shift toward deeper U.S. involvement in Syria, it will be a catastrophe. Graham E.

But I know some of the paths you walk: You’re a parent concerned about your children; you’re a child concerned about her dad; and sometimes what you wish for one of them conflicts with what the other wants for you. I’ve walked that tightrope myself.My daughter Lily is the light of my life. I knew that my mother, who I loved but with whom I sometimes clashed, adored her. So a few years back when my mom voted to ban gay marriage, it was painful; it took time and more than one very hard conversation for her to understand how her vote made families like her own granddaughter’s less safe. When she got a second chance to vote against gay marriage just a few years later—she couldn’t.This year, when copies started circulating of a potential executive order which would have allowed discrimination in the guise of religious freedom, I was deeply grateful that you and Jared intervened, making whatever case it took for your dad to keep it off the table.I can well imagine the experience of having that conversation. My mom and your dad were high-schoolers at the same time; though age doesn’t determine one’s attitude toward equality, it certainly informs it. And our folks were raised in an era before the average parent would have dreamed of telling their kids that “love is love is love.” Thank you for helping your dad be more a part of our time.I understand that you and Jared are trying to lead another conversation that our parents couldn’t have predicted: the one about climate change. My mom was torn about this.On one hand, she seemed to believe the news reports she was reading; but she also felt that God would just solve it in the end. Your dad seems similarly conflicted, though for economic instead of religious reasons. And here is where I’m asking for your help: Please, for all our kids, keep talking to him, keep making him see.For my mom, the most compelling arguments about any subject were personal ones. For instance, she was OK with “gays” in general not having full marriage equality or civil rights, but when it came to her granddaughter, she didn’t want Lily to be hurt by such limits on her dads; she just wanted Lily to be happy. Maybe you can personalize your climate discussions with your dad by reminding him what’s at stake—and I don’t mean the whole planet, a concept which would be hard to take in, or even the White House, which can only be his home for eight years. Rather, remind him of three more immediately tangible concerns: Arabella, Joseph, and Theo.Your dad probably already knows that for hundred of millions of people globally, two degrees will affect access to food and water. But, if he is like my mom was, the bigger the scope means the greater the remove, so maybe start smaller. Focus on what matters to your kids: the things they love, the places you take them, the experiences that shape their lives.I’ve read that Arabella likes strawberries (which you grow at home) especially in “pink” ice cream. If earth’s temperature warms by two degrees, as pretty much every credible scientist now sees as unavoidable (and some think is too optimistic at this point), there will a much shorter farming season in the reduced number of places where they are still able to grow.California, the biggest US producer, may see harvests fall by 40 percent, and what remains will be of decreasing quality. England, which foresees higher berry rot and smaller yield, is so concerned about this that its scientists are pre-emptively trying to engineer new strawberries altogether. That’s just one example—and a very small one—of what can happen.Hawaii, your last vacation destination as a family before inauguration, will look very different when the temperature rises by those two degrees: All the famed resort-lined beaches could be erased, moving the shoreline dramatically inward, even as the islands battle flooding and species loss. Aspen, where your kids learn to ski with their cousins, is already on the cusp of change. Scientists predict that a two-degree rise will limit Aspen’s snow cover, cause dust build-up on the peaks, kill off the trees for which the region is named, and increase the risk of devastating wildfires.For me and Lily, our Aspen is a little island off the coast of Maine. We go there for a week every summer, sharing a house with another family and reveling in the calm of a place you can’t even drive to.You park your car in the woods, take a skiff over, and settle in for lazy days with the kids safely roaming about as they look for crabs or build fairy houses. With climate-change-induced sea level rise, the most modest estimate suggests that the island’s will be under water by 2050; by the median estimate, the houses around the perimeter will be gone; by the most extreme estimates, the island will disappear below the surface, an obstacle ships steer around on the way to the new coast of Maine.It will join a fast-growing roster of Atlantises lost. Just think of places you’ve been with Jared—Miami, Belize, London. If things go forward unchecked, those places could be largely underwater too, wrecks sunken by the missed opportunities of parents like you and me. Now imagine not just visiting but living in those places—or in a country like Bangladesh, expected to lose 17% of its land. Imagine your family staring down the barrel of such loss.That’s why I try to do my part, keeping a small carbon footprint, writing about the topic, and sending this letter to you—I think you have a chance to get far more done than I can.That’s also why this column is not some put-on or satire. It’s a real letter from one parent to another.Though the election yielded a lot of division—which I admit I sometimes contributed to—I think the best thing Americans can do for each other (and the planet) is to acknowledge where we connect and what we have in common. I believe you and I share some important values that will make our kids’ lives better.We’re both so lucky to have children and it’s our responsibility to care for them. I hope Arabella, Joseph, Theo, and Lily get to enjoy the best world you and I can make together.Sincerely, Dave"

A mention of his name among groups of women will usually elicit shudders of disgust.Notwithstanding, 21st Century Fox decided to extend the contract of this serial sexual harasser while helping to pay the $13M in legal fees for his harassment of women. Are we surprised? Appalled maybe, but not surprised. This is after all, the same network that supported the election of an admitted sexual assaulter as President of the United States and which until recently was run by a man who himself was a serial harasser who used his power at the network to make women submit to him.O’Reilly, Trump and the current and former head of Fox News have one common denominator: They are conservative white men in positions of power. Power and domination tie these men inextricably. As does disrespect for women.While neither Trump nor O’Reilly created the problem of harassment and assault in America, they have two things in common: 1) They are high profile perpetrators who have managed to get away with their disgusting behavior and 2) They are co-dependent on the explicit and implicit racism and sexism of their audiences for ratings or votes.Ultimately, the wider Trump and Fox News agenda is all about disempowering women. Consider that Trump has:· Built the whitest, most male cabinet in recent history –including Jeff Sessions and Mike Price who voted against legislation to curb violence against women and achieve equal pay.· Re-enacted the global gag rule on reproductive freedom for women. And his Administration has already moved to bar funding for women’s health though Planned Parenthood· Proposed an anti-women domestic budget that would mean among other things that 260,000 more victims of sexual assault and domestic violence would not have access shelters and supportive services each year.· Signed an executive order that rolls back hard-fought victories for women in the workplace.And O’Reilly? His record of straight up misogyny and racism on air is nothing new. Just last week, he insulted Congresswoman Maxine Waters because he couldn’t get past her race and gender.Donald Trump loves and needs Bill O’Reilly, a man who was known during the campaign as his chief enabler. O’Reilly loves and needs Donald Trump. And the head of Fox News network can’t seem to get enough of them. Or their repulsive comments. Or their racism, misogyny and xenophobia. Why? Ratings. And the mighty dollar ― 21st Century Fox loves profits! It’s a trifecta of co-dependency – the white nationalist President, the sexist right wing media icon and a corporation willing to pick up the harassment tab as a gateway for more profits.What is to be done about this? Step one is to remember an important reality: Fox News is literally digging its own grave. The median age of a Fox New prime time viewer is 68 – meaning that over half of its audience is older than that.The Fox News audience is old and male and getting even older and more male. The continuing saga of harassment and Fox’s cheerleading for Trumpism will only worsen its demographic demise. And here is something else that counts against them: while Trump voters and Fox News’s audience are literally dying, women of color will make up 53 percent of the population by 2050.None of that is to say we need sit around and watch Fox News go gently into that good night. Bill O’Reilly has advertisers and those advertisers have customers who are younger (even if Fox itself does not). Already, these advertisers are waking up to the fact that the surging post-Trump resistance personified by the electrifying March for Women and building to a new, pro-immigrant crescendo on May 1st is bigger than Trump? Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and BMW recently pulled spots from O’Reilly’s show. More are following suit.Social justice advocates are also stepping up their game. In every post-election meeting I have attended about organizing resistance (and good news - that’s a lot of meetings) the subject of corporate targets has come up. Increasingly, our society is becoming more conscious of what they buy, the level of corporate responsibility behind these products and whether these entities attack or support people based on their identity.More and more, this generation is using their creativity and might and buying power to bring about change. Just witness the bloodbath of corporate withdrawal regarding Trump brands. Corporate America may be part of the trifecta of co-dependency in this case – but only so long as we permit it. And time is running out on them.For those of us who make up part of the growing number of women of color who will soon be the 53% let me be clear: we intend to use our power to make sure that men in positions of power who abuse and harass women – men like O’Reilly and Trump, are knocked off their perch.

33,POLITICS,"Border Agents Illegally Turned Away Asylum-Seeker And Her Children, Attorney Says",Roque Planas and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/border-agents-asylum-seeker_us_58ebd4f2e4b0df7e204453f8,The government told senators that the woman didn't ask for asylum. But she and her lawyer say she tried repeatedly.,2017-04-10,The San Ysidro Port of Entry in California is one of the busiest in the U.S.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ebd820150000200034abd9.jpeg?cache=vDqGROPL7i&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"AUSTIN, Texas ― U.S. Customs and Border Protection repeatedly turned away a 30-year-old Mexican woman who came to the border seeking asylum because she feared for her life and her four children ― and did so without even referring her to an asylum officer, according to her lawyer. The woman’s attorney says this was a flagrant violation of U.S. law. When two U.S. senators asked the agency about the woman’s case, her attorney says, the CBP falsely claimed the woman had told agents she was seeking work and better schools for her children, not fleeing violence. Legal groups who represent asylum-seekers say the woman’s case illustrates an increasingly common pattern under the Trump administration of CBP agents turning away asylum-seekers at the border. When people show up at the border saying they’re afraid to return to their home country, federal law requires that border authorities let them into the country, where they are to be granted an interview with an asylum officer from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “It’s shocking that you have federal law enforcement officials ― people who are charged with upholding the law and bellyache all the time about immigrants crossing illegally ― [and] that they are breaking the law themselves,” Nicole Ramos, an attorney representing the Mexican woman, told The Huffington Post. “We’re not asking for special treatment. We want them to follow the law and that’s it.”The woman, who requested anonymity because she fears for her and her children’s safety, says she fled her hometown in the Mexican state of Guerrero because she believed their lives were in danger and the local police wouldn’t protect them. Two armed men came to her home and threatened to kill all of her children unless she delivered her 14-year-old son to them, she said in an affidavit. The men forced her to perform oral sex on one of them, then showed her videos of a man with a bloodied face whose hands had been cut off. They punched her repeatedly and said she would end up like the man in the video if she didn’t cooperate. “I got down on my knees and begged them to go away and leave my children alone,” the woman wrote in the translated affidavit.The woman and her four children first traveled to the San Ysidro Port of Entry, which connects Tijuana and San Diego, on Jan. 28. She asked for asylum there, and says she was told she couldn’t continue the process with all of her children, because two were already U.S. citizens. Eventually a border agent spoke with her, but did not ask her why she wanted asylum. The agent told her that asylum was only available for diplomats and people persecuted by their governments, and that citizens of Mexico were ineligible, she says.Her two U.S.-born children were allowed to continue into the United States, where they now live with a relative.The woman says she returned to the border crossing on Feb. 4, this time armed with a declaration of her intent to seek asylum and a notice that she had legal representation. But the woman says CBP agents repeatedly tried to get her to say in a recorded interview that she did not fear returning to Mexico. “All they did was yell at me and tell me I was being stupid, that people like me could not get asylum,” the affidavit reads. “Then the officers began recording again. They asked if I was afraid to go back to Mexico and I said that yes, I was afraid. The CBP officer said, ‘lady are you dumb or just pretending? Quit playing games. You’re supposed to say you’re not afraid.’” Again, the woman says, CBP agents sent her back to Mexico. CBP spokesman Ralph DeSio declined to comment on the allegations, but said in general terms that the San Ysidro Port of Entry has experienced an uptick in people trying to cross with asylum claims. “Our officers are not authorized to determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed,” DeSio told HuffPost in an email. After the unsuccessful Feb. 4 attempt, the woman went to Tijuana with Ramos to try once again. But for a third time, agents refused to let her have a so-called “credible fear interview,” the first step in applying for asylum.“They didn’t even let me talk,” the woman told HuffPost. “They said, ‘You can’t apply for asylum. Go somewhere else in Mexico.’” The number of people crossing into the United States without authorization has plummeted since President Donald Trump took office in January. The Trump administration attributes this to his tough stance on illegal immigration. But advocates say the decline is largely due to the Trump administration’s refusal to allow people like Ramos’ client to cross into legal ports of entry to ask for asylum. Trump has accused immigrants of abusing the humanitarian guarantees that U.S. law provides, implying that families apprehended and then released into the U.S. as they seek relief are a drain on society and potentially dangerous. In February, the administration ordered asylum officers to use stricter criteria when conducting credible fear interviews. Trump also said he would unleash border agents to act as they wish rather than have them follow more specific guidance from the top ― a promise that immigrant rights advocates think carries great potential for abuse. And when the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held a hearing last month on concerns about U.S. treatment of asylum-seekers, the Trump administration made the highly unusual decision to skip it. In a complaint to the Department of Homeland Security, Ramos wrote that she had interviewed seven families who said they were coerced into withdrawing requests for asylum in the past three months. She asked DHS’ Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to investigate.“Please do not ignore this,” Ramos urged the office, according to an email shared with HuffPost. “One day CBP is going to illegally turn away an asylum seeker, and that human rights violation may be the thing that gets them killed.”Senators attempted to intervene as well. After Sens. Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein, both California Democrats, wrote to CBP for more information on the case, an official told them that the woman “did not express fear of returning to Mexico.” Rather, the official claimed, the woman “stated the reason for coming to the U.S. was to seek employment and for her children to attend public school in the U.S.”“Please allow me to express regret for any conduct Ms. [redacted] may have perceived as rude or unprofessional during CBP processing,” Kim Lowry, acting assistant commissioner for CBP’s Office of Congressional Affairs, wrote to the senators.Tyrone Gayle, a spokesman for Harris, said the senator’s office first reached out to CBP about the woman’s case in mid-February, and didn’t get a full response until nearly a month later.“Senator Harris believes that refugees, immigrants, and asylum seekers have the right to be heard, especially when their liberty and oftentimes lives are at stake,” Gayle said in an email. “And they should have prompt access to all measures necessary to ensure they receive protections granted under U.S. law.”“Despite multiple Statements of Declarations [the Mexican woman] has made for each of her asylum attempts, CBP has refused to provide her with a Credible Fear Interview ― jeopardizing her and her family’s safety,” he went on. “This is unacceptable.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The pope is scheduled to meet with the grand imam of al-Azhar and the head of the Coptic Christian church.Bombs went off at two Coptic Christian churches in Egypt on Sunday, killing more than 40 people and injuring dozens of others. The attacks occurred on Palm Sunday ― one of the holiest days on the Christian calendar. The Islamic State claimed responsibility, and the Egyptian president declared a three-month state of emergency.Greg Burke, director of the Holy See press office, told journalists on Monday that “the Pope’s trip to Egypt proceeds as scheduled” in spite of the attacks.Monsignor Angelo Becciu, the third-ranking official in the Vatican’s Secretariat of State, said in an interview published Monday in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: “There is no doubt the Holy Father will maintain his offer to go to Egypt. Egypt has assured us that everything will go as well as possible, so we will go confidently.“What happened caused disorder and tremendous suffering, but it cannot stop the pope’s mission of peace,” Becciu added.Coptic Christians make up the majority of the Egypt’s roughly 9 million Christians. Since the time of their split from mainstream Christians in 451 AD, Coptic Christians have been the targets of violence and persecution.Pope Francis was celebrating a Palm Sunday Mass for tens of thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square when the Vatican received word of the bombings. In swiftly prepared comments, he said: “I pray for the dead and the victims. May the Lord convert the hearts of people who sow terror, violence and death and even the hearts of those who produce and traffic in weapons.”"
35,ARTS & CULTURE,'Handmaid's Tale' Waitlists Surge In Libraries Across America,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/handmaids-tale-waitlists-surge-in-libraries_us_58eb8840e4b00de141050bef,"As reproductive rights continue to come under threat, readers flock to  Margaret Atwood's dystopian warning.",2017-04-10,Alexis Bledel appears as a Handmaid in Hulu's adaption of <em> The Handmaid's Tale.</em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586eacf01200002e00ad5d10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you had casual plans to check out a copy of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale from your local library, we have some bad news: The waitlists are almost as daunting as the author’s dystopian vision for the future.Hundreds of Handmaid’s Tale fans in New York City are waiting to get their hands on Atwood’s novel, soon to hit Hulu as an adapted TV series starring Elizabeth Moss, Samira Wiley, Joseph Fiennes and Alexis Bledel, according to a recent report from Patch verified by The Huffington Post.In February, readers placed 183 holds on 64 copies of the book at the New York Public Library alone. By March, the NYPL added 32 more copies of the book into circulation, and the number of holds jumped to 534.“As of today, there are currently 546 holds on 96 copies of The Handmaid’s Tale,” a NYPL representative told HuffPost on Monday. “For background, according to our online catalog, there aren’t other dystopian titles with the same level of checkouts or holds.”The NYPL isn’t the only public library experiencing a surge in demand for The Handmaid’s Tale, which recently rocketed to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list. According to the Chicago Public Library’s website, there seem to be four of 160 paperback copies of the book available to check out, though there are currently 63 holds on six other copies and 318 holds on 81 available ebooks. The San Francisco Public Library presents a similar backlog; there are 101 holds on 54 physical copies and 283 holds on 65 ebooks. The Houston Public Library boasts zero available physical copies.Demand for the book shouldn’t take anyone by surprise. Atwood’s 1985 novel is set in a near-future, totalitarian U.S. civilization called the Republic of Gilead, which is built on Christian fundamentalist values and fixated on the declining birthrate of its population. The story is told from the perspective of Offred, a “Handmaid” suddenly forced to abandon her relatively free life in order to have sex with, and produce children for, a high-ranking man whose wife is infertile. Offred is one of a number of Handmaids subjected to the reproductive rights nightmare that unfurls.A description of The Handmaid’s Tale on the Houston Public Library’s website characterizes it as “a novel of such power that the reader will be unable to forget its images and its forecast.” It continues:In condensed but eloquent prose, by turns cool-eyed, tender, despairing, passionate, and wry, she reveals to us the dark corners behind the establishment’s calm facade, as certain tendencies now in existence are carried to their logical conclusions.As many critics and fans ― and even Atwood herself ― have remarked, this story feels more relevant to American politics than ever. Just last month, a group of women activists made sure the parallel was clear by wearing Handmaid’s Tale–style red robes to the Texas Senate in protest of the anti-abortion bills being considered. (Ed. note: HuffPost reporter Catherine Pearson is attempting to keep up with the dizzying array of abortion-related bills in the U.S.)The NYPL did not speculate as to which factors have contributed to the book’s increase in popularity. Earlier in 2017, the waitlist for George Orwell’s 1984 surged, prompting the library to recommend a slew of other dystopian books, including the Atwood classic now sprinting off shelves. New York Times writer Alexandra Alter surmises that Americans turning to dystopia may be doing so as a response to the uneasy feelings some have felt after the election of President Donald Trump."

Scott Walker has already rolled back environmental protections and cut funding for the Department of Natural Resources.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ebe41a1500002000c78e5c.jpeg?cache=d3WeTOGG6U&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) plans to do away with a nearly century-old, state-run nature magazine, sparking outrage among critics who see it as part of an ongoing anti-environment agenda.Walker’s 2017-2019 budget, which he unveiled in February, calls for suspending publication of Wisconsin Natural Resources next year. The magazine, a product of the state Department of Natural Resources, has kept Wisconsinites informed about hunting and fishing opportunities, species conservation, environmental issues and much more since 1919.The Walker administration argues it doesn’t fit the department’s core mission.“While the magazine has a loyal following and is supported by subscriptions, it became clear as our staff continued to examine what they did and why they do it ... that we at DNR are stewards of resources and not magazine publishers,” department Secretary Cathy Stepp said during a legislative hearing late last month. She added that her agency’s time is better spent focusing on digital communication.But a former department secretary, two former editors of the magazine and dozens of Wisconsin residents have blasted the governor’s plan. “Anyone that says communication and education is not a core value of a natural resource agency doesn’t get it,” George Meyer, who served as natural resources secretary from 1993 to 2003, told Wisconsin Public Radio.The proposed shutdown of the magazine appears to be part of a larger attack on environmental science by the Republican governor.With Walker in office, Wisconsin has rolled back environmental regulations and slashed Department of Natural Resources funding, resulting in the elimination of half the agency’s scientists. Last year, references to climate change were scrubbed from its website, part of a continued push to silence discussions of climate change at the agency.The magazine saw “editorial oversight dramatically increase” in 2013 after it ran an insert on climate change funded by the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, according to Natasha Kassulke, who served as the magazine’s editor for five years until mid-2016. “From then on, all stories were vetted by officials within the state Department of Natural Resources,” Kassulke wrote in a recent Chippewa Herald op-ed. “They spiked stories having to do with climate change, a federally endangered mammal living near a proposed iron mine, and challenges to the privatization of groundwater.”Kassulke noted that the magazine, which is published six times a year, is funded entirely by its more than 80,000 subscribers. A subscription costs $8.97.Reached Monday for comment, department spokesman James Dick referred The Huffington Post to a video of the March hearing at which Stepp testified. “As you will hear during the appearance, the decision regarding the magazine was a business decision — not an editorial one,” Dick wrote in an email. Walker’s spokesman earlier told the Wisconsin State Journal that cutting the magazine was not part of any anti-science, anti-environment agenda.“That’s a ridiculous claim,” spokesman Tom Evenson said in a statement. “The DNR is realigning to become more efficient and effective. This magazine is not a part of the DNR’s core mission. It is not the government’s role to produce magazines that duplicate what is available in the private market.”A public records request found the governor’s office had received more than 150 written communications and dozens of phone calls related to the magazine’s fate, according to The Progressive, a Madison-based publication. All reportedly opposed shutting down the magazine. “Your stated intention to eliminate the Wisconsin Natural Resources magazine has ended my remaining respect for you,” Harry Syke wrote to Walker on Feb. 17, according to The Progressive. “You have systematically degraded this state’s environment and educational system. ... Our children and grandchildren will bear the damaging costs of your legacy.”“HOW MUCH MORE ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM US BEFORE YOU LEAVE OFFICE?” wrote Marjorie Peterson. “I’m glad I’m 92 and won’t have to live through much more.”Walker’s proposed budget must still be approved by the Wisconsin legislature."

At 49, Gorsuch could serve on the bench for decades. It is also by far the biggest coup of President Donald Trump’s chaotic first 100 days in office ― the confirmation process went relatively smoothly despite bitter bickering in the Senate, which blew up its own rules to get Gorsuch confirmed.“I’ve always heard that the most important thing that a president of the United States does is appoint people ― and hopefully, great people, like this appointment ― to the United States Supreme Court,” Trump said to the crowd gathered in the Rose Garden, which included every sitting justice now on the court. “And I got it done in the first 100 days!” Trump boasted.Gorsuch’s swearing-in at the White House was also symbolic. His former boss on the high court when he was a young lawyer, Justice Anthony Kennedy, administered the oath. “We as a people find our self-definition, our heritage, and our destiny in our Constitution,” Kennedy said in brief remarks before he read from the judicial oath. As of Monday, Gorsuch became the first former law clerk to serve alongside one of the justices he worked with.“I won’t ever forget that the seat that I inherit today is that of a very, very great man,” the new justice said following his swearing-in, referring to Scalia, whose seat remained unfilled for more than 400 days.One Supreme Court commentator quipped that Gorsuch may have been referring to Judge Merrick Garland, whom former President Barack Obama chose to fill the Scalia seat but who was historically denied even a hearing by Senate Republicans. During his own confirmation hearing, Gorsuch had nothing but praise for Garland but refused to say what he thought about how the Senate treated the judge.The White House, for its part, has its sights set on the next Supreme Court vacancy.Three justices — Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer — are all in their 80s or near it, and a death or retirement during Trump’s first term is a real possibility. With the loss of a liberal justice or Kennedy, who often votes with them on issues such as gay rights, Republicans could entrench a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.After Monday’s festivities, Gorsuch is expected to dive headlong into the work of the court. Later this week, he will convene with his eight colleagues for his first private conference, where the nine will consider which new cases to add to the Supreme Court’s docket for the new term, which begins in October.Next week, Gorsuch will begin hearing the court’s last batch of cases for the current term. Of these disputes, perhaps the most significant is a contentious church-state dispute from Missouri that is likely to divide the justices into ideological factions.Also down the line are cases that directly implicate Trump and his policies — including constitutional challenges to Trump’s beleaguered travel ban and conflicts of interests under a clause of the Constitution that bars federal officials from accepting payments from foreign governments. Citing judicial ethics concerns, Gorsuch declined to comment on these issues during his Senate hearings.“I will never forget that to whom much is given, much will be expected,” Gorsuch said as he closed out his remarks, which commended the roles of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) during his confirmation. “And I promise you that I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.” As the most junior justice, Gorsuch will also relieve Justice Elena Kagan, who joined the court in 2010, from answering the door at high court’s private conferences — a tradition reserved for the court’s newest member. Gorsuch is also expected to take over from her in attending the cafeteria committee — an informal body that determines the food served to the public and employees on Supreme Court grounds.Kagan gave Gorsuch a taste of what that’s like during a public appearance last summer in Colorado, according to The Washington Post.“I think this is a way to kind of humble people,” Kagan said. “You think you’re kind of hot stuff. You’re an important person. You’ve just been confirmed to the United States Supreme Court.”"

Monáe did not hold back.“People have to start respecting the vagina,” she told Marie Claire. “Until every man is fighting for our rights, we should consider stopping having sex. I love men. But evil men? I will not tolerate that. You don’t deserve to be in my presence.”She continued, saying that this year she’s all about black girl magic: If you’re going to own this world and this is how you’re going to rule this world, I am not going to contribute anymore until you change it. We have to realize our power and our magic. Because I am all about black-girl magic, even though I’m standing with all women. But this year? This year, I am so carefree black girl.The “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight” actress also discussed why it’s so important to push back on gender stereotypes.“It is important for women to be [in control], especially when gender norms and conformity are pushed upon us,” Monáe told Marie Claire. “Women automatically are told that this is how you should look. This is how you should get a man. This is how you should get a woman. You need to fit into all these boxes to be accepted. I don’t subscribe to that way of thinking.” In true Monáe fashion, the actress reminded readers just how important it is to stay true to yourself.“I believe in embracing what makes you unique even if it makes others uncomfortable,” she said. “I have learned there is power in saying no. I have agency. I get to decide.”Head over to Marie Claire to read all five of their May cover star interviews, with women like Emily Ratajkowski, Aja Naomi King, Zoey Deutch and Alexandra Daddario. "

As a result, she had to undergo multiple surgeries and ultimately lost her eye.Today, Brynn has been in remission for over 16 months. In honor of her third birthday in March, Danielle gave her daughter a custom-made bunny, who also has one eye.The Utah mom ordered the bunny from Jessica Sebastian of Sebastian Design. Danielle told The Huffington Post she’s a big fan of Jessica’s brand and thought one of her bunny dolls would be perfect for Brynn, who loves animals. “I messaged her asking if she could make her one, but if she could do it without the left eye,” she explained. “Jessica was so nice and understanding, she understood completely how it feels to want to give your children something special, that’s unique like them.”When Danielle placed the order, Jessica already had a waitlist of over 60 people and wasn’t sure she could take on any new customers. But the toymaker was so touched by Brynn’s story she decided to make an exception and do a rush order for the family. “The whole reason I started making dolls is because I have two girls who don’t really look like sisters (one is brown and one is white), and I wanted them to have dolls that looked like them,” Jessica said. “So when Danielle asked if I could make a doll who looked like her daughter, I just decided I couldn’t say no.

That’s why I made dolls with hijabs for my own girls!” Danielle told HuffPost Brynn loves her new bunny friend and named her “Sparkle.” The small piece of joy is welcome after the difficult medical journey the Munger family underwent. After doctors discovered her tumor, Brynn underwent three surgeries over the course of two months. “The recommended course of action from the oncologist was to remove her left eye and everything else within her left orbit, as the tumor had touched everything,” the mom explained.Brynn also underwent six weeks of radiation to more completely eradicate the cancer cells. The day before Thanksgiving 2015, her oncologist performed another surgery to graft skin over her orbit to make it what is called a ‘safe wound.’ She’s been in remission ever since. Brynn celebrated her one year anniversary of remission last Thanksgiving.“During this journey we have had some of the lowest possible points,” Danielle recalled. “Such as having to pass my precious 1-year-old baby to the nurses after she fell asleep from sedation, knowing that my beautiful baby would lose her eye and the feelings of hurting so much more than I ever could have imagined, to some of the best points ― seeing how truly strong Brynn is, knowing we can do anything after fighting cancer, and the absolute humbling love and kindness of others.”Throughout the process, the Mungers have been touched by the generosity of friends, family and total strangers. That includes Jessica and her special gift for Danielle.Jessica said it was humbling to create something for the toddler and she was touched to receive a sweet video of Danielle hugging her new bunny.The response to the story from others has also been incredibly supportive.

Kelly, Kanye and Linkin Park. A 2010 hits collection, including tracks “Izzo” and “99 Problems,” is still available at time of publication, as well.While earlier reports claimed Jay Z also pulled his work from Apple Music, his catalog remains in place on that service.The move is an evident attempt to draw more subscribers over to Tidal, the self-proclaimed artist-friendly service that has lagged behind Spotify and Apple in subscribers. While Spotify boasts around 50 million users and Apple 20 million, Tidal claimed last year it reached the 3 million subscriber mark ― but that number is thought to be significantly lower.As TechRadar points out, one particular reason for the move may be that Spotify is preparing to launch a higher quality audio feature that’s been a main selling point for Tidal, which bills itself as “the first music service with High Fidelity sound quality.” Spotify Hi-Fi, as the new service would reportedly be called, would allow users CD-quality streaming.Maybe it was also just that time for Jay Z to pack up and go. He’s been an outspoken critic of tech companies over artists’ pay, blasting Google (which owns YouTube), Spotify and Apple at a New York event in 2015 by rapping: “Them n***as pay you a tenth of what you’re supposed to get / You know n***as die for equal pay, right? / You know when I work I ain’t ya slave, right?”As for music by Jay Z’s wife, Beyoncé, it’s safe on Spotify ― for now ― other than her most recent “Lemonade” album, which never appeared on the service.The Huffington Post has reached out to Jay Z’s reps, along with Spotify’s, and will update this post accordingly."

Greenpeace also criticized Coke, the world’s largest soft drink company, for its reluctance to set a new industry standard for incorporating recycled plastic into its packaging.Coke told The Huffington Post in a statement that it’s doing more to tackle the issue of marine litter. But Greenpeace is eager to see the global company take more tangible steps to significantly reduce the amount of plastics it introduces into the environment.If current pollution rates remain unchanged, there will be more plastic than fish (by weight) in the ocean by 2050. Coke won’t publicly release figures related to the amount of plastic bottles it produces, so Greenpeace conducted its own evaluation of the matter.Greenpeace estimated that coke sells 108 to 128 billion plastic bottles every year, based on Coke’s annual sales figures of certain product lines and their proportion in the company’s overall packaging mix.“Coca-Cola needs to accept responsibility for the damage its products are causing to the marine environment,” Greenpeace said in its report.Coke said PET plastic ― the kind of plastic environmentalists want to see less of ― makes up 58 percent of its total packaging. While Coke’s bottles are recyclable, that’s not enough to prevent them from ending up in the oceans or to protect marine life from ingesting pieces of them.Recyclable materials still find their way into bodies of water and landfills due to a lack of recycling infrastructure, consumers’ reluctance to recycle and other issues. Greenpeace says it wants to see Coke lead the way in the soft drink industry by using recycled plastic in its bottle production. That would reduce the amount of new bottles being made, and cut back on wasted materials. Currently, newly manufactured plastic is cheap, while recyclable plastic, due to a lack of demand, is pricy ― which is why companies aren’t eager to use it.April Crow, Coke’s senior director of environment and sustainability, told HuffPost last month that the beverage company is making efforts to ramp up its usage of recycled materials when it’s “economically and physically feasible.”Recycled plastic has been approved for regulatory food-grade use in 44 countries of the more than 200 where Coke operates. In those places, the company buys almost 20 percent of the recycled plastic available.Coke hasn’t set any global targets for boosting recycled content across its product lines. The company’s European arm, however, has vowed to source two-fifths of its plastic bottle material from recycled or renewable sources by 2020.Greenpeace also takes issue with the fact that Coke has significantly scaled back on an important green practice. According to the report, the amount of refillable containers it uses dropped from 31 percent of its global product packaging to 25 percent from 2008 to 2015.“Rather than reducing the number of single-use plastic bottles it produces, Coke is investing in even more throwaway plastic,” Louise Edge, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said in a statement. “We’d love for Coke to come clean on its plastic footprint and provide detailed breakdowns of what it produces annually.”"

Despite hope that this year’s bleaching wouldn’t be “anything like last year,” scientists returned with disheartening news.Spurred by record-breaking temperatures, some 900 miles of coral was hit with back-to-back bleaching, particularly affecting the middle third of the structure that stretches along Australia’s northeastern coast. Last year’s mass bleaching hit the northern third of the reef the hardest, meaning only the southern portion has been left relatively unscathed. Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre and the leader of the aerial surveys, said yet another bleaching event so soon after last year’s (and others in 1998 and 2002) left the reef without enough time to recover.“Clearly the reef is struggling with multiple impacts,” he said in a statement. Hughes has long linked the reef’s struggles with human-induced climate change: Corals bleach when oceans become too warm, causing the colorful algae that live within them to leave and turning them bright white. If temperatures don’t return to normal, the structures can die.“Without a doubt, the most pressing of these [impacts] is global warming,” Hughes said. “As temperatures continue to rise, the corals will experience more and more of these events.”James Kerry, a senior research officer at James Cook University, said corals can take up to 10 years to recover and mass bleachings so close together “offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016.”Last year’s bleaching, spurred by record-breaking temperatures and El Niño, set off a firestorm of media coverage after Hughes and his team returned with photographs that showed up to 95 percent of parts of the reef had been harmed. Scientists declared it the most severe bleaching event on record, and in parts of the reef, more than two-thirds of the coral died.Hughes on Sunday tweeted his ongoing work at the Great Barrier Reef was “without a doubt the most confronting research project” he’s ever done and called for the world to act to save the reef from climate change.Australia has promised to do just that, and some scientists have proposed last-ditch efforts to save at least some parts of the reef. But local government officials also approved what would be one of largest coal mines in the world in the state of Queensland last year in a perplexing move that activists say won’t do anything to help halt climate change.Hughes, at the time, called such a move “laughable” and said without action to keep the planet from warming, he’s not sure how much time the Great Barrier Reef has left.“Time is certainly running out,” he said."

Last year’s mass bleaching hit the northern third of the reef the hardest, meaning only the southern portion has been left relatively unscathed. Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Centre and the leader of the aerial surveys, said yet another bleaching event so soon after last year’s (and others in 1998 and 2002) left the reef without enough time to recover.“Clearly the reef is struggling with multiple impacts,” he said in a statement. Hughes has long linked the reef’s struggles with human-induced climate change: Corals bleach when oceans become too warm, causing the colorful algae that live within them to leave and turning them bright white. If temperatures don’t return to normal, the structures can die.“Without a doubt, the most pressing of these [impacts] is global warming,” Hughes said. “As temperatures continue to rise, the corals will experience more and more of these events.”James Kerry, a senior research officer at James Cook University, said corals can take up to 10 years to recover and mass bleachings so close together “offers zero prospect of recovery for reefs that were damaged in 2016.”Last year’s bleaching, spurred by record-breaking temperatures and El Niño, set off a firestorm of media coverage after Hughes and his team returned with photographs that showed up to 95 percent of parts of the reef had been harmed. Scientists declared it the most severe bleaching event on record, and in parts of the reef, more than two-thirds of the coral died.Hughes on Sunday tweeted his ongoing work at the Great Barrier Reef was “without a doubt the most confronting research project” he’s ever done and called for the world to act to save the reef from climate change.Australia has promised to do just that, and some scientists have proposed last-ditch efforts to save at least some parts of the reef. But local government officials also approved what would be one of largest coal mines in the world in the state of Queensland last year in a perplexing move that activists say won’t do anything to help halt climate change.Hughes, at the time, called such a move “laughable” and said without action to keep the planet from warming, he’s not sure how much time the Great Barrier Reef has left.“Time is certainly running out,” he said."

First, Shetterly will tackle Baltimore and the prominent black families that empowered its citizens in the middle of the 20th century, as well as the discriminatory policies and norms, such as redlining, that black Baltimore residents faced.The upcoming book will spotlight Willie Adams, a venture capitalist who invested in numerous black-owned businesses at a time when access to capital was hard for black Americans to come by. Upon his death in 2011, former Baltimore Mayor Thomas D’Alesandro told the Baltimore Sun, “He brought black entrepreneurs into the formerly all-white business community.”Adams’ wife, Victorine, was the first black woman on the Baltimore city council.In that same book, Shetterly will also examine the lives of the Murphys, a powerful family who published the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper for generations.And that’s all just in the first of a two-book deal ― we can’t wait to see what she has in store next.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article included the name Octavia Butler instead of Octavia Spencer.

In January, a jury found he deserved the death penalty.Pleading guilty to the state charges allows for Roof’s transfer to death row and spares survivors and relatives of the victims a second round of courtroom testimony detailing his rampage on June 17, 2015, at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston.He will receive a sentence of life in prison on the state charges, which include attempted murder of three survivors of the shooting, solicitor Scarlett Wilson said last month. State prosecutors abandoned efforts to seek a second death penalty.Roof was ordered into the custody of U.S. Marshals last week. He has been held at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center in Charleston County awaiting his state trial.Standing shackled in a striped prison jumpsuit beside his attorney, Roof on Monday told the court he understood he would serve life in prison without eligibility for parole. He waived his right to any appeal.He is expected to be transferred to the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, that holds male death-row prisoners, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit group that monitors U.S. capital punishment.Since 1988, when the federal death penalty was reinstated, 76 defendants in the United States have been sentenced to death and three prisoners have been executed, according to the center’s website.Roof becomes the 62nd current federal death row inmate, and appeals in such cases can take a decade or more, the center’s executive director, Robert Dunham, said in a telephone interview.(Editing by Letitia Stein and Matthew Lewis)"

Over the past year, the Environmental Council of the States, a nonprofit organization of the leaders of state environmental agencies, has surveyed those agencies to collect budget data. Last month they released their findings, which included responses from 48 state and territorial environmental agencies. According to their report, state environmental agency funding rose from $12.2 billion in 2013 to $14.9 billion in 2015. But most of that increase was in California where the budget grew from $2.9 billion to $4.9 billion. With California excluded, state funding only went up from $9.3 billion in 2013 to $10.0 billion in 2015.Federal support for states other than California during this part of the Obama administration dropped by 3 percent from $2,557,856,937 in 2013 to $2,493,785,970 in 2015. Remember that the Obama Administration was not immune to the right-wing attack on environmental regulation that has dominated the budget making process for years. EPA lost 1,600 staff during the Obama years. But it looks like the Tea Party/Freedom Caucus was just warming up for the main event: EPA with republicans in charge of all three branches of the federal government. The effort to eliminate national environmental regulation is now underway.Before the Trump-Pruitt budgetary train wreck hit last month, state environmental agencies were generally holding their own, and California was rapidly increasing its environmental programs. Still, some states have been struggling. Writing about Massachusetts in the Boston Globe in early March, David Abel observed that:Over the past decade, the state Department of Environmental Protection’s enforcement of air and water quality rules has fallen off sharply, as the agency’s workforce shrunk by nearly a third, according to a Globe review of state records. Enforcement actions for serious violations have dropped by more than half, statistics show, as inspections also declined. Fines collected from violators plummeted during the same period by nearly 75 percent.Trump’s proposed EPA budget cuts the agency by 31 percent from $8.2 billion to $5.7 billion. Initiatives that once promoted environmental justice and environmental education are eliminated. Programs to protect the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay are also eliminated along with most efforts to understand the science of climate change. In fact, much of EPA’s scientific research is eliminated under the proposed budget. This is part of a government-wide attack on climate science in NSF, NASA, NOAA and the Department of Energy.In a Washington Post piece at the end of March, Juliet Eilperin, Chris Mooney and Steven Mufson reported that:The Environmental Protection Agency has issued a new, more detailed plan for laying off 25 percent of its employees and scrapping 56 programs including pesticide safety, water runoff control, and environmental cooperation with Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement…Because of the sweeping cuts to scientific programs, the administrator’s own Science Advisory Board budget would be cut 84 percent. As the document explains, it would not need much money due to “an anticipated lower number of peer reviews.” Reductions in research funds will curtail programs on climate change, water quality, and chemical safety, and “safe and sustainable water resources,” the document said.What is notable about these cuts is how many relate to national, international or scientific programs that are unlikely to be funded at the state and local level. Where federal cuts result in increased risk of visible threats to a community’s health and environmental quality, it is likely that state and local resources will be generated for environmental protection and enforcement. Unfortunately, some poorer states will not have the resources to act. And national problems that cross state borders will be very difficult to address. States are free to negotiate compacts with each other and it is possible that this technique will be used to overcome federal reductions. But the cuts at EPA make no sense. Decades of national progress in successfully cleaning up our environment are sacrificed for no reason whatsoever.Ecosystems do not recognize state or national borders. Toxics transported by air and water can easily move from place to place. That is why national institutions and international treaties are needed to protect the planet. States and communities are the first line of defense, but they may lack the resources or the scientific expertise needed to understand and successfully address the problem. Americans concerned with wellness, diet, exercise, and preventative health care will not be happy when they learn that the federal government is cutting back on efforts to study, regulate, and control toxics in their air, water, and land.The attack on EPA is based on an assessment that the agency is a big, lumbering anti-freedom behemoth. This is nonsense. EPA is actually a small, and by federal government standards, relatively efficient and effective agency. It has long leveraged its modest resource base to generate complementary activities in the private sector and from non-federal governments. The attack on EPA assumes that the public thinks it is abusing its power. That is also nonsense. I think the public finds EPA and its state and local counterpart agencies largely invisible. They only get noticed when an environmental emergency hits: when BP spills oil into the Gulf of Mexico; when Flint’s water supply is contaminated; or if a cloud of smog settles on a city during a heat wave. The public expects government to protect them from harm. That can be harm from a terrorist, a hurricane, a fire or an environmental toxic. Remove that protection and an invisible agency suddenly gets noticed, and an issue that never breaks into the top ten is suddenly number one.Climate change may not be a highly visible local issue, but it is one that most people are concerned about. In a Quinnipiac University National Poll at the end of March, 67 percent opposed cuts to scientific research on the environment and climate change; 73 percent are concerned about climate change and 63 percent do not want climate regulations removed. Of those between 18 and 34 years of age, 78 percent believe that human activity causes climate change–that compares to 54 percent of those over 65. Polling on visible local pollution shows even deeper support for environmental protection.Pruitt and Trump seem to believe we must trade off environment and economic growth. Mike Bloomberg learned when he was New York’s mayor that the opposite was true. A clean environment is an economic asset. People do not want waterfront homes on rivers that smell like sewers. No one wants to live in a place where the air is orange and unbreathable. But if the air is clean, the parks look good, mass transit works and you can dine out in a smoke free environment, businesses and people want to visit, move in and invest. Solar energy is not just cleaner than coal, it is cheaper. Mayors know that a clean, healthy environment is a bankable asset. Governors get it too. So do real estate developers.State and local governments cannot perform all the functions that a national environmental agency can. There are places where a failing EPA will fail the American people. Science, cross border impacts, and global issues will be neglected under the Trump-Pruitt EPA. But visible local environmental impacts will generate “not-in-my-backyard” community activation. People care about their family’s health and their own health. Toxic waste, polluted air, garbage on the beach, and lead in their drinking water will require mayors and governors to act. And they will."

If this happened, it would pave the way for government to divert public funding from public schools to pay for vouchers for religious schools, as Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos advocates.The Blaine Amendment was proposed by Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives James G. Blaine in 1875. Blaine was an ambitious politician from Maine who ran for president in 1876, 1880, and 1884. He was interested in a wide range of issues, including trade, monetary policy, and foreign affairs. He is remembered today for the Constitutional amendment he proposed, which passed the House but not the Senate:No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.Although the Blaine Amendment was not adopted as an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, it was adopted by many states and incorporated into their state constitutions to prohibit spending public money on religious schools.Natelson is right that the public schools of the 19th century were deeply imbued with Protestant teachings and practices. I wrote about the battle between Protestants and Catholics in my history of the New York City public schools (The Great School Wars). The arrival of large numbers of Irish immigrants in the 1840s, mostly Catholic, concurred with the beginnings of public school systems in urban areas.In New York City, Bishop John Hughes (later Archbishop Hughes) fought the local school authorities over the content of the textbooks, which contained anti-Catholic selections, and the daily Protestant prayers and rituals in the schools. Hughes demanded equal funding for Catholic schools, since the public schools served as Protestant schools. Even if they cleansed the textbooks of Protestant views of history, he said, the schools would still fail to meet the needs of Catholic children for a Catholic education. He did not want nonsectarian schools; he wanted Catholic schools. He proposed that the state fund both Catholic public schools and Protestant public schools. He ultimately lost the battle, but he determined to build an independent Catholic school system that was privately supported to make sure that Catholic children were not exposed to Protestant teachings in the public schools. His example eventually persuaded the American Catholic Church to require all parishes to open their own schools, and to expect all Catholic children to attend them.The Protestants who then ran the New York City Public School Society tried to placate Bishop Hughes by expurgating textbook content that he found offensive. Their efforts did not satisfy Bishop Hughes because he did not want nonsectarian public schools. He wanted schools that taught the Catholic religion to Catholic children.In the 1840s and 1850s, the Know-Nothing Party formed to advocate for white Anglo-Protestant nativism and to harass Catholics and immigrants. The popular press was rife with cartoons ridiculing Catholics and articles warning about the Catholic menace. Prejudice against Catholics and Irish immigrants occasionally turned violent, and churches and convents were burned to the ground.The Blaine Amendment appealed to anti-Catholic sentiment among the dominant Protestant majority (Blaine’s mother was Irish-Catholic, and as Natelson points out, there is no evidence that he was prejudiced). Blaine was a member of the moderate faction of the Republican party and a strong supporter of black suffrage. (Ironically, Archbishop Hughes of New York was an opponent of abolitionism.)Natelson maintains that the anti-Catholic origins of the Blaine amendment are reason enough to overturn them.But it seems to me even more plausible to argue that the public schools today are not “Protestant schools,” that they are thoroughly nonsectarian in character, and that they fulfill the original promise of the Blaine Amendment, which is to serve all children on equal terms, regardless of their religion. Thanks to the Supreme Court ruling Engel v. Vitale in 1962, forbidding state-sponsored prayer in the public schools, the public schools no longer impose any religious prayers or practices, as was common in most public schools well into the 20th century.The motives of James G. Blaine or Catherine Beecher Stowe or Horace Mann or Henry Bernard or any of the other 19th-century founders of public schools are irrelevant today. They matter less than the reality and practices of public schools today that the Blaine Amendments permit and protect. Because of the states’ Blaine Amendments, public schools across the nation welcome children who are of every religion or no religion, whether Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jewish, Hindi, Buddhist, atheist, or any other belief. To rule against the Blaine Amendments would open the door to subsidizing religious schools with public dollars. On many occasions, voucher advocates have asked voters to repeal their state’s Blaine amendment to allow vouchers for religious schools, and in every state, voters said no. Betsy DeVos and her husband sponsored a referendum in Michigan in 2000 to roll back that state’s ban on vouchers, and voters rejected their proposal overwhelmingly. A proposal to permit vouchers was rejected by voters in Utah in 2007. Jeb Bush promoted a referendum to change the state constitution in Florida in 2012 (he called it the “The Florida Religious Freedom Amendment”), and despite its deceptive name (who would vote no to religious freedom?), voters decisively said no. The voucher programs that now exist were installed by state legislatures circumventing their own state constitution and the will of the voters. The pro-voucher legislators say that the money goes to the family to spend wherever it wants, including religious schools. They go out of their way to try to disguise these voucher programs by calling them something else, like “opportunity scholarships,” “tax credits,” “education savings accounts,” “empowerment savings accounts.” But they are still vouchers for religious schools.The legislators know that the public opposes funding vouchers for religious schools. Thus they try to avoid calling them what they are or asking for a public referendum to change the state constitution. Voters have repeatedly made clear that they do not want to pay their taxes to underwrite religious schools.The founders were wiser than we are. The First Amendment states clearly that Congress is not allowed to establish any religion. The founders were well aware of the centuries of religious rivalry and factionalism that had brought constant war and bloodshed to Europe, and they did not wish to encourage it in their new nation. The word “education” does not appear in the Constitution. It is a responsibility left to the states. That does not mean that the federal government has no obligation to fund education, in support of the general welfare; it does. That does not mean that the federal government does not have the power to protect the civil rights of students; under the Fourteenth Amendment, it does. If the High Court reviews the state Blaine Amendments, I hope the Justices will recognize that the founders knowingly decided to avoid state entanglement with religious establishments. Let the states decide what belongs in their state constitutions, by popular vote. Our public schools are no longer the Protestant public schools that Bishop Hughes fought against. They are an integral part of our democratic society. They are a public good, like the services of police and firefighters, like public beaches, libraries, and parks. Separation of church and state is a valuable principle that protects the church schools from government intervention and mandates. Religious liberty is best protected by keeping it separate from government dollars and government control."

Former Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey has all of these qualities, which is why I expect him to make a smooth transition to the pro game. It’s also why he puts me strongly in mind of the Atlanta Falcons’ Devonta Freeman.Freeman, who’s earned consecutive Pro Bowl honors during the past two seasons, was a fourth-round draft pick out of Florida State in 2014. That was in large part because he lacked size at 5 feet 8 inches and 206 pounds, and because he ran an uninspiring 4.58 40 at the combine. McCaffrey is listed at 6 feet even and 197 pounds, which may not help his draft stock but won’t hurt it much either. While I expected a strong performance at the combine from McCaffrey, it turned out to be nothing short of brilliance. McCaffrey clocked a 4.48 40. Just as impressive were his 37 1/2 vertical jump, 4.22 20-yard shuttle, 6.57 second 3-cone drill and 11.03 60-yard shuttle, all tops for running backs in Indianapolis. What really separates McCaffrey from other prospects, and what heightens the parallels with Freeman, is his incredible versatility as a runner and pass-catcher. Call him a Swiss army knife, if you like.According to ESPN The Magazine, McCaffrey ― who turns 21 in June ― ranked second in the nation among Power 5 running backs on rushing plays directed outside the tackles during the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Additionally, he was slotted fifth in catch percentage and third in yards after catch. And being a capable pass-catching back isn’t just about the screen game. The next step is the slot ― and then on wheel routes ― where few guys have the quickness and the hands needed. Marshawn Lynch was great at this, David Johnson can do it, and Le’Veon Bell excels.Freeman, to his credit, is also deft in such a role for the Falcons. When your running back isn’t merely a three-down guy, but also someone who can really catch the ball, offenses open up and become that much more dangerous. McCaffrey, for his part, possesses the necessary elusiveness and willingness to make “traffic” catches, which bodes well.There’s also McCaffrey’s dynamic punt and kick return ability. In 2015, he broke the all-time single-season NCAA record with 3,864 all-purpose yards. This past year, despite woeful quarterback play, he still managed to rush for over 1,600 yards and a whopping 16 total touchdowns. As a comparison, Freeman also scored 16 touchdowns as a junior, albeit on 1,000 yards and a 5.9 rush average (McCaffrey’s was 6.3).When it comes down to the draft, it doesn’t really matter whether McCaffrey is the second, third or sixth running back off the board. I’d even argue that as a pro, his game translates better than it did as a collegian.Versatility in the NFL is rewarded in spades ― roles are carved out to really maximize talent. (Think Danny Woodhead, Darren Sproles and Tyreek Hill.) To be sure, defenses are much better ― faster and more complex ― but while everyone game-planned for McCaffrey as the Cardinal’s first, second and even third option, that won’t be the case in the league. Better yet, vision ― undoubtedly one of his best skills ― also makes for an easier transition than, say, just being a power back. (Ask Tyrone Wheatley, Ron Dayne or Trent Richardson about that.)This is not to say McCaffrey is another Le’Veon Bell, but that’s where the comparison to the Steelers’ megastar running back makes sense. Dictating to the defense instead of letting the defense dictate to you ― that’s how both of these guys prefer to run the football. It is very, very hard to do, and it doesn’t necessarily mean McCaffrey, a former Heisman finalist, will automatically become a great player. But it definitely helps.All in all, McCaffrey and his dynamic versatility remind me of no one so much as Devonta Freeman. I suspect he will soon be one of the league’s most productive running backs, and perhaps just as importantly, a three-down back as well.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

55,QUEER VOICES,Trey Pearson Sends Hopeful Message To Gay Christians In New Video,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trey-pearson-silver-horizons_us_58eb99cbe4b058f0a03100c9,"The singer hopes ""Silver Horizon"" will ""change hearts.""",2017-04-10,"“Hopefully, it can help change people’s hearts on how they view same-sex relationships,” singer Trey Pearson said of his new video, ""Silver Horizon.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ebe04316000021004d9c14.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It’s easy to spot the parallels in the new music video for Trey Pearson’s “Silver Horizon” and the singer-songwriter’s journey over the past year. In the clip, which can be viewed above, Pearson watches from the pews as a young gay man sings and dances energetically before a church congregation. After the man’s performance concludes, he shares a tender kiss with another man in the sanctuary as the crowd of parishioners breaks into applause. Released April 3, “Silver Horizon” marks Pearson’s debut as a solo artist after 20 years as the lead singer of the Christian rock band Everyday Sunday. It’s also his first musical effort since coming out as gay in an open letter he wrote to fans in the June 2016 issue of (614) Magazine. Coming to terms with his sexuality, he said, has left him feeling more “liberated,” and hence artistically inspired, than ever before. “When you have this major part of your life that you’ve tried to hold down, suppress and ignore... it feels like a valve has popped open,” the 36-year-old told The Huffington Post. “I feel a lot of freedom to express myself and what I’m going through. Honestly, I’ve written more songs in this past year than ever before. I just feel like I’ve had so much to write about.” To direct “Silver Horizon,” Pearson tapped Stephen Cone, whose 2015 movie, “Henry Gamble’s Birthday Party,” was a coming-of-age tale about an evangelical preacher’s gay teen son struggling with his sexuality. It was a narrative that Pearson said he instantly related to. Though the Ohio native came out to his friends and family members months before the (614) Magazine article was published, he said the path to acceptance has been “difficult.” Pearson and his wife, Lauren, separated in the wake of his announcement, but continue to share parenting responsibilities of their two young children. In September, Pearson and his band were axed from the lineup of California’s Joshua Fest, a “family friendly” Christian music festival, after 11 members of the event’s production team threatened to walk out if he performed. “It’s crazy that anybody would try to shame you for being your most authentic, best self,” Pearson, who had been “excited and honored” to be the festival’s first openly gay headliner, said of the experience. At the last minute, however, he was invited to join the members of Five Iron Frenzy, a ska-punk band, for their encore ― a move he described as “really encouraging.”Naming Bleachers and The 1975 as influences, Pearson said “Silver Horizon” is just the first of many projects in the works, including two EPs and a full-length solo album. Describing his sound as “progressive pop,” he shrugged off the suggestion that his faith will be less reflected in his music now that he’s come out. “I have a major problem with people using ‘Christian’ to describe anything but a person. It makes a great noun and a horrible adjective,” he said. “I don’t think bands, artists, movies or restaurants can be ‘Christian.’ A person is a Christian.”Ultimately, Pearson would like “Silver Horizon” to “bring hope to people who’ve felt that it wasn’t OK to be themselves.” He added that he’s “thought a lot about how much I wish, when I was younger, there would’ve been somebody that I looked up to,” and would like to his work to inspire other young LGBTQ people. “I hope people smile as much when they see [the video] as I do,” he said. “Hopefully, it can help change people’s hearts on how they view same-sex relationships.” For the latest in LGBTQ entertainment, check out the Queer Voices newsletter.

From now on we will respond with force to any aggressor or any breach of red lines from whoever it is and America knows our ability to respond well,” said the statement published by the group on media outlet Ilam al Harbi (War Media).U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, meanwhile, blamed Russian inaction for helping fuel the chemical weapons attack it had reacted to, saying Moscow had failed to carry out a 2013 agreement to secure and destroy chemical weapons in Syria.He said the United States expected Russia to take a tougher stance against Syria by rethinking its alliance with Assad because “every time one of these horrific attacks occurs, it draws Russia closer into some level of responsibility.”PUTIN, ROUHANI SPEAKRussian President Vladimir Putin and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani said in a phone call that aggressive U.S. actions against Syria were not permissible and violated international law, the Kremlin said on Sunday.The two leaders also called for an objective investigation into an incident involving chemical weapons in Syria’s Idlib and said they were ready to deepen cooperation to fight terrorism, the Kremlin said in a statement on its website.Syrian army forces had been losing ground across the country until Russia intervened militarily in September 2015, propping up Assad and protecting its own interests in the region.Assad has also drawn heavily on foreign Shi’ite militias sponsored by Iran, led by Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, for his most important gains since the Russian intervention.The joint command center also said the presence of U.S troops in northern Syria where Washington has hundreds of special forces helping the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to oust Islamic State was “illegal” and that Washington had a long-term plan to occupy the area.The regional alliance said the U.S. cruise missile strikes on a Syrian base which Washington said was involved in a chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians would not deter their forces from “liberating” all of Syrian territory.In Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the U.S. missile strike was a “a strategic error, and a repeat of the mistakes of the past,” the state news agency IRNA reported.“The Islamic Republic has shown that.. it does not back off and its people and officials ... do not retreat in the face of threats,” said Khamenei.Many Syrians opposed to Assad’s rule consider Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iranian-backed troops as occupiers seeking to drive out mainly Sunni Syrians from the areas they live in. They hold Iran and its allies responsible for the displacement of millions outside the country.They also see Russia as a foreign occupier whose relentless aerial bombardment of rebel-held areas has led to thousands of civilian casualties. Some accuse Moscow of applying a “scorched-earth policy” that targets hospitals, schools and residential areas more than frontlines to break the resolve of the anti-Assad insurgency.(Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Additional reporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Stephen Powell)"

The military vessels will operate in the Western Pacific rather than making previously planned port visits to Australia, it added.This year North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un, have repeatedly indicated an intercontinental ballistic missile test or something similar could be coming, possibly as soon as April 15, the 105th birthday of North Korea’s founding president and celebrated annually as “the Day of the Sun.”Earlier this week U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Florida, where Trump pressed his counterpart to do more to curb North Korea’s nuclear program.Trump’s national security aides have completed a review of U.S. options to try to curb North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. These include economic and military measures but lean more toward sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its reclusive neighbor.Although the option of pre-emptive military strikes on North Korea is not off the table, the review prioritizes less-risky steps and de-emphasizes direct military action.Trump spoke with South Korea’s acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn on Friday, the White House said on Saturday in a statement which did not mention the strike group.(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Richard Chang)"

However, his bid was rejected and he was wanted for disregarding a deportation order, Hysing said.Police had been looking for him since Sweden’s Migration Agency in December gave him four weeks to leave, but security services had not viewed him as a militant threat.Sweden’s prosecution authority said a second person had been arrested on suspicion of having committed a terrorist offence through murder, but police said they were more convinced than ever that the Uzbek man was the driver of the truck.Another five people were being held for questioning after raids and police said they had conducted about 500 interviews.Police across the Nordic region went on heightened alert after the attack and in neighboring Norway police set off a controlled explosion of a “bomb-like device” in central Oslo on Sunday and took a suspect into custody.FLOWERS AND DEFIANCEAlthough nine of the 15 people injured remained in hospital, two in intensive care, Stockholm began to return normal on Sunday with the removal of police barricades along the Drottninggatan street where the attack took place.Hundreds of flower bouquets covered steps leading down to the square next to where the truck ploughed into the Ahlens department store, with more piled up under boarded-up windows.Only yards from the scene, thousands of people gathered in the Sergels Torg square in a show of unity as heavily armed police stood guard and a police helicopter hovered overhead.“I want to show I’m not afraid to go out,” Eva Udd, a 55-year-old nurse who had joined the demonstration with a friend, said. “I usually never go to things like this, but this just felt so very important.”Husam Kranda, a Libyan living in Sweden for the past five years and now working as translator, was among the multi-ethnic gathering which underlined Stockholm’s cosmopolitan inhabitants.“We believe it’s our duty to come here and show our support for the Swedish society,” he said.“I know it’s a difficult time, there is a lot going on within Swedish society and internationally. But today is not about that, it’s about showing support for our neighbors and our beloved ones.”He was joined by his wife from Uzbekistan, Irana Mamedova.“I really feel ashamed [of] that man, because this country give him everything, this country give him peace,” she said of the Uzbek suspect. “He is a monster.”Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, addressing a Social Democratic party conference in the western city of Gothenburg, said Sweden would never be broken by acts of terror.“We will hunt down these murderers with the full power of Sweden’s democracy. There will be no compromises,” he said.Sweden, a nation of 10 million inhabitants, has long taken pride in its tolerant liberal society and been among the world’s most welcoming nations to immigrants.But some Swedes are having second thoughts after more than 160,000 people, many from Syria, applied for asylum in 2015.The Ahlens store canceled a planned half-price sale of smoke-damaged goods and apologized after a storm of protest on social media that this would be disrespectful to the victims.(Additional reporting by Johan Sennero, Johannes Hellstrom, Helena Soderpalm, Olof Swahnberg and Daniel Dickson, and Temis Tormo and Philip O’Connor for Reuters TV in Stockholm, and Julia Fioretti in Brussels; writing by Simon Johnson, Alister Doyle and Niklas Pollard; editing by Mark Heinrich and Alexander Smith)"

The military vessels will operate in the Western Pacific rather than making previously planned port visits to Australia, it added.This year North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un, have repeatedly indicated an intercontinental ballistic missile test or something similar could be coming, possibly as soon as April 15, the 105th birthday of North Korea’s founding president and celebrated annually as “the Day of the Sun.”Earlier this week U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Florida, where Trump pressed his counterpart to do more to curb North Korea’s nuclear program.Trump’s national security aides have completed a review of U.S. options to try to curb North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. These include economic and military measures but lean more toward sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its reclusive neighbor.Although the option of pre-emptive military strikes on North Korea is not off the table, the review prioritizes less-risky steps and de-emphasizes direct military action.Trump spoke with South Korea’s acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn on Friday, the White House said on Saturday in a statement which did not mention the strike group.(Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Richard Chang)"

The system was shut down around 1:20 a.m., he said.Worried residents dialed 911 in a surge that clogged up the system, with some callers enduring six-minute wait times. Operators usually answer 911 calls within 10 seconds, Dallas spokeswoman Sana Syed said.Dallas mom Beth Mortenson described the wailing sound as “like an air raid.”“I knew there wasn’t severe weather, checked to see if there was severe weather. When there wasn’t I thought, we need to get out of here,” Mortenson told CBS-11.Mortenson said a 911 dispatcher told her authorities didn’t know what was going on. Vaz said city technicians initially suspected a malfunction and were forced to disable the emergency alert system to quiet the sirens. The citywide system is likely to be reactivated late Sunday or Monday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide alternative emergency announcements if the need should arise, Vaz said.Should the alarms go off before the system is reactivated, Vaz asked the public to not call 911.Vaz said the idea that hackers would break into the emergency system was not a concern “until now.”“This is a very rare event,” Vaz said.He said someone may have accessed a couple of sirens before, but never the entire network. He declined to provide details on how the attack was carried out until the investigation is complete. A search for whoever is responsible is underway with the help of the Federal Communication Commission, Vaz said.“This is going to be a very long process,” Vaz said. “This is like finding a needle in a haystack, pretty much.” Mayor Mike Rawlings vows to “find and prosecute whomever is responsible.”“This is yet another serious example of the need for us to upgrade and better safeguard our city’s technology infrastructure,” the mayor said in a Facebook post. “It’s a costly proposition, which is why every dollar of taxpayer money must be spent with critical needs such as this in mind. Making the necessary improvements is imperative for the safety of our citizens.”"

Rallies went out in cities across the country on Saturday, the largest of them in the capital, Caracas. Protesters in the capital chanted “Liberty, Liberty” and carried signs saying “Dictator Maduro!” and “Elections Now!”While protesters say Saturday’s demonstration in Caracas started peacefully, the day ended in fierce clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Officers in riot gear used tear gas and water cannons to prevent marchers from proceeding. Some protesters threw rocks and petrol bombs and lit garbage on fire. Around a hundred protesters broke into an office of the Supreme Court.Opposition activists say dozens of people were detained on Saturday. Saturday’s protests came after ten days of intense unrest, sparked by the Supreme Court’s decision last month to strip the country’s Parliament from most of its powers.On March 29, Venezuela’s highest court ruled that it would take over the legislative powers of the National Assembly, the country’s opposition-controlled Congress. The move by the Supreme Court, which was stacked with Maduro-allies during the last session of the National Assembly before it fell in opposition hands, sparked fierce condemnation from activists, international powers and even supporters of President Maduro. Luisa Ortega, Venezuela’s attorney general, called the ruling “a rupture” of the constitutional order.While the court eventually reversed the ruling amid growing pressure, the decision galvanized the opposition and set off tense protests throughout the following week. The unrest claimed its first victim on Thursday, when a police officer shot a law student dead on the outskirts of Caracas. Opposition leaders said 19-year-old Jairo Ortiz was killed as authorities tried to break up a protest. The Interior Ministry confirmed Oritz’ death and vowed it would charge the police officer who shot him, but disputed claims that Ortiz was a protester.Demonstrators were angered anew on Friday, when the national comptroller’s offices announced opposition leader Henrique Capriles would be barred from holding office for 15 years.While the government accused Capriles, a two-time presidential candidate who narrowly lost the election to Maduro in 2013, of breaking contracting laws and improper management of donations, the opposition says the move is intended to crack down on the opposition ahead of new elections in 2018. “When the dictatorship squeals it’s a sign we’re advancing,” Capriles said in a speech on Friday. “The only one who is disqualified here is you, Nicolas Maduro.”Discontent with Maduro’s policies is at an all-time high as Venezuela battles a dramatic economic and humanitarian crisis. Falling oil prices and economic mismanagement brought about a recession that the IMF predicts will last until at least 2019. As the economy shrank, Venezuela faced growing poverty and crippling shortages.Today, unemployment is up and wages have declined dramatically. Stores across the country lack basic food products. Hospitals go without medicines and essential medical equipment.As opposition intensified, Maduro has stepped up the crackdown on dissent. More then a hundred political prisoners are currently behind bars, the New York Times reported recently, up from 89 a year ago. “The level of repression has risen to a brutal level,” Alfredo Romero, who heads Penal Forum, a human rights organization that tracks political arrests, told the newspaper.For now, there’s no end in sight to the protests. Demonstrators are expected to rally again on Monday and a large rally is planned for Wednesday, April 19. “It’s been two years since I’ve been out on the streets,” Richard Morton, a 43-year-old electrical engineer told Reuters. “I’m out today because I see people acting in solidarity and the lawmakers are backing us up more.

Greg died a few months after this picture was taken.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ea664a1500002300c7ebec.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At the end, there were only two things I cared about: the bag of heroin on my glass-topped coffee table, and the cell phone next to it. They were my two life lines. After a decade of abusing opiates, I couldn’t stop using heroin. I was psychologically, physically, and emotionally dependent on it. My phone, too, was an absolute necessity. It linked me to my network – which I’d started building since I worked in the White House as a young, ambitious staffer. On the last day of my drug use, I stared down at the table. To my left, the baggie. To my right, the phone.At the time, I had no idea that one of those two things would save me from the other. Now, my phone – and, more specifically, its social media capabilities – are an intrinsic part of my new life in recovery. It’s been more than two years since I got the call on my cell, telling me there was a bed available at a public detox. I took that call, and the chance to get sober. While I was in rehab, I communicated with my family and friends. I started connecting with other people in recovery online, through Facebook and Twitter. Through social media and articles I read, I learned that addiction is a chronic brain illness. Online, people were speaking up about their experience, breaking the silence of addiction. I’d found my tribe – and it fit in my back pocket, or right in the palm of my hand.My phone is how I found out my friends were dying of the health problem that I had. Early in my recovery, I lost four people who were very close to me, all within 3 months. One, Nick, was an aspiring actor. He was found in his room and had died hours earlier from a fatal overdose. Another friend, Greg, died just a few short weeks after. I will never forget getting those messages, or how I realized, days later, that my friends were only four out of hundreds of people who die every day from addiction-related issues. It seemed that, everywhere I turned, someone had lost a son, a daughter, a friend, or a mother or father. Addiction, I realized, was lethal. And staying silent was our death sentence.Sitting on my bed in the Pasadena sober living home where I’d finally landed, I looked down at the phone in my hand. Statistics swirled in my head. Addiction affects 1 in 3 people in the United States. Only 10% of people with addiction actually got treatment for their disease. The wait time for access to public facilities typically exceeds 30 days. I myself had frantically called multiple treatment centers, only to be told that beds weren’t available, and likely wouldn’t be for multiple weeks. Being placed on waiting lists, knowing that my window of willingness to keep fighting for help was waning by the hour, were some of the most terrifying moments in my entire life. I knew that untreated addiction was lethal. And yet, 23 million people in the United States live in long-term recovery. People made it – but how to make that attainable for more people?On the evening of October 4, 2015, I opened my Facebook app. And there, in my hands, was the livestream video that changed my life forever: the UNITE to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It sounds like a small thing, but watching that concert, which was attended by tens of thousands of people in recovery and included performances by sober artists that I grew up listening to on the radio, changed my perception of what was possible. That was my community – my people. And they were standing up for what they believed in. They weren’t hiding and they weren’t ashamed. That was the day that I stopped being a social media bystander and got involved. I’d found my purpose – and once again, it was right under my nose.The idea that social media can create massive cultural change isn’t a new one. Because social media allows people to communicate freely and share information, it enables the creation of like-minded groups. If these groups are big enough, or driven enough, they have the potential to positively influence and shape cultural progress. Recent examples of this include the Green Revolution in Iran, Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, and #BlackLivesMatter protests. And, of course, the new grassroots movement to end the stigma of addiction. Our community, once marginalized and shamed into silence, had found a way to make its voice heard – and it was loud. Feeling inspired, I logged on to Facebook messenger and found Tom Coderre, a recovery advocacy change-maker and friend of Facing Addiction, the movement whose work I admired. He immediately put me in touch with co-founders Greg Williams and Jim Hood– and I was on my way. I had no idea where I was going, or how I would get there, but I was going. I had a mission: to lift-up voices of people in recovery, and share the vital stories of our community.Soon, I was on the road, heading to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention. Hey, I’d done crazier things – now, I was doing them in recovery, and for a good cause. We coined the project Addiction Across America and partnered with Facing Addiction. We were driving 3,000 miles east to speak at the convention and advocate for addiction solutions. It was a 30-day road trip through the heartland of America – communities hit hardest by the addiction crisis. I had nothing but $20, my phone, and a $100 Google Stream notebook when I came up with the idea. But I also had a road map from the people who’d taken this journey of advocacy before me, and the stories kept coming. I published some of these stories in a digital web series. That was the beginning of what is now called the Voices Project.It was also the beginning of my recovery advocacy. After the convention, and the 2016 election, I realized the tremendous influence that social media could have on how people talked, thought, acted, and even voted. I saw a way for us to transform the recovery movement into a campaign – one so big that it couldn’t be ignored or silenced. So I started a Facebook page, then added Twitter and Instagram. Up front, I decided these accounts would never be about me. The point was always to raise up the voices of others. The pages began to grow. People from all over the world found me. 5,000 followers turned into 50,000. Now, that number is over 200,000 people, combined across all three platforms. But it’s never been about the numbers. Each one of those “followers” has a face, a heartbeat. They are real to me. They’re people. They’re a mom in Connecticut who lost her child; an incarcerated recovering heroin addict in Richmond who’s a peer leader in his cell, helping others find recovery; a brave young man in Los Angeles who would come out as a person in recovery and tell his inspiring story for the first time.Before the Voices Project, I never thought of myself as a storyteller. But I guess it’s who I am – and today, I’m okay with that. I’m a storyteller with a purpose. I didn’t set out to become an advocate. I had no idea that my recovery would take me in this direction, but like so many others across this country, once I became aware of this crisis, I couldn’t ignore what I saw. The injustice, prejudice, and epidemic loss of life have me mad as hell. Every day, more lives are lost; another unfair, discriminatory policy is written. So much depends on telling our stories. I can’t stop. I won’t. And while I don’t often know what to say, I do know what to do today.And that’s where you come in. The Voices Project proves that together we can help end the addiction crisis. We can do the work that we could never accomplish alone. Together, we’ll end the silence and show this country that we are one of the largest constituencies ever to exist. We can inspire change, save lives, heal our communities, and build a digital movement like nobody’s ever seen before. This is the #VoicesProject.Our time is now. Let’s go make some history.Ryan Hampton is an outreach lead and recovery advocate at Facing Addiction, a leading nonprofit dedicated to ending the addiction crisis in the United States.

My phone, too, was an absolute necessity. It linked me to my network – which I’d started building since I worked in the White House as a young, ambitious staffer. On the last day of my drug use, I stared down at the table. To my left, the baggie. To my right, the phone.At the time, I had no idea that one of those two things would save me from the other. Now, my phone – and, more specifically, its social media capabilities – are an intrinsic part of my new life in recovery. It’s been more than two years since I got the call on my cell, telling me there was a bed available at a public detox. I took that call, and the chance to get sober. While I was in rehab, I communicated with my family and friends. I started connecting with other people in recovery online, through Facebook and Twitter. Through social media and articles I read, I learned that addiction is a chronic brain illness. Online, people were speaking up about their experience, breaking the silence of addiction. I’d found my tribe – and it fit in my back pocket, or right in the palm of my hand.My phone is how I found out my friends were dying of the health problem that I had. Early in my recovery, I lost four people who were very close to me, all within 3 months. One, Nick, was an aspiring actor. He was found in his room and had died hours earlier from a fatal overdose. Another friend, Greg, died just a few short weeks after. I will never forget getting those messages, or how I realized, days later, that my friends were only four out of hundreds of people who die every day from addiction-related issues. It seemed that, everywhere I turned, someone had lost a son, a daughter, a friend, or a mother or father. Addiction, I realized, was lethal. And staying silent was our death sentence.Sitting on my bed in the Pasadena sober living home where I’d finally landed, I looked down at the phone in my hand. Statistics swirled in my head. Addiction affects 1 in 3 people in the United States. Only 10% of people with addiction actually got treatment for their disease. The wait time for access to public facilities typically exceeds 30 days. I myself had frantically called multiple treatment centers, only to be told that beds weren’t available, and likely wouldn’t be for multiple weeks. Being placed on waiting lists, knowing that my window of willingness to keep fighting for help was waning by the hour, were some of the most terrifying moments in my entire life. I knew that untreated addiction was lethal. And yet, 23 million people in the United States live in long-term recovery. People made it – but how to make that attainable for more people?On the evening of October 4, 2015, I opened my Facebook app. And there, in my hands, was the livestream video that changed my life forever: the UNITE to Face Addiction rally on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It sounds like a small thing, but watching that concert, which was attended by tens of thousands of people in recovery and included performances by sober artists that I grew up listening to on the radio, changed my perception of what was possible. That was my community – my people. And they were standing up for what they believed in. They weren’t hiding and they weren’t ashamed. That was the day that I stopped being a social media bystander and got involved. I’d found my purpose – and once again, it was right under my nose.The idea that social media can create massive cultural change isn’t a new one. Because social media allows people to communicate freely and share information, it enables the creation of like-minded groups. If these groups are big enough, or driven enough, they have the potential to positively influence and shape cultural progress. Recent examples of this include the Green Revolution in Iran, Arab Spring, the Occupy movement, and #BlackLivesMatter protests. And, of course, the new grassroots movement to end the stigma of addiction. Our community, once marginalized and shamed into silence, had found a way to make its voice heard – and it was loud. Feeling inspired, I logged on to Facebook messenger and found Tom Coderre, a recovery advocacy change-maker and friend of Facing Addiction, the movement whose work I admired. He immediately put me in touch with co-founders Greg Williams and Jim Hood– and I was on my way. I had no idea where I was going, or how I would get there, but I was going. I had a mission: to lift-up voices of people in recovery, and share the vital stories of our community.Soon, I was on the road, heading to Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention. Hey, I’d done crazier things – now, I was doing them in recovery, and for a good cause. We coined the project Addiction Across America and partnered with Facing Addiction. We were driving 3,000 miles east to speak at the convention and advocate for addiction solutions. It was a 30-day road trip through the heartland of America – communities hit hardest by the addiction crisis. I had nothing but $20, my phone, and a $100 Google Stream notebook when I came up with the idea. But I also had a road map from the people who’d taken this journey of advocacy before me, and the stories kept coming. I published some of these stories in a digital web series. That was the beginning of what is now called the Voices Project.It was also the beginning of my recovery advocacy. After the convention, and the 2016 election, I realized the tremendous influence that social media could have on how people talked, thought, acted, and even voted. I saw a way for us to transform the recovery movement into a campaign – one so big that it couldn’t be ignored or silenced. So I started a Facebook page, then added Twitter and Instagram. Up front, I decided these accounts would never be about me. The point was always to raise up the voices of others. The pages began to grow. People from all over the world found me. 5,000 followers turned into 50,000. Now, that number is over 200,000 people, combined across all three platforms. But it’s never been about the numbers. Each one of those “followers” has a face, a heartbeat. They are real to me. They’re people. They’re a mom in Connecticut who lost her child; an incarcerated recovering heroin addict in Richmond who’s a peer leader in his cell, helping others find recovery; a brave young man in Los Angeles who would come out as a person in recovery and tell his inspiring story for the first time.Before the Voices Project, I never thought of myself as a storyteller. But I guess it’s who I am – and today, I’m okay with that. I’m a storyteller with a purpose. I didn’t set out to become an advocate. I had no idea that my recovery would take me in this direction, but like so many others across this country, once I became aware of this crisis, I couldn’t ignore what I saw. The injustice, prejudice, and epidemic loss of life have me mad as hell. Every day, more lives are lost; another unfair, discriminatory policy is written. So much depends on telling our stories. I can’t stop. I won’t. And while I don’t often know what to say, I do know what to do today.And that’s where you come in. The Voices Project proves that together we can help end the addiction crisis. We can do the work that we could never accomplish alone. Together, we’ll end the silence and show this country that we are one of the largest constituencies ever to exist. We can inspire change, save lives, heal our communities, and build a digital movement like nobody’s ever seen before. This is the #VoicesProject.Our time is now. Let’s go make some history.Ryan Hampton is an outreach lead and recovery advocate at Facing Addiction, a leading nonprofit dedicated to ending the addiction crisis in the United States.

The first bombing, in Tanta, a Nile Delta city about 100 km (60 miles) north of Cairo, tore through the inside of St. George Church during its Palm Sunday service, killing at least 27 people and injuring at least 78, the Ministry of Health said.The second, carried out a few hours later by a suicide bomber in Alexandria, hit Saint Mark’s Cathedral, the historic seat of the Coptic Pope, killing 17 people, including three police officers, and injuring 48, the ministry added.Coptic Pope Tawadros had been leading the mass at Saint Mark’s Cathedral at the time of the explosion but was not injured, the Interior Ministry said.“These acts will not harm the unity and cohesion of the people,” he was later quoted as saying by state media.Sisi ordered troops be immediately deployed to assist police in securing vital facilities, a statement from his office said, a rare move for the general-turned-president, who as defense chief led the military’s 2013 ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood’s President Mohamed Mursi.Deflecting Western criticism that he has suppressed political opposition and human rights activists since he was elected in 2014, Sisi has sought to present himself as an indispensable bulwark against terrorism in the Middle East.“The attack...will only harden the determination (of the Egyptian people) to move forward on their trajectory to realize security, stability and comprehensive development,” Sisi said in a statement.President Trump, who hosted Sisi last week in his first official visit to the U.S., expressed support for a leader he has said he plans to work more closely with on fighting Islamist militants, who Sisi identifies as an existential threat.“So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. U.S. strongly condemns. I have great confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly,” Trump wrote on his official Twitter account.Hundreds gathered outside the Tanta church shortly after the blast, some weeping and wearing black while inside, blown apart pews sat atop tiles soaked with blood.“There was blood all over the floor and body parts scattered,” a woman who was inside the church at the time of the attack said.“There was a huge explosion in the hall. Fire and smoke filled the room and the injuries were extremely severe,” another woman, Vivian Fareeg, said.“WE FEEL TARGETED”Islamic State’s branch in Egypt has stepped up attacks and threats against Christians, who comprise about 10 percent of Egypt’s 90 million people and are the biggest Christian minority in the Middle East.In February, scores of Christian families and students fled Egypt’s North Sinai province after a spate of targeted killings.Those attacks followed one of the deadliest on Egypt’s Christian minority, when a suicide bomber hit its largest Coptic cathedral, killing at least 25 people. Islamic State later claimed responsibility for that attack.Islamic State has waged a low-level war against soldiers and police in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula for years but is now targeting Christians and broadening its reach into Egypt’s mainland. That is a potential turning point in a country trying to prevent a provincial insurgency spiraling into wider sectarian bloodshed.Although Copts have faced attacks by Muslim neighbors, who have burnt their homes and churches in poor rural areas, in the past, the community has felt increasingly insecure since Islamic State spread through Iraq and Syria in 2014.“Of course we feel targeted, there was a bomb here about a week ago but it was dismantled. There’s no security,” said another Christian woman in Tanta in reference to an attack earlier this month near a police training center..Wahby Lamie, who had one nephew killed and another injured in the Tanta blast, expressed exasperation.“How much longer are we going to be this divided?

You need to know that you’re making the right choice.,2017-04-09,<p>Most people wait too long to leave a bad job and their health and sanity suffer. Dr. Travis Bradberry shows you when to call it quits.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e679a616000028004d926b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re like most people, you spend more of your valuable waking hours at work than you do anywhere else. It’s critical that you spend your time at the right company, pursuing the right opportunity.Bad management does not discriminate based on salary or job title. A Fortune 500 executive team can experience more dissatisfaction and turnover than the baristas at a local coffee shop. The more demanding your job is and the less control you have over what you do, the more likely you are to suffer.Staying in a bad job for too long can be very harmful to your career. If you’ve tried everything you can think of to make things better and haven’t seen any big changes, it may be time to move on.Choosing to leave a job can be a gut-wrenching decision. You need to know that you’re making the right choice. The good news is there are some clear signs that—if you experience enough of them—suggest it’s time to move on.1. The company is circling the drain. A recent study showed that 71 percent of small businesses close their doors by their tenth year in operation. If you’re worried about your company’s health, there’s a good chance you’re right. Watch for clues, like suddenly needing management approval for even minor expenses, an increase in closed-door meetings, or an increased number of upper-management departures. If you suspect that the business is in trouble, it may be time to leave. If you wait until the company closes, you’ll be in the job market competing against your former co-workers.2. There’s no room for advancement. It’s easy to get stuck in a job and, if you love what you’re doing, getting stuck can be comfortable. However, it’s important to remember that every job should enhance your skills, and add to your value as an employee. If you’re not learning anything new, and are just puttering around doing the same old thing while people around you get promotions and plum assignments, it’s time to look elsewhere.3. You’re out of the loop. Does it seem like you’re always the last one to hear about what’s going on at work? If you’re left out of meetings, rarely get face time with upper management, and have never even heard of the big project everyone else is so excited about, that could mean that your bosses just see you as a body filling a desk, rather than as a valuable contributor. That’s bad news for your career and may mean it’s time to leave.4. You know more than your boss. It’s frustrating to work for someone you believe to be less skilled or knowledgeable than you are, but the real issue is deeper than that. If you can’t trust your company’s leadership to make good decisions and steer the ship in the right direction, you’ll be living in a constant state of anxiety. And, if you’re right that your bosses don’t know what they’re doing, you could find yourself out of a job when the company goes under.5. You have a bad boss who isn’t going anywhere. Bosses come and go, which is why conventional wisdom says that it’s best to just wait a bad boss out. But that’s not always the right move. If you have a bad boss who’s well-liked by upper management, it may be time to leave. In addition to making you miserable every day, a two-faced manager who’s loved by the higher ups can wreak havoc on your career by taking credit for your work, bad-mouthing you to others, and blaming you for things that go wrong.6. You dread going to work. We all get a case of the Mondays from time to time, but if even thinking about your job fills you with dread, it’s probably time to leave. Don’t keep telling yourself you’re having a bad week if what you really have is a job that’s a bad fit.7. You’ve lost your passion. Even if you love the company, your boss, and your co-workers, it’s not worth the effort if you hate the work. Passion is a necessary ingredient for success. If you’re unenthusiastic or even indifferent about the work you do, it’s time to reassess your career.8. Your health is suffering. No paycheck is worth sacrificing your health. Job stress can lead to depression, insomnia, headaches, frequent illness, and worse. Don’t let this happen to you.9. Your personal life is suffering. Whether you work too many hours or you’re stressed and miserable when you come home, it’s time to leave when your job starts affecting your personal life.Bringing It All TogetherIf you do decide to leave, be smart about it. Don’t burn bridges by venting about all of the reasons you’re leaving. That accomplishes nothing, and could even haunt you later. Instead, simply explain that you’re leaving to pursue another opportunity, and then do so graciously.Please share your thoughts in the comments section, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.Want to learn more?

74,POLITICS,New York Set To Offer Free Tuition At 4-Year Colleges,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-set-to-offer-free-tuition-at-4-year-colleges_us_58ea54c5e4b05413bfe39c3a,"If the state Senate approves the budget, New York will become the first state to do so.",2017-04-09,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo introduced a free four-year college tuition plan in January. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ea6eb01500002000c7ebf4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a major victory for the movement to improve access to higher education, New York is set to become the only state that offers free tuition at four-year colleges.Deemed the Excelsior Scholarship, the free tuition plan is included in the $163 billion state budget approved Saturday by the The Democrat-controlled Assembly. The Republican-led Senate will vote on the budget Sunday evening; and with Senate Leader John Flanagan (R-Long Island) supporting it, it’s likely to pass. The Excelsior Scholarship will cover tuition for any New Yorkers whose families earn less than $125,000 a year and who are accepted to one of the state’s public community colleges or public four-year universities ― which cost approximately between $4,350 and $6,470 annually. The scholarship is applicable to around 80 percent of the 940,000 families with college-aged children in New York, says Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who first proposed the tuition-free degree program in January. “Today, college is what high school was—it should always be an option even if you can’t afford it,” Cuomo said in a statement Saturday.“There is no child who will go to sleep tonight and say, I have great dreams, but I don’t believe I’ll be able to get a college education because parents can’t afford it. With this program, every child will have the opportunity that education provides.”If approved, the program will be phased in over three years, first applying to families earning up to 100,000 this fall. Those who take advantage of the opportunity must be enrolled full-time and maintain a certain grade point average and number of credits each year. While the program is similar to what Cuomo first proposed in January, a recent addition to the tuition plan requiring students to live and work in New York after graduation for the same number of years as they received the scholarship is alarming to some student aid experts, the magazine Inside Higher Ed noted. If students breach that, the scholarship will be converted to student loans, though some exceptions may be provided in cases of extreme hardship or out-of-state graduate programs. With similar free community college programs already in place in Tennessee, Oregon and Minnesota, New York’s plan to extend tuition coverage to four-year universities builds upon the college accessibility efforts championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Democratic presidential campaign.

The hope, rather, is to buy time and build resilience. Sheriden Morris, managing director of the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre, the nonprofit behind the plan, told The Huffington Post that the $9 million pilot project aims to prevent the loss of coral species by staving off bleaching in select, high-diversity areas. Pontoons, equipped with low-energy solar technology, would draw up adjacent water from depths of up to 130 feet — where water temperatures are slightly cooler — and flood it onto shallow reefs.“It’s very localized,” Morris said. “This isn’t going to save the reef. All the efforts to improve climate change need to happen at the same time. This is just protecting some of those complex areas.”While some critics have dismissed the plan as a “Band-Aid,” “ridiculous” and a “quick-fix gimmick,” Morris argues that the scientific community must do more than simply wring its hands.“As pressures increase, we have to increase our protection agenda,” she told HuffPost. “We have to actually start doing applied approaches for protections. Otherwise, if we do come out the other side and we do get successful international control of climate — and the Paris Agreement does hold — we might get to the other end and have lost some of these assets already.”The Great Barrier Reef, the world’s largest reef system, is off the coast of Queensland, Australia, and extends more than 1,400 miles. It consists of some 3,000 individual reefs and is home to about 600 species of coral — an astonishing number when one considers that the Caribbean has fewer than 100. Unfortunately, Australia’s marine jewel, like many reefs around the globe, is in serious trouble. Scientists from the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies found that last year’s bleaching, the most severe coral bleaching event on record, had affected 93 percent of the reef. And it could be hammered by another bleaching event this year. Coral bleaching is a phenomenon in which stressed corals expel algae and turn white, often as a result of warming ocean temperatures. If not given time to recover, bleached corals can die. Morris said her organization’s proposal calls for deploying the pontoon units at ecologically and economically valuable reefs around Cairns, a tourist hotspot. She hopes to have the technology in the water before January, the start of bleaching season.“We are looking at how you can actually sustain key, complex communities into the future with the current climate pressures that the reef faces,” she said.A coral expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Rusty Brainard, told HuffPost in an email that, given the plight of corals around the globe, he’s “inclined to think that even small efforts like this are a step in the right direction” as countries work to reverse the global CO₂ emissions trend.“Saving some reefs in the short-term provides more opportunities for recovery and sustainability over the longer term,” said Brainard, chief of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Program at NOAA’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. Mark Eakin, coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch, said that the idea “sounds crazy,” but Australia should give it a try. And while there could be risks, he would prefer to worry about possible harm to living corals than dead reefs. “This sort of thing really only makes sense if it is happening in conjunction with major reductions in CO₂ emissions,” he said in an email. “Otherwise, it is indeed only a Band-Aid.” “As an analogy, bandaging up a wounded soldier but leaving them in the line of fire is not a solution.

Bob Corker, R-Tenn., speaks with reporters before the start of a briefing on Syria for Senators in the Capitol on Friday, April 7, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e81a411500002000c7e9c0.jpeg?ops=crop_0_142_4387_2422%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Here’s a not-so-reassuring thought about President Donald Trump’s strikes against Syria: Even though most members of Congress praised him for punishing Bashar Assad, none of them actually knew the legal and constitutional rationale that supported the action.And few of them seemed especially concerned about what a president already criticized for chaos and impulsiveness might use that power to do next.Asked what constitutional and legal authority the president used to fire 59 $1 million Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airport ― and whether he was concerned how Trump might use that authority in the future ― Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) ducked.“I think the president had the authority to do what he he did,” McConnell said, without elaboration. “And I’m glad he did it.”The No. 2 Republican in the Senate, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, was similarly pleased that Trump retaliated for an alleged chemical bombing this week that killed dozens of civilians. But when he was asked for the U.S. rationale, Cornyn showed why McConnell may have declined to elaborate.“I’ll tell you there is a desire to see what authority that the administration is claiming to operate under so far ― whether it’s based on his powers as commander-in-chief under Article II to deal with the national security interest, or to defend the interest of the United States, or whether there’s more,” Cornyn told reporters after a briefing from Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Other senators who supported the strikes weren’t worried about the authority issues.“I’ll let the international lawyers look at the details of how they view it,” said Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska).Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said it’s open to interpretation if Trump had legal authority.“It can be argued on both sides,” Tester told reporters. “I think we need an [Authorization for the Use of Military Force] that actually addresses this issue. We don’t have one right now.”Some senators had their own ideas for why they believe the administration was acting legally.Some reasoned the strike was permitted under the 2001 AUMF that Congress passed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, although that was aimed at al Qaeda and its affiliates, not the Syrian government.Others said Trump is authorized to take such a step under Article II the Constitution, which grants the president his commander-in-chief military powers.“I believe the president does have inherent authority. I think the president should be able to act,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.“The president is commander-in-chief,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “It’s the same rationale that Ronald Reagan used after there was a bombing of a bar, a disco in Berlin, and he struck Libya. This is not the first time a president of the United States has acted militarily in response to a crisis, and a necessity for us to react.”If there was no clear agreement on what authorized Trump’s attack, there was an even greater divergence of opinion on what comes next, or what the Trump’s undefined authority might allow him to do in Syria, or perhaps North Korea or Ukraine.“I can’t parse that,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who backed Trump’s attack. “That’s a big and complicated question, and not one that I can elaborate.”Many senators did warn that Trump should get a new AUMF from Congress, although there was also little agreement in defining what should be authorized.McConnell said any authorization should let Trump do more.“If the president can think up some AUMF that he thinks that strengthens his hand, I’d be happy to take a look at it,” McConnell told reporters.The Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker (Tenn.), said Trump does need a new authorization if he wants to act much further against Assad, and he suggested it should be detailed.“If it’s going to be something much more extensive, that would need certainly a lot more consultation and an understanding of what the endgame is, which we haven’t had in prior AUMFs,” Corker said.Corker said he expected the administration to outline the basis for its authority when Dunford briefed senators, but no explanation was offered.Senators leaving the briefing said Vice President MIke Pence would detail the rationale in coming days. Nevertheless, like other supporters of the action, Corker was not worried that Trump might go off the rails.“I don’t think you’re seeing the beginnings of some willy-nilly effort. That’s not what’s happening here,” Corker said.While there seemed to be little cohesion among the supporters of the strikes regarding all those troublesome details, opponents had a very clear tale to tell.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) was adamant that Trump can’t launch such attacks simply because he’s the president, and that the 2001 AUMF in no way covers a massive missile launch against a sovereign government. “The Article II powers, by longstanding clear interpretation, allow the president to take unilateral action to defend the United States against an imminent threat. There’s no suggestion that this was the case,” Kaine said.“The reason that you have a process that Congress has to declare first is to stop a president from just feeling like he can do whatever he wants,” Kaine continued. “The president has already, in 75 days, conducted the first ground operations in Yemen, the first ground operations in Syria and now air attacks in Syria. At the beginning of an administration, it’s time to get it right or it’s going to race away from us and we’ll regret it.”Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who warned that bombing Syria would not be legal just hours before Trump did it, said Americans should be very concerned about what the president will do next.“If the president gets away with taking this action against the Syrian regime without a congressional vote, there is no end to the executive power over the military affairs,” Murphy said. “If you don’t need authorization to strike a foreign government with no imminent threat to the United States, then when will Congress ever have to weigh in on military action overseas? I think this is a turning-point moment for the role of Congress setting foreign affairs.”Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting."

Trufant will earn nearly $14 million per season along with nearly $42 million in guaranteed money.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58e6d26c16000020004d93d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Atlanta Falcons standout cornerback Desmond Trufant has agreed to a massive five-year contract extension with the team, according to multiple sources who spoke with The Huffington Post. The contract is worth $69 million, with Trufant earning nearly $14 million per season and almost $42 million in guaranteed money. Trufant, who was previously signed through the 2017-18 NFL season, is now under contract for the next six seasons with Atlanta. The deal makes him the fourth-highest paid cornerback in the NFL in terms of guaranteed dollars.With the league shifting more and more toward passing, possessing quality corners has become increasingly important. The 26-year-old Trufant earned Pro Bowl honors in 2015, and was likely well on his way to another selection last season before requiring season-ending surgery after suffering a pectoral injury.As a precaution, the former Falcons’ first-round pick will be held out of offseason workouts, but clearly the team isn’t worried.“Trufant is coming along great,” head coach Dan Quinn recently said at the NFC coaches breakfast in Phoenix. “We won’t have him practice during [organized team activities (OTAs)], but by the time we get to training camp, he’ll be ready to go and battle.”All in all, it has been a highly productive and eventful offseason for GM Thomas Dimitroff and the entire organization. As the team gets set to debut its $1.6 billion new state-of-the-art Mercedes Benz Stadium, it will do so with a new offensive coordinator in Steve Sarkisian ― a story first broken by HuffPost ― after former OC Kyle Shanahan left to become the head coach of the 49ers.While the record-breaking Atlanta offense ― led by MVP Matt Ryan and All-World receiver Julio Jones ― garners most of the headlines, it’s worth noting that the Falcons defense improved dramatically during the second half of last season.During its final nine games, it surrendered only 22 points per matchup, totaling an impressive 22 sacks and 18 forced turnovers, including a pick-six of Tom Brady in Super Bowl LI.In turn, retaining a shutdown corner like Trufant (who has 48 career passes defensed) for the long-term is undeniably a huge boon for a promising young defense that helped propel the franchise to its second ever Super Bowl appearance.Trufant will once again join forces with Jalen Collins and Robert Alford, two other young corners who played well in his absence. Trufant is also flanked by safety Keanu Neal (Atlanta’s 2016 first-rounder), who led all rookies with five forced fumbles last year, while ranking second with 106 tackles.Don’t forget about linebacker Deion Jones either. The 2016 second-rounder ― notice a theme here ― led all rookies with 108 tackles last season and was tied for first with three interceptions. Rounding out the defense is 24-year-old outside linebacker Vic Beasley, Jr., who led the league with 15.5 sacks last year.
