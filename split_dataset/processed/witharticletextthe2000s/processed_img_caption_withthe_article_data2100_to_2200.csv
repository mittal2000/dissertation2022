0,POLITICS,Virginia's GOP Governor Hopeful Takes Aim At Voting Rights Again,Sam Levine and Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ed-gillespie-voting-rights_us_59f38aa9e4b077d8dfc99a68,"“I characterize this stage of the race like trench warfare,” says a Virginia politics watcher.",2017-10-27,"Lt. Gov Ralph Northam, the Democrat running for governor in Virginia, is facing attacks from his opponent for a policy that restores voting rights to former felons.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f38f22150000ad52747ce3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ed Gillespie, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, launched another highly misleading ad on Friday targeting the practice of restoring voting rights to former felons who have completed their sentences.The advertisement marked the second time this week Gillespie has attacked the policy, which has dramatically expanded under Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). In Virginia, people convicted of felonies lose the right to vote, but can regain their voting rights once they serve their time, if the governor chooses. McAuliffe has individually restored the rights of 168,000 people who have completed their sentences.The new Gillespie ad accuses McAuliffe and Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam (D), Gillespie’s opponent in the race, of making Virginians less safe by restoring former felons’ right to vote. The ad focuses on John Bowen, who had his voting rights restored in December, a week after he had been charged with possessing child pornography (the state does not remove voting rights when someone is only facing a criminal charge). Once Bowen pleaded guilty in January, he lost his right to vote again, but the ad doesn’t mention that.“John Bowen had his rights restored because of Ralph Northam’s policy,” the ad says. “Ralph Northam called restoring the rights of unrepentant sex offenders one of his greatest feats. Ralph Northam’s policies are risky.”The segment appears to be referring to a Northam comment from May in which he spoke about restoring rights more generally.“I’ve worked very closely with Governor McAuliffe. I think it’s one of our greatest feats ... during the last four years,” Northam said in May.“We’ve restored the rights of over 156,000 Virginians, and I’ve had so many people come up to me and just say, ‘Thank you. Thank you for letting me get back into society. Thank you for letting me have my self esteem back.’ That is so important,” he added. Before McAuliffe began restoring rights, the nonprofit Sentencing Project estimated that 1 in 5 African-Americans in Virginia was disenfranchised because of a felony conviction. Virginia is one of the most restrictive states in the country when it comes to restoring voting rights, and it is ultimately up to the discretion of the governor whether to do so.In a statement on Friday, McAuliffe suggested Gillespie’s opposition to restoring voting rights would lead to a racist outcome.“Ed’s ads suggest that rather than continue the progress that we have achieved, he would reinstate a racist, fringe policy that would send the Commonwealth squarely back to the Jim Crow era,” McAuliffe said. “I believe Ed would be less inclined to call 168,000 Virginians ‘unrepentant sex offenders’ if he understood the discriminatory history of felon disenfranchisement in Virginia and across the nation, or took the time to meet the Virginians he is using as political footballs.” David Turner, a Northam campaign spokesman, called the ad “the last gasp of a pathetic, know-nothing campaign.”The Washington Post editorial board dubbed it “poisonous.”“The ad targeting his Democratic opponent in next month’s election, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, is in keeping with the recent thrust of Mr. Gillespie’s campaign, which, taking a page from the Trump playbook, has been more about scaring and dividing Virginians than inspiring and uniting them,” the Post wrote in a scathing editorial on Thursday.Notwithstanding Gillespie’s attempts to capitalize on the public’s fear of ex-felons, his website states that he actually favors the restoration of voting rights, but wants a more “permanent solution.” Republicans supported a failed constitutional amendment that would have required former felons to repay all their fines and dues before their rights could be restored. Critics said the measure would have perpetuated the disenfranchisement of poor Virginians.For years, Gillespie, a longtime lobbyist and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, cut a moderate profile on hot-button social issues like crime and immigration. But that was before a bruising gubernatorial primary with Trumpian populist Corey Stewart, whose appeals to pride in Confederate history and branding of Gillespie as “Establishment Ed” nearly deprived him of the nomination. In the end, Gillespie defeated Stewart by little more than 1 percentage point.Over the past two months, Gillespie has done his utmost to shore up the base of voters loyal to Trump and Stewart, hiring a key Stewart adviser to run his field operations in southwestern Virginia and fundraising off of his opposition to the removal of Confederate monuments. In addition to the attack ad portraying Northam as soft on former criminals, Gillespie released a series of ads accusing Northam of enabling MS-13 gang members to thrive by backing so-called “sanctuary cities.”In fact, Northam cast a vote blocking a GOP bill that obligated localities to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Gillespie has admitted that the state does not currently have any cities that limit their cooperation with ICE or could otherwise be construed as sanctuary cities, and there is no evidence federal and state authorities would have trouble deporting violent criminals arrested in those municipalities regardless.The barrage of negative ads ― which many observers have compared to the infamous Willy Horton ad that George H.W. Bush used to win the presidency in 1988 ― appears to have been something of a boon for Gillespie. He’s now neck-and-neck with Northam in many polls, spooking Democrats eager to hold on to the state’s governorship.“I characterize this stage of the race like trench warfare,” said Quentin Kidd, political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. “Northam holds the ground right now that gives him a small lead over Gillespie ... and [Gillespie] is trying to take ground away from him inch by inch.”Kidd ventured that Gillespie is trying to excite Stewart voters, particularly in rural southwestern Virginia, while also making the race so radioactive in the minds of moderates and independents in exurban Northern Virginia that they stay home rather than turn out for Northam.“I may not approve of the tactic and I may not like it,” Kidd said. “I understand tactically why they’re doing it.”Gillespie’s racialized attacks have apparently not ruffled many of the wealthy conservatives across the country who have donated to his campaign.But that might be because the donors themselves share his views.Robert McNair, owner of the NFL’s Houston Texans, contributed $102,500 to Gillespie’s campaign. (Virginia has no limits on individual contributions to state-level races.)During an NFL owners’ meeting about players who are protesting racism and police brutality during the national anthem, McNair said, “We can’t have the inmates running the prison,” according to an ESPN report.The Gillespie campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McNair’s remarks."

Addiction recovery is political. Public policy determines who recovers and who dies. From criminal justice, to the FDA, to Medicare reform, every aspect of addiction and recovery is affected by politics. We’re making it political, and we’re calling for reform now.We are activists, advocates, and leaders who see that ignorance, fear, and discrimination shape policies that affect people with substance use disorder. Anyone who tells you that recovery isn’t political is completely wrong. Recovery, and the way we treat people with the disease of addiction, is political to its core. When we pretend like it’s not, we are condemning millions of Americans to suffer and die. One person dies every four minutes due to drug-related causes. How long can we ignore that? It’s not enough to tell people to “just say no,” or add a few beds to rehab facilities. We need swift, decisive, compassionate action and sweeping reform.Although addiction is not, and never was, a moral failing, we still treat it like an unsolvable problem. It’s not. In fact, almost every one of the “changes” that President Trump mentioned in yesterday’s announcement are already provided for in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The policies simply haven’t been enacted, funded, or enforced. More talk isn’t the answer: action is.We need change at the federal level and in every branch of government that acknowledges what we know about addiction. Instead of punishing people for getting sick, we need to treat them for their illness. Instead of locking them up, we need to address the root causes of their problem. Instead of stripping them of their rights, isolating them, and shaming them, we need to offer support and access to services that enable them to leave addiction in the dust.The Surgeon General’s report showed that people with substance use disorder are highly receptive to early intervention. We recover at high rates when we have access to recovery programs, detox, treatment, and after care in our own communities. Across our nation, grassroots groups are creating peer mentorship programs, recovery toolkits, and addiction crisis hotlines that enable anyone to get help, whenever they need it. This work is invaluable and saves lives. However, these services are severely underfunded. Taking a stand against addiction does not mean taking a stand against people who struggle with substance use. There is a solution, and it starts with strong leadership in the fight to bring recovery to every community in America. Addiction affects one in three Americans. Just saying no to drugs isn’t working. We need to say yes to recovery, in a big way.There is great financial incentive to make these changes. Every $1 spent on treatment and recovery services frees up $7 in criminal justice, law enforcement, emergency medical care, and social services like housing and food stamps. When we enable people to recover, they can truly change their lives. Consider that over 20 million Americans have substance use disorder. If we alter our approach to addiction by helping all of them find recovery, and making recovery accessible to everyone, that translates to billions of dollars that we could be spending on things that matter: schools, safer neighborhoods, our national parks, and disaster relief.To end the drug epidemic, we need funding that goes directly to community support organizations, nonprofits and the groups on the front lines. We need people affected by addiction — including families, neighbors, friends, and coworkers — to mobilize, register to vote, and turn out for recovery events. We need more voices, calling for change. We need our own Million Man March. We need to put recovery in the spotlight, and keep it there until drug-related deaths are eradicated. We found a cure for polio. We can find a solution to addiction, too.We represent a massive, unacknowledged demographic: Americans who have, or are affected by, the disease of addiction. We will no longer be silent. We will not stand by while the people we love get sick and die, right in front of us. We will no longer blame them for being sick. We want change, and we want it now. Access to quality medical care, social services, community support, and equal treatment: without these, Americans will continue to die at record rates.Addiction can be a silent killer. It hides in plain sight, in every church, community, and home in our nation. Yet, we are not silent. We’re speaking up, and we demand real change that continues the strong efforts of recovery nonprofits, private foundations, and community groups. It’s not enough to say simply that we exist. Actions speak louder than words: it will take more than words to save millions of American lives.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

In an interview with Refinery29, the singer revealed how she handles those sometimes difficult but necessary moments.Clarkson has a 3-year-old and an 18-month-old with her husband, music manager Brandon Blackstock. Blackstock also has two kids from a previous marriage. When asked how she talks to her four kids about the “crazy” things currently happening in the world, Clarkson responded that it’s “a very crucial time for anyone with kids.”“It’s a daily challenge, because our 10-year-old or 16-year-old will often say something like, ‘Why does this person say this, are they allowed to say this?’” she said. “I’m not going to lie, it’s hard, because every single day I’m explaining away a news headline or action of someone in politics.”The Grammy winner also noted that many of the horrific topics in the news like sexual harassment, rape culture and bullying are also rampant in schools.“It all starts young,” she said. “So right now we have a unique opportunity to use what’s happening to ask our kids, ‘Do you think this was right or wrong? What do you think should have happened?’ It sounds obvious, but that’s the only way, long term, this world is going to get any better.”Refinery29 later asked Clarkson about her experience with sexual harassment, referencing the many allegations against film executive Harvey Weinstein. The singer explained she’s experienced sexism in the music industry along with sexual harassment at another job and made it clear she’s over the excuses she’s heard about Hollywood. “You always hear these dumb answers like, ‘Oh, that’s just Hollywood, it’s been that way since old Hollywood!’ But that’s not an answer. That’s a cop out, an excuse, and a bad one,” she said. “I think every single person can educate themselves on why certain things are wrong, so they’re not living in an archaic dark hole. And so they know what it looks like when something is wrong, so they can speak up. But unfortunately I think a lot of people are stuck in their ways, so a lot of it is really all about trying to do better with our kids.”Known for her success on the music charts, her multiple Grammy awards and her outspoken take on being body positive, Clarkson offered advice to girls starting their careers in any industry in which women are overshadowed.“First, surround yourself with people who truly love and support you and want you to be a better human. Not just a better singer, or a better writer, or whatever your occupation is, but a better human — the kind of people who are not just going to encourage you and empower you, but also open your mind,” she said. “Second, don’t take advice from anyone you wouldn’t want to switch places with. That cuts out a lot of people.”Read the interview in full on Refinery29. "
5,ARTS & CULTURE,When Booting Dead White Guys Off Reading Lists Is A Good Idea,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/when-booting-dead-white-guys-off-reading-lists-is-a-good-idea_us_59f29887e4b03cd20b80a874,A recent tabloid scandal managed to raise awareness of a big problem within the English literary canon.,2017-10-27,Not all of these authors made it into the generally agreed-upon English canon -- and not everyone who made it needs to stay.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f37c0d180000360ddfc9b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Student forces Cambridge to drop white authors,” blared a front-page headline in U.K. paper The Telegraph on Wednesday. Beneath was a large, above-the-fold photo of Lola Olufemi, an English literature student and activist. The caption claimed that Cambridge University would drop “some white authors” in favor of black writers following “demands” made by Olufemi and other students.Just a few enormous problems: Cambridge had made no concrete plans to change its curriculum, Olufemi and her peers certainly have no power to “force” the prestigious and powerful school to do so, and the students had made no “demands” to excise white authors.What Olufemi had done is co-author an open letter to Cambridge faculty, signed by over 100 students, detailing concerns with the marginalization of postcolonial work and writers from the Global South in the English curriculum. It concludes with a list of suggestions, including “the inclusion of two or more postcolonial and BME [Black and Ethnic Minority] authors on every exam paper” and the addition of “a short seminar series in first year looking at postcolonial texts and thought.”After uproar over press coverage, The Telegraph eventually printed a small correction noting that “the proposals were in fact recommendations,” the students did not call for “the University to replace white authors with black ones,” and, to be clear, “there are no plans to do so.” The sheer journalistic malpractice of the article, which quite predictably resulted in the pictured student ― a black woman ― receiving abuse and threats online, has drawn considerable outrage. “It is actually staggering irresponsibility by the Telegraph and The Daily Mail to take a small-scale matter for the English department to consider and turn it into, what to me looks like incitement to race war,” Priyamvada Gopal, senior English lecturer at Cambridge, told Buzzfeed on Wednesday. That a black woman, and non-white authors, were presented as a dangerous threat to a British university played gleefully into the hands of white nativist forces, which often frame institutions built through centuries of white supremacy and imperialism as the victims of violent cultural erasure at the hands of today’s politically correct brigands.But the media controversy threatens to overshadow the problem the students originally hoped to highlight ― a foundational problem with the English literary canon. Even as we correctly point out that the Cambridge open letter, “Decolonising the English faculty,” didn’t make any demands or force the university to dropkick white male authors into the dumpster of history, we should note that the suggestions therein were not only reasonable, but urgently necessary ― not just in the U.K., but here in the United States.Despite years of activism on college campuses, many English students today can still enroll in programs that do little or nothing to ensure that graduates will be educated in the work of authors of color and, to a lesser extent, women. Though many colleges have added courses on women writers, African-American literature and so on, such classes are often electives rather than required, foundational courses, and non-white male authors remain relatively sparse on the reading lists of required survey courses. This approach allows English departments to amp up the overall diversity of a department’s offerings without substantially changing the reading lists of core introductory classes ― and even with these pushes for inclusion, there’s still a long way to go. Despite efforts to include more women writers in college humanities courses, overall, men still hold significantly more spots on syllabuses than anyone else. “Any required classes we have, like early and late British lit, are almost completely white-washed and male,” Mercedes Gonzales-Bazan, a student at the University of New Mexico, told HuffPost. “There’s usually one text from a POC and one text by a woman, but never intersectioned.”  Cristina Stubbe, a recent graduate of Emerson College, reported the same experience to HuffPost: All of the required classes for English majors were dominated by white male writers. “We had to take British Literature, the Art of Fiction and Literature Foundations (all of which were predominantly white and male, even though there are plenty of nonwhite authors that could be studied for both courses).” Later, she said, she took classes with more diverse offerings, like International Women Writers. “It was great that they offered these courses,” she said, “but we have to spend our first two years not being able to take classes like that because they are an optional course.”“It’s frustrating because as students we have to actively seek out literature courses that incorporate a diverse set of authors and ideas,” said Gonzales-Bazan. “So unless a student is determined and passionate enough to focus on finding diversity, then they’re sitting blind and unaware to the lack of it within most of their courses.” This is also often the case in classes that cover literary movements (unless, like the Harlem Renaissance, the movements are specifically non-white-coded). “For example, many teach courses on modern American poetry by focusing on the biggest figures, say: Eliot, Pound, Stevens, Williams, Frost. Maybe they throw in Langston Hughes or Marianne Moore as a nod to ‘diversity,’” Jacquelyn Ardam, currently a visiting assistant professor in English at Colby College, told HuffPost. “But white man’s modernism is just one version of modernism.” In her own courses on modernism, Ardam teaches a more expansive syllabus, including Jean Toomer, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mina Loy and the early work of Gwendolyn Brooks. “These are figures whose work is often overshadowed in the dominant versions of modernism on our syllabi,” she explained.By including one or two token women and people of color in our curricula rather than reimagining those syllabuses from the inside out, we imply that they are less deserving of our full attention; they are included as a gesture to their otherness rather than through merit. The focus of a literary curriculum on white men doesn’t only send an implicit message of exclusion to students who don’t identify as white men ― it emboldens white male students in beliefs about their own worth relative to that of other students. In 2006, I was a freshman in college, and I enrolled in a double-credit, two-semester seminar on the Western canon. The class, which took up as much space in one’s schedule and transcript as four other classes would, was billed as a foundational class for humanities majors, and I was lucky to get in. But the whiteness and maleness of the class curricula could also be infuriating. I suffered, not-so-patiently, gripes from white male classmates that literary greats like Jane Austen and Sappho had been included in our extensive, almost entirely male syllabus thanks to P.C. pearl-clutching rather than merit. (Apparently we were taking up good class time that could have been spent on another white male philosopher, poet or historian.) But the overall white maleness of the course clearly confirmed, in the minds of many of my classmates, that all the true great thinkers of our humanities tradition have been white men.Several current or former literature students recalled to HuffPost experiencing direct tokenization and bigotry in their departments. Stubbe remembered one course, in which a white professor had assigned a text by Gloria Anzaldúa. During the class, she said, “I was forced on the spot to translate a block of Spanish text with no warning, simply because he thought I could, as the token Latina in the class.”Another woman, who asked not to be named because she fears it could hurt her graduate school applications, recalled a department reading for her M.F.A. program at which a white male professor read a personal essay called “N*ggerbaby.” The essay reflected on his black nanny and a game he played as a child in which, the woman said, “he and his friends would pretend a ball was a ‘N*ggerbaby.’ They would throw it and see how far they could run before it smashed into the ground.” At the end of the essay, she said, the nanny is portrayed as wise for being unbothered by their hurtful words. As a black woman in a mostly white crowd, she says she was horrified but felt that she “couldn’t speak. And even if I could, anything I said would be from the irrational black woman in the room, the one who puts identity over academics.” One student, a white man, challenged the professor about the problematic racial perspective of the essay, but was quickly dismissed. “Afterward, I hid in the stairwell,” she recalled, “angry and crying.”Aman Kumar, a former classmate of mine who graduated from Princeton with a degree in comparative literature and later studied at Columbia, told HuffPost he saw “casual sexism and racism among faculty and students” throughout his studies. When studying the traditional canon, he said, “their political or personal noxiousness or crimes were rarely discussed, in deference to The Text Itself. On the other hand, lazy caricatures of anyone packaged as ‘peripheral’ seemed compulsory.” The close, reverent readings of our white male writers urge students to bestow generous and specific consideration to each of them; meanwhile, we often present marginalized writers as avatars defined by their race, gender or sexual identity ― or we simply don’t present them at all.Ardam recalled a class she taught at UCLA in which she assigned The Mixquiahuala Letters by Ana Castillo, a novel about two Latina women traveling through western United States and Mexico together. “After we wrapped up discussion of that book,” she told HuffPost, “two students came up to me separately to say: I have never read a book about someone who looks and talks like me before. This was in Los Angeles in 2015.”Students can and should learn from authors who look like them and share their experiences, allowing them to see a place and a relevance for themselves and their lives in the canon. They also can and should learn from authors who don’t look like them and don’t share their experiences ― as people of color, women and non-binary people, and members of other marginalized groups are often called upon to do. But white men are rarely asked to engage with literature from another perspective ― and that fundamentally inhibits their own learning, as well.The exclusion of literature by authors of color, women and other underrepresented groups, and the frequently oblivious attitude toward the racial and colonial attitudes of white canonical authors in literature programs, should be a self-evident problem. After all, protests against diversifying these curricula often rest on harms to the culture and psyches of white people, especially white men. In response to my Twitter query about people’s poor experiences with whitewashed English syllabuses, one person responded, “What if we’ve been prevented from having good experiences with great curricula because the authors were, say, cishet white males?” Another complained, “I’ve [had] experiences w/ females teaching students to be ashamed of their whiteness, does that fit your narrative?”The reality is that, insofar as a writer not appearing on a required course syllabus constitutes “preventing good experiences” with that author, it’s unavoidable that even the luckiest students will be prevented from good experiences with great writers. There are more great writers than colleges can reasonably teach in four years; they have to pick and choose. The question is whether they’re maximizing the knowledge and personal development of their students through the reading lists they’re choosing. This is an art, not a science, but a strong, deeply entrenched preference for the work of white men is not a merit-driven factor.Sticking to the traditional canon is more a form of intellectual laziness, in which we comfortably default to familiar white names rather than pushing ourselves to learn from a larger body of literary achievement. Kumar described the tendency of many accomplished humanities professors to ignore philosophers, social scientists and authors outside of certain geographical and temporal regions as “sheer sanctioned ignorance.” For those who only care about the white students whose education and, presumably, feelings are being hurt by the increased inclusion of non-white writers, it must be noted that pressure to diversify curricula is not coming solely from students of color. As Cambridge student Jason Osamede Okundaye pointed out in a Guardian piece, “By making [Olufemi] the solitary figure behind the decolonization movement at Cambridge, the coverage ignores the fact that heavy support for diversifying curriculums has come from white students.” Perhaps because curious young English students don’t go to college hoping to remain ignorant about important aspects of their field ― whether it’s the work of Shakespeare, the racial and colonial ideologies underpinning much of the traditional canon, or long-marginalized but brilliant writers.An acceptance that vast parts of literary history (the parts involving non-white people, primarily) won’t be addressed isn’t intellectual rigor. It’s a distortion that will ultimately harm the education of students ― and implicitly encourage women, students of color and other minorities to feel ashamed of their identities. Intentional dismantling of that bias is a necessary step toward building a true canon that highlights the best and most vital works in English literary history.This isn’t a new idea, and the Cambridge open letter didn’t introduce it. I spoke with several educators who have been working to redefine the boundaries of the canon, and students who have benefited. Danielle Badra, who has taught as a graduate assistant at George Mason University in recent years, said she “specifically design[ed] all of my curriculum to include only marginalized authors ... I was never taught enough of those categories in grad school.” She taught both required introductory courses and electives, and said her students “all loved the literature they were assigned. Most of them said they were happy to be learning about something new and reading stuff they hadn’t been assigned before.”Nor is it just individual instructors ― there are larger movements away from a stuffy, exclusive white canon in English departments.“Curriculum change can be a long and tedious process, but it does happen, and often in good, if incremental ways!” Ardam told HuffPost. “While I was a graduate student, my school ― a large public institution ― moved away from a conservative curriculum which required historical surveys of British literature as well as single-author courses on major figures: Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton.” Instead, the major now offers “a more conceptually-based curriculum” that requires students to take “historical surveys of literature” as well as courses in areas like “gender, race, ethnicity, disability and sexuality studies.”“This change in the curriculum decentralized ― [though] by no means expunged ― the stories of dead white men,” Ardam said. “Many, if not most, English departments across American have made similar changes in the past two decades.”As Ardam and the Cambridge open letter emphasized, this simply doesn’t mean erasing white men. Shakespeare, Keats and Hemingway stand little chance of being pulled from shelves or eliminated from college courses. But simply because they’ve always been there doesn’t mean that white male writers are always the most deserving of being on our reading lists. Curricula can and should change, and they’ve long done so for other reasons ― certain writers falling out of style, others being remembered, movements experiencing renewed interest. In the process of adding women, people of color and other marginalized artists to our syllabuses, we will inevitably have to make some room. Maybe some white people won’t be happy with the choices that college faculties make, the dead white men who are left off of introductory surveys or who are studied through the lens of their race and gender.To which we can only say, now you know how everyone else has felt for hundreds of years."
6,QUEER VOICES,Wilson Cruz Opens Up About 'Star Trek' Finally Going Gay,"James Frew, ContributorWriter, Humorist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wilson-cruz-opens-up-about-star-trek-finally-going_us_59f27f19e4b06ae9067ab79b,"“I hope that people walk away from the series more willing to see themselves in other people.""",2017-10-27,Actor Wilson Cruz arrives for the Premiere Of CBS's 'Star Trek: Discovery' at The Cinerama Dome.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f28c2e180000360ddfc7ce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Star Trek, from its very inception, has always told us that representation matters. In 1966, creator Gene Rodenberry vaulted audiences at warp speed into a multicultural future where Captain Kirk teamed with the likes of Uhura, Sulu, Chekov and Spock, a cast more diverse than any of its time – but it’s taken more than 50 years for the franchise to introduce its first gay characters to the small screen. In last week’s episode five of Star Trek: Discovery, “Choose Your Pain,” that moment finally came – as the closing scene showed science officer Lt. Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp) brushing his teeth next to his partner, the ship’s resident physician, Lt. Commander Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz). It was a subtle moment long overdue to the franchise – Rodenberry first mentioned gay characters would be introduced on Star Trek: The Next Generation in a 1987 interview – that its importance was deeply felt by Cruz himself.“As a fan of the franchise, I count myself among the countless LGBTQ fans who have longed to see themselves and our relationships depicted on Star Trek,” Cruz told me. “The fact is that we have always been here, but finally seeing ourselves and our stories included in this, truly, American mythology confirms what we’ve always known to be true – which is that we are an integral part of this culture and we always will be.”A fitting statement from an actor first noticed as Rickie, the gay best friend of Claire Danes’ Angela Chase on the iconic 90’s coming of age ABC show, My So-Called Life. Cruz would go on after Life’s 1995 cancellation to star with his current Discovery co-star Rapp, in the 1998 Broadway production of Rent – a fact that has given a rousing chemistry to their on-screen bickering – and momentary reprieve amidst Discovery’s consistently serious tone. “One of the many advantages of working with a friend of over 20 years, as I do with Anthony [Rapp] on Discovery, is that you bring an immediate sense of comfort and ease to the work. What I love about this relationship is that Stamets and Culber are both committed to their work as they are both geniuses in their fields and it’s their relationship with each other that allows them to excel. They know that no matter what happens on that ship they have each other and while it’s not always easy, they can count on the love they have for each other to ground them.”Original Discovery showrunners Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman were clear from its inception that Discovery would continue Star Trek’s longtime premise of inclusion – and do so with a series of firsts. Not only are Stamets and Culber introduced as the steady relationship on the show, Fuller was intent on casting a black woman as the lead character, and Sonequa Martin-Green flourishes as Michael Burnham, a disgraced former commander fighting to find her ground after a monumental mistake. Her character is a direct reference to Nichelle Nichol’s Uhura, still the most visible black woman in science fiction today, yet relegated to a supporting role on the original series – and Majel Barret’s “Number One,” the original first officer from Rodenberry’s never-released Star Trek pilot, “The Cage.” NBC refused the idea of a female first officer in 1966 – and instead, Spock was chosen for that role. Discovery is making every attempt to right the wrongs of previously marginalized character types – and it’s a fact not lost on Cruz. “I hope that people walk away from the series more willing to see themselves in other people. In this political and cultural climate in which some people want to divide us, I hope Discovery will help to remind us that at the cellular level, there is no separation between us and in fact, we all long for the same things.” After six episodes, Discovery looks to be finding its ground as today’s Trek – and if Culber, Stamets and Burnham see their characters fully realized – Discovery could boldly go, indeed.

As a young teen, I lived in constant fear that someone would hear the inflection or accent in my voice and verbally or physically assault me because I was different. And I knew that if I called the police to help me, they might discover my immigration status and deport me from the only country I’ve ever called home.No 14-year-old kid should live with these crippling fears, yet that is the reality facing thousands of high schoolers across the country. For undocumented students, every deportation they see on the news is a daily reminder of their precarious legal situation. Every act of violence against an LGBTQ friend or neighbor reminds them that their safety is constantly at risk just for expressing who they are and how they love. And since last November, the stakes for people of color, immigrants and LGBTQ Americans have never been higher.Virginia’s gubernatorial race makes it clear that these threats aren’t just coming from the White House, but are right here in the Commonwealth. Following in the footsteps of Donald Trump, Ed Gillespie is running a xenophobic and homophobic campaign that makes it clear how much we have to fear from a Gillespie administration.Throughout his campaign, he has aired hateful, fear-mongering ads that criminalize people of color and make erroneous links between immigrants and MS-13 gang violence. He has also consistently opposed LGBTQ rights, from opposing marriage equality to supporting anti-trans legislation. John Adams, who is running for attorney general, is just as dangerous. During his campaign, he has spread lies that all undocumented students are getting in-state tuition benefits in Virginia or that the Supreme Court decision granting marriage equality is “totally made up.”No matter what Gillespie says, hate is not a Virginia value. His opponent, Dr. Ralph Northam, is the only candidate for governor who has Virginia’s true values at heart ― values like opportunity and justice for all. Instead of working to divide us by our differences, Northam has fought his entire life to make Virginia a more supportive, welcoming place for all people, no matter their color, race, sexual orientation or immigration status. Now more than ever, we need a leader for our state who will be steadfast defense against the discriminatory policies emanating from the Oval Office, as well as a fearless advocate for LGBTQ and immigrants’ rights. Ralph Northam is that leader.October 11 marked National Coming Out Day, an annual reminder of the journeys many of us have taken to come out as LGBTQ and the work that still needs to be done to achieve equality for the LGBTQ community. In past years, I’ve celebrated with friends and family, but this year was different. Instead, I found every opportunity I could to talk to Virginians about the importance of voting in this election. I texted all my friends to confirm they had updated their voter registration information and talked through plans for voting on election day to get people out to the polls. Most importantly, I reminded people why it was important to vote for Ralph Northam, along with Justin Fairfax (candidate for lieutenant governor) and Mark Herring (candidate for attorney general).What did I tell them? No matter your politics, we can all agree on one thing: no one should ever have to live in fear.Rodrigo Velasquez is a formerly undocumented immigrant, an activist and a communications fellow for the Center for Community Change Action."
8,POLITICS,Coloradans Who Deregistered After Trump Request For Voter Data Aren't Signing Up Again,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorado-voters-trump-voter-fraud-probe_us_59f3690ae4b077d8dfc960b9,Less than a fifth of voters who pulled their registrations following a request for voter information have registered again.,2017-10-27,"A chart from Amber McReynolds, the director of elections for Denver, shows the uptick in deregistrations following a request for voter information by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f3822e150000b544747cb6.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Only a small fraction of the thousands of Colorado voters who withdrew their registrations following a controversial request for voter information from President Donald Trump’s voter fraud probe have chosen to reregister less than two weeks ahead of election day.8,983 people have canceled their voter registrations since June 28, when Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the vice chair of Trump’s commission to investigate voter fraud, sent a controversial letter to election officials in all 50 states requesting voter information, according to the Colorado secretary of state’s office. While some voters said they intended to register again ahead of election day, just 1,622 have done so. It’s impossible to say why all of those voters deregistered, but election officials said there was a noticeable surge after Kobach’s letter. Officials in North Carolina, Florida and Washington also noticed an uptick in the number of voters who wanted to deregister following the federal government’s request.The small number of returning voters underscores the fear that critics have about Trump’s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. They say the probe is designed to discourage people from voting. A lawsuit by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, one of a handful of ongoing suits against the commission, argues the panel’s purpose is to intimidate voters, particularly those of color. Kobach has dismissed the reports on deregistrations, saying people withdrawing maybe shouldn’t have been on the rolls in the first place or that it was a “political stunt” and the voters would reregister ahead of the November elections.Amber McReynolds, Denver County’s director of elections, said just over a third of deregistered voters had decided to reregister to vote in the upcoming Nov. 7 elections. Her office is actively trying to bring those who withdrew back into the fold and sent deregistered voters a letter inviting them to register again. Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams (R) already turned over the state’s voter file to the commission ― he said he was legally obligated to do so ― and the letter notes there is no longer a “current request” for voter data.“I want to monitor that number over the next week to see what happens. This election is a local election and voter interest tends to be somewhat low. So, my optimistic view is that many more will continue to re-register as next year’s election cycle get closer,” McReynolds wrote in an email. She added her “pessimistic side” worried voters would be driven away by partisan politics.“I believe that voters deserve a meaningful voting experience that is efficient, accessible, secure, and reliable and one that respects their ability to participate. Partisan politics and fear mongering have no place in the election administration process and it undermines the very essence of our [sic] what it means to be an American.”Lynn Bartels, a Williams spokeswoman, attributed the lack of reregistrations to the fact that there aren’t statewide contests happening in Colorado this year.“It is an off-year election without a statewide ballot measure to get voters really engaged. I suspect these voters won’t be sitting out in 2018 when Coloradans elect a new governor, members of Congress, county clerks and more,” she said in an email.Some voters, however, are coming back to reregister, and say they only did so once they knew their data was safe.Bob and Connie Bair, longtime Denver voters who deregistered following the commission’s request, said they reregistered at the beginning of October because the state had already sent information on voters to the commission.“Barring any more hi-jinks by Trump, Kobach, and Company, we both intend to stay legally registered to vote for as long as we remain alive,” Bob Bair wrote in an email.Mary Friedrichs, another voter who canceled her registration, said she registered again after seeing someone online post that it was safe to do so. She didn’t know if her information would be protected from the commission, but that wasn’t what mattered most to her. “Frankly, I had no idea, but I didn’t want to kiss my chance to vote,” she said."

She said she believed he was about to grab a weapon.The 42-year-old officer was found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in May after a jury deliberated for nine hours.Shelby resigned from the Tulsa police force on Aug. 3 and was sworn in as a reserve deputy for the Rogers County Sheriff’s Office a week later.Shelby’s defense attorney, Shannon McMurray, told The Associated Press that the “crime does not exist for employment application purposes,” and said it was important “to have that smear on [Shelby’s] name removed from public view.”McMurray added that her client “continues to work to try and serve her community and prays for everyone’s continued healing.”Neither Shelby nor any member of the Crutcher family attended Wednesday’s hearing.Crutcher’s relatives are now focusing their attention on a civil suit they’re bringing against Shelby, the city of Tulsa, Tulsa Police Chief Chuck Jordan and two other officers.Citing more than 40 excessive force settlements within the Tulsa Police Department from 2000 to 2016, the Crutcher family said it hopes the suit brings attention to department’s use of force against Tulsa citizens, local station KOKI TV reported."

Instead, he claims the aliens have harmed not only him and his wife but the animals.“I saved from the time I was 8 years old on to buy a horse ranch and when I buy a horse ranch I buy an alien Hellhole,” he lamented in a 2015 interview posted to YouTube. “It’s not like you can say well I screwed up, I’ll just dump it and go get another one.”He’s posted photos to Facebook that show off some of the physical injuries and scars that he claims aliens left him with. One such photo shows dents and scratches on his leg, which he described as “wounds” from a “battle with malevolent ET.”“This is why I want to move!” he wrote.Another photo shows a Samurai sword lying across what he claims is alien blood on the ground. He wrote that the ET he sliced was able to get away because he didn’t dislocate an antenna on its head, which apparently isn’t easy to do.His wife has also had her share of experiences, including one he said he witnessed first hand.“They actually levitated her out of the bed in the master chamber and carried her into the parking lot and tried to draw her up into the craft,” he told KPNX, without elaborating on what happened next.In his 2015 interview, Edmonds said the uninvited ET guests come through the property’s portal or “gate” almost like clockwork.“We know that there is a gate on the back of the property, we know where it is, and about every 72 days it seems to open, and at that point, there are massive sightings out there,” he said.Those interested in potentially experiencing their own out-of-this-world encounters or those just looking for a five-bedroom, four-bathroom ranch featuring beautiful desert views can learn more about the listing here."

He continued to follow them after they drove off in their SUV. Rodriguez told the news station that he quickly figured out he was being followed and pulled the vehicle into a parking lot because he didn’t want anyone to know where he lived.Witnesses told officers they heard Haskell identify himself as a police officer while trying to pull the teens out of their SUV.The cousin allegedly swung at Haskell, who then pepper-sprayed him before running off. Although Haskell claims he used the pepper spray in self-defense, he’s facing a felony charge for unlawfully using tear gas, according to City Pages.Rodriguez told WCCO TV that he stayed in his seat because he believed Haskell’s claim of being a cop.“I thought he was a police officer, that’s why I didn’t do anything,” Rodriguez said in the video above. “I’m not going to not follow orders of a cop.”Rodriguez managed to call his mom on his cell phone, but says by the time she arrived, Haskell had pinned him against the SUV.Haskell later told police he was attempting to perform a citizen’s arrest, according to court documents. Besides the felony tear gas charge, Haskell faces five counts of misdemeanor assault and one of impersonating a peace officer.Haskell’s attorney, Chris Ritt, told WCCO that his client is the real victim.“The police investigation is absurd and flawed. My client was the victim. We will fight these allegations in the courts.”Haskell is due in court November 30.When HuffPost reached out to Haskell’s church, the person who answered the phone declined to comment except to say, “We know the real facts.

Francis wasted no time in getting down to the really big questions about the meaning of life and love. “As you’re contemplating the undoubted limits of the universe, it makes us think about where we come from and where we’re going,” he said. “In light of your experiences in space, what are your thoughts regarding the place of man in the universe?”Nespoli, who has been at the space station since July, told Francis that he’s largely a technical person familiar with experiments, machinery and equipment. He said he’s hoping that in the future, theologians, philosophers, poets and other creative minds will be able to visit space to contemplate these big ideas.“When we speak of these much more internal questions of where we come from, I remain rather perplexed ... I think that our objective here is that of knowing our being and to fill our knowledge to understand what’s around us,” Nespoli said. “But on the other hand, an interesting thing is that the more we know, the more we realize how little we know.”“I’d like to see you here to explore what it means to have a human being in space.”“What you’re saying is true,” Francis replied.The pope then asked the astronauts to muse about the nature of love, quoting the poet Dante Alighieri who referred in the “Divine Comedy” to love as the force that moves the sun and the stars. He also asked what part of the astronauts’ jobs bring them the greatest joy. NASA astronaut Randy Bresnik said that the greatest joy for him is to be able to see creation from God’s perspective. “People cannot come up here and see the indescribable beauty of the Earth and not be touched in their souls,” Bresnik said.Bresnik also said he hopes the international teamwork happening on the space station will inspire peace on earth, as well.Looking out from the station, Bresnik said, “There’s no borders, there’s no conflict — it’s just peaceful. You see the thinness of the atmosphere and it makes you realize how fragile our existence here is.”“We hope that that example of what we can achieve together [in space] is an example for the world and all of humanity.”“You have succeeded in understanding that Earth is too fragile. It is a moment that passes,” Francis replied. “It is so capable of destroying itself or doing bad things.”Francis isn’t the first pope to place a call to the space station. Pope Benedict called astronauts at the station in 2011 and asked about the environmental risks the earth faces. Following in his predecessor’s footsteps, Francis has also focused on raising awareness about the need to care for the earth. In 2015, he released “Laudato Si,” an encyclical that called on people around the world to work together to address climate change."

The question surprised me. We have been together for 12 years, and are from the same small hometown. Have we really never had that conversation?As the women in my life discussed #MeToo, our stories ranged from rape, to groping, to catcalling. One friend shared that her graduate school classmate had raped her, several years ago. Now he is an elected official, in a serious relationship with another friend, and attended the Women’s March.A couple friends quietly, almost guiltily said, “Not me, actually.” However if catcalling and having your butt pinched count, then yes, them too. It has all become so normalized that sometimes women don’t even process that stuff. That is just the paradigm that we live in.In the United States, our elected officials say things like, “Some girls rape easy.” This heinous 2012 quote is from Roger Rivard, the Republican Member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. It is often included in social media posts condemning the GOP’s platforms on women’s issues. His words were meant to explain that women have consensual sex and then claim rape later, just to get the man in trouble. Turns out, studies have shown that at least 90% of rape accusations are true.Last week’s #MeToo campaign was widely attributed to a tweet by the actress Alyssa Milano. Actually, Me Too originated a decade ago, thanks to Tarana Burke, a black woman. This “detail” is important for the topic of intersectional feminism. When I discovered this, I read more and more articles online about the ways in which contemporary feminism often alienates or ignores the voices of women of color. This is an extremely important topic; and my job as a white woman is to amplify the voices of women of color, not absorb them.Between reading these articles and waking up the next morning, #HowIWillDoBetter became the male response to #MeToo. My guy friends and friends’ husbands filled my newsfeed with posts acknowledging what they had seen and heard from the women in their lives. Each of their confessions, apologies, and self-flagellations received dozens and hundreds of Likes—the currency of social media. Each “Me Too” I had seen the previous day had, at most, tens of Likes. There were also several articles celebrating the #HowIWillDoBetter response.As the primary problem, men must be the primary solution. To do that, men must absolutely consider how they need to change and do better. We must have more of these conversations. While acknowledging that, I cannot help but feel some resentment that this became about men. I resent that men—some of the men trying hardest to do the right thing—stole the spotlight with their own stories.As a woman in my early 30s, many of my friends now have children. As such, so many of these #HowIWillDoBetter posts invoked daughters. It is of course natural for a man to look at his daughter and suddenly understand how terrifying the sexual assault statistics are…or is it? I appreciated Hunter Harris’ piece, “Stop Mentioning Your Daughters When You Denounce Harvey Weinstein.” Why does it have to be a female’s relation to a man (as a daughter, a mother, a sister) that earns us respect, rather than just our existence as a fellow human being?In the U.S., I feel like a walking cliché of the “woman alone late at night,” pre-emptively blaming myself even for potential assaults. The U.S. has three times more incidents of sexual assault each year than Germany. Before I looked up this statistic, I knew it intuitively. I feel safe on the streets here at any hour.Germany somehow avoids the rampant hypersexualization of women that is so pervasive in the U.S. In German advertisements, I see models of various ages, sizes, and attractiveness; fewer women in revealing clothing, selling something completely irrelevant. The stock photos in my German textbooks feature middle-aged women with a size 16 waist, rather than thin, smiling young women eating salads.And of course, Germany’s leader is a woman. A woman who has used dressing “frumpy” as a political tool. The U.S. president is an admitted pussy grabber.A friend told me, “With all that is going on in the world, I just do not care what Harvey Weinstein did to Gwyneth Paltrow, or what all these millionaires do or don’t do to each other.” And yes to that. Of course, though, the #MeToo campaign is precisely to demonstrate that it is not just about celebrities and millionaires.At least 12 million women participated in the #MeToo campaign on Facebook. Many women chose not to, for several reasons. Assault victims often feel shame or fear. One friend resents being “rolled out as victims all the time.” Several friends voiced skepticism about the social media platform.For me, something feels different this time. While perhaps not perfectly, men are responding. Creeps are being called out, and removed from their positions.As more and more women feel free to speak their truths, we must believe, amplify, and support them. May this be our new normal—not for our daughters, mothers, or sisters, but simply for us.Previously published as ‘On Breaking the Silence With #MeToo’ in Annie’s LETTERS FROM BERLIN column in The Wild Word magazine. www.thewildword.comFor some more great Wild Word essays see:Why We Need to Break the Silence on Gun Control by M.L.

19,POLITICS,Chris Murphy Wants A New Progressive Foreign Policy,"Richard North Patterson, ColumnistColumnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-murphy-wants-a-new-progressive-foreign-policy_us_59f22f23e4b06ae9067ab739,The Connecticut senator's vision stands out among Democrats.,2017-10-26,"Senators John McCain and Chris Murphy wave to protestors as Ukrainian UDAR party leader Vitali Klitschko looks on during a mass rally in Kiev's Independence Square, December 15, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f24309140000610d8c9e6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among political observers, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut is widely considered a potential presidential aspirant – articulate, forthright and media-savvy. Notably, his lengthy filibuster denouncing gun violence after the mass shooting in Orlando garnered national attention. But what most distinguishes him among Democrats, perhaps, is his call for a new direction in American foreign policy.In Murphy’s view, Trump’s global ineptitude makes fresh thinking all the more imperative. “The amateurism of Trump’s foreign policy is absolutely stunning,” he told me. “He has zero interest in learning about the world.” Elsewhere, Murphy has observed that Trump “believes in putting a wall around America and hoping everything turns out OK.”It won’t, Murphy insists. Nonetheless, he thinks that many Americans are attracted to Trump’s instinctive isolationism because “the version of internationalism we have pursued in the last 20 years hasn’t worked” ― the Iraq war is a mistake for which America is paying still, and many voters blame stagnant wages on the incursions of the global economy.Nor have Democrats mastered the challenge of linking our policies abroad to our well-being at home. In the last election, Murphy told The Atlantic earlier this year that neither Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders “really represented my views... I think there is a big open space in the Democratic Party right now for the articulation of a progressive foreign policy.”Such a policy, Murphy believes, must confront unavoidable realities. America faces threats without borders – like pandemics and climate change – which continue to loom. The postcolonial status quo in the Middle East disintegrates, creating terrorism which threatens our national security. Russia and China are challenging international norms in order to expand their influence – including, in Russia’s case, by attacking our democratic institutions.“The Russians,” Murphy told The Atlantic, “are bullying countries with oil and gas, the Chinese are making massive economic investments around the world, ISIS and extremist groups are using propaganda and the Internet to grow their reach. And as the rest the world has been figuring out that power can be projected in non–military means very effectively, the United States has not made that transition.”The challenge he sees is to present Americans with a new and realistic vision for protecting our interests by engaging with the world. Unlike Trump, Murphy believes that America is strongest when working with partners, allies, and global institutions like NATO and the UN. His blueprint emphasizes proactive diplomacy and economic engagement: Doubling the size of America’s spending for diplomacy and foreign assistance. Starting a new Marshall plan to strengthen regions at risk – including struggling to stave off extremists. Engaging with Russia and China to pursue their ambitions within the framework of accepted international norms. Upholding America’s reputation as a beacon of opportunity and an advocate for civil and human rights.Here Murphy contests Trump’s most basic assumptions ― isolationism, indifference to democracy and human rights, a preference for rhetorical militarism over vigorous diplomacy, and the belief that our posture toward other peoples and countries has no relationship to the terrorist threat.Take the linkage between terrorism and our policies regarding human rights and refugees. While Murphy recognizes that our immediate security interests can conflict with long-term human rights concerns, he challenges Trump’s affinity for autocrats. One example is Egypt, where Trump funds the al-Sisi government with no strings attached, even though it is “likely creating more radicals than it’s eliminating.”Another is Trump’s unquestioning support for Saudi Arabia, especially since, Murphy says, “Saudi money fuels the building blocks of extremism” ― including the Wahhabi movement ― spreading instability across the region and menacing the U.S. The primary source of global terrorism is not Shia extremism, or even Iran, it is Sunni extremism. Saudi Arabia was home to the 9/11 hijackers; by comparison, Shia extremism does not drive the terrorist threat to America itself. Trump grants too much credence to the Saudis; and asks far too little.Trump further exacerbates the threat to America, Murphy cautions, through his refugee policies. As to refugees, Murphy contends that “the historic strength of our country is the ability to rescue people from terror and torture.” He would expand, not contract, our refugee program and believes that policies which discriminate against Muslims will only aid terrorist recruitment and endanger Americans. Murphy tweeted this blunt assessment of Trump’s travel ban: “We bomb your country, creating a humanitarian nightmare, then lock you inside. That’s a horror movie, not a foreign policy.”Specifically, Murphy would welcome refugees from Syria. While we can insist on stringent vetting, there is no evidence of real and present threat from Syrian refugees – the vast majority of whom, he notes, are women and children. And every time we “dim the light of America,” Murphy argues, we drive people toward our antagonists.Murphy perceives Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord as another potentially disastrous mistake. Climate change, he insists, is an immediate threat to the U.S. and the world, exacerbating instability in some of the globe’s most volatile regions. Far from ignoring these dangers, America must invest money and political capital to address them.As to the nuclear threat, in Murphy’s analysis Trump worsens the risks through bluster bereft of policy. One example is his careless indifference to nuclear proliferation. Another is his irresponsible flirtation with abandoning the Iran nuclear deal – “a catastrophic self-inflicted wound,” Murphy told me, alienating our allies while potentially putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.This has wider reverberations. For the Senate to use Trump’s groundless decertification as a pretext for exiting the agreement would, Murphy warns, shred America’s credibility at the very time we are trying to defuse a nuclear crisis with North Korea ― we can never convince Kim Jong Un to curb nuclear weapons by ripping up an agreement the U.S. exhaustively negotiated with Iran and the other major powers. Thus Trump hazards war in the Middle East and on the Korean Peninsula, further endangering American lives.As for North Korea itself, in Murphy’s estimate “Trump is deploying the worst negotiating strategy in the history of the American presidency ... placing the negotiations on life support.” The president should empower American diplomats to do their work; instead, Trump insults Kim Jong Un and undercuts his own Secretary of State.Like the overwhelming majority of military experts, Murphy believes that a preemptive American military strike would be disastrous – not least for those living on the Korean Peninsula. Instead the appropriate pressure point is for America to negotiate multi-lateral sanctions against Korea. But given Trump’s erratic pronouncements and disdain for diplomatic agreements, Murphy judges that America’s position in the world is too weak to achieve that strategy. Even our allies, he adds, wonder if they can still rely on us ― perhaps the ultimate measure of Trump’s failure.Overall, Murphy’s grasp of complex foreign policy problems is impressive; his indictment of Trump compelling; his proposals for protecting America clear and considered. But how does a progressive Democrat persuade a party, and country, fearful of terrorism yet weary of war and wary of the world at large? One answer may lie in Murphy’s attitude toward military preparedness and the use of military force.Like many Republicans, Murphy supports a military ready to discourage aggression, promote stability, and protect the free navigation of the seas. He does not advocate a massive transfer of money from the Department of Defense. But, in his reading, American foreign policy cannot rest on “the point of the spear.”In particular, he asserts that the U.S. should intervene militarily only with express congressional authorization, based on clear goals and exit strategies, and a firm commitment to care for our military when they return. Such actions should focus on creating space for local political solutions. If there is no achievable political solution, one must question the use of military force. This approach restores congressional authority, checks unilateral presidential actions, and respects the lives and welfare of our troops.For Murphy, another crucial point marks the volatile intersection of domestic and foreign policy – free trade agreements. For Americans who perceive the global economy as a threat to their personal security and livelihood, free trade pacts are inherently suspect; like many Democrats, Murphy opposed the Trans Pacific Partnership. Here foreign policy goals, including countering Chinese influence in Asia, conflicted with the concerns of American workers ― and the political interests of a party beset by Trump’s facile promises to better their lives through protectionism.Challenged to explain his vote, Murphy is direct. There was a winning foreign policy argument in favor of the TPP, he says – and a losing economic argument. First, he contends, America must invest in people who are displaced by economic change – through free education, job retraining and the like. Only with this as predicate can he support free trade agreements in order to expand our influence and commerce abroad.One can agree, or not. But successful leaders in foreign policy must be able to bring their constituents along, lest they lose touch, and fail. Clearly, Murphy understands this.In fact, Chris Murphy clearly understands a great deal more about foreign policy than most of his peers. And more, surely, than Donald Trump ever will. In a world as complex and dangerous as this, that matters – now, and perhaps in 2020."

We never know when it will be our turn. They cry, the children cry at the doorway, They cry when they see that their mother will not come back. (La Santa Cecilia, “ICE, El Hielo, “)Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has finally pierced the walls of the Ivy League. In so doing, they shattered a family and jeopardized the future of Viviana Andazola Marquez, a senior at Yale University. They also incurred the wrath of hundreds of student activists who have joined the struggle against an out of control enforcement machinery.For years, Viviana’s father, Melecio Andazola Morales, has sought to regularize his immigration status as he settled in Denver, started a family and raised his four US citizen children. Two weeks ago, ICE tricked Melecio and Viviana into believing that the purpose of a scheduled appointment at the Denver office of the US Citizens and Immigration Services (USCIS) was to grant him legal residency. While in the meeting room, officers ordered Viviana to leave the room, then handcuffed Melecio and whisked him away to a detention center, where he now awaits deportation.ICE surely knew of Melecio’s background and history before detaining him. They were aware that he has been living in the U.S. for 19 years, trying to regularize his status since 2001. That earlier in the year, Viviana, a US citizen, had filed yet another petition with USCIS so that her father would no longer be undocumented. And that Melecio had zero interactions with law enforcement. ICE might not have known then – but know now that Melecio has earned a steady living as a construction worker, supporting his mother and children. That the young woman that they ordered out of the room that afternoon is a student at one of the nation’s most prestigious universities. That in the course of an afternoon, they ripped apart a family that has followed the rules and tried everything to get right with immigration laws. Yet ICE does not honor the values of fairness, justice and the exercise of discretion.Under this administration, ICE has become a rogue agency that knows no bounds. Our families, neighbors and friends who are working hard for themselves and their families are the targets. The agency’s focus is now to carry out as many deportations as possible, by any means necessary. Their tactics shock the conscience and often violate our laws. They roam courthouses, snatching immigrants waiting for their day in court, a practice which makes it less likely for women facing domestic abuse to seek restraining orders, for tenants to seek redress for living in squalor, or for victims of crime to testify. They have followed parents taking their children to school, detaining them after drop-off and leaving children with no one to greet them at home. They wait outside of churches, arresting people after service. They pretend to be local police. They have even stopped wearing uniforms: Just last week, they entered a private home in plain clothes without a warrant and arrested a man, releasing him hours later without explanation. They have detained U.S. citizens in clear cases of racial profiling.Melecio is part of a growing number of people detained without any criminal history. Between January and September, ICE arrested 98,482 immigrants, a 43% increase from the prior year. Of those, 28,011 had no criminal record, an increase of 179% from 2016. This is not a mistake – it’s a strategy. What ICE did not anticipate when they detained Viviana’s father is that his arrest would mobilize students and professors more than 2,000 miles away, many of whom had been untouched by the rogue nature of immigration enforcement. Viviana’s predicament has brought home not just the impact that ICE is having on one of their peers, but also the way that it is systematically breaking apart immigrant families and shattering communities even within the hallowed community of Yale. At a rally last week at Yale supporting Viviana’s family, community speakers discussed Marco Lopez, an immigrant who had taken sanctuary in a church one block from the Yale campus. His case is strikingly similar to Melecio’s. Students in campuses around the country have joined the fight for Melecio – not just at Yale, but also at MIT, the University of California Santa Cruz, Tufts University, Oberlin College and others. They have circulated a petition that has generated tens of thousands of signatures. They have flooded ICE offices with calls. They have held rallies. They have mobilized public officials. And by doing so, they have begun to examine what is happening in their communities –detentions and deportations that until now barely caught their attention.What is needed now is concerted resistance. Resistance from students, professors, lawmakers, lawyers, advocates, construction workers, farmers, school teachers – any of us and all of us who care about fairness and protecting our democracy.We must resist not just for Melecio Morales, but also for the thousands of others whose lives are being ruined by an agency funded by our dollars and acting in our name.Kica Matos is the director of immigrant rights and racial justice at the Center for Community Change Action."

As a result, the three women have lost out on earnings, promotions and benefits, the lawsuit says.Avendano and Toro Lopez left Uber this summer after more than two years with the company. Medina is still employed there, according to the lawsuit.Uber spokesman Matthew Wing declined to comment.The lawsuit describes an employee ranking system that is “not based on valid and reliable performance measures” and favors men and white or Asian employees. Women, Latino, American Indian and African American employees are given lower performance scores, making it more difficult for them to advance professionally and confining them to more menial tasks, according to the lawsuit.“In this system, female employees and employees of color are systematically undervalued compared to their male and white or Asian American peers,” the lawsuit says.Women, black and Latino employees also lose out on pay raises, bonuses, stock options, benefits and other wages because of the company’s discriminatory practices, the lawsuit alleges.“These three engineers are seeking to ensure that Uber pays women and people of color equally for the hard work they’ve done – and will continue to do – to help make Uber successful,” said lawyer Jahan Sagafi of Outten & Golden which is representing the plaintiffs. Outten & Golden have also represented employees in gender discrimination lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and Microsoft Corp.Avendano and Toro Lopez brought their complaints to the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency this summer, an administrative step that precedes a public lawsuit.

Its stock price fell 4.56 percent to $7.08 in midday trading on Thursday.The charges marked a major escalation of the ongoing investigations of Insys related to Subsys, an under-the-tongue spray that contains fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid.Those probes have come amid a national opioid abuse epidemic. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in over 33,000 deaths in 2015. The death rate has continued to rise, according to estimates.Kapoor, who founded Insys in 2002 and remains a board member, stepped down in January as the company’s chairman and chief executive, a role he took on in November 2015.He is currently the chairman of drugmaker Akorn Inc and president of investment firm EJ Financial Enterprises Inc.According to the indictment, following the launch of Subsys in 2012, Kapoor and Babich grew dissatisfied with the drug’s success in its initial three months on the market.It says they, with others, devised a scheme to pay bribes in the form of speaker fees and food and entertainment to medical practitioners to prescribe Subsys and to increase the dosage and volume of existing prescriptions.They also sought to mislead and defraud insurers who were reluctant to approve payment for Subsys when it was prescribed to patients who did not have cancer, the indictment said.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Scott Malone and Dan Grebler)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f1b0971500007a4174781c.png?cache=9qVBRzE0lf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a scathing, and viral, takedown of Fox News, late-night comedy host Trevor Noah made an astute observation. Fox News has been blistering in its coverage of sexual harassment and assault allegations facing Harvey Weinstein, Noah, host of “The Daily Show,” noted on Monday. But Fox News seemed to be treating the sexual harassment scandal involving former Fox host Bill O’Reilly rather differently.The numbers appear to corroborate Noah’s observation. Media Matters said in a report released Wednesday that Fox had spent about 12.5 hours in three weeks covering allegations against Hollywood’s Weinstein. The network devoted just 20 minutes of coverage to reports about O’Reilly’s alleged sexual predation — over the course of seven months.John Whitehouse, a writer for the media watchdog, mused that Fox would need more than two decades to give O’Reilly the same amount of coverage as Weinstein, given the current pace. Fox’s coverage of O’Reilly included 10 separate news segments ― half of them on the network’s media criticism show, “MediaBuzz,” Media Matters noted.The Weinstein story, on the other hand, was featured in 173 separate segments, Media Matters said. The New York Times reported in April that O’Reilly and Fox had spent millions over several years settling at least five allegations of sexual harassment against the longtime anchor. Weeks later, facing public outcry and an advertiser boycott, O’Reilly was ousted from the network.In another bombshell report published over the weekend, the Times revealed that O’Reilly had paid $32 million to longtime network contributor Lis Wiehl over “allegations of repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material.” 21st Century Fox, the news network’s parent company, acknowledged it was “aware of” Wiehl’s complaints about O’Reilly. Still, the company signed O’Reilly to a contract extension that paid $25 million a year, according to the Times. Noah called out the hypocrisy.“So we know that Fox News not only knew what O’Reilly was up to for a long time, they even hid some of it,” Noah said. “Which means that while Fox News may be woke in the streets, they are definitely enablers in the sheets.”Last month, O’Reilly returned to Fox to promote his new book on Sean Hannity’s show. The interview, which lasted 35 minutes, was heavily promoted by the network, reported CNN.Hannity appeared thrilled at the former anchor’s return, suggesting that O’Reilly could become a recurring guest.“Come back. Will you come back?” Hannity asked at the end of the segment."

Ten years later, the academy is stressing that these toys “should generally be avoided.”“Furry and plush toys such as stuffed animals are difficult to clean and can harbor germs and should generally be avoided in clinic waiting areas and game rooms,” the statement reads.The AAP wrote that offices can encourage parents to bring toys for comfort if needed.In a major change, the AAP suggested to make flu shots mandatory for all staff members at these offices as well as at outpatient facilities. “Health care facilities should provide an influenza vaccine annually to all HCP [health care personnel] at no cost,” the authors wrote. Among its standard ideas, the AAP reiterated the importance of hand hygiene. Doctors’ offices and outpatient clinics should have “visual alerts” to remind patients to use their elbows (not their hands) when coughing and sneezing and to cover their noses and mouths when doing so. Having masks available for patients with these symptoms “should be considered,” especially if there has been an increase in respiratory issues. And in not surprising news, the AAP continues to recommend having alcohol-based sanitizer and tissues readily available in waiting rooms, along with “no-touch receptacles” for disposal.Read more about these guidelines on the AAP’s site.

According to one study, in 1995, 6 million women, the majority of whom were white, had jobs they wouldn’t have otherwise held but for affirmative action. Another study shows that women made greater gains in employment at companies that do business with the federal government, which are therefore subject to federal affirmative-action requirements, than in other companies — with female employment rising 15.2% at federal contractors but only 2.2% elsewhere. And the women working for federal-contractor companies also held higher positions and were paid better. Even in the private sector, the advancements of white women eclipse those of people of color. After IBM established its own affirmative-action program, the numbers of women in management positions more than tripled in less than 10 years. Data from subsequent years show that the number of executives of color at IBM also grew, but not nearly at the same rate.Racism, willful ignorance, delusion — these are our only explanations for whites holding beliefs dramatically contradicted by an abundance of evidence that in the U.S. white privilege is powerful and the oppression of blacks is pervasive even when blacks attain more education.One case that rivals white delusion is charter school delusion.When I published an op-ed countering two local news stories on SAT scores — both of which misled readers by ranking schools and suggesting charter schools are somehow superior to traditional public schools — the predictable response appeared, from the state’s superintendent of charter schools no less:Three levels of delusion in one tweet.First, my university is test-optional—We believe that your potential for success cannot be determined solely by standardized test scores. As a result, our admission process is test optional, meaning you are not required to submit SAT or ACT scores.—as are a growing number of colleges and universities. And thus, the “gotcha” aspect of this tweet falls flat due to a complete failure to look for the evidence.Next, high-stakes testing—which remains biased by race, social class, and gender—does in fact cause inequity since these tests often are gatekeepers for scholarships and admissions.And finally, the greatest delusion of all among charter advocates is pure ideology: “Our expectations of kids cause inequity.”Simply examine the SAT scores along with the Poverty Index (PI) in the chart below (traditional schools, no highlight, and charter schools, highlighted):Both traditional and charter schools fall along a predictable pattern of SAT scores correlating strongly to PI, and thus, charter advocates have a real evidence problem with claims that SAT scores are the result, mostly or only, of expectations.If there is an expectations problem in the charter school movement, it is that we must have higher expectations for honesty and awareness of evidence among charter school advocates, administrators, and teachers.Delusion that denies white privilege or misrepresents educational policy is harmful on many levels since it detracts from real problems—such as the cancers that are racism and inequity as well as the tremendous failures of universal public education in the U.S.In my first-year writing seminar, my constant refrain is urging young people to step back from what they believe is true, to be skeptical of those quick and easy beliefs, and to seek credible and compelling evidence that either confirms or corrects those beliefs.Just saying something, I warn, doesn’t make it true.White people and charter advocates, it seems, could use a refresher course in the foundations of composition."

The Republican leadership proposes eliminating the state and local tax deduction. Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat from California, called this “an insidious effort to raise taxes on middle class families.”A large number of long-form filers who take this tax deduction come from just seven states, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York, that all voted against Trump in 2016. The state and local tax deduction allows states and communities to raise funds to pay for things like police, schools, and hospitals without overburdening residents.Even some Republicans from these states oppose the plan. Representative Peter King, Republican from Long Island, New York, complained “They’re asking us to vote on the budget for a tax bill they haven’t shown us on a promise that somehow it’s going to be fair, even though they’re talking about knocking out SALT. I don’t see how anyone from those districts can vote for the budget under that, even if they promise us something.”According to the Tax Foundation, in 2012 the state and local tax burden in Mississippi was 8.6%. It ranked as the 41st lowest tax rate in the country. Louisiana, at 7.6%, ranked 45th. New York was the highest taxed state followed by Connecticut and New Jersey.The Wall Street Journal, hardly a left-leaning publication, reports that states get what they tax for. Mississippi ranks 49th in the United States in education. Its per pupil spending is 13th lowest and its high school graduation rate is 4th lowest. Its advanced placement test scores are dreadful, 25 percent lower than the national average. Louisiana ranks 45th in the nation. It spends a little more on schools, but its high school graduation rate is one of the lowest in the country. Less than 30 percent of fourth graders and fewer than 18 percent of eighth graders in Louisiana are considered proficient in math.Health care in Mississippi and Louisiana states is equally dismal. According to a report in USA Today, Mississippi has the highest poverty rate in the United States, is tied for the worst obesity rate, and has the lowest life expectancy in the country. Louisiana, ranks just behind Mississippi in these depressing categories. It has the third highest poverty rate in the United States, one-third of its population is obese, and life expectancy ranks fourth from the bottom.Turns out the Trump and Republican tax cuts may really be punishments for states that vote Democrat.

So, it hardly comes as a shock that a new survey has found that less than half of men think women have a right to affordable menstrual hygiene products.In a YouGov survey of more than 2,000 American adults released this week, just 46 percent of men said they agreed that having access to affordable tampons and pads should be categorized as a right, not a privilege. Of the women surveyed, 65 percent said it should be considered a right. Meanwhile, 33 percent of men and 24 percent of women surveyed said they disagreed that it was a right, with the rest unsure or opting not to say. More advocates are working to convince lawmakers to make tampons and pads less expensive and more readily available in public restrooms. The goal is to ensure that women and girls of menstruating age don’t miss out on school and work opportunities or have their dignity compromised just because they can’t afford a tampon.While research hasn’t determined the precise number of women and girls who can’t afford tampons or pads in the U.S., surveys suggest it’s a widespread issue affecting various low-income communities. The YouGov report found that almost 40 percent of women surveyed have been in a situation more than once where they didn’t have a tampon or pad when they needed it.Poor women and girls, as well as those who are incarcerated or homeless, often struggle the most to get access to tampons.Part of the issue is that in most states, tampons and pads are subject to sales taxes because they’re not classified as products that fulfill a basic need, like medication and food. This puts an already pricey item further out of reach for underserved women and girls.A box of 36 tampons typically costs about $7. Over the course of a lifetime, women spend about $2,200 on sanitary pads and tampons. But research shows that people living in poverty spend more on basic items like tampons, toilet paper and diapers than people who don’t.In rural areas, which tend to be poorer, the prices for products from far away cities are higher due to price gouging and fuel costs.

The YouGov report reflects how much work still needs to be done to convince men that tampons and pads aren’t a “luxury” item. While 67 percent of women oppose taxing menstrual hygiene products, only 43 percent of men feel the same way.Some advocates say they feel hopeful as lawmakers have grown more open to making tampons and pads freely available in public restrooms, just as soap and toilet paper are.Last year, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio signed legislation making menstrual hygiene products free and available in all public schools, shelters and jails in New York City. California followed suit this month, when Brown signed a bill requiring low-income schools to stock half the bathrooms with free menstrual hygiene products. “Part of the goal is to normalize how we treat menstruation,” Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, author of Period Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity, told HuffPost. “No one questions the products provided in public restrooms: soap, something to dry your hands with.

34,POLITICS,'What Is Rich?' Asks Congresswoman Worth $75 Million,Amanda Terkel and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diane-black-rich_us_59f1f3b3e4b07fdc5fbc5a74,"""Is $1 million rich? Is $10 million rich? Is $1 billion rich?""",2017-10-26,Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) argues that it's hard to tell when someone is rich.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f1f4bc140000610d8c9d28.jpeg?cache=n2fUEDOCVv&ops=crop_0_0_5568_3521%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"While trying to sell the GOP tax plan as a benefit for the middle class, Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) argued on Monday that it’s hard to tell whether millionaires are in the middle class or are considered “rich.”Fox Business host Trish Regan pressed Black, who chairs the House Budget Committee, about whether the GOP tax plan would actually hurt wealthy taxpayers. She asked how “socking it to the rich” would help Republicans curry favor with the middle class.“Well I don’t know that you would call that ‘socking it to the rich’ if there wasn’t a decrease in the marginal rate because there are some other things that will help those who are at the higher income level,” she said.“I’m always careful about calling people rich because, what’s rich? Is $1 million rich? Is $10 million rich? Is $1 billion rich? So I want to be careful about that. But we really want to be sure that ... there are some pieces in there besides just the marginal rate, such as getting rid of the [alternative minimum tax]. There are some other pieces in there that do help those at upper income.”To answer Black’s questions, yes, you are rich if you have $1 million, $10 million or $1 billion. A net worth of just $630,754 would put you among the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans, according to 2011 census data. The line may be fuzzy around the $1 million mark for the congresswoman, who is running for governor of Tennessee, because she is worth far more than that. Black’s net worth was more than $75 million in 2015, the latest year available on OpenSecrets.org. In 2011, The Atlantic ran a piece about Black called, “The Richest New Member of the House” and noted that much of her money came from “her interest in Aegis Sciences Corporation, a Nashville forensic chemical and drug-testing laboratory that her husband, David, founded in 1986.”Black did grow up poorer, though, spending her first few years in public housing.The median household income in the U.S. was $59,039 last year. There is no set definition of “middle class,” but in politics the term tends to apply to people making vastly more money than most Americans.The few details of the GOP tax plan that have been released so far suggest not every middle-class taxpayer would get a lower tax bill. Though the framework calls for lower marginal tax rates, it also simplifies the tax code by eliminating a vast array of deductions and exemptions, which benefit the rich but also most people with lower incomes.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center said in an analysis that by 2027 the plan would actually increase taxes for nearly a third of taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $150,000 and nearly two-thirds of taxpayers with incomes between $150,000 and $300,000.Republicans are tweaking their plan and have said they want to avoid those middle-class tax increases. The problem is that if they give back more deductions and exemptions, their plan will lose even more revenue. That’s why they’re considering an extra tax bracket for people with higher incomes.During the debate over expiring Bush-era tax cuts in 2012, Democrats wanted the top marginal tax rate for individuals to kick in for incomes above $200,000, which Republicans thought was too low a threshold. Congress ultimately set the top bracket around $400,000. "
35,POLITICS,Donald Trump Throws U.S. Generals Under The Bus In Regard To Niger Attack,Willa Frej,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-generals-niger_us_59f19528e4b0438859154c04,"And that's not presidential, experts say.",2017-10-26,"U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, at right, shakes hands with national security adviser H.R. McMaster.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f1e645140000371b8c9cf8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"History has shown that it’s an unspoken rule for the commander in chief to take responsibility for the deaths of U.S. troops abroad, even if he wasn’t involved in the planning or the execution of whatever mission went awry.President Donald Trump, however, has broken with that tradition, instead choosing to pass the buck to his generals.He told reporters on Wednesday that he wasn’t the one to specifically order the Oct. 4 mission in Niger that killed four U.S. soldiers, indirectly implicating the generals in charge of the operation instead.“I have generals — they are great generals,” he said on Wednesday. “I gave them the authority to do what’s right so that we win. That’s the authority they have. I want to win and we’re going to win.”He has used this strategy of heaping praise on U.S. generals but also subtly turning them into scapegoats before.When Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens died in a botched raid in Yemen several days after Trump took office, he pinned the tragedy on his predecessor and the military even though he was the one to personally give the raid the green light.“This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something that was, you know, just — [the generals] wanted to do,” Trump told Fox News. “And they came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected. And they lost Ryan.”But as the most senior military leader in the U.S. chain of command, should responsibility fall to the president no matter what? Experts argue that the answer is unequivocally yes.“Instead of acting like a commander in chief and commanding responsibility for all of the troops when something goes wrong, he says, ‘Well, that’s on the generals,’” David Rothkopf, senior fellow in American foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, told HuffPost. “He wishes to benefit from the association as far as it takes him, using them as a firewall.”“This sort of abdication of responsibility and accountability isn’t unique to Trump; it is a common practice of poor leaders ― accept a credit, assign all blame,” said Micah Zenko, a Chatham House Whitehead senior fellow. “It is just wholly unprecedented for an American president in modern history.”Past presidents on both sides of the aisle, including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, publicly took the blame for the deaths of American troops overseas.Tommy Vietor, former National Security Council spokesman under Obama, said that as commander in chief, “the responsibility for success and failure ends with him.”“But every time he’s asked to comment on casualties or an operation that goes badly,” Vietor added, “he pushes responsibility onto his military leadership. It’s weak and cowardly and shows a lack of accountability.”What’s clear is that Trump places an unusual amount of faith in his generals, to the point of bringing on several as his closest advisers.Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, is a retired four-star Marine general. Defense Secretary James Mattis is also a retired general ― he even had to receive a waiver to be confirmed for the position because he retired less than seven years ago. His national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, is an active-duty Army officer.“Never have so many generals served at once in such positions of authority,” Council on Foreign Relations fellow Max Boot wrote in Foreign Policy earlier this week. “This has raised concerns about whether soldiers and Marines are usurping prerogatives best left to civilians.”In March, Trump began offering the military more autonomy to pursue counterterrorism missions by loosening some restrictions on operations in parts of Africa as well as Yemen. Under Obama, any proposed airstrike away from conventional war zones like Iraq and Syria required stringent interagency vetting.“What I do is I authorize my military... We have given them total authorization, and that’s what they’re doing,” Trump said in April.On the one hand, Rothkopf said, Trump’s decision to give more leeway to the generals may have been an effort to respond to the military’s criticisms of the Obama administration ― “that it micromanaged and it tied the hands of the military.”“It’s very important and very helpful for us to have a little more flexibility, a little bit more timeliness, in terms of the decision-making process,” said Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the top officer at Africa Command. “It allows us to prosecute targets in a more rapid fashion.”But this approach also allows Trump to sidestep responsibility.“It allows him to say ‘Look how pro-military I am,’ but at the same time, he gives himself an out,” Rothkopf said. “He gives himself the ability to say ‘If something goes wrong, go see them.’”Rothkopf doesn’t think the strategy will sit well with the American public. “I don’t think the American people ― or the people of the world ― are ready to dissociate the commander in chief from the actions of the militaries he commands,” he said. “At end of the day, he may say it’s on them, but it’s on him.”This story has been updated to include Rothkopf’s comments."

The locations are in Miami, Boston, Los Angeles, Austin and Salt Lake City (the specific addresses can be found below).News of the offer came in the release of a particularly creepy YouTube video that shows a man being chased by the painted characters until he reaches a Burger King restaurant. Once inside he’s met by a sinister looking yellow and red-suited clown that resembles Ronald McDonald ― McDonald’s mascot and Burger King’s arch-rival.According to a press release by Burger King, clowns are the third most sought-after Halloween costume this year, likely in part to the recent release of Stephen King’s horror movie “It.”“We don’t usually talk about clowns,” said Alex Macedo, President of North America’s Burger King band, in a statement. “But for this Halloween, come dressed as a clown to eat like a king.”The offer is Burger King’s latest clear dig at its fast-food rival.Earlier this month, the restaurant snuck an ad into the credits of a screening of “It” in Germany to poke fun at McDonald’s clown connection. Just before the credits were about to roll at the end, a sign flashed up on the screen reading: “The moral is: Never trust a clown.”Here are the addresses of select restaurants hosting the Halloween clown gatherings, which are scheduled from 7 p.m. to closing time:1101 Washington Ave, Miami Beach, FL"

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) speak out about what he called “personal attacks, … threats against principles, freedoms, and institutions, [and] flagrant disregard for truth or decency,” an apparent criticism of President Donald Trump. But Flake, who announced he would not run for re-election Tuesday, should have spoken out sooner, she argues. “Speaking out, that’s great,” Abboud, who calls herself a “proud American-Muslim woman,” told HuffPost in an interview. But it “would have been better if we could have combated the rhetoric at the time and stood up as Americans and said, ‘This is not the direction we need to be going.’”Abboud, a Phoenix attorney and civil rights advocate who’s facing U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema and others in the Democratic primary for Flake’s seat, decided to run in part because she was concerned about politicians “throwing communities under the bus for political gain,” she said, and not just in the U.S. presidential race. (Though, during his presidential campaign, Trump called some Mexican immigrants “rapists” and vowed to ban Muslims from entering the United States.) Leaders like Flake were allowing this rhetoric to “prosper and go unchallenged” by not standing up, she added. As president, Trump has continued to push for policies criticized as anti-Muslim while also failing to convincingly denounce white supremacists.Abboud has personally faced Islamophobia during her campaign, receiving hundreds of abusive and hateful comments online. She said she hasn’t banned anyone from her social media pages, though she uses filters for profanity. (“Pretty useless,” she remarked.) She also said that “flag-waving white supremacists” showed up at two of her events: at a vegan restaurant in May and an LGBTQ church. “They decided to ask very inflammatory questions, which I answered,” she said, though, she noted, in general people want to talk about the issues and problem-solving. When trolls attacked Abboud on Facebook over the summer, Flake came to her defense. “Hang in there,” he tweeted in July. “Sorry you have to put up with this. Lots of wonderful people across AZ. You’ll find them.” Abboud told HuffPost that Flake’s Twitter response was a “move in the right direction.” But she said she wants to see more leaders taking a stand against “un-American” attacks across the board. “Muslims may be the flavor of the day, but we’re not the only flavor. A lot of communities are under attack.” "
39,BLACK VOICES,Boston's Mayoral Election Hinges On Race And Fairness,"Kevin C. Peterson, ContributorWriter on Race & Politics",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boston-mayor-election-hinges-on-race-and-fairness_us_59ee3164e4b031d8582f5729,"Incumbent Mayor Marty Walsh and City Councilor Tito Jackson envision two very different futures for the city, epitomizing a divide on the left.",2017-10-26,City Councilor Tito Jackson and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh join for a debate ahead of the city's upcoming mayoral election,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f24ca3140000610d8c9e85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, the Boston NAACP released a stunning report card on incumbent Mayor Marty Walsh that reflects his legacy on racial relations in that city. The report is not good. And it deserves Mayor Walsh’s real scrutiny at the polls for black voters.Walsh, currently in his first term, oversees a city that is mostly black, latino and asian, and is running for re-election against an African-American mayoral challenger, City Councilor Tito Jackson. Jackson is the adopted son of a mother whose birth mother was raped and whose adopted father was a stalwart labor activist. His mother was also a public school teacher.The local NAACP branch, headed by Tanisha Sullivan, gave only mid-to-low grades to Walsh, who has ― in the past ― shunned open debates with Jackson, a candidate pushing racial fairness in Boston.In the debate this week, Jackson grilled Walsh on issues that ranged from housing, to economic development, to income inequality, to poverty and crime in the city. Under Walsh, the city’s black businesses only gained two percent of municipal contracts while they are 25 percent of the city. Walsh has also wavered on issues like police body cameras backed by the Black Lives Matter movement.Jackson, otherwise, has backed concerns for local organizing.But Walsh has refused to endorse the Ten Demandments, which call for sweeping changes in the city, one of the nation’s largest that has not elected a black or minority mayor.The Demandments prioritize racial equity and fair treatment in the municipality.“The report’s underlying public service value is that it highlights some entrenched issues that frankly have not been effectively addressed, solved or monitored consistently for decades. High youth unemployment comes most readily to mind. Unresolved, the same issues have continued to plague communities of color, impeding progress on all fronts” wrote Boston Herald columnist Joyce Ferribough.The NAACP report agrees with what members of Boston Communities United, a grassroots collaboration of civil rights groups, have been arguing in Boston: black people have been ignored in a city which has seen enormous economic progress.Walsh has been the recipient of the former mayor’s economic vision. The building growth has been phenomenal in the downtown regions and in high-income neighborhoods.But Walsh’s most prominent failure seems to be his reluctance to spread the wealth and respect the legacy of blacks in his city.He has failed to address renaming Faneuil Hall in Boston, an edifice named after a slave owner. That national monument offends the civic dignity of black people in the state’s capital city. I have led the city in this effort.In addition, African American teachers are under-hired in Boston’s public schools despite a court order, issued 30 years ago, intended to ensure blacks account for a minimum of 25 percent of the teacher corps. And furthermore, Walsh has wavered significantly on the use of police body cameras in the city. The Boson NAACP, however, has arrived late. It had promised to deliver a report card four years ago under its former leader Michael Curry, but It’s current leader shows bravery and an ability to get things done. Let hope she can. To that point, the Boston branch of the NAACP would do well by activating its branch members to embrace the 10 Demandments. They could also be helpful in sitting with the current mayor and the challenger to discuss, in open forums, the profoundly moving issues of racial division that impact the city before the election on November 7.This would begin to heal the racial divide in the city and heal the legacy of hatred that divides its citizens there.At the least, the Boston NAACP, the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts and the Boston Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights should push for minority rights and increased voter participation."

In January, a U.S. intelligence report concluded the two are arms of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine.”The social media outlet disclosed RT spent $274,100 on ads in 2016, and $1.9 million on ads since joining the platform in 2011. Twitter said Thursday it will donate those funds to an external group researching “the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections, including use of malicious automation and misinformation.”RT responded to the decision in an opinion piece, calling the accusations that it’s seeking to influence people via advertising on Twitter “absolutely groundless.”The Russian outlet claimed the real culprit here is Twitter itself, blaming the company for recruiting RT to spend heavily on ads during the 2016 election.“Twitter pushed RT for a large ad buy for the 2016 US election, but the channel declined the offer,” wrote Deputy Editor-in-Chief Kirill Karnovich-Valua.Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan called Twitter’s decision “regrettable,” and reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed the country would respond “swiftly and symmetrically.”On Tuesday, Twitter announced a number of changes to how it treats advertising on the network, with an eye on political advertising in particular.The steps, which aim to make political messaging more transparent, follow a similar push by Facebook. Both companies are making policy changes after the federal government launched investigations into their conduct during the 2016 election. The actions also come amid a fear of increased government regulation of platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google.Twitter has been under heightened scrutiny from lawmakers, who very publicly criticized the company in late September, after closed-door briefings indicated it had not done enough to investigate its role in misinformation campaigns during 2016 election.Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, called its presentation “inadequate on almost every level,” adding Twitter’s efforts “showed an enormous lack of understanding ... of how serious this issue is, [and] the threat it poses to democratic institutions.”Troublingly, both Twitter and Facebook have been scrubbing their platforms of data ― and, in Facebook’s case, thousands of potentially incriminating posts ― that’s invaluable to researchers investigating the Russian disinformation campaign."

And everyone knows Ladurée in Paris makes the freshest macarons of the entire Ladurée empire, right?Wrong.What most people may not know is that the macarons at Ladurée in Paris ― or any Ladurée around the world, for that matter ― aren’t made fresh in the store. Most of them are made in a factory in Switzerland, preassembled and then shipped across the world in a “hibernation state” (more on that later). “Our macarons are made in Switzerland only, since we want the same quality control worldwide with the same ingredients, water, etc. and know how,” Celine Kaplan, who manages public relations for Ladurée, told HuffPost.There’s one exception: Kaplan explained that macarons served in French Ladurée shops are made at a lab about 20 minutes outside of Paris, put in a “hibernation state,” and then shipped to shops in France. They are not made in Switzerland (but they’re still put in hibernation, meaning they’re not freshly baked when you eat them in a Paris shop).The only food that is actually made on-site in Ladurée stores around the world are the pastries (such as croissants), but the macarons are always shipped in a “hibernation state.”So, what exactly is that? Kaplan said that the hibernation state is “a cooling off stage after the baking process.” When asked if it was similar to freezing, Kaplan said “not really.” She also doesn’t like to use the word “frozen” because it is “too harsh.”“It’s an in-between stage. They hibernate and then we slowly wake them,” Kaplan explained. “I know it sounds crazy. They’re not people. But we slowly wake them up. I’ve seen it myself.” While it’s not uncommon to freeze macarons, it’s clear Ladurée hasn’t liked to use that terminology in past interviews.“We don’t say they are frozen — it’s not a very pretty word,” Aude Schlosser, a Ladurée spokeswoman, told the New York Times in a 2013 interview. The fact that Ladurée macarons aren’t made in-store isn’t exactly a secret. As stated above, the Times mentioned that the pastries are made in a factory in a 2013 piece about macarons and a widely-circulated Medium post in 2015 also explored the subject. David Holder, chairman of Ladurée, offered some insight as to why macarons are shipped in from Europe at the opening of NYC’s Laduree location in 2011. “Ladurée is exactly the same all over the world, everywhere: Exactly the same French style,” Holder told WWD at the time. “I want the New Yorkers to feel like they’re in Paris on the Rue Royale in 1862, to feel the same way and have the same dream: what we call ‘le rêve Ladurée.’ Everything is the same. Between New York, Tokyo, Paris. The macarons are made in Paris and shipped overnight. The manager of this New York location is French. Everything has to be like being in Paris. That’s very important to me.”But as Heather Stimmler-Hall wrote of Ladurée macarons in her Medium post, “I’m not saying they don’t taste good, but it’s hard to swallow their ‘artisan luxury macaron’ story when they’re produced in a factory by a large corporation, then frozen and shipped over long distances around the world.” So if you were planning a trip to Paris just for the “artisan” macaron experience at Ladurée, you might want to rethink things."

As a perpetual hypocrite, Rubio has a solid record of doing and saying anything that will advance his own personal interests. During the 2016 election, Rubio wasted no time in stating that the United States should not entrust an ""erratic individual"" like Donald Trump with the nuclear codes. And yet, Rubio ultimately endorsed Trump for president because he signed his name to a piece of paper saying he would support the Republican nominee. That same year, the same Marco Rubio who repeated over 10,000 times a bogus claim of becoming a private citizen by January 2017 ended up pushing his friend, and current Lt. Governor of Florida, Carlos Lopez-Cantera out of the way that he could run for a second term as Florida's junior senator.And let us not forget how Marco Rubio, once part of the immigration working group known as the ""Gang of 8,"" lied to the faces of immigrant mothers from Florida who had traveled to Washington D.C. to confront him about rumors that he was backing away from his own immigration reform bill in 2013.Marco Rubio is and will continue to be the same chameleon-colored empty suit that we have known him to be since he first ran for the United States Senate. There is simply no changing that fact.That is why Rubio will declare his support for Ed Gillespie's anti-immigrant campaign next Monday, just so that he can later brag to Spanish-language media about his non-accomplishments on immigration and lackluster political career. Because that is who Marco Rubio is, a self-serving politician who works from the sidelines in hopes that, by casually supporting the extreme right, her can one day landing a leadership post he is unfit to hold."

If you missed it, it’s plain and simple. He asked me to.”Mowry went on to explain that as Cree’s parent, she feels she should “nurture his thoughts and ideas.”“He said he wanted to look like daddy [actor Cory Hardrict] and was very specific how he wanted his hair,” Mowry wrote. “Someone is a very happy boy and that’s all that matters.”In the video, you can hear Mowry share her excitement for her son’s decision. “You look so handsome, boy,” she says. Later that day, Mowry shared an additional photo of Cree rocking his new look and giving a thumbs-up.In 2014, Mowry wrote another important post about her son’s hair. After receiving criticism for keeping his hair long, the actress wrote on Instagram that she was “proud to have a son that embraces his natural hair.”“Hair length does not define your sex,” she wrote. “Last I checked a penis and a vagina does.”While chatting with Meredith Vieira on her talk show in 2015, Mowry again pointed out the absurdity of the backlash she faced.“I really don’t get it,” she said. “I don’t understand how people like to compartmentalize what men should look like or what women should look like.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f18cc41500007a417477f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As millions of Puerto Ricans struggle without power, automaker and energy company Tesla is bringing some much-needed light to the hurricane-ravaged island.Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, announced on Wednesday that the company had restored electricity to San Juan’s Hospital del Niño (Children’s Hospital) after installing solar panels and energy storage batteries at the facility.In a viral Instagram post, Musk said the solar firm’s installation at the hospital marked the “first of many solar+battery Tesla projects going live in Puerto Rico.” “Glad to help support the recovery,” added Musk, who has personally donated $250,000 to support the island’s hurricane relief efforts.According to David Begnaud, a CBS News correspondent, the hospital’s solar farm is capable of generating 200 kilowatts of solar power and has 500 kilowatts of storage. That’ll be sufficient to support the day-to-day operations of the facility, which has 35 permanent residents with chronic conditions and provides care to more than 3,000 children from across the island.The solar farm is reportedly a donation from Tesla to the hospital and will be provided free of charge for an indefinite time as Puerto Rico gets back on its feet following the devastation of Hurricane Maria, which barreled through the island last month.Maria Lopez, the hospital’s executive director, told the newspaper El Nuevo Dia that once the energy crisis is over, the facility would likely negotiate a deal with Tesla to acquire the system permanently. She added that the solar installation had “enormous implications on the operation of the institution,” which had been struggling to serve its patients since the hurricane hit. Tesla has made quick work of its promise to help Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria ― a promise that was apparently sparked by a series of tweets between Musk and Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello.Musk had mused on Twitter on Oct. 5 that Tesla could likely help restore power to parts of Puerto Rico using solar panels and batteries.Rossello promptly responded to Musk’s comments: “Let’s talk,” the governor tweeted. Musk replied that he’d be “happy” to chat and hoped “Tesla can be helpful.”Less than three weeks later, Rossello attended the unveiling of Tesla’s solar farm at San Juan’s Children’s Hospital.The governor thanked Tesla for what he called a “humanitarian gesture,” and said the project “could be a model to follow for public or private entities that offer services critical to citizens,” according to El Nuevo Dia.Seventy-five percent of Puerto Rico’s power grid is still down. Rebuilding it will likely take months, experts estimate, and could cost as much as $5 billion, according to NPR. Millions are currently relying on generators for power. But with the price of generators skyrocketing, they’re “out of reach” for many average Puerto Ricans, reported Vox.The stories coming out of the U.S. territory are harrowing: Children returning to schools without electricity and doctors performing surgery under the light of cellphones.The former governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro Padilla, tweeted this image last week: The source of the photo is unknown and could not be independently verified. A tiny Montana energy company named Whitefish was recently awarded a $300 million contract to help restore Puerto Rico’s power grid, prompting questions as to how such a small firm could secure such a major project. The company has ties to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and backing from a major donor to President Donald Trump. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz called the contract “alarming.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f15ee71500007a417477c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Multiple women have accused Mark Halperin, a veteran journalist who co-wrote the book Game Change about the 2008 presidential election, of sexually harassing them while he worked at ABC News, according to a CNN report.Five women told CNN’s Oliver Darcy that Halperin propositioned employees while he was in a powerful position at ABC. Three women accused Halperin of pressing his genitals against them while clothed, and one said he grabbed her breasts against her will. He has denied those allegations to CNN.An additional two women accused Halperin of sexual misconduct as news of the allegations spread. Reporter Emily Miller said on Twitter late Wednesday that she too was assaulted while working as a junior employee at ABC, but did not elaborate on her story. Another journalist, who spoke to The Daily Beast anonymously to speak candidly, said that Halperin made unwanted advances towards her more than a decade ago that were “just shameless.” Both women told the Beast their accounts were separate to those reported by CNN.One woman came forward publicly with her allegations of sexual misconduct in The Washington Post. Dianna Goldberg told the newspaper she worked as a researcher at ABC News in 1994 when Halperin asked her to sit on his lap while they were in his office. Goldberg, who now goes by her married name, May, said she reluctantly complied, fearing repercussions to her career if she ignored Halperin’s request. She said he made similar requests on several subsequent occasions. Halperin told CNN in a statement Wednesday night: “During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me. I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize.“Under the circumstances, I’m going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.”Halperin, 52, has held several senior positions at many prestigious news outlets, most recently as senior political analyst for NBC News and MSNBC. He stepped down from his role at NBC pending investigation of the incidents, the network said in a statement.Savannah Guthrie briefly mentioned the report Thursday on NBC’s “Today” show. Mika Brzezinski, who hosts MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” also addressed the allegations on air. Halperin has been a frequent guest on the show. “CNN is reporting allegations regarding our friend Mark Halperin over a decade ago, unnamed sources detailing unwanted advances and inappropriate behavior,” Brzezinski said during Thursday’s episode. “Halperin apologized for the pain his actions caused... we will be following this story as it develops. I’m sure we will be talking about it again when we know more about it.”The women in the CNN report, who asked the outlet to keep their identities private, did not report Halperin to ABC management out of fear of retribution. None of the women told the outlet that Halperin threatened to retaliate against them or promised anything in exchange for sex.“Mark left ABC News over a decade ago, and no complaints were filed during his tenure,” ABC News told CNN in a statement.Game Change was published in 2010, and two years later was turned into an HBO film starring Julianne Moore as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. The network said Thursday afternoon that it would no longer proceed with making a film about the 2016 presidential election based on a book written by Halperin and John Heilemann.CNN’s Darcy tweeted late Thursday that Penguin, the publisher of Halperin’s upcoming account of the 2016 election, the third Game Change book, had canceled plans to release it with his co-author, John Heilemann.The allegations are the latest in a string of sweeping news reports that have sent shock waves through the media industry, beginning with an Oct. 5 report in The New York Times that alleged film executive Harvey Weinstein had sexually harassed and assaulted women for decades. And Amazon Studios head Roy Price resigned earlier this month after a producer publicly accused him of sexual harassment.Read CNN’s full report here.This article has been updated with additional details and responses to the allegations.

The actresses went on the record to share their stories exclusively with Vanity Fair, though Blair was one of the women cited in a damning Los Angeles Times report, published Sunday, that detailed numerous accounts of alleged sexual harassment by Toback.More than 300 women in total have come forward to accuse Toback of misconduct. When contacted by HuffPost, Toback declined to comment. Blair initially spoke to LA Times journalist Glenn Whipp on the condition of anonymity, but after seeing Toback’s denial of the allegations, she told Vanity Fair she “felt rage and an obligation to speak publicly now.”The “Cruel Intentions” actress told Vanity Fair that in 1999, her representatives arranged for her to meet with Toback. The director wanted to meet in his hotel room. Blair said she insisted they meet at the hotel restaurant, but was told by the hostess when she arrived that Toback would not be coming down.The actress went up to his hotel room. After they were together for about 40 minutes, Blair said Toback asked her to take her clothes off and read a monologue naked. “I told him I was uncomfortable,” she said. “But he continued to coax me—saying that this was in no way a come-on. This was part of training. He wanted to make me a good actress. He wanted to make me comfortable. I thought, ‘Well, my representation sent me to see him. He must be really important.’” Blair said that she complied with Toback’s requests, despite her discomfort, and admitted she felt ashamed. At one point, Blair claimed, Toback began rubbing his penis through his pants before asking her, “Would you f**k me?” The actress said she refused, but Toback wouldn’t let her leave, blocking the door and telling her she couldn’t go until he ejaculated. “I tried to look away, but he would hold my face,” she said. “So I was forced to look into his eyes. And I felt disgust and shame, and like nobody would ever think of me as being clean again after being this close to the devil. His energy was so sinister.” When Toback was done, Blair said he left her with a warning, implying that if she ever spoke out about the incident he could have her kidnapped or killed. McAdams’ story echoed Blair’s. Like the “Hellboy” actress, McAdams met Toback in his hotel room under the impression the two would be talking about a role in “Harvard Man.” She was 21 at the time. “The Notebook” star recalled meeting Toback the day before her first TV job. When she asked if the meeting could be some other time, Toback insisted it had to be that night. When McAdams arrived, she said Toback had books and magazines arranged on the floor, where he asked her to sit.“Pretty quickly the conversation turned quite sexual and he said, ‘You know, I just have to tell you. I have masturbated countless times today thinking about you since we met at your audition,’” she said.The Canadian star said Toback “started that kind of manipulative talk,” asking her questions in an attempt to “build some intimacy.” At one point, McAdams said, Toback went to the bathroom. When he returned, he said he masturbated thinking about her and asked for the actress to show him her pubic hair. McAdams said she eventually excused herself, adding that the incident “has been such a source of shame” for her. When she called her agent to inform her about the misconduct, she said her agent apologized and admitted another client had shared a similar story. Naturally, McAdams was upset.“I felt like I was kind of thrown into the lion’s den and given no warning that he was a predator,” she said. Both Blair and McAdams told the outlet that they want to help bring public attention to the epidemic of sexual harassment in Hollywood. “I want to light the pyre of public opinion,” Blair said. “You have to get it all out in the open and in the light so that we can really understand how pervasive this is,” McAdams said. “I think we almost have to exhaust ourselves sharing our experiences before the rebuilding can begin. And hopefully we never slip back into this darkness again.”"

Why Capitalism Is Broken.",Jo Confino,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/environmental-destruction-inequality-and-loneliness-why-capitalism-is-broken_us_59f18db7e4b0438859153e69,Albert Einstein's scribbled note on happiness is wisdom worth remembering.,2017-10-26,"Gal Wiener, owner and manager of the Winner's auction house in Jerusalem, displays two notes written by Albert Einstein",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f1ca7f150000b54474785a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When everything seems to be changing, it becomes increasingly important to know what endures.A timely reminder of this has come this week thanks to the auction in Israel of a small note that the physicist Albert Einstein gave to a Japanese courier in 1922.“A quiet and modest life brings more joy than a pursuit of success bound with constant unrest,” the note written on Imperial Hotel Tokyo stationery reads. The note comes to light as more people are starting to reevaluate what success actually means and the purpose behind their increasingly fast-moving and complex lives.Einstein’s scribbled message also aligns with a growing “new economy” movement that points out that our current form of capitalism, which puts the pursuit of success and profit as top priorities, is not only leading to unprecedented environmental destruction but is also increasing social inequality.That inequality is one reason why people do not appear to be happier despite an expanding economy.In a study of 16 developed countries, Selin Kesebir, assistant professor of Organisational Behaviour at London Business School, found that when income inequality is high, an increase in gross domestic product per capita was “virtually unrelated to life satisfaction.”Writing in the Harvard Business Review, she concluded that “what we can say for sure is that it’s a fallacy to equate GDP with well-being. It’s not a foregone conclusion that growing the economy will make for a happier people.”She also points to the data which shows that despite the post-war economic boom in America between 1946 and 1970, surveys showed no improvement in happiness.That remains true today, with a United Nations World Happiness Study released in March 2017 showing that while the U.S. ranked third for happiness among the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2007, it had fallen to 19th by 2016. That’s not surprising when you see that the U.S. is facing an unprecedented opioid addiction crisis, while research presented at the American Psychological Association convention in August showed that loneliness and social isolation may represent a greater public health hazard than obesity and is getting worse.Meanwhile, new analysis unveiled earlier this year showed that Americans are experiencing mental health problems in record numbers.Some economists, such as the U.K.’s Kate Raworth and Tim Jackson, are calling for a complete rethink in the way we measure success, moving away from an obsession with GDP growth towards broader measures of wellness that include data on happiness and social stability.Spiritual leaders are also recommending a fundamental change in the way success is measured and point out that our desires for success tend to lead only to suffering. Pope Francis has issued several scathing critiques of the current capitalist system.“Let us not be afraid to say it: we want change, real change, structural change,” the pope said, during a speech in Bolivia in 2015. He added that the capitalist system “has imposed the mentality of profit at any price, with no concern for social exclusion or the destruction of nature.” This system is by now intolerable: farm workers find it intolerable, laborers find it intolerable, communities find it intolerable, peoples find it intolerable. The earth itself – our sister, Mother Earth, as Saint Francis would say – also finds it intolerable.Zen Buddhist Master Thich Nhat Hanh also echoes Einstein’s words of wisdom. “If you have a healthy desire, such as a wish to protect life, or protect the environment, or live a simple life with time to take care of yourself and your beloved ones, your desire will bring you to happiness,” he writes in his 2001 book “Calming the Fearful Mind.” “If you run after power, wealth, sex and fame, thinking that they will bring you happiness, you are consuming a very dangerous type of food and it will bring you a lot of suffering. You can see this is true just by looking around you,” he added.Nhat Hanh recounted speaking with a business leader running a global company with more than 300,000 employees.“He shared that people who are very rich are often extremely lonely because they are suspicious of others,” he wrote. “They think anyone who approaches them in friendship only does so because of their money and only wants to take advantage of them. They feel they do not have any real friends.”The corporate world is starting to wake up to Einstein’s idea that a focus only on the pursuit of success can lead to constant unrest.The World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which represents more than 200 of the world’s largest corporations, has been carrying out research into what it terms the “The Good Life.” Its recommendations very much fit into Einstein’s note. Julian Hill-Landolt, the council’s director of Sustainable Lifestyles, calls on brands to “rethink the picture of the world that they paint through their advertising. We’re not asking them to stop selling their products, we’re just asking them to stop selling their products in a world that is all about bigger, faster, and more.” “The [Good Life] Playbook shows how people are already taking pleasure from a different type of world, one where time with friends and family, health and good food are all luxuries to aspire to,” he said. “At the end of the day, this isn’t rocket science. We’re suggesting that forward-looking brands should check the structural integrity of their messaging.”It can sometimes seem an impossible task for those that are seeking to transform the capitalist system, and help move away from the mantra of short-termism and profit maximization.But for those who may start to lose hope that it is possible to create an economic system that generates prosperity for all within environmental limits, Einstein has another piece of wisdom that is worth remembering.He wrote another short note to the Japanese courier in gratitude for delivering a message to him, which also sold at the same auction. It’s message: “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”For more content and to be part of the community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s This New World series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

But it’s hard not to think about what jokes Rivers would pull out of her archives in the current political and social climate we’re living in. In an interview with HuffPost on Build Series, Joan’s daughter Melissa Rivers ― who recently released a scrapbook of sorts on her famous mom titled Joan Rivers Confidential ― admitted that the writer and host would probably be having a field day in 2017. “I think she would be absolutely thrilled about the scope of material at her fingertips,” Melissa said. “I think that’s the only sort of politically correct way to say this, like, whoa, there’s a lot to talk about. In every sector of life. For comedians right now it’s a little bit like fish in a barrel. It’s like, ‘It’s Christmas every day!’”Melissa is pretty sure that just like late-night hosts Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers, Joan would be itching to get in the game. ″[The late-night shows] write themselves,” the author said. “And now we’re all so jaded. I don’t know about any of you, but I watch the news and go, ’Oh, they’re going to be doing that. This one is going to be talking about this. They’ll be doing that on “Saturday Night Live.″′ And you wait to see if you’re right.”Though many of us miss Joan’s over-the-top, at-times crass humor, we’ll be able to get a little slice of nostalgia when “Fashion Police” airs its final episode on Nov. 27. The E! show is ending after a lackluster few years sans Joan. “We have unearthed a few shows that, for different reasons, didn’t necessarily make air, whether it was because there was like a big emergency and everyone dubbed all the programming or whatever it was. So we have some never-before-seen footage ― some maybe because of the language at the time, 20 years ago. But yeah, I don’t think that’s the last of that kind of television show you’ve seen from me,” Melissa said. “Um, 22 years is a pretty good run,” she added, saying the end will be “very bittersweet, very sad, it’ll be a very hard day for me.”“But, I’m so proud of it as a part of my legacy, that and the red carpets, and it’s been part of my mom’s legacy and my mom’s life.” Joan Rivers Confidential is out now.

The most notable record was set at the Camarillo Airport in Ventura County, where a high of 103 degrees broke the previous record, 88 set in 1983, by a jaw-dropping 15 degrees. Heat waves typically break temperature records by only as much as a few degrees. A June 2016 heat wave that struck Southern California, for example, broke several records by single digits. The one double-digit margin was set in El Cajon, where temperatures for that calendar day toppled the previous record by 10 degrees. Even during a 2015 heat wave in the region with back-to-back days of temperatures surpassing 100 degrees, the heat broke records by small margins. Other heat records set Wednesday include Oxnard, where 102-degree temperatures beat out the old record by 8 degrees, and Los Angeles International Airport, where 99-degree heat toppled the 1983 record of 92.More heat records were set at Santa Maria Public Airport, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, Long Beach Airport and downtown Los Angeles.The ongoing heat sparked several brush fires on Tuesday, requiring closures on three freeways. Later Tuesday, hot wind gusts complicated firefighters’ efforts to contain a growing wildfire in the hills about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles.Scientists have long warned that these types of heat waves will become the new normal.“If we continue with business-as-usual burning of fossil fuels, and warm the planet by [3 degrees Celsius] by the end of this century, then what we today call ‘extreme heat’ we will instead call ‘midsummer,’” Michael Mann, a leading climate scientist and professor of meteorology at Penn State University, told HuffPost during a heat wave plaguing the Midwest and Northeast last summer.

Here comes the misleading ideological hypocrisy. For months there has been speculation",2017-10-25,"Christopher Steele, the former MI6 agent who set-up Orbis Business Intelligence and compiled a dossier on Donald Trump, in London.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f0cd7e140000610d8c9ad2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Start your political engines, folks. Here comes the misleading ideological hypocrisy.For months there has been speculation about who paid Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research that ultimately resulted in the creation of the now-infamous “Steele Dossier.” Late-night media reports Tuesday by The Washington Post and Politico confirmed what many have suspected from the beginning, namely that funding was derived in some fashion (at least after the Republican primaries had concluded) from the Clinton presidential campaign. Specifically, Marc Elias, a lawyer who was representing both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, provided the funding (through his law firm) to Fusion GPS that enabled Christopher Steele to continue the opposition research into President Donald Trump that had originally been funded by a Republican donor.It’s a bombshell! The real story is Clinton campaign collusion with a former British spy who used foreign intelligence source to dig up dirt on Donald Trump, and how some of that information was later used by the FBI against Donald Trump’s associates, right? That’s what the president’s supporters have been screaming, after all.Not so fast.Unlike the Trump campaign’s June 2016 meeting to secure what had been promised as opposition research on Hillary Clinton by way of the Russian government itself, the Steele Dossier has always reflected something more akin to traditional opposition research gathered through private means. It was a privately-funded effort, by way of a private research firm relying upon work by a private subcontractor, gathering raw and unverified intelligence from various sources on a political candidate. Per the media reports from last night confirming the new details about Marc Elias’ involvement, neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC played any role in directing or guiding Mr. Steele’s research. Indeed, in the wake of the new reports, former Clinton campaign press spokesperson Brian Fallon stated he was not even aware of Mr. Steele or his research until after the election. The Steele Dossier itself was not made public by the Clinton campaign or the DNC; it was ultimately released independently by Buzzfeed after the election.Nor are past media reports indicating the FBI has relied in some fashion upon the Steele Dossier in the context of its “Russian collusion” investigation somehow impacted by the fact that part of the funding for the dossier came from the Clinton campaign’s lawyer. The Steele Dossier itself is not something that the FBI (or any law enforcement agency) could merely rely upon by itself as the basis to secure search warrants or authorization to conduct surveillance; the document would be rejected by a judge as inadmissible hearsay if submitted as part of an application for a warrant.The Steele Dossier on its own could serve no value to the FBI beyond acting as a starting point for possible investigative leads which the Bureau might pursue in the context of the already-ongoing Russian collusion investigation. So if media reports are accurate, and for example the FBI did secure authorization for a FISA warrant against a Trump associate like Carter Page or Paul Manafort relying in part upon information from the Steele Dossier, it means the Bureau was able to sufficiently and independently corroborate – with its own documented sources and evidence, and its own subsequent analysis – at least parts of the Steele Dossier for the purpose of persuading a federal judge that there was probable cause to conclude either of those former Trump associates were agents of a foreign power. The information provided to the Federal judge by way of an affidavit from the FBI would document its investigation, its sources, and its evidence to justify the probable cause determination; it would not be pointing to the Steele Dossier as its evidentiary source. Needless to say, if that is the case the fact that the original raw intelligence was funded by way of the Clinton campaign appears to be the least interesting part of this story.To be completely fair and impartial, there is a measure of shadiness at play here by Clinton associates. Assuming Mr. Elias did not simply “go rogue,” he presumably had authorization from certain individuals in the Clinton campaign and the DNC to provide replacement funding to Fusion GPS to allow Mr. Steele to continue his work. That work necessarily entailed cultivating questionable and salacious information from international sources, some of which plausibly would be foreign government officials, about President Trump’s activities (personal or business) overseas. Completely traditional opposition research this was not.President Trump, however, was not a traditional presidential candidate, something he made a point of repeating on the campaign trail and that he has continued to espouse now as the president of the United States. Does this new reporting suggest the need for further scrutiny? Absolutely, including the question of why Mr. Elias was denying his involvement for so long. Does it mean that the real story of the 2016 campaign is Clinton campaign “collusion” with Mr. Steele and the FBI?Not a chance."

Customers can create temporary passcodes for friends and other services professionals to enter as well.The move, in the works for more than a year, may help Amazon capture sales from shoppers who could not make it home to receive an order in person, and did not want the package stolen from their doorstep. It also signals Amazon’s ambitions in the growing market for home security devices, where Alphabet Inc’s  Nest Labs competes.“This is not an experiment for us,” said Peter Larsen, Amazon vice president of delivery technology, in an interview. “This is a core part of the Amazon shopping experience from this point forward.”Members of Amazon’s Prime shopping club can pay $249.99 and up for a cloud-controlled camera and lock that the company offers to install. Delivery associates are told to ring a doorbell or knock when they arrive at someone’s house.

For example, he also likened Trump to a clown on Tuesday when posting about The New Yorker’s new cover.Takei’s latest post was well received on Twitter, although some fans did suggest he “think of the kids” and go with an alternative costume."

For Thomas Awiapo, it was the gift that saved his life. Thomas was orphaned at age 10 in the African nation of Ghana, where poverty is high. Thomas and his siblings, left on their own, struggled with hunger. He remembers well the pain of going to bed every night on an empty stomach. Two of his siblings perished from the terrible hunger they experienced.Thomas had no future until he stumbled upon a school Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had built. There he got food, a snack and a hot lunch. Thomas would come for the meals and then plan how to escape school. He had no interest in learning but he always came back to the school because of the food which was saving his life. Thomas says CRS tricked him into coming to school with the food. Eventually Thomas became not only well fed but also well educated. Now Thomas has a master’s degree and works closely with Catholic Relief Services in Ghana, helping others overcome poverty. He gives presentations on the power of school meals, which he said was the greatest gift he ever received. The food at school broke the cycle of poverty he was destined for. That is why Thomas was in Washington DC recently talking to members of Congress about supporting the McGovern-Dole international school meals program. The McGovern-Dole initiative, run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, funds school meals overseas through charities like Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, Mercy Corps, and the World Food Programme. The plan was named after former senators George McGovern and Bob Dole. These two WWII veterans were very influenced by the scenes of hunger they witnessed in Europe. They both dedicated their careers to fighting hunger at home and abroad. Both McGovern and Dole carried on the Spirit of the Marshall Plan which rebuilt Europe after World War II. Before the Marshall Plan even took place school meals were being provided by the United States in many countries including Germany and Japan.The U.S. Interim Aid program to Europe in 1947, along with the Lira Fund, provided over one million children in Italy with school meals. School meals mattered for the war-torn countries as they do today for nations in peril. In conflict-torn Mali, Catholic Relief Services feeds around 72,000 children school meals with McGovern-Dole funding. Recent interviews have also documented the importance of McGovern-Dole schools meals in Haiti, Laos, Guatemala and Sierra Leone. In drought-affected Ethiopia, UN World Food Program spokesperson Leighla Bowers says around 272,000 children are receiving school meals thanks to McGovern-Dole funding. There are many other areas in need that could benefit from McGovern-Dole funding if the program were expanded. The civil war in Syria has left children hungry and displaced. The World Food Programme (WFP) has school feeding for at least half a million Syrian school children, and hopefully more with enough funding. The WFP program includes food, milk and sometimes fresh fruits and vegetables. This nutrition can help save Syrian children who may be left stunted by hunger. We need to help WFP, Catholic Relief Services and others proving school meals abroad. We can do so by funding and expanding McGovern-Dole to build a global school lunch program. We can do so country by country like in Haiti where McGovern-Dole is helping WFP provide school meals. We must keep up this support until Haiti reaches its goal of a national school lunch program. WFP had plans to develop a national school lunch program in Yemen, which is now mired in civil war. Whatever peace plan hopefully emerges there should include school meals. Increasing funding for McGovern-Dole will not be easy. The Trump administration already proposed eliminating the program in its first budget proposal. Congress will likely not go along with such a drastic and tragic cut. What the public can do is encourage Congress to increase funding for McGovern-Dole. In a normal year McGovern-Dole might get 200 million in funding, which is relatively a very tiny part of the federal budget. Why not increase this amount to 300 million in funding for the next fiscal year so to provide more school meals abroad. With the Farm Bill upcoming, McGovern-Dole funding could be increased in that legislation as well. Thomas Awiapo says that one act of kindness, a simple school meal, saved his life. It was liberation from his suffering as he described it. We can liberate children from hunger and give them a chance to succeed. That is the power of school meals and why every child should receive this precious gift. "

59,POLITICS,GOP Candidate Attacks Democrats Over Voting Rights Progress His Party Has Supported,Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voting-rights-restoration-virginia_us_59f0e9cce4b07d838d31be73,"His opponent said he should be ""ashamed.""",2017-10-25,An ad from Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie accuses Democrats in the state of jeopardizing public safety by restoring voting rights to former felons.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f0ed1b180000051bdfc44a.jpeg?cache=kjt0Rg8ZFn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Voting rights are at the center of a new and nasty attack from the GOP gubernatorial candidate in Virginia.Ed Gillespie is accusing Democrats in the state of jeopardizing public safety by restoring voting rights to former felons who have completed their sentences, a claim the state’s governor says is outrageous.Virginia strips felons of their voting rights, but they can be restored by the governor. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) has restored the voting rights of more than 168,000 former felons, a number he says is a record high. He’s restored all of them individually after the state’s Supreme Court ruled in 2016 he could not do so with a blanket order.A new ad from Gillespie accuses McAuliffe and Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, the Democratic nominee for governor, of putting public safety at risk by enfranchising Virginians.“Last year, Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam instituted the automatic restoration of rights for violent felons and sex offenders, making it easier for them to obtain firearms and allowing them to serve on juries,” the ad says. It also singles out the case of a man who it says had his rights restored after being found with one of the largest child pornography collections in Virginia’s history. (The man actually lost his voting rights again after pleading guilty to possession of child pornography and is serving 15 years in prison, according to The Washington Post.)Former felons in Virginia have to apply to McAuliffe to have their rights restored and are only considered eligible if they have completed all of their sentencing, including parole. McAuliffe’s new process for restoring voting rights does eliminate a step for former felons to regain their gun rights.The ad marks an attack on an issue some Virginia Republicans have supported in the past, though Gillespie appears to be steadfast in his view. In 2013, then-Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) took executive action to automatically restore the rights of nonviolent felons. That same year, then-Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R), McAuliffe’s opponent in the governor’s race, was open to the idea after long opposing it.McAuliffe called Gillespie’s ad the “lowest point yet” in his campaign.“When our administration began the process of restoring the rights of thousands of former felons who had served their time and returned to their communities, we recognized that we were confronting an historic injustice intended to suppress African American voices,” McAuliffe wrote in a HuffPost opinion piece. “We also knew that many forces, such as those that led Ed Gillespie to run his latest ad, would oppose our actions vigorously.”David Turner, a Northam spokesman, accused Gillespie of lying in the ad and said he should be “ashamed.”Tammie Hagen, a community organizer with New Virginia Majority, a group that works to restore felons’ rights, said allowing people to vote does not pose a safety threat. Hagen had her voting rights restored last year.“I’m appalled by the antiquated mentality that seeks to permanently demonize people and withhold the ballot from us. I am a mother, a daughter, a friend, a taxpayer and a neighbor,” she said in a statement. “To claim that I shouldn’t be able to have a say in who I want on my grandchildren’s school board or who I want in office making decisions on my health care is ludicrous and has no bearing on the safety of my community.”The ad also highlights the high stakes for voting advocates in the governor’s race, which is being watched nationally. While McAuliffe has restored more voting rights than any other governor, he has done it through executive orders, meaning the progress could be quickly undone by an administration hostile to voting rights. Nationally, 6.1 million Americans are disenfranchised because of a felony conviction, according to The Sentencing Project, including 1 in 5 African Americans in Virginia.“Right now, the state of felony re-enfranchisement lies in the hands of the governor,” Tram Nguyen, co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, told ThinkProgress. “The entire rights restoration process is on the line with this November election.”Judith Browne Dianis, the executive director of the national office of Advancement Project, said the effort to restrict the vote in Virginia grew out of racism.“The right to vote is sacred, and pitting people’s fears against access to democracy is reprehensible,” she said in a statement. “In Virginia, the zeal to restrict the vote is linked inextricably to the state’s Jim Crow heritage, and attempts to demonize the right to vote must be condemned in the strongest of terms.”"

Had I not been so focused on helping my company “win in the marketplace” and “enhance shareholder value,” had health insurance companies been held more accountable by lawmakers, the media and the public, Nataline, who died at the age of 17 nine years and 310 days ago, might have received the liver transplant she needed.I know about Nataline because of the role I played in her struggle to live—I was writing talking points to try to justify a colleague’s decision to deny coverage for the surgery her doctors were pleading for—but there are an untold number of other Americans who are no longer with us because big corporations, in their unrelenting goal to meet Wall Street’s profit expectations, put profits before the needs of the rest of us. Nothing I can ever do will bring Nataline back, but I can do something to help others who find out, often when it’s too late as it was in her case, just how powerless they’ve become. I can use my knowledge of how profit-obsessed special interests, whether in health care or any number of other big businesses, have rigged the system in their favor. That’s why I’m starting Tarbell.org, a new reader-funded investigative journalism nonprofit with the mission of holding corporations and other moneyed interests more accountable. Our goal is to help average Americans take back their power and drive needed change. We want average Americans to own us and hold us accountable, which is why Tarbell.org will be reader-funded. We're seeking to raise awareness and support among thousands of Americans passionate about changing the state of journalism and the political status quo. Tarbell.org will do more than investigate wrong-doing. We’ll explain how and why the wrong-doers get away with it, and we’ll connect the dots to show readers how political corruption financed by moneyed interests affects their lives. We’ll also go the additional and essential mile of spotlighting solutions and helping our community of readers figure out how they can make a difference. You can learn more about how we're different at Tarbell.org.The problem with the media today is not fake news. The problem is that we don’t get enough of the news we really need. I used to be a reporter in Washington and in Tennessee where I grew up. After my newspaper days, like a lot of reporters, I left journalism to go into PR. I rose up through the ranks to become head of corporate communications for two of the country’s biggest health insurance companies. I was their chief spokesman.At first, reporters from all over the country called with challenging questions about my employers’ business practices. By the time I left after Nataline’s death—I didn’t have it in me to handle any more of what we called “high-profile cases”—the only reporters still calling were writing stories about whether my company and other big corporations were meeting investors’ profit expectations. Many of the reporters who once called had lost their jobs. When I was a reporter, there were about as many journalists as PR people. Over the past few years, we’ve lost 60,000 journalism jobs. That has happened as media ownership has become concentrated in the hands of just six large investor-owned companies. One reason so many reporters have lost their jobs is that investigative reporting is expensive. The investors who own so much of today’s media don’t want to pay for it or risk offending advertisers. So many former reporters have gone in to PR that there are now five PR people for every journalist, and many of those former reporters are now churning out propaganda for their companies and their lobbyists. And the reporters still on the job either don’t have the time or the interest to dig into how business practices put in place to ensure an expected profit margin affect the lives of everyday Americans. When I quit my corporate job, I felt an obligation to try to make amends. I blew the whistle on my industry, in part because reporters were not covering the health care business like they once did. Alex S. Jones, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and fellow Tennessee native, wrote a few years ago that we are losing the “iron core” of journalism. With diminished media scrutiny, the moneyed interests have taken over our government. They have systematically stolen our power to the point that they now call the shots, not just in Washington but in our towns and cities and our state capitals. Yes, we still have some good reporting, and some of the best of it is being done by reporters at the Huffington Post. But we don’t have nearly enough of the pull-no-punches reporting that holds corporations and other moneyed interests to account. The watchdog press that once exposed corporate misbehavior, that investigated ongoing attempts by the rich and powerful to rig the system in their favor, has been neutered. What has happened as the iron-core of journalism has weakened is the emergence of largely unchecked corporate power and a flood of special interest money to influence elections and public policy. The wealthy and connected spent more than $3 billion dollars on more than 10,000 lobbyists in Washington last year. That’s more than what it costs to run Congress. Despite what they say, the people you vote for don’t care as much about you as they care about a handful of people who can write much bigger campaign checks than you can write. They can’t because of the way the system has been rigged by moneyed interests. The people politicians really serve these days run big corporations like the ones I used to work for or for the pharmaceutical industry, big hospital chains and organizations like the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association. And like the fossil fuel and chemical industries and the National Rifle Association. The list is long. Those companies and organizations have much deeper pockets than you or I do. With very few exceptions, whatever they want, they get, regardless of what’s best for you and our country.It is not hyperbole to say that the weakening of the iron core of journalism has enabled a new age of robber barons to emerge. We are living in an age that is strikingly similar to the early 20th century, when our namesake, Ida Tarbell, set her sights on the biggest corporate monopoly of her day. Her reporting led to the breakup of that company and to important antitrust and campaign finance reforms. Tarbell.org will pick up her mantle.Tarbell.org will name names and show you who’s writing the big checks that make your life so damn hard these days. We’ll explain what’s in it for the check writers and reveal which politicians are on the take. We’ll show how this legalized corruption results in growing income inequality and a divided nation.Tarbell.org is based in Philadelphia, where our republic began. We’re determined to help preserve what our nation’s founders risked their lives to create. They believed that government was for the common good, not for the “profit, honor or private interest of any one man, family, or class of man.” They understood that the greatest threat to the American experiment, the American dream, would be a drift toward oligarchy, which they knew could happen without a free, independent and bold Fourth Estate.

But Republicans still haven’t settled many of the details in their tax proposal, even as they vote to increase the debt by $1.5 trillion.The House is tentatively scheduled to vote Thursday on the Senate’s budget proposal, which is needed as a legislative vehicle to carry out tax reform by reconciliation ― a process that allows the Senate to pass a bill by a simple majority. Yet the tax proposal remains in a paradoxical state: simultaneously written and unwritten. Republicans have a framework, they apparently have legislative text, but they’ve left some major decisions undecided.“We’ve been writing for the past year on this,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told HuffPost on Tuesday, while noting that Republicans are still making “adjustments.”The tax bill clearly has some momentum right now, after the Senate approved its budget and House conservatives agreed to simply take the Senate language instead of trying to conference differences between the House and Senate. (While the House budget was revenue-neutral, the Senate budget allows lawmakers to add $1.5 trillion more in debt ― technically, it recommends that the national debt rise to $26 trillion over the next 10 years.)One conservative lawmaker told HuffPost that members of the Freedom Caucus cut a deal with leadership, exchanging their votes on the budget to speed up the tax bill’s release by “at least two weeks, possibly three weeks” so it will have a better chance.Brady told reporters on Tuesday that the plan is for the Ways and Means Committee to release the tax legislation next week, with a committee markup soon to follow.But as of Wednesday morning, Republican leaders were still whipping votes for the budget, telling members they don’t yet have enough support for this first step. While leaders haven’t quite gotten desperate, there are some lawmakers who want assurances on the tax bill before they vote for the budget ― and it’s unclear if leadership can really give members those assurances.The biggest issue right now is the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. The initial framework for the legislation called for the complete elimination of the write-off, which lets individuals deduct the cost of their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. The Tax Policy Center says the elimination of the SALT deduction would raise $1.3 trillion over 10 years, mostly by charging well-off people from highly taxed areas more.That hasn’t sat well with a lot of Republicans from states like New Jersey, New York and California. In the Senate, lawmakers took the House-passed budget and adopted an amendment from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) that explicitly calls for reductions that “may include” the state and local tax deduction, calling it a write-off that “disproportionately favors high-income individuals.”Without any deal from leaders that the House tax bill will scale back some of those cuts, Republicans from some states most affected by them are taking a hard-line stance.“I haven’t seen anything positive at all. They keep saying they’re going to take care of it. Well, the vote is tomorrow,” Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) said of eliminating the SALT deduction.King was one of two New York Republicans to vote against the initial House budget over SALT concerns, and now he’s trying to encourage other members of the delegation and affected states to vote down this budget. “To me, the only way to stop it is to stop the budget. Once that passes, that train is going down the track,” King said Wednesday, adding that there has only been general talk of a fix, but nothing specific.“Each member has their own interest, and that’s all I’ll say,” King added. “But if we stood together, we could definitely stop this.”The problem for King is that members from these states are split. Not all districts are affected the same way, and some members want tax reform more than others. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) ― the first member to endorse Donald Trump ― told HuffPost on Wednesday that he was voting for the budget regardless. “I’m just being honest. It’s too important for me. I don’t play games,” he said.Members had a meeting with leadership on Tuesday afternoon, expecting to gain at least some idea of how they’d scale back the cuts, but lawmakers left without a solution. “We’re not there yet,” Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) told reporters.“New Jersey has to be made right, or I can’t support it,” MacArthur said. “I think that’s the issue for those of us that are in the donor states, the states that are subsidizing everyone else. We’re being asked to subsidize even more. Can’t do it.”MacArthur voted for the initial House budget, but as the tax bill and the elimination of the SALT deduction get realer, his vote now seems somewhat in doubt. And this is exactly the situation that may play out with dozens of other members who have plenty of different concerns. It’s easy to theoretically support cutting taxes ― especially when you falsely believe that tax cuts pay for themselves ― but once Republicans see the actual text, things could get dicey. As freshman Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said this week, the tax bill, at this point, is just a “political Rorschach test.”“Everybody stares at the inkblot and sees what they want to see, because we don’t have a bill,” he said.Gaetz added that Republicans were making fiscally irresponsible decisions by voting for this Senate budget, potentially financing tax cuts on future generations, and said it was frustrating to be asked to vote for a budget “that nobody believes in so that we have a chance to vote for a tax bill that nobody’s read.”“You know, I was watching ‘Indiana Jones’ the other night, and I sort of feel like this tax bill is like the ark of the covenant,” Gaetz continued. “It must be so magnificent that if we actually laid our eyes on it, it would eviscerate all of us. It would lay waste to nations.”The truth appears to be that GOP leaders just don’t want the bill to hang out there for very long before lawmakers vote on it. Republicans do have a number of decisions to make: whether to eliminate the SALT deduction, whether the estate tax will be fully gone, whether businesses can expense the cost of investments to reduce their tax bills, whether and at what rate there will be a fourth top tax rate, the income levels of their tax brackets, how they’ll treat charitable giving, whether there will be changes to 401(k) and other retirement accounts, how they’ll prevent people from gaming the rates just to get the pass-through rate of 25 percent, which corporate loopholes they’re closing, how much the child tax credit will be ― and many, many more issues.As House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Wednesday, Republicans are entering “Class V rapids.” And the House vote is just the beginning of the GOP’s problems. In the House, lawmakers don’t necessarily need to abide by the reconciliation instruction that only allows them to add $1.5 trillion in extra debt. Republicans could kick some of the hardest revenue-raising decisions to the Senate and pass a bill that adds significantly more debt, arguing that they’ll make up the extra money with increased economic growth.“It’s a matter of faith to them that cutting taxes improves the economy,” the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) told HuffPost. “But there’s no evidence for that.”Yarmuth said this budget and the coming tax bill would just show the true priorities of Republicans. “Their real priorities are really not to balance the budget or reduce the debt. They’re to lower taxes on the wealthiest people in the country,” he said.But that may be the one saving grace for this bill. If Republicans were really interested in a tax reform that reduced debt, it’s difficult to believe they’d agree to a budget that allows them to increase debt ― their argument that increased economic growth will pay for the cuts notwithstanding ― because looking into the history of tax cuts, it’s clear that cuts don’t pay for themselves.Even as Republicans argue that their tax bill will pay for itself “in spades,” as Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) told HuffPost, they also say there should be a different debt consideration for tax cuts.“Sadly, it doesn’t seem in this town that people are very concerned about the debt or the deficit anymore. I still care about it,” Blum said. “But first of all, I want people to keep more of their money.”"

Between her animatedly telling me her source for lash extensions and efficiently taking my blood pressure, she asked me a list of routine questions in a monotone voice.Did I have any specific health concerns?Did I drink or do drugs?Was I being threatened or hurt at home?That last question stopped me, because I’ve been thinking a lot about domestic violence aka intimate partner violence (IPV) and the devastation it leaves in its wake. Frankly, I was surprised that she was asking, and I wondered if anyone actually ever answered yes to her question – a question that would expose someone’s most vulnerable spot. I imagined she might have better luck if the patient were wrapped in a blanket, held close, and asked in a gentle voice, “Is anyone hurting you at home?” How many people might say yes?Domestic violence is a hidden issue within the LGBTQ+ community. According to the CDC’s 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey released again with new analysis in 2013, 44 percent of lesbian women, 61 percent of bisexual women, 26 percent of gay men, and 37 percent of bisexual men experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime. According to The Williams Institute, 31-50 percent of transgender people experience intimate partner violence. Abusive queer partners are driven by the same desire for control as heterosexual abusers and use the same weapons of physical, sexual, emotional, verbal, and financial abuse, but have the added arsenal of societal discrimination and often threaten to out partners to employers, family members, etc. Additionally, it’s a mistake to assume that only masculine presenting partners are the perpetrators in LGBTQ+ relationships; gender, size, and presentation have no bearing on who the aggressor might be.When outside of a situation, it’s easy for a random person to shake their head and say, “Why do they stay?” Even people experiencing abuse sometimes have a hard time explaining why they stay. But there are a number of documented psychological processes at play that create an emotional trap that makes it hard to admit or accept what is happening, much less get the wherewithal to leave – and the emotional ties that bond are formidable.Lance, a gender queer Asian butch in a lesbian relationship, didn’t realize that she was the victim of gaslighting, a systematic emotional deconstruction of the victim’s reality that tips the locus of control into the abuser’s hands, and causes a dangerous power imbalance. Many times, it’s hard for the victim to see what is happening, because it’s a progressive process that often starts with excessive praise and affection, aka “love bombing,” and eventually degenerates into a strategic campaign of undercutting another person’s grasp on reality, turning random occurrences into crises that can be blamed on the victim. The perpetrator often offers justifications for their abusive behavior that further destabilize the victim’s perceptions and reinforces the cycle of violence. Lance shared her light bulb moment when she was finally able to see that something was terribly wrong, and that it wasn’t her fault.We were sitting in a restaurant and I saw someone I hadn’t seen in a decade. I was excited to reconnect. When I brought him over to the table to meet my new wife, she was mean. She told me I was wrong for talking to him, because he knew me when I was married to my ex-wife. She was outraged and made a scene in the restaurant. I think it was seeing myself and her through his eyes. He knew me to be a strong, confident, loving partner. Here I was being berated in public for something that could not possibly be in any way deserved.The back and forth shift between love bombing and denigration is what causes a process called intermittent reinforcement. Initially the perpetrator may be charming and loving, and the victim innocently comes to expect that this behavior will continue. When the abuser withdraws the positive attention, the victim tries to behave in ways that will win back that love reward, and falls into a disempowered dynamic. It’s an emotional trap that is set incrementally so that the victim often doesn’t even see it developing, making it harder to extricate oneself.Further complicating the matter is a process called trauma bonding, where the intense experiences of either feeling extremely validated through love bombing or entirely denigrated through emotional abuse causes a bond to form that only deepens. Whether the experience is positive or negative, it is intense and the victim and perpetrator live through it together, causing a connection of shared lived experience that only the two of them know about. Rather than breaking the bond between them, it’s like a rope that ties the victim closer to the perpetrator. Much like Stockholm syndrome, where a kidnapping victim develops a psychological attachment to their captor, because they view them as their only means of survival, an abuse victim can become so deeply entrenched in the emotional control of their perpetrator that they develop a similar dependence and lack of self-determination and selfhood.It is exactly this either/or dichotomy that is so dangerous. If a victim believes their behavior can shift a perpetrating partner from abuse to love, then they are caught constantly trying to please them, not only for their safety, but because they have a tenuous grasp on reality because the gaslighting is so insidious and intense. Especially in the case of emotional abuse, the key to freedom is to break the dichotomy and accept that the perpetrating partner is both bad and good at the same time. They aren’t entirely bad and they aren’t entirely good, and there is no amount of good behavior from the victim that will shift an abuser to acting “good” all the time. When a victim can finally accept this reality, they can then begin the arduous road to freedom.If you suspect or know that you are in an abusive relationship, the first step is to tell someone you trust, whether it is a non-judgmental friend, a therapist, or spiritual leader. Sometimes seeing your experience through someone else’s eyes is what you need to see more clearly when your reality has been disrupted by an emotionally abusive partner. Be kind to yourself, and know that being a victim of abuse doesn’t make you a weak person; in fact, some perpetrators prefer to choose strong, successful people to prey on because they like the challenge.J.D. Glass, a survivor of intimate partner violence, is the author of Drawn Together and Red Light, novels that educate and cast light on the often hidden topic of abuse in the queer community. She told me,Probably the best advice I can give is, once you know you have to go, you have to plan and watch for the opportunity to find some way to secret a few dollars away somehow and plan an escape route. And on the day you know the moment has arrived, hide anything that can be used as a weapon, and maybe have a friend you can text with a code in case things go horribly awry, someone you know will either come help ASAP and/or call PD if necessary. It sucks, because it feels like lying, but it will save your life.Lance adds, “We are blessed with strong minds and bodies but as I learned, you can be strong and smart and still fall victim to abuse. Freedom is forgiving yourself.” Since leaving the abusive relationship Lance has again found her own gravity and is enjoying healthy intimate relations with others.Self-blame is useless in this journey to freedom, and self-love is everything. If you are or have been a victim of abuse, you are still wonderful, intelligent, creative, and strong and you can regain your life. You can shift from victim to survivor.

She figured there wasn’t much the authorities could do. She was right.When she met with police the following day at the now-shuttered Planned Parenthood clinic she headed in Odessa, Texas ― a deeply conservative city in the western part of the state ― they pretty much dismissed the incident. “Well, that’s the price you pay for doing what you’re doing,” Hildebrand said an officer told her in response to the disturbing threat from the previous night.“It was not a supportive environment,” she added.That was 23 years ago. Things have only gotten worse.But despite the death threats, animosity from the community and sweeping actions by lawmakers that have forced closures of Texas abortion clinics, including the Planned Parenthood location where she worked for 27 years, Hildebrand is staying put.Sure, she’s been tempted to move to more progressive areas of the U.S. where her sons live. But for now, she said she feels compelled to remain in Odessa, where she continues to fight for women’s health rights and support survivors of domestic abuse.“You can find your tribe anywhere you go ― your like-minded people,” Hildebrand said. “I have a good tribe to associate with.”Still, Hildebrand recognizes she faces challenges that are “pretty sizeable.”In 2011, state lawmakers cut family planning grants by 66 percent across Texas, which led to the closing of 82 family-planning clinics. That included Odessa’s Planned Parenthood, which shut down in 2012. The one based in Midland ― about 20 miles away ― closed in 2013.That same year, the state legislature passed anti-abortion legislation that ordered abortion clinics to meet hospital-like standards. That further reduced the number of Texas clinics to 19 from more than 40. Most of the closures were in rural and low-income areas.While parts of that law were overturned in court last year, there’s no timeline for when the shuttered clinics might reopen. Hildebrand now serves as executive director of Crisis Center of West Texas, an emergency shelter for domestic abuse victims. She also volunteers with Fund Texas Choice, a nonprofit that covers women’s costs associated with traveling to an abortion clinic. Hildebrand acknowledged that her fervently religious community would resist efforts to open another abortion clinic in the area.During her time at Planned Parenthood in Odessa, the physician who performed abortions wore a bulletproof vest. Protesters once put his face on “wanted” posters and plastered them all over town. As a safety measure, clinic employees never stayed late by themselves. In the 1990s, a Planned Parenthood construction contractor abandoned the job because of threats, stalling a remodeling project.Hildebrand was once called a “murdering Nazi” at a community meeting.Picketers would often record license plate numbers at the clinic, trace drivers’ addresses and send revealing information to patients’ homes or offices. In the worst cases, the harassment put patients’ lives at risk. One woman, who was with an abusive partner at the time, told Hildebrand her husband would’ve killed her if he’d been the one to find documents from the protesters.Hildebrand also saw hypocrisy in her dissenters.Some of the very same protesters who called for her demise also called on her for help when it was their daughters who needed an abortion, she said.“It was frustrating,” Hildebrand said of those moments. “But the basic right of that woman was what we had deep in our hearts, so that overrode any frustration we felt over the situation.”Even people who appreciated Hildebrand’s efforts were reluctant to openly support her.“There are such wonderful people here, even when I was at Planned Parenthood, who would whisper in my ear, ‘I support everything you do. I just can’t be vocal about it,’” Hildebrand said.Many would quietly write checks to the organization.These days, Hildebrand concentrates mostly on improving crisis center services for about 350 domestic abuse and sexual assault survivors each year. While the number of reported domestic violence cases in her area have declined in recent years, Hildebrand said the trend isn’t permanent. During oil boom times, workers camp out in tents because of limited housing, put in long hours, and drink to burn off steam. Assault rates inevitably go up, Hildebrand explained. The area is currently experiencing a bust.In 2015, there were 1,506 reported cases of family violence in Ector County ― where Odessa is located. That was down from 2,676 in 2013. Hildebrand’s current major project is a $5-million building campaign for a new emergency shelter for her organization. The present shelter is “hideous,” she said.The air conditioning system recently shut down. Pigeons had roosted on it, covering it in poop and feathers, which permeated the building with stink. The ovens aren’t safe to use. The building accommodates 30 residents, who sleep about four to a room and don’t have much space to store their belongings.“It’s not conducive to healing,” Hildebrand said.The new facility, slated to open in 2019, will have 17 bedrooms ― each with its own bathroom ― family rooms, kennels for pets and classrooms. The facility will be available to victims of physical violence, and those who’ve suffered emotional abuse, sexual assault, elder abuse or other issues.Though some members of the community were initially wary of Hildebrand taking on her current role because of her past involvement with Planned Parenthood, she said she’s experienced mostly support in her current position. Still, she’s unafraid to remind people she remains committed to her pro-abortion rights mission.Until recently, she had a bumper sticker on her car that read: “A world of wanted children would make a world of difference.” But someone used a key to scratch it off her vehicle. “Who could disagree?” she asked."

As part of a social experiment, Freeman is immersed into a Pakistani Muslim family in Manchester who lived just a few miles away from her own home. While the purpose was to start a conversation about Islamophobia, the documentary has been criticized for its methods. In order to go “undercover” in her neighborhood, Freeman’s skin was darkened, and she was given a prosthetic nose, fake teeth, and brown contact lenses. She also donned a long, flowing robe and covered her head with a scarf. The racist origins of blackface, brownface, and other costumes stemming from cultural appropriation are well documented. The impulse to assume another ethnic group’s features often results in exaggerated, inaccurate, and even harmful stereotypes. In this case, the apparent use of “brownface” had some critics appalled. Journalist Radhika Sanghani wrote in the Guardian that while highlighting the effects of Islamophobia is a worthy goal, showing a white woman “browning up” with a larger, wider nose and fake teeth is not the way to do it. “Instead of perpetuating old cliches and focusing on physical appearance, [the documentary] could have simply followed a Muslim family with cameras, hearing from the women themselves and observing the everyday racism they experience,” Sanghani wrote. “Women of colour are already under-represented in the media – why not give them a voice and hear from them directly?”In a parody of the documentary, British-Iraqi freelance writer Ruqaya Izzidien, flipped the roles around ― imagining what it would be like if a Muslim went “undercover” as a white man. “Channel 4′s My Week as a Muslim was a preposterous conception from the first minute, providing a platform for racism, brownface, crude caricatures, ethnocentrism and general all-round offence,” Izzidien wrote, summarizing her opinion of the show. “It was built on the antiquated, imperialist concept that a person of colour’s word cannot be trusted; their experiences and suffering don’t exist until they are verified by a white person.”The show’s producer, Fozia Khan, defended the decision in a Guardian op-ed, saying that Freeman’s appearances were changed to make her “look and feel different, so she could go unrecognised in her hometown, convincingly experience what it’s like to be a Muslim woman, integrate her into her host community and experience it from within.”″People have suggested that we could have used a different approach – such as giving Muslim women hidden cameras to show their experiences. This has been done before, and we wanted to try something different,” Khan wrote. Khan wrote that when Freeman started the documentary, she had negative opinions about Muslims. She reportedly felt fearful about women wearing the niqab. At one point in the documentary, she says, “You see them and you think, are they going to blow something up?” But over the course of the filming, as she has meaningful conversations and experiences with Muslims, her opinions begin to change. Saima Alvi, the Muslim woman from Greater Manchester whose family Freeman befriended, wrote about this transformation in a blog for HuffPost. Alvi said she was initially reluctant to participate in the documentary, but decided to go through with it after being reassured that she would not be misrepresented. Watch a trailer for the show below: After the Manchester bombing, which happened just one day into filming the documentary, Freeman and Alvi watched the footage from the attack on television together. They were both uncertain about whether to continue.“Katie was worried that she might become a target dressed as a Muslim woman which was an important realisation. I explained that my attire is part of my identity and I must carry on in the outside world carrying this fear,” Alvi wrote. “We both decided to continue with the further five days of filming.”After the attack, Freeman experiences what it was like to walk through the neighborhood as a visible Muslim woman during a tense time ― feeling fearful while simply walking down the street.  “I’m just sick of it, the stuff they were shouting,” she said after being heckled on camera. “But that’s, it’s only for a few days, isn’t it? You know, and I can take this off and I’ll go back to being Katie and they probably wouldn’t even make a comment, would they? But for like, Saima, if she come here and her family came here, they’d have that abuse all the time, wouldn’t they?”Alvi argued that Freeman’s prosthetic nose and other facial changes were meant to be a disguise ― and that the makeover was never intended to mock an ethnic group, or create a caricature.“The programme made me realise that there are genuinely decent people out there who lack the opportunity to engage with the Muslim community,” Alvi wrote in her blog. “Thus their opinions are based on the commonplace demonisation of Muslims, which is generally perpetuated by the media. Katie was willing to learn about the environment she was immersed within and therefore changed many of her former negative opinions.”Khan claimed that her team met and received approval of the idea from Manchester’s British Muslim Heritage Centre. But The Muslim Council of Britain, an umbrella body of over 500 Muslim organizations, told HuffPost that they wished Khan had also reached out to the national body. “There is value in consulting national Muslim bodies for advice, over and above the individuals in the programme, as this may help the production understand the potential national impact of sensitive issues - the strength of feeling of which appears to have been underestimated,” a spokesperson said in a statement. The Council nevertheless commended the documentary’s participants.“We would like to praise the participants who demonstrated some of the best qualities and characteristics in the face of real challenges.” "
67,HEALTHY LIVING,"Polio Could Be Stopped Worldwide By Year's End, Says Gates Foundation",Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polio-eradication-2017-gates-foundation_us_59f006cae4b0bf1f8836b550,"On World Polio Day, health experts celebrated the ""endgame"" of polio eradication.",2017-10-25,"A boy receives polio vaccination drops during a house-to-house vaccination campaign in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on April 10, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f00cb1140000610d8c9908.jpeg?cache=VOhq8WuY4t&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thirty years ago, the polio virus was rampant in more than 120 countries, responsible for the paralysis of about 350,000 people each year. Today, there are only 12 documented cases of the disease in just two nations — and, according to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, this once-prevalent illness may soon be wiped off the face of the planet.Speaking at Rotary International’s World Polio Day event on Tuesday, which was co-hosted by the Gates Foundation, Dr. Jay Wenger, the director of the foundation’s polio eradication program, said humanity had successfully reached “the endgame of polio eradication.” “We are closer than ever, and we’re optimistic that we can see the end of wild poliovirus disease by as early as this year or next,” Wenger said.To mark World Polio Day, Rotary International and the Gates Foundation roped in WWE star John Cena to spread the word about polio eradication efforts. Melinda Gates urged people to donate to the cause, promising to triple any donation coming in. Rotary and the Gates Foundation have both contributed enormously to the global fight to eradicate polio, which has centered primarily on the dissemination of safe and effective oral vaccines to even the most remote corners of the globe.The Gates Foundation has invested almost $3 billion in this effort, a spokeswoman told CNBC. Rotary, which launched the world’s first global initiative to end polio in 1985, has contributed nearly $2 billion. With the support of governments and other organizations, the Gates Foundation and Rotary have helped vaccinate 2.5 billion children in 122 countries since the 1980s.It’s an initiative that’s been hugely successful. “We’ve gone from 40 cases an hour back in 1988 to just 40 cases in all of 2016,” Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, said in June.When India announced in 2014 that it was polio-free, Bill Gates wrote in a Hindustan Times op-ed that the country’s “success in eradicating polio is the greatest global health achievement I have ever witnessed.”“India may be the hardest planet to vaccinate every child. The country has some of the most densely populated urban areas in the world making it a challenge to track children polio workers have immunised,” Gates said. “[But] India was up to the challenge with more than two million vaccinators reaching more than 170 million children with the vaccine.”Today, the crippling and potentially fatal disease survives only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Both nations have committed to fighting the virus. A spokeswoman for the Gates Foundation told HuffPost that once the last case of polio is seen globally, the world will need to go three years without a single additional case before the virus can be declared truly eradicated. This means that global efforts must continue with vigilance to keep the virus at bay. In this year’s Gates Foundation annual letter, published in February, Gates echoed Wenger’s comments in saying that the end of polio was within sight. “It’s thrilling to be nearing the day when no children will be crippled by polio,” he wrote. “We’re often asked why we’re making such a big effort on polio if our priority is to save lives. The answer is, ending polio will save lives — through the magic of zero. When polio is eradicated, the world can dedicate polio funds to improving child health, and the lessons from polio will lead to better immunization systems for other diseases.” He said he envisions a future in which malaria will be no more and “no one will die from AIDS.”“Few people will get [tuberculosis]. Children everywhere will be well nourished. And the death of a child in the developing world will be just as rare as the death of a child in the rich world,” Gates wrote. “We can’t put a date on these events, and we don’t know the sequence, but we’re confident of one thing: The future will surprise the pessimists.” Clarification: This article has been amended to more accurately describe the conditions under which polio may be considered “eradicated.” Comments from the Gates Foundation have also been included.

70,POLITICS,Here's A List Of Climate-Change Deniers The EPA May Be Considering For Its ‘Red Team’ Debate,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/epa-red-team_us_59efa14ce4b0bf1f8836893e,"The hard-line climate change deniers at the right-wing Heartland Institute sent the agency a list of 145 ""climate scientists.""",2017-10-25,EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has said he doesn't believe carbon dioxide causes climate change. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59efa898140000610d8c97e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt says he wants the “true, legitimate, peer-reviewed, objective, transparent discussion about CO₂” that Americans deserve. He’s pitched a “red-team, blue-team exercise” ― a public, potentially televised debate about the threat of carbon emissions ― to shape the national conversation about climate change.HuffPost has obtained a list of prominent climate-change deniers that the Heartland Institute, a right-wing think tank, assembled and submitted to the agency in May. The Illinois-based group, which has ties to the fossil fuel billionaires who run Koch Industries, boasted in July that the White House “reached out” for help identifying scientists for these debates.In an email summarizing a Sept. 28 Heartland Institute meeting, which E&E news obtained and published two weeks ago, Bast wrote that he assembled a list “of around 150 climate experts” that he sent “to folks at EPA in response to their request for recommendations.”An EPA source who requested anonymity provided the watchdog Climate Investigations Center with a list that Heartland compiled for the agency, which includes 145 scientists and 60 economists. The watchdog group shared it with HuffPost and said they were told the names had been presented to the EPA for consideration when shaping the red team.The list includes Edwin Berry, the self-funded researcher who compares belief in climate change to Aztec human sacrifices; Alan Carlin, the so-called “whistleblower” who challenged the EPA’s finding that rising greenhouse gases warm the planet; and, for good measure, Joe Bastardi, Fox News’ favorite yelling meteorologist.The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. It’s unclear whether the list has narrowed since the Heartland Institute convened two meetings in June and September to discuss the “red team.” A final meeting is scheduled for next month.Heartland Institute spokesman Jim Lakely declined to comment before this story was published. Five days after the story was published, Bast issued a statement disputing the nature of the lists, which the group described as just a mailing list for invitations to an EPA event that the agency later canceled. The statement came three days after HuffPost published a follow-up article identifying Oliver Manuel, one of the scientists included on the list, as a convicted pedophile. In August, the Heartland Institute confirmed to Nature that it provided the EPA with lists for a climate science red team. “Many agency researchers assume that Pruitt will use the lists to assemble that team,” Nature wrote, “but some fear that it could be used to identify candidates for empty slots on the EPA’s Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises the agency’s research arm.The names included on the list, as well as Bast’s own meeting notes, suggest the Heartland Institute wants the debate to go directly after the scientific and legal underpinnings of the EPA’s regulations on climate change. Rather than debating the regulatory approaches, they want to undermine the conclusion that climate change is a real problem.“This is not a good-faith debate,” Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Drexel University who tracks climate change denial groups, told HuffPost. “They’re not just misinformation people, they’re either ‘CO₂ is good for you’ or ‘climate change can’t possibly be happening.’”The Heartland Institute has been among the loudest cheerleaders of President Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, availing its dozens of fellows to provide commentary feting the decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement or admonishing scientists for linking the recent series of deadly hurricanes to global warming. But while Trump and Pruitt have begun rolling back regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, so far they have not attempted to undo the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and the environment ― a conclusion known as the endangerment finding. It was the EPA under George W. Bush that first made that determination in response to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, but it never acted on that finding. The Obama EPA did, and, once that conclusion was reached, the agency was required by law to issue regulations under the Clean Air Act. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farms are enshrouding the planet in heat-trapping gases, and a research review published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise.“If Scott Pruitt tried to challenge the endangerment finding, he’d be laughed out of court,” David Doniger, director and senior attorney for Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean air program, told HuffPost. “Sometimes I think Scott Pruitt talks up the red-team, blue-team thing as a way of avoiding the regulatory or legal attack on the endangerment finding, which he’s bound to lose.” Calls for the red-team, blue-team exercise began in April, one month before the date marked on the top of the documents. On April 20, the day before the March for Science protest in Washington, D.C., New York University physicist Steve Koonin published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for a red-team, blue-team exercise to “put the ‘consensus’ to the test, and improve public understanding, through an open, adversarial process.” The next day, Judith Curry, a retired climatologist known for mocking other scientists as “alarmists,” and Anthony Watts, who runs a popular climate change denial blog, endorsed the idea. The next week, Pruitt met with Koonin for an hour, according to schedules published by The Washington Post. All three pundits’ names made it onto the Heartland Institute’s list in May. In June, Robert Murray, the chief executive of coal giant Murray Energy Corp., told E&E News that Pruitt assured him the agency would review the endangerment finding in the coming months.In an interview with Time Magazine last week, Pruitt said he planned to model his red-team, blue-team debate on Cold War-era discussions of the Soviet nuclear threat and suggested that he believed his agency did not “engage in a robust, meaningful discussion” about the threat posed by carbon dioxide before adopting the endangerment finding. But Bast thinks even that rhetoric from Pruitt isn’t enough.“EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s proposal for a Red Team-Blue Team exercise is vague, probably would not be effective, and is unlikely to come about,” Bast wrote in the email published last week by E&E News that summarized a late September meeting at the group’s headquarters just outside of Chicago. The meeting included “about 40 climate scientists, economists, lawyers, and other experts to discuss the possible creation by the Trump administration of a Red Team - Blue Team exercise on climate change,” he wrote. He noted this was the second “Red Team briefing,” following an initial gathering on June 14 in Washington, D.C. A final summit is scheduled for Nov. 8, the day before the Heartland Institute’s America First Energy Conference in Houston. The Heartland Institute wants to go after the endangerment finding directly, and thinks it’s the group’s job to push Pruitt. “He won’t do it without pressure,” Bast concluded. This seems to be the goal of the list, which includes 145 scientists and 60 economists who have long been on the fringes of the climate debate and have made their names as contrarians given to bombastic public statements. “The Heartland Institute has been spearheading a ‘red team’ campaign for the past six months to use Scopes Monkey Trial theatrics to undermine climate science and the EPA’s endangerment finding on carbon pollution,” Kert Davies, director of the Climate Investigations Center, told HuffPost. “Their red team campaign has been a failure. Pruitt hasn’t done anything but talk.”Some of the scientists on the Heartland Institute list have a lot to say, about the endangerment finding and more. Berry’s assertions include tweeting 18 times about Islam over the past year, calling the religion a “death cult,” “our enemy” and a “cancer that invades and can kill.” His arguments about climate science strike a similar tone. “Aztec priests told people they must cut out their beating hearts to bring better climate for their crops. The people believed them,” he wrote in a December 2015 blog post. “Today’s climate priests tell people they must cut out their CO2 emissions and pay penances to other nations, like China, to save our climate. The people believe them.” In an interview with HuffPost, Berry said he did not know his name was on the list but would serve on the red team if asked. “I would go right down to the core, starting with the question, ‘How much do human emissions increase atmospheric carbon dioxide?’ That’s the first assumption the blue team makes, and they have to prove that that’s true,” he said. “In my opinion, the red team would win that debate on the carbon dioxide.” Carlin spent decades as an economist working at the EPA before becoming a conservative media darling for publicly accusing the agency of muzzling his criticism of the endangerment finding. He was never assigned to work on climate change and holds a doctorate in economics, not atmospheric science or climatology, and his comments on the finding were deemed to be the “product of rushed and at times shoddy scholarship,” according to a 2009 analysis by The New York Times. Yet he submitted the 93-page report suggesting the research behind human-caused climate change is “more religion than science.” “It is very clear without a shadow of doubt that the endangerment finding is wrong,” he told HuffPost, adding that he would participate in the debate. “It is my view that this is one of the most important public policy issues that the U.S. has and that the outcome is extremely important.”Bastardi, a meteorologist at the New York-based forecasting firm WeatherBELL, said he was invited to earlier meetings by the Heartland Institute but did not attend because he was covering hurricanes. But past clips of his appearances on “The O’Reilly Factor” offer a hint at how he might have approached the debate, and why the Heartland Institute took interest in him.In 2010, he sparred with science advocate Bill Nye on the show, citing CO₂ calculations from Heartland Institute fellow Joe D’Aleo to refute global warming. In 2009, Bastardi, then working at Accuweather.com, deployed pixelated charts that appear to contradict conclusions about climate change, and he suggested that wildfires in California were the result of cooling temperatures. (The deadly spate of wildfires this month in California, widely attributed to climate change, cast doubt over these assumptions.)“For years Heartland was a minor think tank that defended the tobacco industry by fighting for ‘smoker’s rights’ but then moved into climate change and has gradually become arguably the leading denial organization,” Riley Dunlap, a sociologist at Oklahoma State University who monitors climate deniers, told HuffPost. “It attracts a wide range of professional and amateur deniers, hardly any with solid credentials in climate science. Giving it a crucial role in selecting a denial ‘red team’ to debate a team of leading climate scientists is like letting Putin select a team to investigate Russia’s role in the last election.”This article was updated to included a statement from the Heartland Institute, as well as more information from Nature magazine on the lists.

Others are less sure.",2017-10-25,"Workers of the Sport City tower wash their dishes after their lunch break in Doha, Qatar, Feb. 4, 2006.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f0e7441500007a417476ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Qatar, the tiny but wealthy state in the Persian Gulf that will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, announced a series of major reforms on Wednesday, which could put an end to the oppressive “kafala” labor system that international trade unions and human rights groups have long likened to “modern day slavery.”The package of reforms, according to Qatari state media and labor groups, will establish new protections for Qatar’s migrant workers, including instituting a minimum wage that will no longer discriminate based on race and creating workplace committees with elected labor representatives.The most significant change, however, may be new rules that will allow Qatar’s roughly two million migrant workers, who make up 95 percent of its labor force, to change jobs or leave the country on their own, without approval from their employer. That sort of control over workers is a defining aspect of Qatar’s “kafala” system, as it binds migrants from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and various African countries to employers that have near-absolute power over them.The reforms will “meet the necessary needs of the worker to live at an appropriate humanitarian level,” Dr. Issa Saad Al Jafali Al Nuaimi, the Qatari minister of labor affairs, said Wednesday, according to the state-run Qatar News Agency. And for once, one of the country’s most vocal critics agreed.“This is a genuine breakthrough, and signals the end of kafala,” said Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, which has pushed Qatar to modernize its labor system for more than five years and helped negotiate the new reforms.Global scrutiny of Qatar’s labor system began to intensify in 2010, when FIFA, international soccer’s governing body, awarded the country the right to host the 2022 World Cup. The next year, French soccer player Zahir Belounis was prohibited from leaving the country amid a contract dispute with his club, launching a two-year escape saga that highlighted the horrors of the country’s labor regime.Human rights groups and international unions said that the persistence of the “modern day slavery” system could lead to the deaths of up to 4,000 migrant laborers working on World Cup-related projects by the time the tournament actually began.Qatar has failed in previous attempts to address that criticism. In 2014, it announced a series of reforms that officials claimed would end the “kafala” system. But human rights groups and labor organizations like ITUC quickly dismissed what they saw as “cosmetic” changes that would still fail to protect workers.They have continued to push for reform. In March 2016, all 231 workers interviewed by a researcher from Amnesty International said they had faced abuses ranging from forced labor to the confiscation of their passports to “squalid living conditions.” The next month, a Harvard report called on FIFA to relocate the World Cup if Qatar did not institute substantial reforms to protect workers.As recently as December, Amnesty International warned that Qatar’s labor rules would continue to put workers’ rights and health in jeopardy. While in September, Human Rights Watch called on the country to institute policies to protect construction workers from the desert nation’s “intense heat and humidity.”Qatar, meanwhile, is still facing potential sanctions from the International Labor Organization, a United Nations agency that in 2016 gave the country a year to end forced labor. While Burrow and ITUC hailed Qatar’s announcement, others who have pushed for reforms are more hesitant to proclaim the death of “kafala.”“These [reforms] have a clear potential to have a positive impact on migrant workers’ lives depending on how they’re implemented,” Amnesty International spokesperson Sara Hashash said in an email. But, she added, “I’m afraid we’re not able to assess the significance of all the developments being welcomed by other organizations until we’ve seen the full details of the government’s commitments.”“In principle it seems to be a positive step,” said Mustafa Qadri, a human rights researcher who interviewed migrant workers in Qatar for Amnesty in 2015. “As ever, however, the devil is in the detail. We need to see the details of this proposal: what is Qatar’s long term game plan to eradicate modern slavery and other abuses?”Burrow acknowledged that the new reforms will take time to implement and that Qatar’s labor system will not change overnight. But she is “confident” that the policies ― which also mandate government issuance of identification cards, oversight of employment contracts and a new grievance process for employee disputes, according to an ITUC release ― will finally succeed in protecting workers. She emphasizes this is is particularly because the ILO will help provide support the development and implementation of the rules.“For all workers who are associated with the infrastructure necessary for the World Cup, it will mean a change from a system of modern slavery to normalized industrial relations,” Burrow told HuffPost. “For those specifically working on the World Cup, it gives them confidence that the promises that have been empty to date...will in fact have some legal teeth behind them.”FIFA has maintained it is committed to workers’ rights but has faced its own criticism and legal challenges over its failure to pressure Qatar to reform. The international soccer governing body did not specifically comment on the new reforms. Though a spokesperson pointed to a previous statement that it “recognises its responsibility to address human rights risks” associated with its events.FIFA, the spokesperson said, “will continue to engage with the Qatari authorities to build on the initiatives put in place for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and help raise the bar in regards to labour standards across the country.”Though ITUC will no longer request that the World Cup be moved from Qatar, Burrow said FIFA should claim no credit for the potential abolition of the “kafala” system.“They had the power to affect change five years ago,” she said. “Sadly, they’ve stood by and watched the situation in Qatar. But we’ve always said, ‘No Qatar World Cup without workers’ rights.’ Now, we can have a World Cup with workers’ rights, hopefully.”"

She is credited with helping shape key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.Dēmos, which means “the people,” aims to create a society where everyone has “an equal say and an equal chance,” according to the group’s 2000-2016 Impact Report.With a staff of 50 and an annual $8 million budget, Dēmos works to protect the freedom to vote and to quell the influence of money in politics. Other action areas include increasing upward mobility and combating racism and racial inequality.Hefty Climate Change CostsThe group along with another nonprofit, NextGen America, recently issued a report on the enormous expected lifetime costs to young people today and to future generations, arising from the damaging effects of worsening climate change.The Price Tag of Being Young: Climate Change and Millennials’ Economic Future, includes these findings:A baby born in 2015 who later goes on to graduate from college and earn a median income will lose approximately $467,000 in income over its lifetime due to the effects of climate change. If one assumes that the lost income had been invested at 3.5 percent, the lost wealth would total approximately $764,000.Clean Energy BenefitsThe Dēmos/NextGen America climate report also points to a recent ICF International study which indicated that transitioning to a clean energy economy by 2050 would create up to two million new jobs, boost our economy by $290 billion, and increase household disposable income by $650, saving families $41 billion on energy bills.Remembering the VictimsMcGhee began her Bioneers speech with a moment of silence for the loss of life, homes, and habitats caused by the recent climate-related hurricane disasters that have ravaged the Gulf Coast, Puerto Rico, and large areas of South Asia and the devastating fires that have ravaged parts of Northern California. Only days earlier, the conference site itself been a shelter for evacuees from the fires in California’s Sonoma County and elsewhere.Noting that climate change disproportionately impacts communities of color and poor communities, McGhee said that, “we see an opportunity out of the crisis of climate change, to use the economic transformation we know is necessary, not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce inequality; not just to increase energy efficiency, but to increase wealth in families and communities of color. . . .”Up-Ending the Power StructureMcGhee’s group has begun working toward these twin goals by joining forces with a broad coalition of 120 like-minded groups in New York Renews, a climate-equity campaign that aims to zero out human-caused carbon pollution by 2050 and slash it in half by 2030.It is most important, said McGhee, to direct “40 percent of the revenue from carbon pricing and other measures to the lowest-wealth and most-polluted communities in the state.”The New York Renews campaign, she asserted, is “upending the normal power structure in the state by bringing together a broad-based coalition of civil and human rights, environmental justice, small business, labor, and democracy reform organizations.”The approach is not unique to New York, McGhee said. Similar broad-based coalitions for “equitable carbon pricing” are developing in states like Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, and California.Divide and RuleWhile this was clearly a source of hope for many in the audience, McGhee also blamed the nation’s legacy of slavery and racism for preventing the nation from recognizing itself as one people with common interests. That, in turn, she said, has stood in the way of collective action “to save our collective home, health, and well-being.”___________________John J. Berger, PhD.

But Does He Know What It Means?,Jesselyn Cook,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-xi-jinping-elevation_us_59f0eadde4b0af27f5893f3d,The Chinese president now boasts near-absolute authority.,2017-10-25,"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, on July 8, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f10008140000371b8c9b8e.jpeg?cache=Lwu3LCewnS&ops=crop_0_0_2472_1590%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. President Donald Trump turned to his favorite platform on Wednesday to fire off a quick congratulatory message to Chinese President Xi Jinping for his “extraordinary elevation.” China had unveiled its new generation of leaders in a historic announcement earlier in the day, without presenting a clear successor to Xi ― thus consolidating the Communist Party leader’s ironclad grip on power.Trump’s tweet was conspicuously polite ― contrasting with his repeated criticism of China’s relations with North Korea and his claim that Beijing is fabricating “the concept of global warming.”But it also raises questions as to whether or not Trump fully understands the implications of his Chinese counterpart’s ascension. Referred to by some as China’s “COE,” or “Chairman of Everything,” Xi is now arguably the most powerful Chinese leader in decades. He boasts near-absolute authority over the nation, which is home to some 1.4 billion people and the world’s second-largest economy. Human rights groups warn that government suppression of dissent and free speech has worsened under his leadership.The Communist Party voted to enshrine Xi’s name and political thoughts in its constitution on Tuesday, elevating his status to that of Mao Zedong, the founder of modern China.Vowing to spearhead the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi kicked off his second five-year term on Wednesday. But there is already speculation that he may amend the constitution to extend his tenure beyond 2022.For now, Xi will rule with six other members of the new Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee, all hand-picked by his loyalists. As NBC News concludes in an analysis, this sends a clear signal that China “may be entering an era of strongman rule.”Trump will visit Xi in China next month during a 12-day trip through Asia. His praise for the authoritarian leader may be alarming, but it is certainly not surprising.The U.S. president also congratulated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for winning a widely disputed referendum in April, cementing his increasingly despotic rule.Trump also said that he and Egypt’s autocratic President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi “agree on so many things.” In April, he told the Egyptian leader he’d done “a fantastic job in a very difficult situation,” though Egyptian security forces are accused of a litany of ongoing human rights violations, including the use of torture.Trump has even offered kind words to Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte, an admitted killer who has encouraged citizens to shoot suspected drug dealers in the streets, resulting in thousands of extrajudicial killings.And let’s not forget Trump’s bizarre justification for his flattery of Russian strongman Vladimir Putin: “If he says great things about me, I’m going to say great things about him.”"
74,POLITICS,Democrats Are Trying To Put The Public Option Back On The Table,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brian-schatz-health-care-public-option_us_59f0852ae4b0e064db7df702,They can't pass anything now. But they can start a conversation.,2017-10-25,Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) wants to give people buying private coverage on their own a chance to pay for a version of Medicaid instead.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f087f3150000d63c747515.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Another Democrat has come forward with a proposal that would make a government-run insurance plan available to more Americans who want one, in the hopes of providing consumers with a cheaper, more reliable source of coverage.This time the Democrat is Sen. Brian Schatz, from Hawaii. On Wednesday, Schatz unveiled the “State Public Option Act,” which would allow states to create a version of Medicaid open to people shopping for insurance on their own through the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges.The coverage available through the new program would not be identical to coverage that Medicaid recipients get now. States could design plans with significant deductibles, for example, or without every single benefit that Medicaid provides. But they would have to abide by all of the ACA’s standards, including an overall ceiling on out-of-pocket expenses and requirements that plans cover mental health, maternity care and other “essential” services. The coverage would be available to everybody regardless of pre-existing conditions.People who qualify for the ACA’s tax credits could use them to help pay premiums. And for those who don’t get the ACA tax credits, the law would cap premiums in the new Medicaid program at 9.5 percent of household income. That ceiling is critical, because it would help the people who struggle the most under “Obamacare” ― namely, people who are too wealthy to qualify for government subsidies but who, today, can’t find private coverage without paying high, sometimes exorbitant premiums.Schatz has been talking about this idea for months, and it means there are now three separate “public option” proposals on the table from Democrats. Last week, two other Senate Democrats, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Tim Kaine of Virginia, unveiled a “Medicare-X” bill. As the name suggests, the bill would look more like Medicare, which the federal government runs by itself, rather than Medicaid, which states administer with federal funding and guidance.That’s an important distinction. It means that, under the Bennet-Kaine proposal, a public option would be eventually be available in every state, not just in states where officials opt to create one. Under the Schatz proposal, meanwhile, states could more easily tailor programs to fit the needs of their different populations.The third version of a public option proposal, which Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) introduced in August, would allow anybody 55 or over to buy into Medicare. A major goal of that proposal is to help out older consumers who pay the highest premiums for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, because the law still allows insurers to vary premiums according to age, by as much as a factor of three.Of course, Democrats have also proposed one other kind of government-run insurance program ― a plan that would supplant all existing insurance arrangements and provide coverage directly to all Americans. This “single-payer” plan comes from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been championing the idea for most of his political career but who snagged 16 Democratic co-sponsors when he introduced his latest version a few weeks ago. All of these proposals leave out key details, particularly when it comes to what they would pay providers and, relatedly, how much they would actually cost to maintain. But the authors of these proposals have started to put down some markers. The Schatz proposal, for example, calls for reinstating and then making permanent an increase in what Medicaid pays primary care providers. Medicaid famously pays less than other forms of insurance, even Medicare, and historically that has made it more difficult for people on the program to find doctors willing to see them.Working out these details and dealing with the trade-offs will not be easy. The reality of all public plans, small and big, is that they can potentially offer coverage a lot more cheaply than private insurers can, but only by ratcheting down what they pay hospitals, doctors, drug makers, and other parts of the health care industry.Health care prices in the U.S. are the highest in the world, which suggests there’s plenty of room for them to come down. But an abrupt or clumsy cut in payments to the health care industry could create economic disruption, leading to layoffs, hospital closures or longer wait times. And that’s only if the adjustment happens at all ― a big “if,” given the ferocity with which elements of the health care industry would fight to keep their revenues.That said, it’s not like Democrats are starting completely from scratch. The public option got a lot of attention in 2009 and 2010, when Democrats were writing what ultimately became the Affordable Care Act. There’s a long paper trail of analyses, from government and private experts alike, on how different variations would play out.And the authors of these plans have all been candid about their aspirations, given the current political environment. With Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, they know, none of these bills is going to see so much as a committee hearing, let alone a floor vote. By putting out the proposals now, in protean form, the Democrats say they hope to start a more detailed, public conversation about policy ― one that could result in blending some of their ideas or attempting to pass them sequentially, especially since the proposals have long, overlapping lists of co-sponsors.“I think they are all reasonable ideas,” Schatz told HuffPost. “I co-sponsored Bernie’s bill, for example. We need to get... into a mode where we are doing serious policy work, where even among friends we can have competing ideas and work together to see which idea is the best one in the end.”One question hanging over these proposals concerns their timing, and how that affects the debate about health care more generally. In September, when GOP leaders made a serious, if desperate, push to pass a bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act, they repeatedly said that failure would lead to the enactment of a single-payer bill like the one Sanders was proposing. Plenty of Democrats and their allies worried that Sanders, though a staunch defender of the 2010 health care law, had handed its adversaries a powerful rhetorical weapon for rallying their base behind a repeal measure that was otherwise unpopular.But when open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act begins next week, some Americans ― namely, those who don’t qualify for the law’s tax assistance ― will discover they have to pay a lot more for their coverage. And especially in rural parts of the country, consumers may find just two or one carriers offering insurance. Democrats have spoken frequently about their desire to bolster the Affordable Care Act ― to fix its flaws, without tearing down the whole edifice. The public option could be one way to do that. And although some Democrats fear the specter of government-run insurance would alienate swing voters, others, including the many co-sponsors of these measures, are convinced the public would welcome expansions of Medicare or Medicaid in some form ― and would see those trusted programs as a more reliable, affordable alternative to what they can buy now."

Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a bill on Monday that bans e-cigarettes and vaping systems in public indoor spaces.The state Clean Indoor Air Act previously regulated smoking substances containing tobacco, like cigarettes, cigars and pipes, in public indoor places. The addition of new smoking methods, like e-cigarettes, vaping pens and e-hookahs, closes a loophole in the law that allowed individuals to smoke tobacco in public places where cigarettes are prohibited. “These products are marketed as a healthier alternative to cigarettes but the reality is they also carry long-term risks to the health of users and those around them,” Cuomo stated.E-cigarettes are electronic devices used to mimic smoking tobacco. They contain a nicotine-based liquid that is vaporized and inhaled, and are often marketed as less damaging substitutes to traditional tobacco smoking methods. Vaping is the act of inhaling vapor produced by a vaporizer or e-cigarette.According to the Office of the U.S Surgeon General, e-cigarettes pose health risks to both users and those around them.“Even breathing e-cigarette aerosol that someone else has exhaled poses potential health risks,” the surgeon general’s website states. “The aerosol from e-cigarettes is not harmless. It can contain harmful and potentially harmful chemicals, including nicotine; ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs; flavoring such diacetyl, a chemical linked to a serious lung disease; volatile organic compounds such as benzene, which is found in car exhaust; and heavy metals, such as nickel, tin and lead.”The ban, which will forbid the use of these products in places like restaurants and bars, will go into effect in 30 days.California and Utah also have laws banning public vaping of tobacco products."

He, however, told police he’s actually her ex-boyfriend. It was unclear whether he meant she was his ex prior to the wedding, or because of what happened at the wedding, Flagler Live reports.It all started Saturday morning when Darby Johns ― the man she claims was her beau ― told her he was going to a wedding at a nearby resort, but without her. Investigators said McDowell decided to go uninvited to spy on the 26-year-old Johns, who may or may not have been her boyfriend.After crashing the gathering, McDowell allegedly poured a drink on him and the woman he was dancing with before punching the woman in the face, according to WKMG TV.McDowell told WJAX TV that she wore a black wig to avoid being recognized.“I just wanted to find out what was going on, unnoticed, and leave,” she said in a written statement. “My intention was to SEE what was happening, and if I saw him betraying me, it would have been a way for me to know and understand that our relationship was over.”McDowell said when she walked into the ballroom, Johns was dancing and kissing another woman, identified as 26-year-old Crystal Munoz. That was when she chucked the drink and allegedly punched the woman in the left eye.Police said McDowell ran to the restroom and hid in a stall.McDowell claimed several women in the bridal party went into the bathroom and “pulled her out of the stall by her feet and they began to punch her,” according to the arrest report.However, resort employees told police that when the manager came to break up the fight, McDowell was on top Munoz, pummeling her, according to WKMG TV.McDowell was separated from her victim and made to wait until police and emergency responders arrived.“I was told that if I did not press charges on anyone, no charges would be pressed on me,” she told WJAX TV. “I agreed that I would not press charges, and I waited to be escorted out. When the police arrived, I was arrested and told that Crystal Munoz was pressing battery charges on me.”Officers charged McDowell with misdemeanor battery. She spent the night in jail before being released 12 hours later.In her statement to WJAX TV, McDowell acknowledged she is aware of certain social niceties.“I am aware that going to a wedding uninvited is wrong. I am aware that pouring a drink on someone is also wrong,” she said.She added:“I just wanted to see if Darby was really cheating, so that I could know it was forever over between us. It was always about him, never Crystal. I never intended for there to be a scene.Johns told deputies that he did not kiss Munoz, but instead that he and Munoz were walking to the dance floor when McDowell allegedly attacked them"

But I felt and understood the picture my grandfather painted in 1950 even before I laid eyes on it; it was painted as the family crisis escalated and my grandmother Mary’s impending breakdown loomed like an invisible wraith inside the home, something you could sense more than see.Shuffleton’s Barbershop is arguably Norman Rockwell’s masterpiece. It is chiaroscuro at its best – a noirscape of an after-hours moment in a small town barbershop. It appeared on the cover of the Saturday Evening Post in the spring of 1950.I felt apprehension, a well of emotion coming to the surface, as I sat in anticipation of seeing the painting in person for the first time. Would it live up to my expectations or disappoint me?I knew I was going to encounter my grandfather in a very different, more personal way this time. After researching their lives I now know what he and my grandmother were struggling through when he painted it; how they tried to shelter their three boys from the extent of my grandmother’s growing inner disturbances and the reliance on alcohol she hoped would soothe her inner wounds that were a mystery even to her.Her illness was their secret. Yet everyone knew. A bank of darkness had descended on what was supposed to be the perfect American family. The prevailing instinct is to protect that loved one who is emotionally and mentally ailing. And then to protect your children and yourself.Mary had dedicated herself to my grandfather and his work for over 15 years before she began to collapse. She had never individuated – she went from being an overly protected, isolated child to the wife of an already famous and successful American illustrator, 15 years her senior.And when the buried trauma and attending internal scavengers began to surface within her, she tried everything to find a solution – went to doctor after doctor, becoming attached to each one – until she snapped one day at a coffee counter in a service station in Arlington, Vermont in the dead of winter in early 1951. She broke down into uncontrollable tears as she sat with the younger family doctor who had been trying to analyze and help her. Perhaps in that moment she realized he couldn’t save her, he didn’t have the answers either, and once again, she was left with her overwhelming existential pain. She had improvised an infatuation for this doctor that was just an illusion.It is hard to separate Pop and Mary because in many ways they had always operated as a team. While some other couples slept in monastic side-by-side twin beds, my grandparents pushed their two mattresses together to make one bed. Each Saturday Evening Post cover was a labor of agony and love for both of them. Mary would often drive the models back and forth to the studio, cook lunch for them, scour the countryside for the specific props that Pop needed for each painting. My grandfather also used Mary as a model repeatedly. They had help – Pop always had an assistant in the studio and she had housekeepers in the home. But when she began to seek out psychiatrists in the late ’40s, two of these male doctors unwittingly pulled her and her marriage apart in destructive ways. They questioned how she responded to her husband intimately without guiding her toward a real solution. They challenged her very concept of womanhood; one California doctor provided strange rules and edicts of wifely/female conduct. They began to open her up, yet failed to get to the root of her fragmentation, and then abandoned her.All of this swirled around me as I was led into a small side room at Sotheby’s in NYC – suddenly there was my grandfather’s painting on the wall, waiting for me. I felt shock that I had been granted such immediate access in this private viewing. This is the painting that had haunted me from afar.What struck me first was how much more light there is in the original than the reproductions – there is so much more to see. The influence of Rembrandt – his view of the “deep mysterious” – is unmistakably echoed in Rockwell’s ambitious use of glowing light and stark shadows.In the midst of the darkened room lit by secondary light, the radiant gold of the window sign letters and the bright orange of the fiery hearth call out contrast and almost beckon you inside. Hints and pops of color sneak in through the carefully displayed magazines and comics in front and the patriotic poster on the back wall.The observer is not just the black cat in the darkness with its right ear pulled back in uncertainty or annoyance; it is Norman Rockwell standing outside the cracked window – where his uncentered, diminished signature lingers – an isolated viewer, kept apart from the light of creativity and festive music in the illuminated back room. The older men play with calm joy, yet he remains an imprisoned outsider in the cold looking in.He is not completely alone, he knows his audience looks in with him from the same vantage point. He is quietly asking us for empathy – see, he silently nudges you, this is how I’m feeling, perhaps I’m not so alone after all.The symmetry of the two chairs with chipped paint like two guardians at the gate. The poorly painted window pane with layers of unscraped paint over the years, leaving paint marks on the window. The old broom leans against the wall as another character, its bristles peaking out from overuse. The startling clarity of the hot stovetop and the back light hitting the stovepipe where it enters the wall. A pair of shoes and a pair of beat up boots warm by the fire. The comforting softness of the worn ivory barber cloth draped over the arm of the chair; the channel of light from the other room exposes the intricate detail of the foot rest. Stray cigarettes from the day scattered on the floor.The revelation of the painting is the impressionist reflections in the back window – a play of gradations of gray. Pop always finds a way to surprise me.There is a tender dance between chaos and order, community and isolation.Pop had a number of reference photos of the cat taken. He enlisted his young son Peter and together they cajoled the cat into the correct pose; Pop sitting on his legs right by the cat, Peter on all fours, gesturing out in front. The first model, a round black and white tuxedo cat, wasn’t in the mood to cooperate. Pop replaced him with an all black cat with a leaner back who was more amenable.Did he really need the cat there? And why did he slightly cartoon its figure? Was it a form of slight sabotage to add that “Norman Rockwell” stamp of sentiment or did he feel he needed the ominous presence of a black cat looking on from the shadows – as he was feeling at that time? A grim harbinger of what was to come – perhaps Pop attempted to undercut the gloomy specter with a touch of humor. When I stood back from all the details and silently took the painting in from the other side of the room a strange thing happened – the painting seemed to come to life dimensionally and allow me to enter into it. I was now the observer standing right outside the barbershop longing to be a part of the music in the back room – the barbershop opened up to me and I was transported inside – I knew that I could enter the lit back room if I wanted to.And that is the affirmation – it is the joy of art, of music, of community that saves us in those dark moments. It always saved Pop.Sotheby’s is planning to auction Shuffleton’s Barbershop and Shaftsbury Blacksmith Shop on November 13. Once again controversy circles around Norman Rockwell – people have always parasitically attached themselves to him, forged their identities by associating themselves with him and his work. He has attracted that sort of adulation and animus since his art entered into the public eye. People both revere and disparage his vision.Art is not created to stay in one place, it is created to move about and benefit the world. That is part of the magic of the artistic process – there is no true ownership. All of us are merely temporary custodians. These two paintings were painted in Vermont. Pop donated Shuffleton’s in 1958 and Blacksmith Shop in 1966 to the permanent collection of the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, MA. The Berkshire Museum decided months ago to auction much of its art, including the two Rockwells, in an attempt to reimagine its future.What would Norman Rockwell want? He would want the two paintings to be placed where the most people would have easy access to them, to experience his work for themselves. His art is the art of the people.If this auction goes through, Mr. George Lucas, I am calling on you... to save the day, rescue the Rockwells and become the faithful custodian of them at your new museum.Hope persists, in spite of it all."
