",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6724cd1600002000138855.jpeg?cache=YY2atS1LwR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Automation will further widen the divide between men and women in the workplace, with more women than men at risk of seeing their jobs displaced, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum. Released at Davos ― the annual gathering of politicians and business leaders ― the report analyzed nearly 1,000 jobs across the U.S. economy, and its conclusions are bleak. A predicted 1.4 million U.S. jobs will be at risk from technology and other factors between now and 2026. A shocking 57 percent of these are jobs currently performed by women. It’s yet more bad news for women who are already dealing with a growing gender gap and facing a 217-year wait to have the same job and wage opportunities as men.While much emphasis has been put on the threat automation poses to men, especially due to the decline in manufacturing jobs, WEF argues this has skewed the view of automation from a gender perspective. “The narrative tends to focus on male, blue-collar factory workers, for example,” Saadia Zahidi, head of education, gender and work at WEF, told HuffPost. “But there are also a number of very female-dominated roles like secretaries and administrative assistants that are facing displacement.” Nearly 164,000 female secretaries are at risk, according to the report, compared with 90,000 at-risk male assembly line workers. Automation is not some distant prospect, of course. It’s already happening, and not just on factory lines and in administrative roles. Robots are expanding into the service sector too. They are already running hotels and delivering take out.Amazon has just opened the doors of Amazon Go in Seattle, a cashier-less grocery store that uses apps and high-tech sensors to track shoppers and their purchases.While there are no confirmed plans for a national rollout of the stores yet, this development poses a potential threat to retail jobs. Retail salespeople and cashiers are the top two most common U.S. jobs, employing 7.8 million people collectively. Nearly 74 percent of cashiers are female. Reskilling is the answer to these tectonic shifts in the job market, according to the report, which says learning new skills will increase workers’ chances of re-employment, likely lead to wage increases and improve their social mobility prospects.Retraining has the potential to tackle the gender gap too, said Zahidi: “If we took a very deliberate approach to reskilling in which we tried to ensure some of these gender gaps were closed, we’re actually sitting on an opportunity where we can actually accelerate gender parity.”While the study focused on the U.S. economy, a similar story is unfolding across the world. Emerging economies in Southeast Asia, for example, rely on labor-intensive manufacturing like the garment industry, where women make up the majority of workers. In Cambodia, for example, as many as 88 percent of garment workers ― 81 percent of whom are women ― face displacement through automation, according to an International Labour Organization report.“Worryingly, many of these female workers come from rural areas and are breadwinners of their families,” said Jae-Hee Chang, co-author of the report.“Our study showed that technology would impact vulnerable groups of society the most: low-skilled, women, youth and less educated,” Chang said. She called on policymakers to urgently consider what automation will mean for workers and how to ensure they have the skills and education to move into other jobs, for example in retail and tourismEducation is vital, agreed Johannes Moenius, chair of the Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis, which released a report last year mapping out who would be hit hardest from automation. “It’s absolutely key that people are aware that we have entered a time where continuous education, lifelong education is not just political lip service... it’s a requirement for people simply to earn a living,” he told HuffPost.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Franklin Graham offered a Bible reading at President Donald Trump’s inauguration. He took the rain that fell that day as a sign of God’s blessing on the new president. After Trump’s first tumultuous year in the White House, Graham is still firmly on the president’s side. Graham, son of the famous evangelist Billy Graham and president of the international Christian relief organization Samaritan’s Purse, appeared on Fox & Friends on Sunday to tout what he believes Trump accomplished during his first year.Graham painted Trump as a defender of Christianity, someone who is standing up for Christians at a time when, the 65-year-old pastor said, the religion is being persecuted around the world. “The world is attacking Christians because they hate the name of Christ. And President Trump has been defending Christians,” Graham said. “I find this refreshing to have a president who’s not afraid to say Jesus, he’s not afraid to have prayers where people end in the name of Jesus.”“We’ve never had this, not in my lifetime, and he defends the Christian faith more than any president in my lifetime.“While progressive Christian leaders and some leaders within evangelical Christianity are highly critical of Trump, Graham has long been a staunch supporter. He’s used his popular Facebook page to comment on the president’s actions and often, to defend Trump against attack. On Sunday, Graham praised Trump for his tax plan, his approach toward ISIS, and the growth of the U.S. economy.“Whether you’re an atheist, whether you’re a Catholic, whether you’re a Protestant, a Jew, it doesn’t matter. We all are benefiting from this man,” Graham said. He also applauded the president for being able to work under intense scrutiny from the “left,” which Graham claimed is trying to force Trump out of office in a “digital coup d’état.” Graham’s conservative religious views and his support of Trump have sparked criticism from some of his fellow Christians. He’s made inflammatory remarks about Islam, calling it an “very evil and wicked religion.” In a 2015 Facebook post, he proposed banning Muslims from immigrating to the U.S. Months later, Trump proposed his own ban. Graham also has defended Trump’s plans to drastically curb refugee admission to the U.S. Asked last year by HuffPost about reconciling Trump’s temporary ban on refugees with the Christian commandment to welcome, clothe and feed the stranger and to be a good Samaritan, Graham replied that he did’t see a conflict. “It’s not a biblical command for the country to let everyone in who wants to come, that’s not a Bible issue,” he said.More than 500 prominent evangelical leaders disagreed with that interpretation of Christian charity and signed a letter denouncing Trump’s executive order on immigration. In addition, Graham holds deeply conservative Christian views on sexuality and often rails against the “sinful, destructive, anti-God agenda of the LGBTQ” on his Facebook page. Before planned evangelical events in Canada and the U.K. last year, groups of Christian pastors publicly disavowed Graham’s “Trump style, hard line, hate filled” brand of Christianity. In the interview with Fox and Friends, Graham said that he’s “grateful” for the president and finds Trump to be an “honest” person ― although not without flaws.“He’s not president perfect, he’s got his flaws like we all do,” Graham said. “But he’s certainly trying to fix this nation so it will be better for my grandchildren and his grandchildren. So I say God bless the man and let’s move forward.”"

7,WORLD NEWS,'The Most Popular Politician On Earth' Is Fighting To Save His Legacy -- And His Future,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lula-da-silva-corruption-brazil_us_5a639125e4b0022830033e33,"Luiz Inácio da Silva, the former Brazilian president seeking that office again, is appealing corruption charges his lawyer says are political persecution.",2018-01-23,"Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva wants to become Brazil's president again. But if his appeal of a July corruption conviction is upheld, he'll likely be banned from the race.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6392552200004b00b4f3e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"He was, as former President Barack Obama once said, “the most popular politician on Earth.” But now, former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva finds himself locked in a battle to save his legacy and preserve his future ― which he hopes will soon include another stint as his nation’s chief executive. On Wednesday, da Silva and his lawyers will return to court to appeal his July conviction on charges of political corruption ― a case that threatens to derail his potential candidacy in elections later this year.But da Silva and his legal team are confident they will win, with one of his top lawyers arguing that the former president is the victim of a political witch hunt. “Lula is not being prosecuted but persecuted ― politically persecuted,” Valeska Zanin Martins, da Silva’s co-counsel, told HuffPost. If his conviction ultimately stands, “we are absolutely certain that it is an international legal scandal that should be reviewed internationally and historically,” she said.From 2003 to 2011, da Silva held watch over one of the world’s fastest-growing economies that ― coupled with his enactment of ambitious social welfare programs ― helped lift nearly 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. But since he left office, Brazil has fallen into a state of perpetual crisis: under his hand-picked successor, former President Dilma Rousseff, the economy collapsed. And one of the world’s largest and broadest corruption scandals ― known as Operation Car Wash ― erupted, engulfing hundreds of Brazilian politicians in the process. Da Silva ― known to Brazilians simply as “Lula” ― was among them. He is facing four separate corruption charges. Only one case has gone to trial, however, and in July Judge Sérgio Moro, who has spearheaded the Car Wash probes, convicted da Silva.Moro alleged that the former president orchestrated a vast bribery scheme involving da Silva’s leftist Workers’ Party, the Brazilian construction firm OAS, and Petrobras, the country’s state-owned oil giant. Da Silva, according to prosecutors, took more than $1 million in bribes and personally benefited by gaining access to a beachside apartment in Guarujá, a coastal town in São Paulo state.During the hearing on Wednesday, a panel of judges in the southern city of Porto Alegre will hear ― and could rule on ― da Silva’s appeal. The decision could have sweeping ramifications not just for him, but for Brazil. Da Silva’s the front-runner in early polls for Brazil’s 2018 presidential election. Brazilian law, however, bars anyone convicted of corruption from seeking office.Zanin Martins argued that da Silva’s appeal of the corruption conviction is less about his future political ambitions than about clearing the stain it has put on his name and his record.“He’s an innocent man,” Zanin Martins said. “He wants his biography cleared, of course. He said he will run for president. But it’s even more about clearing his name and making sure that history will see him for what he is, and not for what the Car Wash Operation invented.”Still, the political ramifications of da Silva’s case are impossible to ignore. The 2018 elections have loomed over Brazil since Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016 — a takedown her leftist allies saw as a “legislative coup” by centrist and conservative lawmakers eager to put an end to more than a decade of Workers’ Party rule. President Michel Temer, who inherited the top office from Rousseff, has quickly gone about eroding the left’s accomplishments: He has gotten passed drastic austerity measures that have cut health and education spending, pushed broad labor reforms the left derides as attack on workers, ended certain social welfare programs, and sought major reforms to Brazil’s generous public pension system. Couple that with the economic collapse, and much of the Brazil that da Silva helped build has disappeared: the unemployment rate has improved of late but remains above 12 percent, 4.5 million have been cut from the rolls of one popular social welfare program, and the country is at risk of sinking back onto the United Nations World Hunger Map, which would erase one of da Silva’s proudest achievements.In part because of his policies, and in part because of his own link to the corruption scandal, Temer’s comically low approval numbers place him among least popular politicians in the world — and have bolstered da Silva’s standing and chances of reclaiming the presidency next fall.Da Silva’s conviction, however, sent a shockwave across Brazil. It was a sign, many observers said, that a new era had dawned in which no one, not even a popular former president, could engage in corruption and get away with it. “It’s the president that took Brazil to relevance,” Alana Rizzo, a U.S.-based Brazilian journalist, told HuffPost at the time. “That’s the figure that [internationally] people know. When you have this guy getting convicted, now anyone can get convicted.”But da Silva and his rabid base of supporters saw it differently. Though Car Wash and other corruption investigations have implicated politicians from across the political spectrum, they alleged that this was not indicative of a strong, independent judiciary hellbent on forcing good governance on Brazil. It was, along with Rousseff’s impeachment, instead an opportunistic power play: a chance for Brazil’s political and financial elite to thwart the nation’s primary leftist party and its strongest leaders whose only crime, in this version of events, was redistributing too much of their money to the poor and working classes.Zanin Martins said the facts of the corruption case support da Silva’s innocence. Da Silva and his wife never owned the apartment that factors into the case, the lawyer argues. She also noted that more than 70 witnesses absolved da Silva of guilt during his trial. His lawyers also assert that Moro tainted the trial by illegally leaking da Silva’s phone conversations to the media. “If you look at the overwhelming evidence of innocence that we have produced in the files, it is impossible for an impartial or independent trial not to acquit Lula, or at least to declare the entire procedure null and void.” Zanin Martins said.Da Silva’s opponents have blasted him for his zealous appeal efforts, suggesting that he is undermining the judiciary’s political independence and the anti-corruption efforts. But Zanin Martins said da Silva, whose previous presidential campaigns were rooted in opposition to corruption, still supports broad efforts to fight the sort of political bribery that Car Wash has exposed as rampant across Brazil. It’s just that this case, she said, is the wrong way to do it.Da Silva is “not above the law, but he’s not beneath the law,” Zanin Martins said. “He wants a fair trial, because a fair and impartial trial would lead, again, to his acquittal.”Da Silva’s corruption conviction has polarized Brazil: Protests erupted against the decision after it was announced it July, and were followed by counter-protests supporting Moro’s actions and the Car Wash investigations, which remain broadly popular. But even some of da Silva’s most vociferous political opponents have suggested that he shouldn’t face jail time, or a ban from future elections. In 2016, former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a long-time da Silva rival, said that voters, not judges, should determine da Silva’s fate ― an assertion da Silva’s supporters have used to bolster their claims that his conviction should be overturned and he should be allowed to run.“We cannot politicize the judiciary, or judicialize politics,” Zanin Martins insisted. “Politics are disputed in the ballot box, and should not be disputed in courts.”Brazilian political observers have reached nothing near consensus about how the panel of judges may rule.Whatever the outcome, it is clear that da Silva’s time as Brazil’s most prominent political figure won’t end quietly. He and his legal team have already filed a complaint with the United Nations human rights committee, alleging that Moro and Brazil have violated his right to a fair trial. They’ve lobbied, successfully, for global political support: over the weekend, a group of U.S.House Democrats sent a letter to Brazil’s ambassador to the United States on da Silva’s behalf. If his conviction is upheld, da Silva is prepared to exhaust his legal remedies both “nationally and internationally,” Zanin Martins said. And no matter what, the former president ― for the moment, still the most popular politician in Brazil, if no longer on Earth ― intends to continue his latest pursuit of the presidency. “If the Workers’ Party will nominate him, he will run for office, for president of Brazil,” Zanin Martins said."
8,WORLD NEWS,'The Most Popular Politician On Earth' Is Fighting To Save His Legacy -- And His Future,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lula-da-silva-corruption-brazil_us_5a639125e4b0022830033e33,"Luiz Inácio da Silva, the former Brazilian president seeking that office again, is appealing corruption charges his lawyer says are political persecution.",2018-01-23,"Despite the corruption charges, da Silva remains popular among Brazilians -- and currently leads early polls on the nation's 2018 presidential race.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a665fe72d000049009427b1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"He was, as former President Barack Obama once said, “the most popular politician on Earth.” But now, former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva finds himself locked in a battle to save his legacy and preserve his future ― which he hopes will soon include another stint as his nation’s chief executive. On Wednesday, da Silva and his lawyers will return to court to appeal his July conviction on charges of political corruption ― a case that threatens to derail his potential candidacy in elections later this year.But da Silva and his legal team are confident they will win, with one of his top lawyers arguing that the former president is the victim of a political witch hunt. “Lula is not being prosecuted but persecuted ― politically persecuted,” Valeska Zanin Martins, da Silva’s co-counsel, told HuffPost. If his conviction ultimately stands, “we are absolutely certain that it is an international legal scandal that should be reviewed internationally and historically,” she said.From 2003 to 2011, da Silva held watch over one of the world’s fastest-growing economies that ― coupled with his enactment of ambitious social welfare programs ― helped lift nearly 40 million Brazilians out of poverty. But since he left office, Brazil has fallen into a state of perpetual crisis: under his hand-picked successor, former President Dilma Rousseff, the economy collapsed. And one of the world’s largest and broadest corruption scandals ― known as Operation Car Wash ― erupted, engulfing hundreds of Brazilian politicians in the process. Da Silva ― known to Brazilians simply as “Lula” ― was among them. He is facing four separate corruption charges. Only one case has gone to trial, however, and in July Judge Sérgio Moro, who has spearheaded the Car Wash probes, convicted da Silva.Moro alleged that the former president orchestrated a vast bribery scheme involving da Silva’s leftist Workers’ Party, the Brazilian construction firm OAS, and Petrobras, the country’s state-owned oil giant. Da Silva, according to prosecutors, took more than $1 million in bribes and personally benefited by gaining access to a beachside apartment in Guarujá, a coastal town in São Paulo state.During the hearing on Wednesday, a panel of judges in the southern city of Porto Alegre will hear ― and could rule on ― da Silva’s appeal. The decision could have sweeping ramifications not just for him, but for Brazil. Da Silva’s the front-runner in early polls for Brazil’s 2018 presidential election. Brazilian law, however, bars anyone convicted of corruption from seeking office.Zanin Martins argued that da Silva’s appeal of the corruption conviction is less about his future political ambitions than about clearing the stain it has put on his name and his record.“He’s an innocent man,” Zanin Martins said. “He wants his biography cleared, of course. He said he will run for president. But it’s even more about clearing his name and making sure that history will see him for what he is, and not for what the Car Wash Operation invented.”Still, the political ramifications of da Silva’s case are impossible to ignore. The 2018 elections have loomed over Brazil since Rousseff’s impeachment in 2016 — a takedown her leftist allies saw as a “legislative coup” by centrist and conservative lawmakers eager to put an end to more than a decade of Workers’ Party rule. President Michel Temer, who inherited the top office from Rousseff, has quickly gone about eroding the left’s accomplishments: He has gotten passed drastic austerity measures that have cut health and education spending, pushed broad labor reforms the left derides as attack on workers, ended certain social welfare programs, and sought major reforms to Brazil’s generous public pension system. Couple that with the economic collapse, and much of the Brazil that da Silva helped build has disappeared: the unemployment rate has improved of late but remains above 12 percent, 4.5 million have been cut from the rolls of one popular social welfare program, and the country is at risk of sinking back onto the United Nations World Hunger Map, which would erase one of da Silva’s proudest achievements.In part because of his policies, and in part because of his own link to the corruption scandal, Temer’s comically low approval numbers place him among least popular politicians in the world — and have bolstered da Silva’s standing and chances of reclaiming the presidency next fall.Da Silva’s conviction, however, sent a shockwave across Brazil. It was a sign, many observers said, that a new era had dawned in which no one, not even a popular former president, could engage in corruption and get away with it. “It’s the president that took Brazil to relevance,” Alana Rizzo, a U.S.-based Brazilian journalist, told HuffPost at the time. “That’s the figure that [internationally] people know. When you have this guy getting convicted, now anyone can get convicted.”But da Silva and his rabid base of supporters saw it differently. Though Car Wash and other corruption investigations have implicated politicians from across the political spectrum, they alleged that this was not indicative of a strong, independent judiciary hellbent on forcing good governance on Brazil. It was, along with Rousseff’s impeachment, instead an opportunistic power play: a chance for Brazil’s political and financial elite to thwart the nation’s primary leftist party and its strongest leaders whose only crime, in this version of events, was redistributing too much of their money to the poor and working classes.Zanin Martins said the facts of the corruption case support da Silva’s innocence. Da Silva and his wife never owned the apartment that factors into the case, the lawyer argues. She also noted that more than 70 witnesses absolved da Silva of guilt during his trial. His lawyers also assert that Moro tainted the trial by illegally leaking da Silva’s phone conversations to the media. “If you look at the overwhelming evidence of innocence that we have produced in the files, it is impossible for an impartial or independent trial not to acquit Lula, or at least to declare the entire procedure null and void.” Zanin Martins said.Da Silva’s opponents have blasted him for his zealous appeal efforts, suggesting that he is undermining the judiciary’s political independence and the anti-corruption efforts. But Zanin Martins said da Silva, whose previous presidential campaigns were rooted in opposition to corruption, still supports broad efforts to fight the sort of political bribery that Car Wash has exposed as rampant across Brazil. It’s just that this case, she said, is the wrong way to do it.Da Silva is “not above the law, but he’s not beneath the law,” Zanin Martins said. “He wants a fair trial, because a fair and impartial trial would lead, again, to his acquittal.”Da Silva’s corruption conviction has polarized Brazil: Protests erupted against the decision after it was announced it July, and were followed by counter-protests supporting Moro’s actions and the Car Wash investigations, which remain broadly popular.

I was broken,” Larson said. “Larry, my coaches and USA Gymnastics turned the sport I fell in love with as a kid into my personal living hell.” Larson was one of the last women to read her victim impact statement during a week-long sentencing hearing for Nassar on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. The former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor has been accused of sexually abusing over 140 women ― many of whom were top-tier athletes ― under the guise of medical treatment. Sentencing is set to finish Wednesday morning. “No matter what Larry was supposed to be treating on me over the years, usually my ankles or my knees, his fingers always seemed to find their way inside of me,” Larson said to the courtroom. “Never once wearing gloves.”Larson articulately laid out the culture of elite gymnastics that allowed a predator like Nassar to thrive for so long. She pointed to the isolation of the infamous training center, the Karolyi Ranch (which USA Gymnastics recently cut ties with amid the Nassar scandal), as one factor that allowed Nassar’s abuse to continue.“There is an eerie feeling as soon as you step onto the Karolyi Ranch. It is completely removed from all civilization,” Larson said. “In the case of an emergency, the closest hospital is so far away you’d need to be helicoptered there. To get to the ranch, you must drive up a dirt road for what seems like an eternity. And the closest civilization is a high-security prison 30 miles away. On top of that, there’s no cell service. It’s completely isolated, and that is no mistake. That is how the Karolyis wanted it.”Larson described the grueling seven-hour practices six days a week that she and her teammates endured at the Karolyi Ranch, saying she “dreaded” going back every summer. After spiraling into a deep depression and “destructive” eating disorder at 15, Larson said she deliberately hit her head on a bathtub to get out of going back to the ranch. “One time, I was so desperate not to go, I thought faking an injury bad enough was the only way out,” Larson said as she began crying. “I was taking a bath when I decided to push the bath mat aside, splash water on the tiles, get on the floor and bang the back of my head against the tub hard enough to get a bump so it seemed like I slipped.”She added that this isolated environment allowed Nassar to prey on children for years.“The complete detachment from the outside world, on top of careless and neglectful adults, made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers and molesters to thrive,” Larson said. “But thanks to the women who have spoken here, that horrible place has been closed.”She also called out multiple people who enabled Nassar’s abuse, including current USA Gymnastics trainer Debbie Van Horn, Karolyi Ranch owner Marta Karolyi and Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon. “Marta, did you keep Larry around because he was a good doctor?” Larson asked. “Or did you really keep him around because he let us compete when we were injured and was willing to keep your secrets?” Simon said she learned about Nassar’s abuse in 2014 when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed against an unidentified doctor. “I was informed that a sports medicine doctor was under investigation,” Simon said Wednesday after she appeared in court for Nassar’s sentencing hearing. “I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth.”Neither Van Horn or Karolyi have issued responses to Larson’s statement.Larson said she’s currently working on legislation with Sen. Dianne Feinsten (D-Calif.) that would make it a federal crime for Olympic organizations not to report child sexual abuse allegations. Larson concluded her statement by addressing Nassar in court: “You took complete advantage of my innocence. Your kindness was simply a ploy to molest me every chance you got. I can’t even put into words how much I fucking hate you.”Larson’s former teammate, Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman, responded to Larson’s powerful impact statement on Twitter. Raisman says Nassar also molested her under the guise of medical treatment, and has publicly criticized USA Gymnastics for its mishandling of Nassar’s behavior. “You inspired me and you still do to this day,” Raisman wrote to Larson. “And I know SO many others are inspired by your iconic floor routines and your bravery in speaking out. You are a true role model and that is far more valuable than any medal you could ever win.” The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 after the allegations against Nassar went public. This week, three USA Gymnastics directors resigned, and John Geddert, a former Olympic coach and close friend of Nassar, retired. "

It Didn't Work.,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-dinklage-reed-morano-sundance_us_5a661358e4b0dc592a0b20d8,Peter Dinklage did not take the bait.,2018-01-23,"Peter Dinklage, Elle Fanning and Reed Morano at the IMDB Studio at Sundance on Jan. 21. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6625fe1c00003c00cce9f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARK CITY, Utah ― Peter Dinklage and Reed Morano are great friends. In fact, they are not at all competitive when it comes to their respective, massively popular prestige TV shows. No siree. I met the pair at the Grey Goose Blue Door pop-up on Main Street Sunday (yes, a heavily branded press lounge dedicated to premier vodka), shortly after the Sundance Film Festival debut of their new film, “I Think We’re Alone Now.”Over perfectly crafted bloody marys (Grey Goose, is this how I get free premier vodka?), we talked about their new movie, which revolves around a solitary man Del (Dinklage) as his post-apocalyptic life is disrupted by a carefree young woman named Grace (Elle Fanning), whose past is as mysterious as how she arrived in Del’s small, dead town. Morano, now of “Handmaid’s Tale” fame, took on the dual role of director and cinematographer after “Game of Thrones” standout Dinklage personally requested her to shoot the project.We also talked about the cutthroat rivalry behind television’s favorite auteur and everyone’s favorite Lannister. Or, at least, the rivalry we tried half-heartedly to stoke. How many Sundances have you both attended? Peter Dinklage: Ahhh. This is like my fifth. Reed Morano: I don’t know, it was 2008 to 2014 pretty much, so probably my fifth or sixth. What makes this one particularly special? It’s apparent you have a nice friendship going here, so making this movie together was probably a great experience. PD: Yeah, that’s what makes it special. RM: This movie’s basically the reason why a person would make movies, just because of how fun it was for us to make it. PD: And we just want to share it. Well, this is cool for me because my two favorite shows are colliding on this couch. Peter, how did it feel when “Game of Thrones” lost out to “The Handmaid’s Tale” at the Golden Globes?PD: Oh, whatever. I got one already, it’s fine. RM: He’s got all the awards.PD: You gotta share the wealth, you know? RM: They’re just being polite and making room for other losers. Peter, you approached Reed to be involved in this project. How did you come across the script? PD: Yeah, but without Reed this project would’ve never happened. It’s not a fascinating story ― my agent gave me the script and said, “I think you’d really like this.” And I said, “Yeah, I would if we got the right director and the right actor to play Grace.”[My agent] brought Reed to my attention. I hadn’t seen “Meadowland” [her directorial debut]. I watched “Meadowland” and immediately set up a meeting with her and we met in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, and she just inspired me. That’s all it took. And it was a lot of fun, we had some laughs, and it was a very easy decision. When did filming start? RM: Um, February? Did we shoot in January? PD: March [of last year]. It was really early spring because I remember snow was an issue. RM: Yes, and we pushed a little. PD: So it was like March-April. Was it difficult to nail down a time, since you’re both so busy with other projects? RM: That’s why I think the timing was so particular, because it was the one window that Pete had. Also, I think it coincided with my window, too. Or I kind of pushed something because this was so ready to go, and I just knew it was going to be great and I wanted to do it so bad. PD: Not to be a hippie, but everything happens for a reason, and I think both Reed and I had other things that were looming and they kind of fell apart for whatever reason. And this was never the backup plan, but it really all came together very quickly and happened perfectly. Being so busy with “Game of Thrones,” what about the script spoke to you and made you want to do the project? PD: I just like the original take on the apocalypse genre ― if it even is a genre. We’re so used to getting the same sort of well-done version of it ― because I love John Carpenter and George Miller and all those films set in an apocalypse ― but this was actually more of a personal version of that. A personal, modern take on what it would be like for one individual who isn’t a criminal, isn’t a scientist, doesn’t have explanations for it, and is not so devastated by the loss of everyone, or he doesn’t think he is. As Elle Fanning said onstage following the film’s premiere, there were no zombies, no big action sequences on why the apocalypse happened, it was more of a human story. Sometimes, though, in the back of your mind, you’re wondering, “Wait, how did everyone die? I want to know!” RM: Yeah! I mean, that’s how I kind of felt too when I first read the script, like, “Wait, I want to know. But do I need to know?” Here’s the thing: Whenever we see movies there’s a formula that they predominantly adhere to, and they answer questions and there’s a lot of exposition ― rightfully so, because people want to know answers. But every person is individual, every viewer, every audience member, and some people are going to not be satisfied that they don’t find out why that happens, but every other movie about the apocalypse is why it happens.This movie is about if you were really in the apocalypse, you don’t have a means to find out why. Instead of searching endlessly for a reason, why don’t we make it about what really matters at the end of the world, which is if you’re all that’s left, how do I exist with you? To me, it’s a particular angle to take on it and people never do that with the apocalypse, which is the exact reason why I liked it. Did that visually inspire you, too? Because the visuals and sound design truly encompass the story and immerse you in this world. RM: I think it’s restraint ― not in the sound of the music [the movie was given a Dolby Sound grant] ― but there’s restraint in the storytelling in the fact that we’re not giving all the information. And the way you learn about Grace and Del’s lives before, it’s only given to you in little dribs and drops everywhere, and I liked that in the story. But because there is restraint [in the story], you can kind of go a little crazy with the visuals and sound. PD: Obviously, one of the reasons Reed is so inspiring is because she’s also a cinematographer and the world around Elle and I is basically the third character in the movie ― this isolation, this landscape that’s so well shot and slowly coming back to life. I like that we shot it in the spring because nature is still OK, and let’s face it I’m a big eco-friendly person ― if we were all gone tomorrow the world would be a much better place. But then I love that element of the movie and Reed really captured it so well visually. The expansiveness of it all. Where did you shoot? PD: Upstate New York. How did you find that perfect setting for the movie? Did you know you wanted to have a certain feel to the town? RM: I was just Googling “library big windows” ― I found the library [that’s featured predominately in the film]. Originally, when I was visualizing the project, I imagined a dark wood library, and this was a more modern library and there were interesting lines. I was thinking “Ex Machina,” lines and windows, and I knew I was going to shoot it very naturalistically. And I thought, if we’re going to be in this library for such a long amount of time, we’re going to want a beautiful view. PD: And as much light as possible. RM: Exactly, that was the big debate. But, we got the library in Hastings-on-Hudson and the actual main street of town was in Haverstraw, which we love. We looked at Nyack and Congers, but in Haverstraw the street was so amazing ― that main street. Last question: If you had to go to a Walmart with a couple hundred bucks before the apocalypse, what would you buy? RM: Batteries, wine and gasoline. PD: Wine. Bloody mary mix. RM: Batteries, wine, gasoline, vodka and bloody mary mix. PD: Yeah, that’s all you need. RM: Coolers. A lot of coolers. PD: And ranch dressing. “I Think We’re Alone Now” is currently screening at the Sundance Film Festival. "

It wasn’t so long ago that these tiny insects disrupted their tranquil life and nearly killed Oo.  Once a well-travelled education consultant, Oo now lives on the Malaysian island of Penang with his wife and son. His joints frequently swell and ache, a physical reminder of the events that brought him to the edge of death.Over the course of just a few weeks in 2009, Oo fell victim to a staggering sequence of viruses. First, he was infected with the flu-like dengue fever, fairly common in this part of the world. Then he caught the less common chikungunya, which is similar to and often confused with dengue but can cause disfigurement and disabling joint pain that persists for years. Finally, he caught a more severe strain of dengue and nearly died.There is no cure for dengue or chikungunya, and both spread via the same two species of mosquito that carry the Zika virus. Though Oo’s experience was unusual, it illustrates how these mosquito-borne diseases spread on the backs of urbanization, globalization and climate change. Such illnesses, which have expanded across the world increasingly in the past decade, are making inroads into Europe and the Americas, raising fears among experts that outbreaks could become more severe. The legacy of Oo’s illnesses are still evident in his family’s home. The family always keeps two large cans of insecticide at hand. Oo’s son, Adrian, even decided to research chikungunya for his doctorate. And then there are the memories.When Oo first fell ill with dengue, his temperature was so high that he stayed in the hospital for a week. After a couple more weeks, he was sick again ― they thought it was related to the dengue, but his joints were swollen and his eyes hurt. When his temperature spiked, he went back to the hospital and tested positive for chikungunya, which was then sweeping through his neighborhood.“My hands hurt so much that I couldn’t hold a spoon,” Oo said of his chikungunya. “I couldn’t hold a cup.” He recovered quickly after the first week of chikungunya, but only weeks later a third mosquito bite delivered a dangerous form of dengue. Oo had never felt so sick. Doctors told him he’d need blood transfusions to keep him strong while the virus raged inside him.That last fight was the toughest. But at least he recovered. Others have not been so lucky.As extreme weather events like massive floods and storms become more common, conditions grow more favorable for mosquitoes to breed, and more mosquitoes mean more of the diseases they carry. But some scientists warn it would be simplistic to blame climate change alone for the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases. Instead, they point to a variety of interconnected factors that allow mosquitoes to thrive, including the effects that human activities can have on ecosystems, such as rapid urban construction, deforestation, mass migration and political and economic instability. Scientists are also concerned that cases of chikungunya, dengue and Zika are being under-reported. Some infected people may have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Nevertheless, these diseases are suddenly more visible than they’ve been in the past.Dengue is one the fastest-growing infectious diseases in the world, and the World Health Organization says there may be as many as 390 million new cases each year.The human Zika virus infection, initially endemic in equatorial Africa and Asia, has also expanded its geographical range. In 2007 it emerged in the Pacific region and the Americas as a more serious infection than previously reported. Also in 2007, chikungunya transmission was reported for the first time in Europe: 197 cases in the Emilia Romagna region of northern Italy. The disease had mostly occurred in Africa, the Americas, the Indian subcontinent and wide areas of Asia. Last year, the WHO reported outbreaks in Italy and France.In 2013 the disease re-appeared in the Caribbean after 200 years. Since then, local transmission has been identified in 45 countries or territories throughout the Americas, with more than 1.7 million suspected cases reported to the Pan American Health Organization. Chikungunya went undetected for seven years in Malaysia between 1999 and 2006, which led to speculation it had been eliminated. But it then re-emerged in a reported outbreak in the country’s north, reaching 13,759 reported cases by 2009. The disease now returns in regular outbreaks. Last year, a team of researchers from the University of Malaya (which included Adrian Oo) reported 269 cases, mostly in the north.Oo Boon Siew is a living testament to the resurgence of chikungunya in his homeland: He holds out his hands, the knuckles swollen even after eight years. He feels pain in his joints about once a month. It’s sometimes worse during the rainy season.“My son, Adrian, forbids me to complain now that he studies it,” Oo said of the disease. “He explained that for some people it is much worse.”Adrian, now 25, was taking his high school exams when his father became sick. Those months left such an impression that he decided to study medicine and specifically to research chikungunya.  Chikungunya is more often found in rural areas of Malaysia, but the area where the Oo family lives could hardly be called rural. The picturesque island of Penang has experienced an explosion of new construction in recent years. Building sites now scar a landscape previously thick with forests. This growth benefits businesses and tourists, but also disease-carrying mosquitoes, which thrive in urban environments with numerous construction sites. Floods are also more common now in Penang, helping to fuel the insect problem. Oo says he’s never been sick like he was in 2009. “That’s when they started building all around the area where I live, and stagnant water from building sites was a breeding camp for mosquitoes,” he said.Adrian now forbids his parents from going on runs in the park during the rainy season.“My wife and I used to go very often. But now there’s no discussion, Adrian feels it’s too dangerous,” said Oo.Around the world, disease-carrying mosquitoes are developing resistances to the most common insecticides, including those used to fumigate buildings when an outbreak occurs, according to Dr. Low Van Lun, a senior lecturer on tropical diseases at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur.Recent studies have looked at genetically modifying mosquitoes and releasing sterilized males. “But some are afraid it will affect the ecosystem, killing frogs for example, while the long-term consequences are unpredictable and we could be left with only very strong mosquitoes and the consequences of the bite are unknown,” Dr Low said.For now, Oo is the only one in his family who can laugh at the sight of a mosquito. People who have already had chikungunya or strains of dengue are likely to develop immunities, so he probably won’t get those diseases again. His wife and son are still vulnerable, however.“They are terrified, but I had everything already, so I’m the only one who’s not afraid,” he said.This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them.

Howard Miller’s iconic World War II “Rosie the Riveter” poster died on Saturday at the age of 96, her family confirmed to The New York Times.Naomi Parker Fraley was 20 years old when she and her younger sister, Ada, went to work at the Naval Air Station in Alameda, California, following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor.They were tasked with drilling and patching airplane wings and riveting, The New York Times reported. A photographer touring the station snapped a photo of Fraley wearing a red-and-white polka-dot bandana as she worked a vertical turret lathe, and the image was published in newspapers around the country. The photograph reportedly caught the attention of Miller, who portrayed a flexing, bandana-clad woman in his now-iconic poster.For years, the woman in the photo was thought to be Geraldine Hoff Doyle, who worked as a metal presser in a Michigan plant during the war.When Fraley attended a reunion at the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park in 2009, she saw a copy of the photo captioned with Doyle’s name.“I couldn’t believe it, because it was me in the photo, but there was somebody else’s name in the caption,” she told People magazine in 2016. “I was amazed.”Scholar James J. Kimble, an associate professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, had also been researching “Rosie’s” true identity and zeroed in on Fraley. He published his findings in a 2016 article in the journal Rhetoric and Public Affairs.“There is no question that she is the ‘lathe woman’ in the photograph,” Kimble told The New York Times.Fraley and her sister were among millions of American women who entered the workforce during World War II, filling gaps in the labor force left by men who had gone off to fight. These women fulfilled a range of instrumental tasks, including producing planes and munitions, serving on ration boards, volunteering for the American Red Cross and driving trucks.A Senate resolution last year designated March 21, 2017 as National Rosie the Riveter Day to honor their efforts.After her stint at the naval air station, Fraley went on to waitress at a restaurant in Palm Springs and later got married and started a family. Her Facebook page proudly displayed an image of the “Rosie” poster, Fraley smiling and flexing her arm beside it.“The women of this country these days need some icons,” she told People magazine. “If they think I’m one, I’m happy about that.”"

The 26-year-old freeskier secured a spot on the men’s slopestyle Olympic team Sunday, making him one of two openly gay men competing for the U.S. at the Winter Games for the first time in history. (Figure skater Adam Rippon is the other.) The news came just two days after Kenworthy was named a brand ambassador for Head & Shoulders shampoo. The company showed the first television commercial from its “Shoulders of Greatness” campaign starring the Olympian on Jan. 19. Though the ad shows Kenworthy hitting the slopes, it celebrates the history-making aspect of his achievement and his role as an LGBTQ rights advocate above all else. “My shoulders carry more than my country’s pride,” he says in the clip, hoisting a rainbow flag. “They carry my community’s pride, my family’s pride, and pride in myself.” The significance of appearing before a rainbow flag in a nationally televised ad isn’t lost on the athlete, who said the campaign “resonated” with his journey. “Before coming out, I was carrying so much pressure that I put on myself,” Kenworthy, who first opened up about his sexuality in a 2015 interview with ESPN magazine after competing at the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, a year prior, said in a statement. “It wasn’t until I made the decision to come out that I was able to release that weight off my shoulders and find the confidence to be myself, which allowed me to perform my best.”He shared his excitement with fans on Twitter and Instagram. John Brownlee, Head & Shoulders’ brand director, praised Kenworthy as a worthy inspiration for athletes and would-be Olympians. “He has pushed through personal and social barriers to compete at the highest level … and at his personal best,” Brownlee said in a statement. “We are so excited to be on this journey with him at the upcoming Olympic Winter Games, and we know he will inspire others to shoulder their own greatness, no matter what obstacles they face.”In addition to the commercial, Kenworthy will star in a new Complex video series that “dives deeper into how he’s been able to shoulder the compounding pressures of being a successful athlete” and explores his coming out journey. No doubt Kenworthy’s accomplishments put him in a unique position when it comes to influencing the global conversation on queer acceptance. Go Gus!"

But after the original L’Oréal announcement, people had quickly bashed certain critical remarks she made about Israel, which have since been deleted.Khan wrote that she chose to set down from the L’Oréal campaign because “current conversations ... detract from the positive and inclusive sentiment that it set out to deliver.”She was the first woman in a hijab to be part of a mainstream ad campaign for hair care. “How many brands are doing things like this? Not many,” Khan told Vogue UK last week upon the initial announcement. “They’re literally putting a girl in a headscarf ― whose hair you can’t see ― in a hair campaign. Because what they’re really valuing through the campaign is the voices that we have.”“We have recently been made aware of a series of tweets posted in 2014 by Amena Kahn,” L’Oréal said in a statement to HuffPost. “We appreciate that Amena has since apologized for the content of these tweets and the offense they have caused. L’Oréal Paris is committed to tolerance and respect towards all people. We agree with her decision to step down from the campaign.”This is not the first time L’Oréal has hired and then almost immediately parted ways with a diverse model over previous social media posts. Five months ago, the company cut ties with Monroe Bergdorf, its first transgender model, over her remarks about white America’s systemic racism.L’Oréal had been applauded for its decision to hire Khan in the first place."

But it gave them a way out of what could have been a politically damaging shutdown. And the promise, although it could be reneged on, is something that they didn’t have before. It’s the first time Democrats received a hard date for a vote on an immigration bill. And if McConnell doesn’t follow through, Democrats will be able to use this promise to vote against the next spending bill and pin the blame on Republicans.Read the latest updates below:"

21,POLITICS,Solar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-solar-tariff_us_5a66328de4b0022830057908,The solar industry created 1 in every 50 new American jobs in 2016.,2018-01-22,President Trump's decision to impose a 30 percent tariff on imported solar equipment marks his most striking blow to renewable energy yet. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6674732d000049009427ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the past five years, the solar industry in the United States has boomed, becoming a reliable employment engine and giving hope to policymakers seeking to stave off the worst effects of climate change. But late Monday afternoon, President Donald Trump approved import fees that analysts say will send the price of solar panels surging and halt hiring in an industry that has grown 17 times faster than the U.S. economy.“It’s political fodder to make the United States look like it’s tough on China, and it’s protecting American jobs,” Noah Ginsburg, a director at a New York-based nonprofit that helps low-income communities install solar panels, told HuffPost. “But the reality on the ground is deploying these tariffs will destroy American jobs and negatively impact anyone who wants to participate in and benefit from clean energy.” Solar companies created 1 in 50 new jobs in the U.S. in 2016, with the help of imported solar panels that drastically reduced prices. (The Solar Foundation projects that number will be even higher for 2017; its report on last year’s figures is due out in a few weeks.) Most of those jobs are at companies that install solar panels on rooftops and build large solar farms for utilities and big corporations. At the same time, domestic solar panel manufacturers have suffered, unable to compete with cheaper rivals from abroad. Last year, Suniva, a Georgia-based manufacturer owned by a Chinese company, filed a trade complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) after declaring bankruptcy, arguing that it’s impossible to compete with cheap imports. In May, SolarWorld, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel maker, joined the complaint. The companies requested that the White House impose fees on imported panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the price of solar cells from about 33 cents to roughly 78 cents per watt.Instead, Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported solar panels, decreasing by 5 percent per year over four years. The decision is in line with what the ITC recommended in October, a proposal Suniva called “disappointing.”About half of all solar equipment used in the U.S. this year is projected to come from overseas. The fees are forecast to reduce solar installations by 10 percent over five years, according to new calculations by GTM Research, a renewable energy market data firm. The Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said the tariffs would lead to 23,000 job losses this year alone in both the solar installation and manufacturing sectors. “While tariffs in this case will not create adequate cell or module manufacturing to meet U.S. demand, or keep foreign-owned Suniva and SolarWorld afloat, they will create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs,” Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s chief executive, said in a scathing press release. In a joint statement, Suniva and SolarWold “applauded” Trump, but urged him to increase the first-year tariff to 50 percent. “Our companies and workers are grateful to hear the President understands the seriousness of the problem facing our solar manufacturers in Michigan, Georgia, Oregon and across the country,” said the statement, signed by SolarWorld Americas Inc. CEO Juergen Stein and Suniva executive vice president Matt Card. “Now the President can save and rebuild this great American industry and create thousands of jobs by immediately imposing 50 percent tariffs ― the strongest tariffs possible.” Their complaint marked the first major trade case before the Trump administration, and offered a fascinating test of the president’s “American First” nationalist agenda, which has pushed fossil fuel production as its primary energy policy. The president, who has railed against renewable energy and dismissed climate change as a hoax, had significant discretion over Monday’s decision, which loomed over the industry for months. The precise impact of the tariffs remains difficult to assess. Up to three-quarters of the solar projects scheduled for construction this year could be exempted, in part because companies already stockpiled imported equipment, Ethan Zindler, a Washington, D.C.-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, told HuffPost. “But the 2019 build could be a very different story,” he said.The tariffs appear targeted to Chinese solar equipment, but the wording of the announcement was unclear, making it difficult to gauge how it will affect imports from Southeast Asia and Mexico. “It’s not great news for the industry,” Zindler concluded. “But it certainly could have been worse.”The White House’s announcement came as a relief to cynics who expected the president to impose the sort of draconian tariffs Suniva and SolarWorld proposed. That would have cost the industry 88,000 jobs nationwide, about 34 percent of the 260,000 Americans employed in solar in 2017, according to calculations released last June by SEIA. At risk would be 6,300 jobs in Texas, 4,700 in North Carolina “and a whopping 7,000 in South Carolina,” the group said.Utility-scale projects, which, because of their size, are more sensitive to hardware price fluctuations, would face the biggest slowdown. That leaves the Southeast, where utilities have commissioned a massive surge of solar projects since 2015, particularly vulnerable to higher tariffs.“Those plants haven’t been built yet, they’re just planned,” MJ Shiao, a solar analyst at GTM Research, told HuffPost ahead of Monday’s announcement. “The price of these plants won’t be able to pencil out, and they will be canceled.”Wind energy developers could see a major benefit as states seeking to increase renewable energy capacity bolster incentives to build new turbines in place of solar farms. Natural gas, already the primary fuel of electricity in the U.S., would likely see a boost, too. Coal, the country’s second-biggest source of electricity, would be unlikely to see a major impact because its main competitor for market share remains natural gas. Despite its recent gains, solar makes up just a fraction of renewable energy’s 15 percent share of U.S. electricity generation.“More good-paying jobs will be jeopardized by today’s decision than could possibly be saved by bailing out the bankrupt companies that petitioned for protection,” said Clark Packard, trade policy counsel at the R Street Institute, a conservative think tank that advocates for climate change action. “Today’s decision also will jeopardize the environment by making clean energy sources less affordable.” Solar installation companies warned that tariffs could cost manufacturing jobs, too, as an industry tide pulled by cheap imports recedes and lowers all ships. Still, despite its struggles with cheap imports, the manufacturing sector saw a few bright spots before Trump decided to impose tariffs. In June, Chinese-owned Seraphim Solar announced plans to double the workforce at its Jackson, Mississippi, module-making plant. In August, Tesla’s SolarCity division began producing solar cells at its new factory in Buffalo, New York. And trade disputes between countries have made manufacturing giants in Asia look abroad for new options.“There are spats between the European Union and China and India and China,” Zindler said ahead of the announcement. “A lot of Asian manufacturers are already looking to diversify where they are manufacturing.”“But it takes a few years,” he added. “So it’s not like immediately you’d have a flood of factories in the U.S. owned by the Chinese. That won’t happen overnight.”While Monday’s announcement marks the White House’s most significant blow to renewables yet, the Trump administration has consistently fought clean energy policies.Last year, Trump proposed a 2018 budget that slashed funding for the Energy Department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by 71.9 percent. The administration pushed a proposal designed by coal baron and Trump ally Bob Murray to bail out coal and nuclear power plants with a plan that would add $10.8 billion in ratepayer costs. The Environmental Protection Agency moved to repeal the Clean Power Plan, the nation’s only major federal program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and incentivize utility-scale clean energy investments. The White House also illegally withheld $91 million in funding to ARPA-E, an experimental energy research program responsible for “holy grail” breakthroughs in battery storage technology.  “If Trump really wants to put America first, he should reduce our reliance on polluting energy sources that fuel climate change,” said Howard Crystal, a senior attorney with the environmental nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity. “Instead, this profoundly political move will make solar power more expensive for everyday Americans while propping up two failing, foreign-owned companies.”"
22,POLITICS,Solar Industry Braces For Job Losses As Trump Puts Fees On Imported Panels,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-solar-tariff_us_5a66328de4b0022830057908,The solar industry created 1 in every 50 new American jobs in 2016.,2018-01-22,This chart — from the nonprofit Solar Foundation’s National Solar Jobs Census report last year — counted any job that required 50 percent or more of a worker’s time to be devoted to solar energy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6669721d000026006ac7cd.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the past five years, the solar industry in the United States has boomed, becoming a reliable employment engine and giving hope to policymakers seeking to stave off the worst effects of climate change. But late Monday afternoon, President Donald Trump approved import fees that analysts say will send the price of solar panels surging and halt hiring in an industry that has grown 17 times faster than the U.S. economy.“It’s political fodder to make the United States look like it’s tough on China, and it’s protecting American jobs,” Noah Ginsburg, a director at a New York-based nonprofit that helps low-income communities install solar panels, told HuffPost. “But the reality on the ground is deploying these tariffs will destroy American jobs and negatively impact anyone who wants to participate in and benefit from clean energy.” Solar companies created 1 in 50 new jobs in the U.S. in 2016, with the help of imported solar panels that drastically reduced prices. (The Solar Foundation projects that number will be even higher for 2017; its report on last year’s figures is due out in a few weeks.) Most of those jobs are at companies that install solar panels on rooftops and build large solar farms for utilities and big corporations. At the same time, domestic solar panel manufacturers have suffered, unable to compete with cheaper rivals from abroad. Last year, Suniva, a Georgia-based manufacturer owned by a Chinese company, filed a trade complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) after declaring bankruptcy, arguing that it’s impossible to compete with cheap imports. In May, SolarWorld, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German panel maker, joined the complaint. The companies requested that the White House impose fees on imported panels under the 1974 Trade Act that would more than double the price of solar cells from about 33 cents to roughly 78 cents per watt.Instead, Trump approved a 30 percent fee on all imported solar panels, decreasing by 5 percent per year over four years. The decision is in line with what the ITC recommended in October, a proposal Suniva called “disappointing.”About half of all solar equipment used in the U.S. this year is projected to come from overseas. The fees are forecast to reduce solar installations by 10 percent over five years, according to new calculations by GTM Research, a renewable energy market data firm.

In her powerful, 19-minute testimony, Miller said she had known Nassar for years and experienced frequent sexual abuse by the doctor.The last “treatment,” she said, occurred in August 2016, a week before MSU terminated his employment following a complaint filed against him by Rachael Denhollander. “I’m possibly the last child he will ever assault,” Miller said.She said that even in the wake of dozens of women and girls coming forward with allegations of Nassar’s sexual abuse, “My mom is still getting billed” by MSU Sports Medicine “for appointments where I was sexually assaulted.”A representative from MSU told HuffPost on Monday that “patients of former MSU physician Larry Nassar will not be billed.”Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison in December on child pornography charges. He has also been accused of serially sexually abusing over 125 women when they were minors. The former USAG doctor pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November.Amid the disturbing revelations about Nassar’s conduct, many of his victims have accused MSU and USAG of not doing enough to halt the abuse. The Detroit News reported last week that at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were warned about Nassar’s sexual abuse over the course of two decades and allegedly did nothing to stop it.MSU has repeatedly denied covering up Nassar’s behavior. “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. ... MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.”"

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, told me on SiriusXM Progress that the word on Capitol Hill is that the story of a Russia-NRA-Trump link is going to grow.“FBI counterintelligence investigators have focused on the activities of Alexander Torshin, the deputy governor of Russia’s central bank who is known for his close relationships with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the NRA,” Stone and Gordon reported being told by two sources familiar with the matter.The journalists noted that it’s “illegal to use foreign money to influence federal elections.”The same day their story ran, Gordon told me on SiriusXM Progress he and Stone are fairly certain the Torshin investigation is part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe.“We’re confident that this is Mueller,” he said. “There’s no part of the FBI that is doing Trump and Russia and not working for Mueller.” The Kremlin’s alleged outreach to the NRA, Stone observed, “can be looked at as another part of the way that Russia is trying to build political links in the U.S., and that’s what the suspicions are.”The NRA reported spending a record amount of money on the 2016 elections: $55 million. That includes over $30 million pushing for the election of Trump, which is three times what the group spent to advance Mitt Romney’s campaign in 2012.When I asked about the McClatchy report on Friday, Lieu, a former prosecutor who has been outspoken on Twitter about alleged collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, said, “The rumors I’ve heard on Capitol Hill are that the NRA-Kremlin story is going to get bigger, particularly because we’re talking about some potentially very large sums of money being involved.”Lieu underscored the possible significance of the story with a telling comparison to Watergate.“It’s ironic that when you think about Watergate, one of the lines we followed was, ‘Follow the money,’” he commented.The congressman also weighed in on reports that former White House strategist Steve Bannon, whose recent falling-out with Trump cost him his perch as chairman of Breitbart News, was subpoenaed by Mueller to testify.“He is going to testify under penalty of perjury and he is going to testify at a time when Donald Trump and his associates have abandoned Steve Bannon,” Lieu said. “I think Donald Trump and his associates are in some serious legal jeopardy.” "

Dreamer activists felt betrayed. Sitting in the gallery above the Senate floor, 33-year-old Karina Ruiz started to cry when she watched the first vote to end the government shutdown. “I really [had] hopes and expectations that Democrats would hold the line for us, that they would hold their vote,” Ruiz, executive director of Arizona Dream Act Coalition and a mother of three, said afterwards. “We would send a message that this is urgent.” For months, undocumented immigrants have urged Democrats to oppose government funding bills unless they did something to help Dreamers, about 700,000 of whom will lose deportation relief because President Donald Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Senate Democrats stood with Dreamers on Friday and voted against a four-week spending bill, but just days later on Monday they agreed to a three-week measure, insisting it wasn’t a cave because they had received a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would hold a vote on a DACA protection bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8. The deal wasn’t nothing. But it wasn’t what Dreamers asked for, or what Democrats promised. So on Monday, these undocumented immigrants were left in search of a way forward in a battle that has extended far longer than many had hoped, keeping them in Washington and away from family, school and work. After Monday’s vote, more than 50 Dreamers gathered in a park across from the Capitol in a circle, some of them holding back tears and putting their arms around each another. Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for the Dreamer-led group United We Dream, asked them to raise a hand if they felt disappointed. Everyone did.She then asked them to take a step forward for a series of prompts. They stepped toward the center when she asked if they believed in their hearts that they would win the fight for protections, and again when she said they would not allow politicians to lie to them, and again when she said they are worthy and loved. She asked them to send love to Republicans who oppose their cause and forgiveness to Democrats who lost their spine. “We’re not done,” Martinez Rosas said before leading the group in a battle cry. It was an especially difficult day for Antonio Jauregui, a 20-year-old college student who came to the U.S. when he was five, because it is the one-year anniversary of his grandfather’s death. He said he’d like to be at home with family in California to remember and honor his grandfather, but instead has been in Washington for weeks pleading with lawmakers to fight for him. Jauregui had DACA protections but they expired in September and his renewal application was caught in postal delays. His application is now pending, but in the meantime, he is at risk, just like an estimated 122 other DACA recipients across the country who lose protections each day. He was disappointed by Monday’s events and the fact that Democrats agreed to move forward on a short-term government funding bill based only on a promise for a future immigration vote. “Promises aren’t going to protect our community,” Jauregui said. “Promises aren’t going to grant us a permanent solution. Promises aren’t going to do anything for the DACA recipients like myself who have already lost status. We were really counting on their actions.”Isaias Guerrero, a 33-year-old who works with the Fair Immigration Reform Movement advocacy group, still has DACA protection for another 602 days. He knows because he has a countdown on his computer and has been watching the days tick down since Trump rescinded the program. Guerrero was surprised at what happened on Monday. “We’re just very hurt that we were betrayed once again, both I think by Democrats and by Republicans,” he said. “I thought that they actually were going to listen.” "
26,WORLD NEWS,Pope Francis Offers Partial Apology To Clergy Sex Abuse Victims After Demand For 'Proof',Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pope-francis-apology-sex-abuse_us_5a65fe55e4b0e5630071c663,But the pope didn't waver in his support for a controversial Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse.,2018-01-22,Pope Francis gestures during a Jan. 22 news conference during his flight back from a trip to Chile and Peru.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a66090321000029007c75a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pope Francis partially apologized for last week’s brusque attack on victims of sex abuse by the clergy ― but he continued supporting a controversial Chilean bishop accused of protecting an abusive priest.On board a papal flight from Peru to Rome late Sunday, the pontiff acknowledged to journalists that his demand to see “proof” that Bishop Juan Barros Madrid had been complicit in the abuse of minors could have hit victims like a “slap in the face.” He said he realized that his words on Thursday implied that victims’ accusations of sexual abuse are only credible with concrete evidence. “To hear that the pope says to their face, ‘Bring me a letter with proof,’ is a slap in the face” that he didn’t intend, Francis said, according to The Associated Press. Although he apologized for asking for “proof,” he suggested the testimony of victims against Barros is still not enough.“I can’t condemn [Barros] because I don’t have evidence. But I’m also convinced that he’s innocent,” the pope said, according to AP. Francis said that “covering up abuse is an abuse in itself,” according to Catholic News Service. But if he punished Barros without moral certainty, “I would be committing the crime of a bad judge.”Advocates for victims of clergy sex abuse were stunned and angered last week by Francis’ impassioned defense of Barros. Some victims say Barros was aware of and even observed abuse carried out by his former mentor, the Rev. Fernando Karadima. In 2011, the Vatican found Karadima guilty of sexually abusing boys and removed him from active ministry.When asked about the controversy by a reporter in Iquique, Chile, on Jan. 18, Francis said, “The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk. But there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander. Is that clear?”Juan Carlos Cruz, one of Karadima’s most vocal victims, was angered by Francis’ demand for “proof.”“As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching everything,” Cruz wrote on Twitter, according to a BBC translation.Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the archbishop of Boston and the chairman of the Vatican’s commission on sexual abuse, also was critical of the pope’s comments, saying in a statement that he understands how Francis’ words were a “source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.” “Words that convey the message ‘if you cannot prove your claims then you will not be believed’ abandon those who have suffered reprehensible criminal violations of their human dignity and relegate survivors to discredited exile,” O’Malley said.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, the pope said he regretted using the word “proof,” since it was “not the best word to use to approach a wounded heart,” Catholic News Service reported. He said “evidence” was a better description of what he was looking for. “Of course, I know that there are many abused people who cannot bring proof [or] they don’t have it,” he said. “Or at times they have it but they are ashamed and cover it up and suffer in silence. The tragedy of the abused is tremendous.”The pope also revealed that Barros had offered his resignation twice. But Francis refused to accept the offer both times, Crux reported.“I said no. You don’t play like that, because this is admitting previous guilt,” Francis told reporters.The pope said that the Vatican had investigated the matter and that no one had yet provided him with convincing evidence against the bishop. He said that he hasn’t personally heard from any victim of Barros, although he has an “open heart to receive” that evidence.“I haven’t heard from a victim of Barros. They didn’t come [to meet me]. They gave no evidence,” Francis said.In the meantime, the pope is doubling down on his insistence that those who make accusations without providing evidence are guilty of slander. “To insist, without evidence on one thing or the other, is a calumny,” he said, per Crux.Many advocates for abuse victims told HuffPost last week that they feared Francis’ words would discourage survivors from coming forward because of a lack of evidence. In cases of child sexual abuse, there is often little evidence beyond the testimony of the victim.Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online database BishopAccountability.org, told HuffPost that in his latest remarks, Francis once again seems to be blaming the victims ― this time, for not trying to meet with him. Doyle said church investigators have already extensively studied the claims made by Karadima’s victims, in order to deliver the 2011 ruling against the priest. She doesn’t understand how it’s possible for Francis to claim the Barros case was “studied and studied again” if that investigation didn’t also include gathering testimony from victims and other witnesses.“Few Catholic abuse cases in the world have involved as much testimony and investigation as the Karadima case. Between the church, criminal and civil cases, the victims surely have attested repeatedly about the role of Barros and the other Karadima protégés,” Doyle told HuffPost in an email. “By blaming the victims for not giving evidence, the Pope either is being deceptive or revealing his ignorance of this crucial case.”The story has been updated with more details of the pope’s Sunday press conference and with comment from Anne Barret Doyle."

Eastern Ghouta is the last major rebel position close to the capital.The health directorate for opposition-held areas in the Damascus region said patient symptoms “suggest they have been exposed to chlorine gas inhalation”.It said patients said the smell around the attack site resembled chlorine.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, quoting local medical and other sources, said “gasses” released during a dawn rocket attack on Douma city caused “cases of suffocation”.The Observatory said a gas was also used during a rocket attack last week on the enclave.A witness in the area said people had fled the area of the attack and were receiving treatment for breathing problems at medical centers.In the past two years, a joint U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inquiry has found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin and has also several times used chlorine as a weapon.It has also said Islamic State has used sulfur mustard."

29,POLITICS,Federal Workers Forced To Go Without Pay As Government Shutdown Extends To Day 3,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shutdown-day-3_us_5a6557f4e4b0dc592a0a0e91,"The shutdown is now extending into the work week, and the effects will be far more visible.",2018-01-22,The entrance station to the north entrance to Yellowstone National Park was closed on Jan. 21 but visitors were allowed to enter the park with the understanding that there are no government services due to the government shutdown. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6558ab1c00002600cce896.jpeg?cache=HDkzX4r3z7&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The government shutdown is about to get a lot more visible.Congress wasn’t able to come up with a deal to reopen the government Sunday, meaning the shutdown will extend to the third day on Monday ― the start of the work week. Tourist spots like the National Zoo and the Smithsonian museums remained open over the weekend, but they will be closed on Tuesday, if the shutdown continues. Sightseers who haven’t been following the news will be left locked out and disappointed.Thousands of federal workers will also be forced to go without pay. Some ― those who are deemed “non-essential” ― may have to show up for work Monday morning and then be told to go home. Others will have to work without getting paid.Congress has to pass legislation authorizing pay for employees who work during the shutdown, which it normally does. Still, some people are worried it might not happen this time. “The biggest concern for most government workers is that we will not receive back pay once everything is resolved,” said one U.S. Department of Agriculture employee. “The president has to sign on for back pay. No guarantee with the current president.”In 2013, the last time the government shut down, about 800,000 workers were furloughed. A similar number is expected to be affected this time. Many federal workers who spoke with HuffPost say they have come to expect shutdowns at this point. Congress has been lurching from short-term spending bill to short-term spending bill, with the prospect of a shutdown constantly in the background. It is, unfortunately, the new normal ― even when one party controls the White House and has majorities in Congress. “I have to say, while I’m not exactly thrilled about not being paid, at this point I want a real resolution. No more continuing resolutions,” said a Census Bureau employee. “No more waiting until later to do something for the Dreamers. No more delays in funding [the Children’s Health Insurance Program]. I don’t want even the small amount of anxiety this is causing me personally to be for naught.”The shutdown is also affecting offices on Capitol Hill. One staffer said he and some others in his office were told they would be furloughed, which was frustrating considering other offices declared their entire staff to be “essential” and therefore able to work. The application of the furlough rules was similarly spotty in 2013. Some offices argue it’s important that they be able to respond to constituents during the shutdown, while others have said they should be following the same rules as federal agencies. “I just want to come to work and serve our constituents in whatever limited way I can during a shutdown. I don’t care if my pay is delayed,” said the Hill staffer. “You would think a congressional office would want that attitude. Now I get why people hate the government.”Federal workers have also expressed frustration at how little guidance they’ve received about the shutdown and how it will affect them ― a marked contrast to what happened in 2013, under President Barack Obama’s administration.On Friday morning, for example ― just hours before the government shut down ― an official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said her agency was working on its contingency plans. However, she also said the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget had ordered FEMA not to communicate those plans to other employees. The administration didn’t want to look like it didn’t have faith in Congress to get the job done.The Senate adjourned Sunday with no resolution, although a group of moderate senators in both parties has been working on a potential compromise: fund the government until Feb. 8 and promise to vote on immigration legislation before then. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated Sunday that he backed such an agreement, giving hope to some lawmakers that the end could be near. Many Democrats, however, are skeptical of once again delaying assistance for Dreamers ― the young undocumented immigrants whose protections were taken away by President Donald Trump ― and it’s not clear whether such an arrangement could get through the House. Correction: This piece originally said the Smithsonian museums and zoo will be closed Monday. They will remain open Monday and then be closed thereafter. "

McConnell said it was his intention for the Senate to finish, “as quickly as possible,” a large appropriations deal that would address spending and disaster relief, as well as continue negotiations on border security and protections for young undocumented immigrants at risk of losing deportation protections after President Donald Trump rescinded the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. “However,” McConnell said, “should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on February 8, 2018 ― assuming that the government remains open ― it would be my intention to proceed to legislation that would address DACA, border security, and related issues.”That statement, almost certainly negotiated between McConnell and other senators, could be key to shifting the positions of lawmakers who voted against the four-week spending bill on Friday. In fact, Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), two of the four Republicans who opposed the deal, said they would support the three-week bill after McConnell’s announcement.Flake said McConnell made a “significant” concession that Democrats shouldn’t ignore. And the Arizona Republican argued that Democrats have another opportunity to force an immigration vote during negotiations over yearly spending limits Congress set for defense and non-defense programs in 2011.“That’s a lot of leverage,” Flake said.But McConnell will need seven Democrats to flip as well. That’s a tall order, considering many of them have stated publicly that they won’t support a deal without a vote to immediately help so-called Dreamers, or young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and are now at risk of losing deportation relief. Many Democrats are concerned that McConnell won’t follow through on holding an immigration vote or that, even if he does, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) won’t do the same.“There’s been a lot of promises made to different senators that have not been followed through on by the majority leader, so I would be very leery of anything that wasn’t extremely, extremely clear and detailed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told reporters before McConnell’s speech.House conservatives were also watching McConnell’s speech closely. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) was hanging around the Senate on Sunday night, intercepting McConnell and talking with reporters.After McConnell’s speech on the Senate floor announcing his intention to bring up DACA legislation, Meadows noted that McConnell had not specified exactly what kind of DACA bill he’d bring up.“He didn’t make a commitment to one bill or another, which is a good sign,” Meadows told HuffPost.House Republicans are working on a DACA bill that appears to be a non-starter with Democrats. It would supply funding for Trump’s border wall. It would limit family reunification immigration, which Republicans call “chain migration,” and end the diversity visa lottery program ― both things Trump has demanded ― along with a host of other immigration enforcement measures. In exchange, it would legislatively codify DACA, allowing recipients to stay but not have a path to permanent legal status or citizenship. That’s the bill conservatives want.McConnell said he would have an amendment process on a DACA bill that would be “fair to all sides.” But Democrats still seem to have doubts about the majority leader not putting his thumb on the scale during the immigration debate, particularly if it’s going to be all for naught in the House.McConnell appears to be hoping his statement might sway some more Democrats to vote for the three-week funding bill. But it’s clear the Senate is still short of the votes if its vote has been delated by several hours. Barring some breakthrough on Monday morning, the three-week continuing resolution will still fail and senators will be back to the drawing board.The government technically shut down at 12 a.m. Jan. 20 after senators ― most of the Democratic caucus and four Republicans ― blocked a four-week continuing resolution. Many of the senators said they would not support a bill unless it included protections for Dreamers. Others voted “no” because they said a string of CRs wasn’t a responsible way to run the government, and emphasized the need for a full-year funding bill. Lawmakers stayed in Washington for the weekend to find a deal, but it has proven difficult given the massive gulf between what Democrats and Republicans want ― and differences in what Republicans in the House, Senate and White House want. Democrats want action on a Dreamer bill, or at least a firm commitment that both chambers will hold a vote on one, before they will support reopening the government. Republican leaders in Congress haven’t been willing to go that far, and the White House has said it won’t negotiate on immigration in any way until the government shutdown ends. Trump has been seemingly absent from the weekend negotiations. The president stayed in Washington over the weekend, despite having a celebration scheduled at his Mar-a-Lago resort to mark the one-year anniversary of his inauguration, but he hasn’t been talking with Democrats. Trump and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were close to a deal Friday before staff vetoed the agreement and Democrats decided they wouldn’t take anything more than a funding extension for a few days. The government shut down.House Republicans seemed to dig in on their positions Saturday, insisting that no immigration negotiations take place until Democrats voted to reopen government. But there was some hope in the Senate, with Republicans and Democrats meeting Sunday and showing some signs of progress.Lawmakers do seem closer to ending the shutdown, but it’s clear there is still distance between the two sides. And until one side gives in or lawmakers actually reach some middle-ground proposal, hundreds of thousands of government workers will be furloughed and many national parks will close."

But the pontiff was serious about his message, and has referred to gossip as terrorism a number of times in the past. It appeared to be the first time, however, that he has called people who gossip terrorists.“Do you know what a nun who gossips is?” the pope asked as he spoke to 500 cloistered nuns at the historic Church of the Nazarenas.“A terrorist,” he answered. “Because gossip is like a bomb. One throws it, it causes destruction and one calmly walks away.”He added: “No terrorist sisters! The best remedy is to bite your tongue. Don’t gossip in the convent because that will inspire the devil.”Francis also said that gossiping nuns were worse than the “terrorists of Ayacucho,” again drawing laughter. The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas centered at Ayacucho in the 1980s and 1990s were linked to the killing and disappearance of tens of thousands of Peruvians.The comments drew criticism from a newspaper editor, who said sex abuse by Catholic priests seemed more akin to terrorism than gossip, Reuters reported.The cloistered nuns were a strange group to receive such a warning. They rarely speak to one another and usually spend their days in prayer as part of their religious devotion. They were granted special permission to leave their various convents to attend the event.At the beginning of his address, Francis joked: “Seeing you all here, an unkind thought comes to my mind — that you took advantage [of me] to get out of the convent a bit to take a stroll.”The pope has often compared gossip to terrorism and urged those who were tempted to gossip to “bite your tongue,” as he did last month during a visit to Bangladesh.Later in the day, Francis said Mass for some 1.3 million people in a tented airfield in Lima. He condemned “the grave sin” of corruption, The Associated Press reported, and urged Peruvians to have compassion. He also told them they lived in a “sainted” land and hailed young people for keeping their faith, per The New York Times.He didn’t mention victims of clergy sex abuse.The pope’s South American tour did not get off to a good beginning in Chile. There he apologized for the pain suffered by victims of clergy sex abuse. But he later accused victims of notorious pedophile priest Fernando Karadima of slander for accusing Bishop Juan Barros of protecting Karadima.The Vatican has long defended and embraced Barros. While in Chile, the pope said there was no proof that Barras had any culpability in Karadima’s crimes.Many Chileans were furious with the pope and some critics said such comments would make it less likely for victims to speak up. One banner hanging from a building on the pope’s route to mass in Lima read: “Francis, here there IS proof.”"

Really? Who would have thought it?” Rather, 86, joked while introducing the program, “The News With Dan Rather.” The gig is significantly different from his 24-year career hosting the “CBS Evening News.” “At this age and stage in my life, my attitude is, ‘What the hell,’” he said Sunday in an interview with CNN. The show ― a 30-minute program set to air on the network’s YouTube channel at 5:30 p.m. on Mondays ― will be broadcast from Rather’s office and will focus on the biggest news of the day, original reporting and stories he thinks need more attention.The move is partially motivated by President Donald Trump’s hostile attitude toward the media, Rather told CNN.“I feel strongly that when you have a president who is continually, relentlessly damning the press, individuals by name, individual institutions and calling the press the enemy of the people ― listen, this has to be resisted,” he said. “These efforts to convince the public that people in the news are dealing in fake news is, quite frankly, bullshit.”This isn’t Rather’s first foray into working with somewhat under-the-radar networks. After leaving the “CBS Evening News” in 2005, he hosted a weekly news show called “Dan Rather Reports” on the cable network AXS TV until 2013. The newsman said he was cautiously optimistic that his show with The Young Turks could reach conservative news consumers. “I don’t kid myself that we are going to have much effect on someone who is a follower of Breitbart or Fox News,” he said. “But even if we can have a little effect ― I think some of the authenticity can get through to some of these people.”The first episode is scheduled to air Monday.

Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, called the resignation “a public relations ploy” in a statement to HuffPost. “In speaking with some of our clients this morning, all of them wondered whether USAG will change the position they have taken in court that USAG had no duty to warn its member gymnasts even though they knew Larry Nassar was a molester,” he said. “Until that happens, this move is simply a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship of an organization.”Manly demanded Congress open an investigation into how the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and MSU have handled the Nassar accusations. He added that many of the board members who remain were “well aware of USAG’s concealment of sexual abuse, its non-compliance with reporting statutes and harsh treatment of sexual abuse survivors.” “It should not have more than 100 young women publicly baring their souls about their sexual assault by Larry Nassar to finally get USAG to act,” Manly said. “It’s important to note that 54 USAG Coaches have been credibly accused of sexually molesting little girls and boys in the last 20 years. Child molestation is a cancer in USAG and those responsible need to be completely ousted from the organization so there is nothing left of their influence.”More than 100 women have read victim impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing. Many called out USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University for disregarding or failing to report warnings about Nassar’s abuse. It appears the organizations “only see us as a financial burden that needs to be silenced and squashed, devalued and discredited all while trying to say they are sorry it happened to us and are on our side,” survivor Larissa Boyce recently told HuffPost. Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman wrote in a series of tweets this month that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for Nassar being allowed to continue his abuse for so long. “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again,” Raisman tweeted. ”... The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.” The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 amid the investigation.Nassar is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and faces a minimum of an additional 25 years on the sexual misconduct charges. This article has been updated to include a comment from attorney John Manly. "

(The age of consent in California is 18.) More than two dozen police officers in the San Francisco Bay Area allegedly had sex with Guap starting when she was 14 years old; so far, seven have faced charges for sex offenses and other crimes. Guap came forward in the summer of 2016, saying she had sex and shared cocaine with Officer Rodger Ponce De Leon, 42. According to her phone records, their interactions began when she was 17. But a year and a half later, Ponce De Leon is still under Internal Affairs investigation and is still employed by SFPD, according to Michael Andraychak, a spokesman for the department.Ponce De Leon works in a position in which he has no contact with the public, Andraychak said. But the city is still paying him. The Examiner reported in 2016 that the officer was moved from Northern Station to the SFPD Operation Center, and Andraychak said he is currently still employed as a parole officer. (The SFPD lists the starting salary for its police officers as $83,018, but the department would not comment on Ponce De Leon’s current salary. According to Transparent California, he made $133,968.69 total in 2016.)Although a 2011 study found that sex workers are “18 times more likely to be murdered than women who do not engage in prostitution” and are also more likely to be raped as well, violence against sex workers is often overlooked as a result of the contentious and often dangerous relationship between police and sex workers.San Francisco will no longer prosecute sex workers if they come forward to SFPD as victims or witnesses of “sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking, robbery, assault, kidnapping, threats, blackmail, extortion, burglary or other violent crime,” District Attorney (and former San Francisco police chief) George Gascón announced earlier this month. Some members of the sex worker community lauded the policy and welcomed the opportunity to build trust between the two communities. Briq House, communications director for Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA, told HuffPost that it was “a wonderful step in the right direction.” A former San Francisco-based SWOP-USA Board member, Maggie Mayhem, told HuffPost the policy is a welcome change, but criminalization of sex work remains an issue when it comes to keeping sex workers safe. Overall, she said, “it is a promising sign that the SFPD and DA are continuing to learn more about the important issue of sex worker rights and safety and taking more progressive steps to address it.” The DA’s policy announcement also said SFPD will collaborate with local sex worker organizations to implement a training program for its police members. Neither Guap nor the DA’s office responded to requests for comment."

The actress broke down why Latino representation is so overdue while speaking with E! News correspondent Nina Parker about her upcoming projects, which include major roles in Paramount Pictures’ sci-fi thriller “Annihilation” and Sony Pictures’ action film “Miss Bala.”“Yay, Sony, for putting a Latino in the lead, because barely people do that,” Rodriguez said, turning her attention to the camera to make her point. “I mean, we do make [up] 55 million plus in the country — no big deal — you should throw us in a movie or two, it would make sense. We do buy 1 in every 4 tickets every single weekend and make sure that your movies do well. So it would do you a service. And not only service, it would be — I don’t know — integrity.

A broken-legged “k,” a big-shouldered “T,” a thermometer exclamation point. But you know his handiwork when you see it, and you see it everywhere in the city. “Fuck Trump!” say the plywood construction sheets along the U Street corridor, one of D.C.’s main entertainment districts. “Fuck Trump!” say the electrical boxes at intersections from the White House to New York Avenue Northeast. “Fuck Trump!” say the sidewalk curbs and parking meters and street signs. If you’ve walked around the nation’s capital for even five minutes, to work, to the bar, to a friend’s house, to a Metro subway station, you’ve seen those two words, in his handwriting, somewhere.You can have your “No matter who you are or where you’re from, we’re glad you’re our neighbor” lawn sign. “Fuck Trump!” is “D.C.’s Street Art Anthem,” as the Washington City Paper put it.Dirty Knucklez ― he uses the moniker exclusively ― is a California native who came to the nation’s capital two years ago and has spent most of that time homeless. Out west, he was a rapper; here, he planned to continue to chase his hip-hop dreams.Then Trump won the election, and Dirty Knucklez, who had already scrawled his name across the city in an effort to boost his brand, felt moved to do something more. So he took to the streets with a Sharpie and began writing “Fuck Trump!” whenever and wherever he felt like it.He knows the vulgarity may turn people off. Some of his fellow Muslims ― he converted years ago ― have urged him to stop for just that reason. But how else to put it, particularly in a city where 96 percent of residents voted for someone other than Trump?“It’s not so much a protest as a visual demonstration of my discontent with the way our country’s going right now. We’re supposed to be America,” he said over coffee. “He’s not respectable, he’s not admirable, he’s not any of the qualities we would ideally look for in a president. He’s not representative of our country.”I asked Dirty Knucklez how long his famous scrawl took to complete. He pulled his Sharpie from his pocket and walked outside, to an electrical box on the street corner that he’d spotted on his way in. In less than 10 seconds, he was done.A policeman stood just across the street. It didn’t matter. A minute later, Dirty Knucklez bent down and scribbled the same message onto a parking meter. By his reckoning, he does this 200 to 300 times a day, whenever the inspiration hits him. He started right after the election, with an electrical box in the city’s northeast quadrant. But the U Street corridor is his most common canvas: Dirty Knucklez scratched “Fuck Trump!” onto the walls of a single, block-long plywood construction walkway more than 120 times. The construction firm painted over many, so Dirty Knucklez returned and tagged the walkway again, this time in even more elaborate fashion, with spray paint instead of his Sharpie.One day, he hopes to hit the Trump International Hotel, located just a few blocks from the White House. His favorite tag for the moment, however, is the one on the curb outside Ben’s Chili Bowl, a landmark restaurant on the stretch of U Street once known as D.C.’s Black Broadway.Dirty Knucklez loves this particular tag because of its locale. President Barack Obama once visited Ben’s, one of D.C.’s oldest black-owned establishments. Obama wasn’t perfect, Dirty Knucklez said, but at least he “had been around the block.”“We need somebody who understands people, who understands the majority of the people,” he said, still bundled in layered coats to protect from the bitter winter cold, his face hidden behind a long beard. “The majority of the people aren’t rich. The majority of people don’t have money.”And then, Dirty Knucklez started to cry.“The majority of the people,” he said, “are out here struggling, bro.”Being homeless, he said, has deepened his opposition to the president. Same goes for his friends. One of his closest is a Muslim woman who left her family behind in the Middle East when she immigrated to the United States nearly a decade ago. Now she fears a return visit to see them would mean never re-entering this country.In some ways, Dirty Knucklez has become a local celebrity. His Instagram notifications are full of people who have posed in front of a “Fuck Trump!” in one place or another and who tagged him in their photos. Tourists have asked for pictures with him as he holds a “Fuck Trump!” sign in front of the White House. Local graffiti artists have hailed his work, he said, and local rappers have supposedly included him and his signs in videos filmed in D.C.’s streets. The nation’s capital has a long and rich history of street art and graffiti, protest-minded and otherwise. Dirty Knucklez took his inspiration from the late Cool “Disco” Dan, a street artist who moved to D.C. and began tagging his name on every surface he could find in the 1980s and 1990s. Disco Dan became a D.C. icon. His art, former Washington Post metro columnist Clinton Yates wrote, was “a personal testament to the struggles of the city and the people who lived here, and his staggering visibility, even if illegal, was a steadying hand for many when we had few others.”“It wasn’t until the buildings that he tagged went away,” Yates, who now works for ESPN, said of Disco Dan at the artist’s funeral last year, “that people realized that they actually cared about those monikers that some people just considered vandalism.”In recent years, D.C.’s street art has taken on a more urbane nature, as former taggers have transitioned to painting sprawling, intricate ― and legally sanctioned ― murals alongside the city’s buildings, particularly in neighborhoods that have gentrified.Dirty Knucklez insisted that his art isn’t just a protest against a president he sees as a clear threat to the very idea of America. It’s also a more subtle gesture against the sanitization of a city that, as it’s grown whiter and wealthier, has sought to maintain and celebrate its graffiti culture ― without the actual graffiti. That’s the subject of another message Dirty Knucklez is fond of tagging: “Preserve urban culture,” he writes. “The suburbanization of America is a plot to wipe out our strongest roots of independence.”“It helps me,” Dirty Knucklez said, wiping tears from his eyes. “It keeps me looking forward to the future. Maybe people will see my tags and get the freaking picture.”His most enjoyable moments are when it’s clear people do. As we walked into a sandwich shop and ordered lunch, Dirty Knucklez jokingly asked for “the full Fuck Trump.” The woman taking his order smirked. She didn’t know who he was. At least, I don’t think she did.“Fuck him,” she said. “Fuck him. Fuck him. Fuck him. He’s got these rich people getting tax money back, and poor people getting poorer.”Some nights, when U Street is busiest, Dirty Knucklez sits silently outside Ben’s Chili Bowl and watches as visitors bend down to take pictures of his favorite piece of work. Then he walks over to one of the temporary construction walkways where he’s scribbled “Fuck Trump!” a hundred times and listens. “Fuck Trump!” people scream, the words echoing off the plywood walls around them.“It means,” Dirty Knucklez said, “I’m doing my job.” "

The launch vehicle was carrying three small commercial satellites, including one for weather monitoring and another for earth imaging, according to the Associated Press. Celebrating the launch, Rocket Lab — which was founded by Peter Beck, a New Zealander, in 2006 — called the achievement the “beginning of a new era in commercial access to space.”“It’s absolutely beautiful,” Beck told SpaceNews after the launch.“It puts us into a really good position to really deliver on what we said many years ago, that we’re here to open up space for business.”This is just the second test flight for Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket. During its first test mission last May, the company managed to get the launch vehicle to space, but it failed to reach orbit due to a telemetry glitch. The rocket’s next launch is expected to take place in “early 2018,” the company said in a Sunday press release, adding that “at full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year, and is regulated to launch up to 120 times a year, more than any other commercial or government launch provider in history.”On its website, Rocket Lab describes its mission as the removal of “barriers to commercial space by providing frequent launch opportunities to low Earth orbit.”Richard Easther, a professor of physics at the University of Auckland, told Stuff.co.nz that Sunday was a “red-letter day for New Zealand,” thanks to the Electron’s orbital success."

Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.) leaves a meeting on June 21, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a63bce31c00003d00811b12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Republican tasked with fighting against sexual harassment in Congress secretly settled a misconduct complaint filed against him by a former aide, The New York Times first reported Saturday.According to the report, Rep. Patrick Meehan (R-Pa.), a member of the House Ethics Committee and married father of three, expressed interest in the personal life of a female aide who was decades younger than him. Meehan eventually attempted to pursue a romantic relationship with the aide and became hostile when she rejected his advances, the Times said.The advances reportedly made the aide, who remains anonymous, so uncomfortable that she filed a complaint against Meehan, began working from home and, eventually, quit.Meehan was booted from the House Ethics Committee on Saturday, hours after the Times story was published. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced Meehan’s ouster in a statement to HuffPost.In its story, the Times spoke with 10 people who either worked in Meehan’s office or were friends with the aide at the time the alleged harassment took place.After the aide left her post in Meehan’s office, Meehan reportedly paid her an undisclosed amount from his congressional office fund, which includes taxpayer money, as part of a confidential agreement. Meehan denies the former aide’s allegations, his spokesman John Elizandro told HuffPost in an email, adding that he “has always treated his colleagues, male and female, with the utmost respect and professionalism.”Elizandro said the former employee was represented by counsel and “made certain assertions of inappropriate behavior which were investigated.” He also insisted that Meehan “would only act with advice of House Counsel and consistent with House Ethics Committee guidance,” and that he had handled the process “ethically and appropriately.”Meehan requested that the congressional lawyers involved in the case release both parties from the confidentiality agreement “to ensure a full and open airing of all the facts,” Elizandro said.According to the former colleagues of the employee, Meehan expressed so much interest in her while she worked in his office that others viewed it as unprofessional. He then appeared to become jealous when she entered a serious relationship last year, the Times reported.Meehan reportedly told the woman of his romantic feelings in person and later in a handwritten letter. The aide filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment after she said Meehan became hostile toward her. The former aide told the Times that those tasked with handling the complaint, including two representatives for Meehan and two lawyers for the Office of House Employment Counsel, suggested she had misinterpreted Meehan’s behavior, leaving her feeling demoralized. Meehan and his former aide eventually reached a settlement and nondisclosure agreement after mandatory counseling and mediation sessions, according to the Times.Over the past few months, the House Ethics Committee has been investigating several members of congress who are facing sexual harassment allegations or who have reached settlements with their accusers. In December, the committee opened investigations into sexual harassment claims made against Reps. Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev.).In light of those investigations, both Farenthold (who reportedly used $84,000 in taxpayer money to settle his claim) and Kihuen announced they would not be running for re-election; Franks resigned from Congress.Lawmakers in the House have issued more than $100,000 in taxpayer-funded settlements for sexual harassment claims made between 2008 to 2012, HuffPost reported in December. House and Senate legislators have since introduced proposals to ban the use of taxpayer-funded settlements.After speaking with Meehan on Saturday, Ryan said Meehan was submitting himself to the Ethics Committee for review, Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement to HuffPost.Ryan also urged Meehan to repay the funds he used in his settlement.“The new reforms going into place bar the use of taxpayer money to pay settlements, and so the speaker has also told Mr. Meehan that he should repay whatever taxpayer funds were used to settle this case,” Strong said on Ryan’s behalf."

44,POLITICS,Trump Campaign Uses Shutdown To Accuse Democrats Of Being Complicit In Murder,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-ad-immigrants-democrats_us_5a63cc08e4b0dc592a0968e2,"The president is supposed to be negotiating with Democrats, but instead he's tying them to immigrants who've committed violent crimes.",2018-01-21,President Donald Trump has said he will only help undocumented young people he put in jeopardy if he gets a border wall and massive changes to legal immigration policy.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a63cd701e0000260025b164.jpeg?cache=UhUN0KRagK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It only took a government shutdown for President Donald Trump to return to his original campaign message: Undocumented immigrants are dangerous and out to get Americans. Trump’s campaign released an ad on Saturday that pinned murders committed by undocumented immigrants directly on Democrats who are pushing for relief for so-called Dreamers, young people who came to the U.S. as children. “President Trump is right: Build the wall. Deport criminals. Stop illegal immigration now,” a voiceover says. “Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants.” The ad shows House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) before cutting to video of an undocumented immigrant on trial for killing two police officers. All three lawmakers are advocates of immigration reform and oppose Trump’s border wall, but they aren’t open borders advocates or defenders of murder; the bills they’ve pushed exempt violent criminals from protections and include border security measures. Schumer even said he offered Trump funding for his wall on Friday, but that the president declined the deal. But calling Democrats “complicit” in murder fit in with the White House’s messaging on the government shutdown, which happened when the Senate failed to pass a short-term government funding bill by the end of Friday. Most of the Senate Democratic caucus, plus four Republicans, voted against the bill, many of them saying they would not support funding without a fix for the 700,000 undocumented young people Trump put at risk of deportation by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. While Trump and the White House have occasionally referred to those young people, often called Dreamers, in fairly sympathetic terms, they’re now characterizing them as “unlawful immigrants” whom Democrats insist on helping.It’s a return to form for Trump, who launched his campaign by claiming that Mexico was sending rapists and other criminals across the border, has called for a U.S.-Mexico border wall and has highlighted crimes committed by people without legal status in the country. While some undocumented immigrants do commit crimes separate from immigration, numerous studies have disputed the idea that immigrants are bringing more crime into the country. Trump and his administration have also repeatedly attacked Democrats for their immigration stances. As part of a campaign against so-called “sanctuary cities,” a term for jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with deportation efforts to some degree, the administration has floated the idea of criminally prosecuting local officials. Trump’s message from day one has been that immigrants are, first and foremost, a frightening threat.

45,POLITICS,Bipartisan Group Of Senators Push For Deal To End Government Shutdown,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shutdown-deal-bipartisan_us_5a6518c8e4b0dc592a09f85b,"It's not looking good, though.",2018-01-21,Immigration activists rallying outside the U.S. Capitol building.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a653ee12100003c007c74aa.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― A bipartisan group of centrist senators met Sunday to work out a potential compromise that would fund the government until Feb. 8, contingent on a promise to hold a vote on an immigration bill before then.In exchange for more Democratic votes to reopen the government, GOP leadership would need to offer some sort of commitment to help the so-called “Dreamers” in coming weeks, according to several senators who attended the meeting in the office of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Capitol Hill.It’s not clear, however, whether enough Democrats would accept a simple verbal commitment from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that the Senate would consider an immigration bill at some point in the future. He already pledged to do so last month, for example.“There’s been a lot of promises made to different senators that have not been followed through on by the majority leader, so I would be very leery of anything that wasn’t extremely, extremely clear and detailed,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oreg.) said.President Donald Trump necessitated a legislative fix for Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ― when he ended former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting them at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief. The program expires in early March, putting pressure on Congress to reach a solution to protect 700,000 young people from deportation.The bipartisan group of roughly 20 senators presented the terms of the potential deal to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who spoke about it privately later. The group included Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.)There’s no deal at this time, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. McConnell on Sunday night delayed a vote on a three-week stop-gap measure to fund the government, moving it from about 1 a.m. Monday to noon on Monday. He also upped the stakes to pressure those who had previously opposed the deal, saying on the Senate floor that he intended to hold a vote on an immigration bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8, should the government reopen. Murkowski said McConnell was “receptive” to the deal worked out by the moderate senators, but that it was ultimately up to him and Schumer to come to an agreement on funding the government.“I think it was important for him to hear the direction that we had gained from these broader groups,” Murkowski said. The White House has said that the issue of immigration should not be considered until government funding is approved. House Republican leaders also rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote until Democrats vote to reopen the government.During a Sunday interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) dismissed a bipartisan immigration framework brokered by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) as an “end run” around existing negotiations.In a sign the two sides were no closer to reaching an agreement, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) also poured cold water over the prospect of committing to a vote on an immigration bill before Feb. 8.“We’re more than happy to have a vote on it well before the deadline,” Cornyn said of a legislative fix on DACA. “Turning the agenda over to Democrats who just shut down the government makes no sense to me. It just seems like it encourages bad behavior.”Asked if he thinks the government will still be shut down on Monday, Cornyn added, “Right now, yeah. I do.”This story was updated with comments from Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley."

Annon, 44, had never been to a protest in her life before Saturday. But she and Lee, 42, decided to take their 7-year-old daughter to the 2018 Women’s March in New York City, joining more than 200,000 marchers locally and hundreds of thousands more around the world. “It’s time for change,” said Annon, who told HuffPost that it was #MeToo, specifically the Aziz Ansari story, that pushed her to march. “We need to stop making excuses, and I don’t want my daughter to grow up in a world where she feels pressured to do things that she’s uncomfortable doing.” The day after President Donald Trump was sworn in last year, women and men across the country took to the streets, making the first Women’s March the largest single-day protest in U.S. history. A year later, on the day of a government shutdown, the energy and rage are still there, bolstered by the #MeToo movement and anger at an administration that has been actively hostile to the rights of women and other marginalized groups.In New York, the march spanned more than 20 blocks and two avenues. Marchers of all ages, genders and backgrounds carried signs with slogans like “Grab him by the midterms,” “Harasshole,” “I miss science,” “Stop tearing families apart,” “Nasty women from shithole countries,” “Together we rise,” and “Fuck this shit.”Despite a year that several women described to HuffPost as “hard” and “draining,” marchers seemed prepared to call their representatives and protest in the streets for the next three years. “After marching many times, I would march next year and the year after that, and I would continue marching,” said Tessa Cahill, 11, who marched in D.C. with her family in 2017.Though the themes of the 2018 march remained largely the same as last year’s, many women pointed to the #MeToo movement, which kicked off in earnest this past October, when asked why they were marching again. “I feel optimistic, especially with so many women coming out in the #MeToo movement [and] in Time’s Up,” Danielle Sabalvaro, 26, told HuffPost. “Enough is enough at this point ― especially after this past year. So I think we have a lot of momentum coming into this year.”Nikki Vargas, 30, said she had protested and marched before Trump was elected, but was especially energized this past year by #MeToo and her identity as a Colombian immigrant. “This march is even different from the last one because of the #MeToo movement and the spotlight on sexual assault victims,” Vargas told HuffPost. “There’s a lot more rage and a lot more anger in this march, and I think we’re going to see a lot of women out there defending those who didn’t have a voice before.”Another clear difference between this march and the one in 2017 was an effort to work for inclusiveness and intersectionality from day one. The original march, which grew out of two Facebook events created by white women, drew criticism for not initially doing so.The founders of the Women’s March changed the name of the event from the “Million Women’s March” ― the name of a 1997 black women’s march ― brought seasoned organizers Linda Sarsour, Tamika Mallory and Carmen Perez on as national co-chairs, and say they have since spent a lot of time discussing and reflecting on white privilege and the problems with white feminism.“I think it was important for all of us to talk about the ubiquity of white privilege and how we all had been basically skating on this privilege without really naming it or addressing it for a very long time,” said Bob Bland, a co-founder of the march. “We learned about the history and the ways we were causing harm and trauma to communities of color, and we centered women of color in leadership and became intentional as white women about holding space.” Many women brought signs to the march that emphasized inclusivity. Veronica Pazmino, 28, in New York with an indigenous women’s group from Mexico, said she wore red to honor indigenous women. “I just really wanted to show solidarity and stand with all my sisters here today, all native sisters, all trans sisters,” she told HuffPost. “And I really feel like it’s important to stand together, be inclusive, not exclusive. This is about all groups of women, not just certain groups of women. Be intersectional and not be like, oh, this is only for certain groups and not the others.” Majella Mark, 31, carried a sign that nodded to “pro-life feminists,” despite the fact that she supports abortion rights and that feminism has traditionally shunned the anti-abortion community. “There’s women who really are dedicated to gender equality, and their perspective is just different, and that’s OK,” she said.The march still drew some criticism this year, and some women of color chose not to attend, citing lack of intersectionality and other reasons.But Bland said she is encouraged by the movement’s evolution.“The miracle of this year is people putting away any past differences ― or more accurately, talking about them ― and having the courageous conversations that needed to be had with each other,” she said. One year into Trump’s presidency, demonstrators see the Women’s March as a jumping off point rather than an end goal. And with the midterm elections just months away, that’s where many of the marchers plan to direct their energy. That’s also where the Women’s March organization has directed its efforts, via the Power to the Polls campaign, which kicks off on Sunday in Las Vegas.“It’s a marathon fight, not a sprint,” said Marianna Martinelli, 35. “Now it’s 2018, we’ve got our eyes on November and trying to support candidates that are gonna be able to make a change in D.C. So I think we know that it’s gonna be the long haul. It’s not guns blazing ― we’ve gotta keep the pace, keep fighting.”“It’s wonderful to see this kind of turnout,” echoed Sydney Crawford, 83, who has been marching since the 1960s when she fought for civil rights alongside Martin Luther King Jr. “I was with a group in Virginia, and we took 12 seats in the state legislature and got the governorship. People came out and voted, and it was really inspirational.”Bland shares the optimism of the New York marchers. “I would say our greatest victories are ahead of us,” she said. “The true promise of the Women’s March hasn’t yet been met.”This piece has been updated to reflect a later crowd size estimate."

Rand Paul outside his Kentucky home plans to pleads guilty to a felony charge of assaulting a member of Congress, his lawyer said Friday.Josh J. Minkler, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Indiana, which was assigned to the case, announced in a Department of Justice release Friday that Rene Boucher had been charged in the Nov. 3 assault, which left Paul with bruises and broken ribs.“Assaulting a member of Congress is an offense we take very seriously,” Minkler said in the release. “Those who choose to commit such an act will be held accountable.”Boucher plans to enter a plea of guilty to violating the federal statute, his attorney, Matthew Baker, said.“Under that statute, the elements of that offense are fairly straightforward,” Baker told HuffPost. “The prosecutor has to prove that Rene Boucher assaulted Rand Paul and ... prove that Rand Paul was a member of Congress. Those are the elements of the offense.”Boucher has maintained that the assault had nothing to do with Paul being a senator.“This is a purely private dispute of yard maintenance issues between two next-door neighbors,” Baker told HuffPost. “There is no political component.”Boucher, a retired anesthesiologist, was initially charged with fourth-degree assault with a minor injury, a misdemeanor.According to the Justice Department release, Paul was mowing his yard in Bowling Green when Boucher saw him stack brush onto a pile close to his property and had “had enough.”Boucher then ran onto Paul’s property and tackled him, fracturing six of the senator’s ribs. Paul later contracted pneumonia, the release noted.Other neighbors told CNN at the time that the two men had argued over yard waste for years. Kelley Paul, the senator’s wife, denied that there was an ongoing dispute. “The only ‘dispute’ existed solely in the attacker’s troubled mind, until, on a beautiful autumn day, he ran down the hill on our property and slammed his body into Rand’s lower back,” she wrote in a CNN op-ed.Paul’s office could not be reached for comment Friday.Boucher could face up to 10 years of prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Baker said he planned to request that the judge assigned to the case sentence Boucher to probation and not prison."

The paper announced Friday afternoon that Levinsohn would be taking an unpaid leave of absence while an outside law firm investigates.Most journalists had already cast their votes by the time the Levinsohn story was published. But it served as yet another reminder of why so many decided it was time to bargain collectively. “I wasn’t planning on going to the vote count, but after [the Levinsohn news] yesterday, I really do feel like I want to go,” said Jaweed Kaleem, a former HuffPost reporter who now covers race and justice for the Times.On Friday, federal officials released the lopsided ballot count of a historic election at the storied paper: The newsroom cast 248 votes in favor of joining the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America, and just 44 votes in opposition.What started out as a campaign over basic workplace grievances like gender pay inequities and a change in vacation policy had evolved to include much broader concerns about the paper and its direction, from the editorial independence of the newsroom to the competence of top management. While the paper’s ownership mounted a counter-campaign that included frequent emails urging workers not to unionize, it could not overcome the staffers’ concerns or their smart organizing effort. In fact, Times staffers say that management’s aggressive anti-union posture likely flipped more votes in favor of unionizing. “The overwhelming majority voted to finally give this newsroom a voice,” Times reporter Bettina Boxall told HuffPost. “Having a union won’t stop layoffs, but we have a collective voice and the days of the newsroom passively standing by while corporate management did whatever they wanted are over.”A spokeswoman for Tronc, the corporate parent of the Times, said the company would respect Friday’s vote count and looks forward to working with the union. The two sides will soon begin the process of bargaining over a first contract as rumors of looming layoffs swirl among staff members.Times Guild organizing committee members said the overall feeling in the newsroom as they awaited the vote results was “electric” because of its historic nature. But many had lingering apprehension about how Tronc will handle the situation with Levinsohn, who became CEO and publisher last August.Organizers made their union drive public in October, but it began months before that. A 2016 change in the newspaper’s vacation policy angered staffers and provided early inspiration for the union movement, multiple staffers said. “That really is what lit everybody up,” said one reporter. “They did that unilaterally without telling us, and a lot of people who have been here for 30 years have banked an insane amount of days that they haven’t used ― and that’s extra compensation when they leave, and they were told that whole policy would end.”Support for the unionizing effort grew when Tronc fired top Times editorial leadership in August, prompting concerns over who would replace them. Conversations among small groups of employees expanded to the rest of the newsroom.Times staffers were also troubled by Tronc executives’ lavish compensation plans and private jet use ― while they were simultaneously told there wasn’t money for raises. In November, it was reported that executive pay at Tronc shot up 80 percent in 2017 alone, and Tronc chairman Michael Ferro’s private jet costs the company millions annually.The idea of the Times newsroom unionizing once seemed unimaginable. The paper has a long history of virulently anti-union ownership stretching back more than a century, as the Columbia Journalism Review documented. Former publisher Harry Chandler once bragged that a labor strike would never succeed in Los Angeles. “The reason is because it has the Los Angeles Times.”Anti-union campaigns are common in American workplaces, and they often work. But journalists are an inherently skeptical bunch. Times staffers said they found the emails and memos from the company in recent months to be condescending.

51,POLITICS,How The LA Times Union Won,"Dave Jamieson, Ann Brenoff, Matt Ferner, and Maxwell Strachan",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/los-angeles-times-union-won_us_5a626c2fe4b0e563006fa774,"""The days of the newsroom passively standing by while management did whatever they wanted are over.""",2018-01-20,"Tronc chairman Michael Ferro speaks in Beverly Hills, California on May 3, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6281bd220000251ab4f38b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After 136 years without a union, staffers at the Los Angeles Times decided it was finally time to join one.Their cause was inadvertently helped along by management, which ran a union-busting campaign that, in its oafishness and ineptitude, served as a fitting monument to the newspaper’s publisher.On Thursday, NPR detailed allegations of past misconduct by LA Times CEO and publisher Ross Levinsohn. The paper announced Friday afternoon that Levinsohn would be taking an unpaid leave of absence while an outside law firm investigates.Most journalists had already cast their votes by the time the Levinsohn story was published. But it served as yet another reminder of why so many decided it was time to bargain collectively. “I wasn’t planning on going to the vote count, but after [the Levinsohn news] yesterday, I really do feel like I want to go,” said Jaweed Kaleem, a former HuffPost reporter who now covers race and justice for the Times.On Friday, federal officials released the lopsided ballot count of a historic election at the storied paper: The newsroom cast 248 votes in favor of joining the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America, and just 44 votes in opposition.What started out as a campaign over basic workplace grievances like gender pay inequities and a change in vacation policy had evolved to include much broader concerns about the paper and its direction, from the editorial independence of the newsroom to the competence of top management. While the paper’s ownership mounted a counter-campaign that included frequent emails urging workers not to unionize, it could not overcome the staffers’ concerns or their smart organizing effort. In fact, Times staffers say that management’s aggressive anti-union posture likely flipped more votes in favor of unionizing. “The overwhelming majority voted to finally give this newsroom a voice,” Times reporter Bettina Boxall told HuffPost. “Having a union won’t stop layoffs, but we have a collective voice and the days of the newsroom passively standing by while corporate management did whatever they wanted are over.”A spokeswoman for Tronc, the corporate parent of the Times, said the company would respect Friday’s vote count and looks forward to working with the union. The two sides will soon begin the process of bargaining over a first contract as rumors of looming layoffs swirl among staff members.Times Guild organizing committee members said the overall feeling in the newsroom as they awaited the vote results was “electric” because of its historic nature. But many had lingering apprehension about how Tronc will handle the situation with Levinsohn, who became CEO and publisher last August.Organizers made their union drive public in October, but it began months before that. A 2016 change in the newspaper’s vacation policy angered staffers and provided early inspiration for the union movement, multiple staffers said. “That really is what lit everybody up,” said one reporter. “They did that unilaterally without telling us, and a lot of people who have been here for 30 years have banked an insane amount of days that they haven’t used ― and that’s extra compensation when they leave, and they were told that whole policy would end.”Support for the unionizing effort grew when Tronc fired top Times editorial leadership in August, prompting concerns over who would replace them. Conversations among small groups of employees expanded to the rest of the newsroom.Times staffers were also troubled by Tronc executives’ lavish compensation plans and private jet use ― while they were simultaneously told there wasn’t money for raises. In November, it was reported that executive pay at Tronc shot up 80 percent in 2017 alone, and Tronc chairman Michael Ferro’s private jet costs the company millions annually.The idea of the Times newsroom unionizing once seemed unimaginable. The paper has a long history of virulently anti-union ownership stretching back more than a century, as the Columbia Journalism Review documented. Former publisher Harry Chandler once bragged that a labor strike would never succeed in Los Angeles. “The reason is because it has the Los Angeles Times.”Anti-union campaigns are common in American workplaces, and they often work. But journalists are an inherently skeptical bunch. Times staffers said they found the emails and memos from the company in recent months to be condescending. In one case, management seemed to use an anti-union form letter that it may have forgotten to personalize. (“As we have tried to explain, you could be STUCK with the [Union] for a long time,” the flyer read.) At another point, a reporter said, an anti-union flyer in the newsroom appeared to include “MS Paint symbols from the ’90s,” he said. “We all kind of chuckled.”One Times staffer said that the company’s aggressive tack only emboldened the union drive internally, turning fence-sitters into union supporters. “They would have made the union drive much more difficult if they had simply said nothing at all,” the staffer told HuffPost.In a Dec. 29 email obtained by HuffPost, top Times editors Jim Kirk and Lewis D’Vorkin wrote to staff, “To be clear, unionization does not protect any company from making difficult decisions that sometimes need to be made to operate in a tough environment no matter what promises are made by union leaders.”“I think people got sick of it,” explained Kaleem. “They got sick of being talked down to, as if they weren’t journalists.”With tensions already high, allegations of Levinsohn’s “frat-house” behavior, detailed by NPR this week, sent the newsroom into a state of revolt.

52,POLITICS,Neo-Nazis Say They'll Protest A Women's March In Tennessee,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nazis-knoxville-womens-march_us_5a638ca3e4b0e56300702a63,Members of the racist Traditionalist Worker Party say they're going to join anti-abortion activists in Knoxville on Sunday.,2018-01-20,"Matthew Heimbach in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he helped organize the violent ""Unite The Right"" rally that left scores injured and one anti-racist protester dead.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a63a794220000251ab4f3ec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A neo-Nazi group plans to join anti-abortion activists in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Sunday for a rally against the Women’s March in that city. Matthew Heimbach, a leader of the the Traditionalist Worker Party — a racist and anti-Semitic white nationalist hate group that advocates for the creation of a white ethno-state — has called on his “comrades” to march on Knoxville to “take a stand for life, against the hordes of those who would empty the cradle of our nation.” “As the defenders and advocates of women and our children, the Traditionalist Worker Party is taking a stand in Knoxville Tennessee on Sunday January 21st against the proposed feminist march and in support of the March for Life being held the same day,” Heimbach wrote in a Jan. 12 blog post on the Traditionalist Worker Party site. “Any movement that doesn’t defend the sanctity of life is not a movement worth having,” the post read. “If we are to build a free nation for our children, we must first secure life for our children.”“Feminism and abortion are opposed to life in every way,” he added. “The gift of having children is a blessing for woman, and the entire nation, and it should be promoted as truly sacred.” Heimbach — whose activism has earned him the nickname “The Little Fuhrer” — told Newsweek he expects 50 or 60 fellow white nationalists to make the trip to Knoxville, though that could be an exaggeration. However many turn up, they won’t find a very welcoming reception. The anti-abortion activists behind the March To Life rally have denounced the group’s plans. “Any group or individual that promotes white supremacy or other dehumanizing world views, are not in tandem with the position of Tennessee Right to Life on the value of every person’s dignity and life,” Ed Albin, a Tennessee Right to Life leader, wrote in a Facebook post this week. “Our organization’s march has a single agenda to support the rights of mothers and the unborn, and we don’t agree with the violent agenda of white supremacists or Antifa.” Antifa — the loose and decentralized network of anti-fascist and anti-racist activists known for sometimes violently confronting neo-Nazis — are expected to greet Heimbach and his crew in Knoxville. In a statement on It’s Going Down, a platform for anti-fascist activism, two local anti-racist organizations, The Holler Network and Nashville Anti-Racist Action, laid out their reasons for confronting Heimbach and his “horde of human garbage followers”:The TWP and other white supremacist groups view Southeast Appalachia as an ideal region for a white separatist movement, and they prey upon rural and semi-rural areas to build their base. But their claims to Appalachia fly in the face of centuries of resistance to white supremacy and settler colonialism that are woven into these hills and rivers. From indigenous resistance to militant maroon communities, to multiracial labor strikes and prisoner uprisings, to the very existence of tight-knit black and brown communities across these hills, we know Appalachia has never been and will never be their all-white vision- as long as we continue to resist. So join us! Bring your love, solidarity, and rage to Knoxville on January 21st and help us take this trash the fuck outta East Tennessee!Meanwhile, the organizers of the Knoxville Women’s March — one of many such marches being held in cities across the country this weekend to protest President Donald Trump and sexism — have changed the route of their march, citing concerns over the neo-Nazis coming to town. According to a report in KnoxNews.com, local law enforcement will keep Women’s March participants and those protesting them in separate areas. There will also be a security screening process: Bags will be checked and no weapons or bottles will be allowed. There’s reason to be alarmed. Over the last year, white supremacists — emboldened by Trump’s ascendance to the White House — have engaged in violence at multiple rallies across America, most infamously in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing anti-racist activist Heather Heyer. Heimbach was an organizer of a large “White Lives Matter” rally in Tennessee in October. He and some 200 neo-Nazis, white nationalists, Klansmen and other assorted racists and fascists marched through the town of Shelbyville, where they were met by a significantly larger group of counter-protesters. When Heimbach spoke into the megaphone at the event, his anti-Semitic diatribe was drowned out by counter-protesters blaring Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have A Dream” speech over a much superior sound system. That night, Heimbach and and his neo-Nazi buddies harassed and then fought an interracial couple at a Nashville bar. Police were investigating. CORRECTION: This article originally stated 200 neo-Nazis marched through the town of Murfreesboro. The march actually took place in Shelbyville.America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."
53,POLITICS,Progressive Activists Divided On What Immigration Compromises They Will Accept,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/progressive-activists-divided-on-border-wall_us_5a639eb0e4b0dc592a094b23,"The border wall is a sticking point for some, but not others.",2018-01-20,Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a speech that he had expressed openness to funding a border wall during discussions with President Donald Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a639fb91e000028005ade16.jpeg?cache=dUX3uwWsg4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the federal government partially shut down at the stroke of midnight early Saturday morning, progressive activists presented a united front with congressional Democratic leadership.Blame for the shutdown, they declared in press releases and social media posts, lay squarely with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans for rejecting bipartisan deals that would provide permanent protection to “Dreamers,” as the group of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children are commonly known.“When Trump rejected a bipartisan immigration deal and ended negotiations, he threw the entire government into chaos,” MoveOn executive director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement. “Now, it’s on Republicans to restart those negotiations, pass legislation to protect Dreamers—who have been left in limbo since Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in September—and reopen the government.”The harmony wouldn’t last long. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) sparked ire from the grassroots left when he revealed in a floor speech early Saturday that during talks with Trump he had agreed to “put the border wall on the table for the discussion.”In response to a question at a press conference on Saturday about what that meant exactly, Schumer said, “I’m not gonna get into the specific numbers, but I will tell you it was the president who suggested a specific number and I said, ‘Let’s put it on the table.’” The tensions raise the prospect of discord in Democratic ranks at a time when the party has high hopes for major gains the midterm elections this November.“While Trump and Republicans completely own this #TrumpShutdown, it is embarrassing to see the #SchumerSellout charade play out on the Senate floor,” said Murshed Zaheed, political director of Credo, an activism group that mobilizes its 5 million members to pressure Congress on progressive causes. “Schumer conceding on the wall is deeply immoral and unacceptable.”Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, which backs progressive congressional candidates, including many primary challengers, noted that Schumer was among the Democratic leaders who attended anti-Trump rallies where protesters chanted “no ban, no wall.”Hundreds of thousands of activists took to the streets in cities across the country with a similar message on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the women’s march, Shahid observed. “Progressives were happy to see Chuck Schumer and the Democrats respond to grassroots organizing over the past few months that led to unifying enough of the caucus to fight on this,” Shahid said. “But there was absolutely no reason why Schumer needed to publicly and enthusiastically declare that he was willing to give Trump the wall in exchange for a deal.”Yasmine Taeb, a Virginia Democratic National Committeewoman who led many of the first Washington, D.C.-area protests against Trump’s travel ban, praised Schumer’s leadership thus far, claiming that “overall he’s been very receptive to the grassroots.”Taeb, a human rights attorney, nonetheless agreed that funding for the wall, which activists view as a powerful gesture of white supremacism, is a dealbreaker.“The issue is how and why [Trump] campaigned on that message,” Taeb said. “We refer to it as a racist border wall ... because that’s how it’s seen.”In September, when Trump put an expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that had temporarily shielded Dreamers from deportation and provided them access to legal work opportunities, he turned it into a bargaining chip for his restrictive immigration goals.Progressive immigration activists have long advocated for the Dream Act, a bill that which would grant permanent legal status to young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. After the September announcement, advocates ramped up their protests, staging dozens of mass demonstrations demanding a “clean” Dream Act be passed without any concessions to Republicans. These activists frequently note that the Dream Act is incredibly popular with the American public, giving Democrats greater leverage in negotiations. Eighty-three percent of Americans favor allowing Dreamers to remain in the United States, according to a CNN poll released in December.Trump’s inconsistent signals about what he wants from a deal makes it even less necessary to entertain major concessions, according to Shahid.“I don’t think we can trust where the president is coming from on any of this,” Shahid said.Given Republican control of the White House and Congress, and the politically unpredictable outcome of a prolonged shutdown, however, not all progressives are sure that some wall funding ― or any other specific concession ― should be off the table.“In the realpolitik of this moment, it’s clear the only way it passes is if Republicans get enough to support it and Trump gets enough where he can at least sign it,” said Frank Sharry, founder of the immigration reform group America’s Voice, which had pushed for a clean Dream Act for months.Rep. Luis Gutíerrez (D-Ill.), who is perhaps Congress’ most prominent immigration reform advocate, also said he would be willing to vote for a government funding bill that protected Dreamers ― even if it included funding for a wall. (Back in August, Gutíerrez had insisted that Democrats needed to vote down any bill that funded the border wall.)“It’s an awfully wasteful burden on the taxpayers to build a wall, but I’ve come to a conclusion that lives are more important than bricks,” Gutíerrez told HuffPost on Saturday.Sharry of America’s Voice said that compromises needed to be weighed against the need to shield Dreamers from deportation, as well other priorities like securing work permits for the parents of some Dreamers and reinstating the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Haitians and El Salvadorans. (The Trump administration ended the temporary protected status of 59,000 Haitian immigrants and 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants who had fled natural disasters.)To that end, Sharry called the outline of the deal that Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) were discussing before talks reached an impasse a “genuine bipartisan compromise.”The Graham-Durbin agreement included some funding for border enforcement that could be used toward a physical barrier at the southern border that Sharry said, “Trump will call a wall but we know really isn’t.”For Zaheed’s part, the Graham-Durbin deal is “not OK.” The Credo leader suggested that lawmakers should look at more moderate legislation co-sponsored by Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) “with the same level of intensity.” The Hurd-Aguilar bill protects DACA recipients from deportation, while providing funding for more border security. Unlike the Graham-Durbin deal, Hurd-Aguilar does not address legal immigration levels.Regardless, some advocates believe that the border wall itself has taken on an undue level of importance. Sharry noted that in many cases the addition of more immigration enforcement personnel is in some ways a greater concern than the wall, since border patrol agents “roam around border communities stopping brown people and asking for their papers” and ICE agents “are ripping families apart.”Sharry echoes the views of groups like the Southern Border Communities Coalition, which represents communities in the crosshairs of tougher border enforcement, and fears the consequences of an influx of border agents. “I honestly don’t know what we would do if we were talking about $18 billion for 1,000 miles of concrete wall. But that’s not what we understand is on the table,” Sharry concluded.Elise Foley contributed reporting."

56,POLITICS,Trump’s Decision To Keep Parks Open During Shutdown Puts Politics Before Safety,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/national-parks-trump-government-shutdown_us_5a61ea28e4b0125fd635df5a,Former Interior Department officials warn the move endangers both visitors and America's priceless resources.,2018-01-20,A National Park Service ranger removes a closed sign from the Lincoln Memorial after the 2013 shutdown.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a62758d1e00003d005adda2.jpeg?cache=ikLnbc6b1s&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — As a government shutdown grew increasingly likely this week, the Trump administration scrambled to find a way to keep America’s national parks and monuments open — albeit without rangers, restrooms and other visitor services.While the federal government appears woefully unprepared for a shutdown generally, the motivation for this particular exception seems clear: President Donald Trump and his team are looking to avoid the fiery backlash that the previous administration faced when it shuttered parks and monuments in 2013.It’s a move that puts natural and cultural resources at risk, critics warn.Jon Jarvis, the former director of the National Park Service, dubbed it “incredibly idiotic.” The park service is not going to be able to live up to its stewardship responsibilities, he told HuffPost on Friday.“The great thing about national parks is that when visitors come, they have a certain expectation of the experience,” Jarvis said. “That there will be rangers on duty. There will be information at the visitor center. … If they get lost, we’re going to find them. If they get injured, we’re going to rescue them.” What makes the U.S. park system the best in the world, he said, “is a professional corps of managers in the field that provide for that experience and protect the resource.”The Trump administration has notified National Park Service officials across the country to maintain public access at parks “unless access presents a serious and imminent threat to human life, safety, or health, or a serious and imminent threat to the condition of a sensitive natural or cultural resource.”Major national parks, including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon, were all scheduled to be open Saturday morning. Many war memorials and battlefields are also managed by the National Park Service. And Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke posted a photo early Saturday of himself with students at an open National World War II Memorial. During a 16-day shutdown in 2013 — in the first year of President Barack Obama’s second term, when Republicans controlled the House of Representatives and Democrats had a majority in the Senate — national parks and monuments were closed across the country. Barricades were erected around the National Mall in Washington. Signs were put up that read “Because of the Federal Government SHUTDOWN, All National Parks Are CLOSED.” Vacations were ruined. TV news aired footage of military veterans busting through blockades to access war memorials.If that experience proved anything, it was that closing parks and monuments is indisputably unpopular. And despite having previously threatened a shutdown, Trump seems to understand that Americans could be quick to blame him for any federal closures they don’t like.A day before the 2013 shutdown, Trump told Fox News that “problems start from the top.” When people look back decades later, he said, they’re “going to be talking about the president of the United States — who was the president at that time?”Similarly, Zinke — who oversees an agency that employs more than 70,000 people and manages 500 million acres of land, including the 59 national parks — has spoken about the important role those parks play in how Americans view the federal government. In a speech to agency staff on his second day as secretary, Zinke called the parks “the face” of the Interior Department. “For a lot of the millions of people who visit our parks every year, you’re the face,” he said. “So your uniforms, showing up every day, your professionalism, is how most of America views our department. And that’s an enormous responsibility.”With the Republican-controlled Congress proving unable to fund the government by midnight Friday, visitors to U.S. parks, monuments and memorials are expected to face bare-bones operations — open access without those welcoming uniformed professionals.Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement Thursday that those public places would “remain as accessible as possible” in the event of a shutdown.“The American public and especially our veterans who come to our nation’s capital should find war memorials and open-air parks open to the public,” she said. “Additionally, many of our national parks, refuges, and other public lands will still try to allow limited access wherever possible.”But former Interior officials warned that the administration’s attempt to save face could backfire.“With this new direction — where some things are open, some things are not, some things are going to be maintained, some things are not — and you’re asking them to figure this out on the fly in 24 hours,” Jarvis said. “That’s where it’s going to be a great deal of chaos.”Sally Jewell, who served as secretary of the interior during the 2013 shutdown, told The Atlantic that clearly the administration is trying to “reduce the heat,” but it’s “naive” to think that a few police officers can protect these sites. “It’s not realistic,” she said, “and I think it’s a lack of understanding of the roles that so many people play in the parks and, frankly, what [roles] volunteers play in the parks as well.” And Kate Kelly, public lands director at the Center for American Progress and an Interior official during the Obama administration, accused Zinke of “using the national parks as pawns in some political game.”“The National Park Service’s mission shouldn’t be held together by duct tape and bailing wire in order to lessen the public’s blowback on the party that controls Congress and the White House,” she said in an email.As the head of the park service during the 2013 shutdown, Jarvis recalls facing a lot of the criticism. He remembers the deluge of media articles about parks being closed, the local economic suffering, the angry tourists, the weddings that had to be relocated.“It’s painful,” he said. “The park service hates to do this stuff. We love to have the public come and see us.”But that doesn’t justify keeping these sites open without proper staffing and services, he warned. Jarvis compared the plan to ordering the Smithsonian to close its doors but bring its collection outside for everyone to see.“It’s not like these areas are impervious to impact, to vandalism, to terrorism attacks, to damage,” he said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress in 2013. Only the House of Representatives had a Republican majority."

David Ige (D) has been facing criticism for the false missile alert that sent the state into a panic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a62c7001e00003d005addb4.png?cache=ka7fSnevyG&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A hearing with Hawaii lawmakers on Friday revealed that Gov. David Ige knew last weekend’s missile alert was a false alarm two minutes after it was broadcast across the state, but didn’t notify the public of it until 15 minutes later.The false alert was triggered at 8:07 a.m. on Jan. 13. Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan told state legislators that he personally called Ige to let him know that Hawaii was not facing a missile threat at 8:09 a.m. It wasn’t until 8:24 a.m. that the governor’s office publicly acknowledged the mistake by retweeting the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, with the added note, “There is NO missile threat.”Six minutes after that, a note about the false alert appeared on Ige’s Facebook page.“I don’t know what the governor was doing. I wasn’t with him at the time,” Logan told lawmakers. “I know he was preparing to go to an event and this circumvented all of that.” While this new detail prompted state lawmakers to ask more questions about that particular lapse of time, Ige wasn’t able to respond. The governor left 45 minutes into the two-hour hearing.Ige’s spokeswoman Cindy McMillan told HuffPost that the governor didn’t alert the public right away because his staff handles his social media accounts. “It took time for the governor to contact us and give us the information before we could post it,” she said.McMillan didn’t answer HuffPost’s question asking why Ige couldn’t publish the message himself.People in Hawaii were in a state of panic and confusion last weekend after a state emergency employee accidentally triggered an incoming missile alert to cellphones, TV and radio broadcasts during a routine drill.While officials called radio stations and news stations and issued corrections on social media, it took 38 minutes for the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency to broadcast a correction using the same alert system.An official with Honolulu Emergency Medical Services said 911 calls briefly spiked in the hour after the statewide alert. At least one person, a 51-year-old man, suffered a heart attack as a result of the alarm and was transported to the hospital in critical condition, an EMS official told HuffPost.The first person to notify the public of the emergency agency’s mistake appears to be a 17-year-old who was able to call state emergency officials immediately after receiving the alert.The high school student, William Heyler, told local news station KHON2 that he decided to check in with the agency after he noticed that there were no sirens to accompany the alarm. Within five minutes of the alert, Heyler talked to an official and tweeted that it was a mistake. His tweet went out at 8:12 a.m.At 8:19 a.m., Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) became the first state official to acknowledge the mistake when she tweeted that she’d confirmed there was no missile headed to Hawaii.After Ige left Friday’s hearing, Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing told emergency officials that he was disappointed that the governor had slipped out early.“I can’t imagine what’s more important than this right now,” Ing said.McMillan told HuffPost that the governor had to leave the hearing early to attend to other appointments he couldn’t reschedule on Friday afternoon.During Friday’s hearing, lawmakers probed emergency officials about the mistake and urged them to address the flaws in the response to last weekend’s botched drill. One lawmaker blamed the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency’s entire system for the prolonged panic.“It wasn’t just the fault of one man in a room pushing a button,” Democratic state Rep. Matt LoPresti said on Friday. “It was the entire system.”Lt. Col. Charles Anthony, a spokesman for the Hawaii Department of Defense, told HuffPost on Thursday that it took more than 30 minutes to send a follow-up alert because their system did not have a feature that allowed employees to send follow-up alerts after one is already sent.After last week’s mishap, the emergency agency has added a cancellation feature that would allow officials to correct any false alerts almost immediately. Additionally, the agency requires two people to sign off on alerts before one is broadcast to the state.National Guard Brig. Gen. Kenneth Hara is conducting a thorough review of the false alert and will provide state officials with an action plan on how to improve the state’s missile preparedness and alert system in the coming months.

His 14-year-old daughter was shot dead as he and his family ran from their house. The man’s story shows that the campaign of violence against his Muslim minority continues, even though a deal to repatriate Rohingya refugees and Hindus from Bangladesh back to Myanmar is set to begin on Tuesday. Many of those who fled their homes are apprehensive.“I’d rather be killed here than be returned,” the man whose house was burned told UNICEF from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, choosing to remain anonymous for fear of his safety.He’s not alone ― Rohingyas continue to cross into Bangladesh by the hundreds, fleeing violence against them led by Burma’s military since last summer.“They will slaughter us all,” Abd-us-Salam, a Rohingya refugee who is more than 100 years old and has fled three crackdowns in Myanmar, told Al Jazeera. “Please don’t send us back as bait for the monster.” Bangladeshi and Burmese officials negotiated the repatriation deal without the oversight of the U.N. Refugee Agency, which typically assists in such situations. The agreement would repatriate about 1,500 Rohingyas per week and house them in temporary transit camps in Myanmar as their homes are rebuilt. Yet without any international monitoring, international organizations worry these vulnerable people will be thrown right back into the misery they sought to escape in the first place. “The bottom line is that refugees have to decide themselves when they feel it’s safe to go back, the process of the repatriation is safe and conditions on the ground make them feel safe,” Caroline Gluck, a U.N. Refugee Agency senior public information officer, told HuffPost.Amnesty International called the repatriation deal “alarmingly premature” and pointed to conditions the two governments have set out in the scheme. For one, Rohingyas interested in returning are required to provide proof of citizenship, something the majority don’t have. In addition, the Burmese government hasn’t indicated it’s willing to change its stance on the Rohingya, a community it has viewed with disdain for decades.A 15-year-old refugee boy who said he was shot in the arm while entering his house, and later had the limb amputated in the jungle, told UNICEF he would only return home if his rights were guaranteed.“We will go back if we get recognized as Rohingya, and our property, cow and house back,” he told the U.N. child advocacy organization.Another concern is that Rohingyas who have fled to Bangladesh haven’t been informed about the potential repatriations, said a UNICEF media and communications spokesperson.They “absolutely do not want to go back,” the spokesperson said. “They’re full of fear. If you look at past scenarios where Rohingya people have been returned, it has led to more persecution.” The U.N. Refugee Agency hasn’t seen a list of people planning to return, according to Gluck. More than 655,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar since August, when the Burmese military reignited a crackdown on the religious minority after Rohingya militants reportedly attacked several police posts. Rights groups have accused authorities of summary executions, as well as widespread rape and torture that amount to ethnic cleansing. More than 40 villages have been completely razed, Human Rights Watch determined.The repatriation process, if it begins next week, would take an estimated two years, Gluck said. The U.N. Refugee Agency and other aid organizations plan to remain in Bangladesh as long as their assistance is needed. “They still need services, they need access to health, they will need food and water,” Gluck said. “This is still a long-term operation.”"

Hundreds of thousands of people across the country are attending this year’s Women’s March to protest his administration. His approval ratings are in the tank. And oh, the government has shut down. Though nothing quite illustrates the dysfunction and vitriol of this administration as much as the Statue of Liberty ― a shining beacon for immigrants and America’s traditional values ― being closed on Saturday as part of the government shutdown. In the last year, Trump has turned his back on the ideals Americans often espouse. The president attempted to block the passage of people from Muslim-majority countries from coming into the U.S. (he failed). He wants to build a stupidly expensive, unnecessary wall to keep out Mexicans and Central Americans. And under Trump, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has ramped up its efforts to kick out immigrants who have spent the vast majority of their lives here.It gets worse. Just this month, Trump reportedly described Haiti and African countries as “shithole countries” in a closed Oval Office meeting. He instead suggested the U.S. bring in immigrants from nations like Norway.But nothing quite shows the disdain he has for immigrants in this nation like his handling of Dreamers, unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and who know no other home. Last September, Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), originally put in place by former President Barack Obama, which protected these young immigrants from deportation. Democratic lawmakers have made it clear that they won’t support the policy many say is racist. Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, used immigrant lives as a bargaining chip for the government shutdown, which occurred after Congress was unable to reach a budget agreement by midnight on Friday.Trump, in all his “stable genius,” has passed the blame off on Democrats for the shutdown that has also led to the closure of Lady Liberty. It is the first time in the history of this country that a government shutdown has happened despite the House, Senate, and White House all being under the control of one party.The Statue of Liberty last made national headlines after White House aide Stephen Miller said in August that the poem inscribed on the statue, “New Colossus,” had no significance because it was added later. “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” the poem reads. “The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”For now, Lady Liberty’s doors are closed. And until this administration recognizes the noble belief that this is a country for all, perhaps those doors should remain closed."

64,ENTERTAINMENT,'Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind' Gives Fans A Glimpse Of Comedian's Offstage Life,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robin-williams-come-inside-my-mind-sundance_us_5a5cd5d4e4b03c418967f2d4,"Billy Crystal, David Letterman and Williams' son Zak touchingly describe the actor's endless love of entertaining.",2018-01-20,"Comedian Robin Williams performs in Atlanta on May 10, 1986.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a62b76a1e00003d005addb0.jpeg?cache=siyxqxSn5V&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARK CITY, Utah ― Robin Williams grew up as an only child to a fun-loving mother and businessman father far outside the Hollywood machine. But the moment he witnessed his stern dad laugh out loud at Jonathan Winters’ stick routine on “The Jack Paar Show,” Williams knew he wanted to be a performer.Nearly four years after Williams’ death, HBO is set to release a new documentary on the beloved comedian’s life and one-of-a-kind career. “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” directed by Marina Zenovich and produced by Alex Gibney and Shirel Kozak, made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday night to a sold-out crowd. Audience members diligently followed the story of the award-winning actor from his childhood experiences at home and in school to his tragic suicide at age 63. Featuring new interviews with Williams’ first wife, Valerie Velardi, “Mork & Mindy” co-star Pam Dawber, friends David Letterman and Billy Crystal, and his son Zak Williams, the film highlights the actor’s creative genius through some of his most beloved stage and screen performances, including “A Night at the Met,” “Happy Days,” Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Aladdin,” his USO tour, “Good Will Hunting” and “Dead Poets Society.” It also shines a light on Williams’ personal life ― namely, his three marriages, his addiction to drugs and alcohol, and his friendships with the likes of John Belushi, Bobcat Goldthwait and Crystal.The best bit of the film involves voicemails that Williams left for Crystal, which play over a montage of photos of the close duo. Williams would try out various character impressions, like “Sam from the Sibilance Society,” to get a rise out of his buddy. Crystal returned the favor when Williams underwent an aortic valve replacement in 2009, leaving him voicemails from “Vinny the Valve Guy” to help ease his recovery post-surgery. Crystal reiterates that he wanted to be friends with Williams since the day he met the eccentric comedian in the 1980s. “I had no agenda,” Crystal says in the film, “I just liked him.” One of the most profound moments revolves around Belushi’s overdose ― Williams was with the “SNL” star at his bungalow the night before he died. On the “Mork & Mindy” set the next day, Dawber informed Williams that Belushi had died, making a point to tell a cocaine-using Williams that she didn’t want him to end up like Belushi. And he promised he never would.“It sobered the shit out of me,” Williams admitted in a soundbite from one of the many interviews Zenovich and her team dug up for the documentary. Throughout his life, Williams used humor and performance as another way to get the “high” he craved in his day-to-day, according to many of the interviewees in the film. Zak Williams reveals that his father’s calling ― his desire to get from Hollywood what he needed ― took him away from Zak and his half-siblings, Zelda and Cody.Although Williams was a standout entertainer, behind closed doors he was a mild-mannered introvert, as both behind-the-scenes archival footage and personal videos reveal. Performer Williams was electric, while Real-Life Williams was vulnerable and quiet.“He was really comfortable onstage and less comfortable off,” his “Waiting for Godot” co-star Steve Martin said in the doc.Yet for most, it was hard not to fall for Williams. Every person interviewed for “Come Inside My Mind” seemed eager to share heartfelt memories and stories about the actor’s craft, humor and personality. “He could levitate,” Letterman said.“The urge to be funny was so innate to him,” “One Hour Photo” filmmaker Mark Romanek added.In 2006, Williams fell back into alcohol use to numb some of the pain he endured. Though he did get clean and continued to treat his addiction until the end of his life in 2014, the effort did not protect him from a misdiagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.

But the moment he witnessed his stern dad laugh out loud at Jonathan Winters’ stick routine on “The Jack Paar Show,” Williams knew he wanted to be a performer.Nearly four years after Williams’ death, HBO is set to release a new documentary on the beloved comedian’s life and one-of-a-kind career. “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,” directed by Marina Zenovich and produced by Alex Gibney and Shirel Kozak, made its debut at the Sundance Film Festival on Friday night to a sold-out crowd. Audience members diligently followed the story of the award-winning actor from his childhood experiences at home and in school to his tragic suicide at age 63. Featuring new interviews with Williams’ first wife, Valerie Velardi, “Mork & Mindy” co-star Pam Dawber, friends David Letterman and Billy Crystal, and his son Zak Williams, the film highlights the actor’s creative genius through some of his most beloved stage and screen performances, including “A Night at the Met,” “Happy Days,” Mrs. Doubtfire,” “Aladdin,” his USO tour, “Good Will Hunting” and “Dead Poets Society.” It also shines a light on Williams’ personal life ― namely, his three marriages, his addiction to drugs and alcohol, and his friendships with the likes of John Belushi, Bobcat Goldthwait and Crystal.The best bit of the film involves voicemails that Williams left for Crystal, which play over a montage of photos of the close duo. Williams would try out various character impressions, like “Sam from the Sibilance Society,” to get a rise out of his buddy. Crystal returned the favor when Williams underwent an aortic valve replacement in 2009, leaving him voicemails from “Vinny the Valve Guy” to help ease his recovery post-surgery. Crystal reiterates that he wanted to be friends with Williams since the day he met the eccentric comedian in the 1980s. “I had no agenda,” Crystal says in the film, “I just liked him.” One of the most profound moments revolves around Belushi’s overdose ― Williams was with the “SNL” star at his bungalow the night before he died. On the “Mork & Mindy” set the next day, Dawber informed Williams that Belushi had died, making a point to tell a cocaine-using Williams that she didn’t want him to end up like Belushi. And he promised he never would.“It sobered the shit out of me,” Williams admitted in a soundbite from one of the many interviews Zenovich and her team dug up for the documentary. Throughout his life, Williams used humor and performance as another way to get the “high” he craved in his day-to-day, according to many of the interviewees in the film. Zak Williams reveals that his father’s calling ― his desire to get from Hollywood what he needed ― took him away from Zak and his half-siblings, Zelda and Cody.Although Williams was a standout entertainer, behind closed doors he was a mild-mannered introvert, as both behind-the-scenes archival footage and personal videos reveal. Performer Williams was electric, while Real-Life Williams was vulnerable and quiet.“He was really comfortable onstage and less comfortable off,” his “Waiting for Godot” co-star Steve Martin said in the doc.Yet for most, it was hard not to fall for Williams. Every person interviewed for “Come Inside My Mind” seemed eager to share heartfelt memories and stories about the actor’s craft, humor and personality. “He could levitate,” Letterman said.“The urge to be funny was so innate to him,” “One Hour Photo” filmmaker Mark Romanek added.In 2006, Williams fell back into alcohol use to numb some of the pain he endured. Though he did get clean and continued to treat his addiction until the end of his life in 2014, the effort did not protect him from a misdiagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. In truth, he suffered from Lewy body dementia, which was almost surely a factor in his suicide, Goldthwait said.Perhaps comedian Lewis Black described Williams best in the film, stating, “[He was] the light that never knew how to turn itself off.” “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind” will air on HBO July 16.

66,POLITICS,House GOPers Say A Secret Memo Could End The Trump-Russia Probe. Their Staff Wrote It.,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-russia-mueller-fbi-doj-house-gop_us_5a613a58e4b01d91b25446b5,#ReleaseTheMemo is the latest way Republicans on Capitol Hill are trying to undermine the Mueller probe.,2018-01-20,Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) leaves a House Republican Conference meeting in December. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a621f721e00003d005add3c.jpeg?cache=ltIWe0orXF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― House Republicans spent the end of the workweek telling everyone who would listen that the American people must be allowed to see a top-secret four-page document that could bring an end to special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 elections.One thing about that document: Republican staffers wrote it.The memo Republican staffers compiled reveals information that is “absolutely shocking,” “sickening,” “jaw-dropping” and “worse than Watergate,” GOP members of Congress said Thursday and Friday. The document could send government officials to jail, one congressman said. “Is this happening in America or is this the KGB?” asked another.Even the most plugged-in news consumer could be forgiven for thinking the classified memo is an executive branch document that exposes wrongdoing within the Justice Department and the FBI. It isn’t. The document, which alleges abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the FBI’s quiet counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign in the final months of the 2016 election, was actually compiled by Republican staffers on the House Intelligence Committee. That committee voted along partisan lines this week to allow any member of Congress to take a peek at the document themselves. Republican members soon flocked to a secure room to read the memo written by their allies — and then ran to tell the press about it. Sara Carter, a Fox News contributor, wrote in a blog post on her personal website that the “bombshell” document “could lead to the removal of senior officials in the FBI and Department of Justice” and potentially spell the end of the Mueller probe. Carter’s post was widely shared on Twitter, including by Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas), former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch and former White House official Sebastian Gorka. Ahead of Carter’s appearance on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Thursday night, Sean Hannity used the story to send a “message” to Mueller.“Your witch hunt is now over,” Hannity said, addressing the Republican special counsel who was unanimously confirmed as FBI director in 2001 by the U.S. Senate, which a decade later unanimously voted to extend his term past the 10-year limit. “Time to close the doors.”Overnight, #ReleaseTheMemo ― a hashtag reportedly given an additional boost by Russian-connected bots ― started trending on Twitter. In less than 24 hours, Donald Trump Jr. ― a likely target of the Mueller probe who communicated with Wikileaks before the election and held a meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer promising dirt on Hillary Clinton ― sent off more than 30 tweets and retweets about the memo to his nearly 2.5 million followers.The broader theory of the case Republicans are pushing is that the FBI inappropriately used information gleaned from a controversial “dossier” on Trump to obtain a FISA warrant to monitor a Trump campaign affiliate. They hope that’s the poison pill that could somehow justify shutting down Mueller’s entire investigation (which of course didn’t begin until after Trump was elected, took office, and fired former FBI director James Comey).Democrats say the Republican-drafted classified memo is full of omissions and distortions intended to fuel efforts to run cover for President Trump. “It’s a distorted view of what the FBI has been doing,” one Hill source told HuffPost. “The majority of the committee is only sharing it so that other members of the caucus can also disparage and discredit the FBI.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the document was a “profoundly misleading set of talking points drafted by Republican staff attacking the FBI” and the bureau’s handling of the investigation.“Rife with factual inaccuracies and referencing highly classified materials that most of Republican Intelligence Committee members were forced to acknowledge they had never read, this is meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI,” Schiff said. “This may help carry White House water, but it is a deep disservice to our law enforcement professionals.”Is there actually a new bombshell in the report? It’s possible. But the motives and track records of the Republican lawmakers behind the media blitz surrounding the memo suggest there may be less to it than they claim.Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who chairs the committee that cooked up the document, had been the public face of the GOP push to undermine the Mueller probe, although he’d taken a backseat as of late. Last year, Nunes was involved in an embarrassing episode in which he briefed President Trump on information he received from a source he wouldn’t name. It later turned out he’d met that person on White House grounds.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) ― who previously called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign (which would allow Trump to replace him with an official who could shut down the Mueller probe) ― said the memo was “absolutely shocking.” But Meadows thinks the entire Russia probe is manufactured hysteria.Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who said the memo “is so alarming the American people have to see” it, has previously called for a new special counsel to investigate Mueller’s special counsel team.Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who said he was shaking his head when he read the memo and that the “American people deserve the truth,” benefited politically from documents the Russians hacked, and pushed a measure that would kill the Mueller probe.Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) ― who has called for reining in the Mueller probe by gutting its financing, and recently went pheasant hunting with Donald Trump Jr. ― said he was sickened by the memo and that it was “worse than Watergate.” He thinks the FBI was part of the #NeverTrump movement and wanted Clinton elected.If the memo does eventually go public, it won’t end well for Republicans, Susan Hennessey, the executive editor of the legal commentary site Lawfare, argued Friday. “After causing completely unnecessary chaos today, this memo will be released in some redacted [form] in a few weeks and prove to be an utter embarrassment to Nunes personally, the [House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence] majority, and frankly to US House of Representatives,” Hennessey predicted.Some conservatives have urged caution, worrying that Republicans are overhyping a secret document. Republicans “should not oversell” the report, conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt wrote. Over at the conservative blog Hot Air, Ed Morrissey wondered if it was a “set-up for a let-down.” He argued the memo should be released, but warned conservatives to “not go all-in on it until we have a chance to see it for ourselves. In the meantime, remember that most things that seem too good to be true usually are.”Rep. Matt Gaetz, a 35-year-old Republican freshman from Florida who recently flew on Air Force One with Trump and is friends with Roger Stone, is one of the believers. Gaetz has called for Mueller to be fired and said on “Hannity” on Thursday that officials might wind up in jail over what he saw in the memo.HuffPost ran into Gaetz on Capitol Hill on Thursday evening, just a few hours after the congressman appeared on the Fox Business channel above the chyron “I JUST READ A 4-PAGE MEMO THAT THREATENS DEMOCRACY TO ITS CORE.”“I believe that the contents of that memo need to be made available to the public immediately, and that that is a critical concern in kind of all of the Mueller, Russia, Trump discourse,” Gaetz told HuffPost of the memo, which he said “kind of aggregates” intelligence data.In the interview with HuffPost, Gaetz ran into a common problem for Republicans who suggest the FBI was too rough on Trump but went too easy on Clinton during the 2016 campaign: the indisputable fact that the FBI’s actions then harmed Clinton. Comey’s conduct during the Clinton investigation was even the underlying justification the Trump administration provided last spring to explain Trump firing Comey. If people in the FBI and the so-called “deep state” were trying to get Clinton elected president, then frankly, they did a terrible job of it.Surely Gaetz could concede the FBI’s actions ahead of the 2016 election were much more damaging to the Clinton campaign than they were to Trump? “I wouldn’t agree with that characterization,” he replied.Under Gaetz’s theory, the FBI was hellbent on leaking information to the press to stop Trump from being elected. Gaetz told HuffPost that texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page showed they were “talking about a plan to strategically leak information to embarrass Trump.” As HuffPost recently explained, a deeply flawed story by John Solomon of The Hill has left a lot of people with the inaccurate impression that the text messages show the FBI officials were leaking information to hurt Trump. That’s what Gaetz believes.“That was explicit in their communications to each other,“ Gaetz claimed.“How so?” HuffPost asked. Here’s how the conversation went from there:Gaetz: Well, when they talked about the, um, I think it was the Wall Street Journal article, and they were talking about, oh, was it behind a paywall and did it contain the information that ―Gaetz’s theory ― that the FBI provided information for an Oct. 24, 2016, Wall Street Journal story on the Trump dossier ― doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, chiefly because no such story exists. The first story to reference the “dossier” was published by Mother Jones on Oct. 31, 2016, a full week after Strzok-Page exchanged texts about a Wall Street Journal article. The Mother Jones story only came out after Comey sent a letter about the Clinton investigation on Oct. 28 that set off a media frenzy Clinton has partially blamed for her loss. But the secret GOP memo gave Gaetz a convenient pivot point: the suggestion that there’s something, a bombshell, that he can’t reveal publicly. And it totally supports the theory he’s been pushing this whole time.“I can say that if this memo become available to the public, many of the concerns that have been raised by members of the Judiciary Committee will be highlighted,” Gaetz said. Later on Friday, all nine Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement calling the memo a “misleading set of talking points attacking the FBI.” Since the documents that the GOP-prepared memo cites are highly classified, the Democrats said, they will not be made public and it will become “impossible for the few Members who have seen the documents to explain the flaws and misstatements contained within the talking points” without disclosing sources and methods. “This is by design,” they said. “Not surprisingly, the GOP campaign to attack the FBI now has been joined by the same forces that made common cause during the Trump campaign — Wikileaks, Julian Assange and a multitude of online Russian bots are now involved in promoting this effort. It should be seen for what it so plainly is: yet another desperate and flailing attempt to undermine Special Counsel Mueller and the FBI, regardless of the profound damage it does to our democratic institutions and national security agencies.”Ryan Reilly is HuffPost’s senior justice reporter, covering criminal justice, federal law enforcement and legal affairs.

67,POLITICS,Scott Pruitt’s First Year Set The EPA Back Anywhere From A Few Years To 3 Decades,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pruitt-one-year_us_5a610a5ce4b074ce7a06beb4,"Former EPA chiefs reflect on policy changes, budget cuts and staffing issues under Pruitt.",2018-01-20,Pruitt and President Donald Trump in June 2016 as they announce plans to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a610bfa1e000028005adbce.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Shortly after taking office, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt set out to permanently limit the agency’s regulatory power in what he billed as a “Back to Basics” agenda focusing on cleaning up toxic waste and providing safe drinking water ― but not curbing new industrial pollution. Former administrators warn that it could take anywhere from a few years to three decades for future administrations to restore the EPA to where it was a year ago, before the regulatory rollbacks, mass attrition and budget cuts. “If [former President Barack] Obama’s name is near it ― irrespective of whether it’s good, bad or indifferent ― they’re undoing it,” Christine Todd Whitman, who served as administrator under former President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003, told HuffPost. “To just mindlessly do it is… mindless. There’s no other word for it.” The lasting damage is already significant, and seems likely to get worse. Despite rumors that Pruitt may leave his post early to run for Senate or governor in Oklahoma, his home state, or take over as attorney general if Jeff Sessions steps down, the administrator has plans to ramp up his efforts in 2018. He told The Wall Street Journal this week that his second year would focus on accelerating efforts to remake the agency and speeding up the permitting process.“There’s tremendous opportunity to show really significant results to the American people in a really short time frame,” Pruitt said. Some of the policies Pruitt has rolled back could be restored. The administrator decided in April not to prohibit a pesticide linked to brain damage, immediately prompting lawsuits that could force the agency to issue a ban anyway. The next EPA chief could ramp up enforcement efforts to make up for the dramatic drop in prosecutions of polluters seen so far under Pruitt. A future head of the agency could also reverse Pruitt’s October order barring scientists who receive agency grants from serving on its advisory boards, and could even, in theory, issue a new order to limit the industry-funded researchers now set to dominate the panels.Yet, Pruitt’s swift moves to axe major rules that took decades to craft stands apart from previous Republican efforts to slow new regulatory regimes at the agency. Take, for example, the EPA’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, which curbs heavy metal pollution from coal-fired power plants. The rule took over two decades to craft: It began under former President Bill Clinton, was briefly sidelined during the Bush era, and came into effect more than two years ago, under Obama. But, in 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had not adequately accounted for the cost of adhering to the regulation, and sent the case back to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal government had been scheduled to defend the rule. Then, in April, Pruitt ordered the agency to “fully review” the findings behind the rule, stoking fears among environmentalists that the new industry-friendly administration was laying the groundwork for a potential repeal. Consider, too, the Clean Power Plan. The signature Obama-era climate policy limiting carbon dioxide pollution from power plants and incentivizing renewable energy came out of a policy analysis started in the mid-1990s. Back then, the Clinton administration drafted what became known as the Cannon memo, arguing that greenhouse gas emissions could be regulated as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. That formed the legal foundation of Massachusetts’ landmark Supreme Court victory over the Bush-era EPA in 2007. From there, the Bush administration began writing what became known as the Endangerment Finding ― that greenhouse gases posed a threat to public health and required EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act ― although it never implemented the policy. In 2009, the Obama administration picked up the baton, issuing the Endangerment Finding and, in response to its mandate, drafting the Clean Power Plan. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the rule in February 2016. Rather than defend or modify that regulation, Pruitt proposed repealing the plan outright in October. He didn’t provide an alternative.Most legal scholars argue that overturning the Endangerment Finding would require Pruitt to prove in court that climate change isn’t caused by humans. Still, the hard-line climate change deniers with whom Pruitt has allied himself are calling on the EPA to attempt just that.If the Clean Power Plan were completely repealed, the next administration at the EPA would have to start from square one, said Carol Browner, who served as EPA administrator under Clinton from 1993 to 2001. She said it could take “20 to 30 years.”The agency suffered from “sort of benign neglect” under Bush, said Browner, but “it wasn’t a forced policy.”“Under Pruitt, what they’re doing is conscientiously tearing the place down,” she said.The EPA did not respond to a request for comment. The EPA’s dismantling does not rest in Pruitt’s hands alone. The Trump administration has proposed slashing the agency’s budget by 30 percent ― to a 40-year low of $5.7 billion ― and the Republican-dominated Congress seems ready to make significant cuts. Restoring the agency’s capacity in the future will require replenishing its coffers with adequate funding. “It’s just the sheer fact that you’d need a budget to do it,” Browner said, referring to the challenge of reversing the damage Pruitt has inflicted.Restaffing the agency after Pruitt could pose a series of challenges. More than 700 personnel have left the EPA over the past year, according to a joint investigation published last month by The New York Times and ProPublica. Of the employees who quit, retired or took buyouts, more than 200 were scientists, and another 96 were environmental protection specialists. The EPA aims to cut staffing by nearly 50 percent ― from 15,000 to less than 8,000 ― by 2021, the agency told the Washington Examiner this month.“You’d have to convince some of those who have been dismissed to come back,” Whitman said. “You’d want some of them to come back and help break in new people so you don’t have a complete vacuum of that institutional knowledge.”“We’re in grave danger of losing that,” she added. “It’s a very complicated agency, these regulations are complicated, the rules Congress enacted when they enacted the legislation are very prescriptive.”She warned that it could become harder to attract top young talent in the future if they fear the agency cannot offer stable, long-term careers. There are other, less tangible potential effects of EPA’s pendular approach to regulatory policy and newfound status as a culture war battleground. Pruitt’s oft-repeated slogan ― that “regulations ought to make things regular” ― runs amok of his radical agenda to roll back rules that scientists say are necessary to curb pollution, and therefore appear likely to return under future administrations. Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator from 2013 to 2017, said Pruitt is creating the exact sort of regulatory confusion for businesses that he railed against. “The challenge that this administration is posing, and it’s certainly not limited to the EPA, is they’ve created a wealth of uncertainty,” McCarthy told HuffPost. “At EPA, it’s uncertainties in the business community. Do they ever take rules seriously if every administration undoes everything the prior administration did?”"

The story, published Thursday, found that throughout the last two decades of his publishing career, Levinsohn has been a defendant in two sexual harassment lawsuits, has created workplace environments hostile to women and has made homophobic comments, according to uncovered court documents, financial filings and interviews with 26 of his former colleagues. Levinsohn, whom the Los Angeles Times’ parent company, Tronc, hired to run the paper in August, previously held high-ranking roles at Guggenheim Digital Media, CBS, the search engine Alta Vista, Yahoo and News Corp. The two lawsuits against Levinsohn were filed by female colleagues at Alta Vista in 2001 and at News Corp. in 2006, NPR reported.During the 2001 suit, Levinsohn admitted under oath that he’d openly ranked the “hotness” of women in the office, had discussed whether one of his female subordinates had a second job as a stripper and had speculated on her sex life. In the 2006 lawsuit, a female subordinate alleged that workplace sexual harassment thrived under Levinsohn. When she asked him for a promotion, she claimed, he pointed to a female reporter who was a former pinup model, saying she had “learned how to work her way to the top.”At Yahoo, colleagues and industry peers said Levinsohn’s approach to selling ads was to throw big parties where bikini-clad models mingled with Yahoo’s business partners ― an alienating process for women attempting to make business deals, some told NPR. (Yahoo and AOL merged in 2017 to become Oath, HuffPost’s parent company.)In 2013, while overseeing Guggenheim Digital Media’s portfolio, which included The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard magazine, Levinsohn said he was leaving a company party early because it was attended by of “a bunch of ladies and fags,” sources told NPR.At another party months later, witnesses say they saw a then-married Levinsohn aggressively kiss another woman with “his hands ranging over her body” in plain view of his employees. The Los Angeles Times guild campaigning for the union said Thursday that the accusations outlined in NPR’s report shed light on the many ways Tronc has failed the Times staff. Ross Levinsohn should resign or be fired immediately. A man who sexually harasses women, engages in “slut-shaming” and refers to gay men as “fags” is not fit to lead our newspaper.Levinsohn declined to answer questions for NPR’s story ― but according to the report, he called NPR CEO Jarl Mohn on Wednesday, calling the allegations “lies” and threatening to potentially seek legal counsel.On Friday, the Los Angeles Times staffers successfully voted to unionize. The union campaign has largely centered on the staffers’ complaints about editorial leadership, fair wages and outsize salaries and perks for top executives. Management has taken a strong stance against the campaign.The same day, Tronc announced Levinsohn has taken a voluntary unpaid leave of office while his conduct is investigated."

Silverman said the rabbis’ activism is driven by their Jewish faith ― and the fear that the asylum-seekers may face torture, human trafficking or death if they are deported. She also said it was inspired by the story of Anne Frank as well as by the sanctuary movement in the U.S.Silverman told Israel’s i24 News that if asylum-seekers need protection, the Jewish rabbis in her network will be ready. “We’re saying [to the migrants], ’Come ... we are thousands of Israeli families and we will be here for you and you can come and you live in our homes and the government will have to come through us to take you.” About 35,000 Eritrean and Sudanese natives live in Israel, Haaretz reports, along with about 5,000 of their children who were born in the country. Many of the adults entered Israel illegally through Egypt, and have temporary visas that must be renewed every three months.The next time these migrants attempt to renew their visas, those who don’t meet certain criteria will face with a tough choice ― to return to their country of origin or to a third country like Rwanda or Uganda, according to the Associated Press. As an incentive, the Israeli government is offering those who choose to be deported before April a payment of $3,500 and the cost of their airline tickets. Those who stay past April may face indefinite incarceration, the AP reports.Silverman believes all of this is a clear violation of Jewish values. She referred to the way that non-Jews took great risks to hide Anne Frank and other Jewish people inside their homes during World War II, in an attempt to save lives. Silverman told i24 News the African migrants in Israel are facing a similar situation. “No one’s going to go to their deaths in Israel. The Israeli government isn’t proposing anything of that sort,” she said. “But we know that when people are sent from here to other countries that they are back on the refugee trail …. Absolutely no guarantee of their safety, in fact they’re at very, very great risk. If we are sending them to these other countries, then we are complicit.” Silverman, RHR and a representative for the Israeli government did not immediately respond to HuffPost requests for comment.The religious leaders who attended Tuesday’s conference hope to gather support for the campaign among their communities across Israel, Haaretz reports, and get American Jewish communities involved as well. Rabbi Yehiel Grenimann, RHR’s director of organization development, referred to the example set by the American civil rights leader Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who participated in civil rights demonstrations with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. If Heschel were alive today, he would be “passionately protesting the plans to expel African asylum seekers and refugees to a tragic fate in Africa,” Grenimann wrote on Facebook on Jan. 15. “Especially when these things are being done by representatives of a people who have themselves suffered expulsion, refugee status and worse in the past.”Late last year, the U.N. refugee agency expressed serious concerns about Israel’s deportation of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum-seekers. The agency said it is worried people who have been relocated have not found adequate safety.The UNHCR reports that since 2009, Israeli authorities have recognized only eight Eritrean and two Sudanese natives as refugees. About 500 Sudanese asylum-seekers from the Darfur region were granted a similar residency status last year. "

Many of the adults entered Israel illegally through Egypt, and have temporary visas that must be renewed every three months.The next time these migrants attempt to renew their visas, those who don’t meet certain criteria will face with a tough choice ― to return to their country of origin or to a third country like Rwanda or Uganda, according to the Associated Press. As an incentive, the Israeli government is offering those who choose to be deported before April a payment of $3,500 and the cost of their airline tickets. Those who stay past April may face indefinite incarceration, the AP reports.Silverman believes all of this is a clear violation of Jewish values. She referred to the way that non-Jews took great risks to hide Anne Frank and other Jewish people inside their homes during World War II, in an attempt to save lives. Silverman told i24 News the African migrants in Israel are facing a similar situation. “No one’s going to go to their deaths in Israel. The Israeli government isn’t proposing anything of that sort,” she said. “But we know that when people are sent from here to other countries that they are back on the refugee trail …. Absolutely no guarantee of their safety, in fact they’re at very, very great risk. If we are sending them to these other countries, then we are complicit.” Silverman, RHR and a representative for the Israeli government did not immediately respond to HuffPost requests for comment.The religious leaders who attended Tuesday’s conference hope to gather support for the campaign among their communities across Israel, Haaretz reports, and get American Jewish communities involved as well. Rabbi Yehiel Grenimann, RHR’s director of organization development, referred to the example set by the American civil rights leader Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who participated in civil rights demonstrations with Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. If Heschel were alive today, he would be “passionately protesting the plans to expel African asylum seekers and refugees to a tragic fate in Africa,” Grenimann wrote on Facebook on Jan. 15. “Especially when these things are being done by representatives of a people who have themselves suffered expulsion, refugee status and worse in the past.”Late last year, the U.N. refugee agency expressed serious concerns about Israel’s deportation of Eritrean and Sudanese asylum-seekers. The agency said it is worried people who have been relocated have not found adequate safety.The UNHCR reports that since 2009, Israeli authorities have recognized only eight Eritrean and two Sudanese natives as refugees. About 500 Sudanese asylum-seekers from the Darfur region were granted a similar residency status last year. "
71,MEDIA,The Los Angeles Times Votes To Unionize,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/la-times-union-vote_us_5a4d4c38e4b025f99e1fb8a1,"A day before the vote, senior editors had made a last-ditch effort to quash the unionizing campaign.",2018-01-19,People walk past the LA Times building in Los Angeles.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a25bee41400002862b6b61e.jpeg?cache=CT9B23PTrV&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Los Angeles Times staffers have voted to unionize, defying pressure from the newspaper’s leaders to abandon the effort. The newsroom held a vote to join the NewsGuild-Communications Workers of America in the first week of January, and the National Labor Relations Board tallied the results on Friday. Staffers and their union representation will now begin negotiations on a contract with management.The announcement comes a day after an NPR report uncovered allegations of sexual misconduct against the Times’ publisher and CEO, Ross Levinsohn, increasing tensions between staffers and the executives who have long been hostile to the union campaign. On Friday, the paper’s publisher, Tronc, announced that Levinsohn has taken a voluntary unpaid leave of absence while his conduct is investigated.“We will not hesitate to take further action, if appropriate, once the review is complete,” Justin Dearborn, Tronc’s chief executive officer, said in a statement.The day before the Jan. 4 vote, the paper’s editor-in-chief, Lewis D’Vorkin, and its former interim executive editor, Jim Kirk, made a last-ditch effort to quash the union campaign.In a lengthy letter to the newsroom that day, D’Vorkin and Kirk warned that unionizing would not guarantee better compensation, and suggested that union leaders may not act in the best interest of Times staffers.“Will they represent you, or parity for the union?” they wrote. “So, the question to you is do you want to preserve your independence and the independence of the Los Angeles Times or do you want someone else negotiating on your behalf?” the letter read.The letter also attempted to raise suspicion about union leaders who may say “they can protect against layoffs,” and listed unionized newsrooms where layoffs have recently occurred, including HuffPost. However, it is standard in unionized newsrooms for management to maintain the right to lay off employees. Tronc has also firmly rebuffed the union campaign that staffers launched in October, warning that in attempts to negotiate for better compensation, union members may be forced to lose out on other benefits, such as 401(k) matching.The Times’ union campaign organizers say the claims that there won’t be enough money to go around are baseless. Tronc is spending an outsize amount on salaries and perks for its executives, they say, including an “eye-popping” $8.1 million paid to Tronc CEO Justin Dearborn last year, more than $4 million spent on a private jet for Tronc chairman Michael Ferro and other costs on executives they say are much higher than what comparable publishers spend.The Los Angeles Times is the latest in a wave of media outlets to seek union representation in recent years. Others include HuffPost, Salon, Vice, MTV News, ThinkProgress, The Guardian US, Jacobin, The Intercept and Thrillist. "

Darren Soto asked for clarification on the Florida waters decision at a congressional hearing Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6227e22200004b00b4f31b.jpeg?ops=crop_26_103_4676_2600%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — Despite Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s announcement last week, the waters off the coast of Florida are still being considered for future offshore oil and gas drilling, according to the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.At a congressional hearing Friday, Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.) asked acting BOEM Director Walter Cruickshank if Zinke was “getting ahead of the game” when he tweeted that he had taken Florida waters “off the table.” “The secretary’s statement stands on its own,” Cruickshank told the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. “We are following the process and the secretary’s decisions will be reflected in the proposed program decision.”“By ‘stand on its own,’ it just stands on its own but it’s not an official action? Is that what you mean?” Soto questioned. “It is not a formal action, no,” Cruickshank said. The acting director added later that Florida’s coastal waters “are still part of the analysis until the secretary gives us an official decision.” Zinke has given the people of Florida a false sense of security, Soto said at the hearing.“As you can appreciate, many Floridians now believe that we are off the table, that there is going to be no offshore drilling because of that statement,” the congressman said. “And that’s not true. We still have to go through an analysis to determine whether that’s going to happen or not.”A few days into the new year, the Trump administration released a sweeping plan to boost America’s fossil fuel production that would make available for drilling leases roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, including huge swaths of the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. The move drew instant outrage from both Democrats and Republicans. Less than a week later, just two days into a 60-day public comment period, Zinke announced that at the recommendation of Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) — whom he called a “straightforward leader that can be trusted” — he would remove the state’s coastal waters from the areas that could be leased for drilling. Zinke broke the news from Tallahassee after a brief face-to-face meeting with Scott, an otherwise staunch Trump ally who had pushed back against the offshore proposal even before it was officially revealed.

And despite the gravity of the situation, Washington is surprisingly unprepared.“I think the most frustrating aspect of this all is the total lack of communication from anyone in management,” said a U.S. Department of Agriculture employee.If Congress doesn’t come up with a funding agreement by midnight, the government will shut down. The last time there was a shutdown was in 2013. It lasted for 16 days.The atmosphere in Washington now couldn’t be more different from then. In 2013, there was widespread attention and alarm about the possibility and potential effects of a shutdown. Federal agencies communicated their plans to employees and the media alike.Not so much this time. Of the dozens of federal employees HuffPost spoke with, many said that as of Friday morning, they had received no guidance from the leadership of their departments. Others had, but only very recently.Mid-morning Friday, employees at the departments of Homeland Security, Interior, Commerce and State, among others, said they’d received notices telling them agency leaders were “working to update our contingency plans for executing an orderly shutdown of activities that would be affected by a lapse in appropriations.”In other words, just 12 hours ahead of a potential shutdown, some federal agencies were still figuring out what they were going to do.“Every agency is required to have a plan on the shelf about what they’re going to do in a shutdown. But those plans are plans,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. “There’s a big difference between having a document that says, ‘Open in case of emergency,’ and being able to do it appropriately.”As The Daily Beast reported, of the nearly 130 agencies and offices that submit contingency plans to the Office of Management and Budget, 66 had not publicly updated their proposals since 2015 as of Thursday afternoon.An employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said her agency has been working for a while on contingency preparations ― but they have not been able to send out any of that information to employees, under orders from DHS and the Office of Management and Budget.“We haven’t been allowed to notify them of their status or share any of the official documentation, like, ‘What happens if my benefits aren’t being paid? Do I have to pay them?’” she said, adding that it’s very different from 2013, when they let staffers know how the shutdown would affect them days in advance.Part of the calculation, the FEMA employee explained, is that the administration doesn’t want it to look like the government agencies don’t have faith in Congress to do its job.“It’s very bad for our employees, because they don’t get the information they need, and they’re very anxious about this,” she said.A USDA employee told HuffPost he had to ask a human resources staffer about shutdown protocols. The answer he received was later contradicted by his boss.Another USDA employee said that in 2011, when there were rumors of a shutdown, workers received emails with instructions on what to do. And in 2013, when it became clear there would indeed be a shutdown, there were even more detailed notices.“This time there has been literally nothing,” the employee said. “No emails, meetings, posts to our internal bulletin board, not one thing.”“Zero guidance so far, from high- or low-level managers (only unofficial guidance based on our past experiences with shutdowns),” an employee at the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday morning. “Usually by this time we have received at least one high-level email letting us know what to do in case of shutdown, how to report to work Monday, what to do, etc.” Part of the reason the federal government is less prepared than it was in 2013, under President Barack Obama, is that the Trump administration simply doesn’t have the people or expertise in place to oversee something like this. Stier’s group looks at more than 600 government jobs that require Senate confirmation. Currently, he said, there are more jobs for which the Trump administration has failed even to nominate anyone than there are jobs where someone has actually been confirmed.“There are some big issues that the administration’s going to have to deal with, and I don’t think they are ready for it,” Stier said. “You have a group of people at the very top who have not been in government previously, certainly not been in government running the entire show, and that’s going to present a real problem.”Many federal employees who spoke with HuffPost said they were simply going about their business as on any other Friday. They’re getting used to shutdown threats, and there is nothing they can do about the current mess.When the government shut down in 2013, it was the first time it had done so since President Bill Clinton’s administration, when there were shutdowns in 1995 and 1996. Those shutdowns were considered massive mistakes on the part of the GOP-controlled Congress, and Clinton emphasized the harm to federal workers in his well-received State of the Union address in 1996.But lately, it seems there’s the possibility of a shutdown every few months. And Washington is growing used to it.“The mood isn’t really anything different than usual,” a Federal Communications Commission employee said. “Most federal government employees have been around a while and are kind of used to the ‘will we or won’t we shut down’ drama at this point ― it’s been so many years of continuing resolutions for short periods of time, it’s like we are numb to it.”Roughly 800,000 federal employees would be furloughed without pay in the event of a shutdown. Congress typically authorizes back pay. Federal workers said they expect that to happen again if the government closes, but nothing is certain with this Congress. Another USDA employee said she has been stocking up her emergency funds since November because of the possibility that she would have to go without pay for a period of time.“People seem resigned to the possibility of a shutdown,” an Interior Department employee told HuffPost. “Most people seem to hope that if a shutdown happens that it does not last long. The 2013 shutdown resulted in cascading delays in getting important work done, including permitting and granting rights of way, which was distressing for tribes, local governments, taxpayers, and companies wanting to do business on public lands.”“It is likely that a shutdown would have an even greater impact on DOI’s work this time around,” the employee continued, “because we have fewer employees to do the work.” Chris D’Angelo contributed reporting.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said 80,000 people will likely be furloughed in a shutdown. The correct number is 800,000. "
74,POLITICS,Dreamers Don't Want Congress To Save Them By Hurting Other Immigrants,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dreamers-daca-shutdown-deadline_us_5a620f0ee4b074ce7a07bd44,There are some compromises that young undocumented activists and Democrats say they won't make when crafting an immigration deal.,2018-01-19,Dreamers have called on Democrats to vote against a government funding bill unless they get a deal on immigration. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6210351f00009a00db97d0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Undocumented immigrants and their allies know that compromise will be necessary for Congress to broker a deal to help the 700,000 young people set to lose deportation protections under President Donald Trump. But they don’t want Democrats to sell out other immigrants to make it happen. “Our safety can’t come at the cost of our values, of our dignity and of having the back of black immigrants and standing up to white nationalist sentiment and racism,” said Greisa Martinez, a Dreamer with the advocacy group United We Dream. Democrats are pressing for a deal by midnight to help so-called Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom the president put at risk of losing their jobs and deportation relief when he rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Many have threatened to vote against government spending until DACA is addressed, which could risk a government shutdown. With hours to go, there is still a gulf between what the president and his immigration restrictionist allies want in a deal and what is acceptable to Democrats, and to the Dreamers they’re trying to help. The president says he won’t do anything for them unless he gets his border “wall” ― in whatever form that means ― and changes to restrict legal immigration. Dreamer and immigrant community advocates have red lines, too. As the most visible members of the undocumented community, Dreamer activists have argued for years that their protections shouldn’t come at the expense of others. Some say Democrats should not accept a deal that would put more border patrol agents into communities or other interior enforcement efforts such as adding detention beds. Some want to protect immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and other nations who are already in the United States under temporary protected status. Some want to save family reunification visas or the diversity visa lottery. It’s likely that any deal ― if Congress makes one at all ― will have pieces that disappoint activists and Democratic lawmakers. But there’s broad consensus between both groups on one thing: The idea that Republicans can receive a slew of immigration changes in exchange for only one from the left is a non-starter. There are two major bipartisan proposals in Congress right now. In the House, there’s a bill spearheaded by Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas), Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.) that would pair Dreamer protections with various border security measures, meant to be a “narrower” approach.That bill has concessions that Democrats and many activists are willing to swallow in exchange for DACA. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said he would probably support the bill “if it came down to it.” His main non-negotiable issue is eliminating family-based visas, he said. “I think we’re going to cross a point where there’s going to be that balance between the 800,000 lives [of DACA recipients] and let’s say the Aguilar-Hurd legislation, and I would say Aguilar-Hurd would win that day,” he told HuffPost. The bill lacks some of the provisions border community advocates are afraid of. Andrea Guerrero, the chair of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said their top concerns are preventing a massive increase in border agents and additional infrastructure ― or wall ― that isn’t based on any analysis or input from people who live there. Guerrero said her group thinks the Hurd-Aguilar bill addresses border security in a responsible way.Advocates don’t see border communities as a good giveaway to get aid for Dreamers ― it’s one thing to make concessions on technology, but another to approve more agents who can conduct arrests up to 100 miles from the border, including of young undocumented people. Guerrero said she and others from her group, including Dreamers, are lobbying Congress to not throw the border under the bus. “We’re always concerned that members of Congress are going to take a shortcut, are going to ignore the realities of our communities and are going to respond to the rhetoric,” she said. The other bipartisan proposal on Dreamers, this one from six senators, includes border security measures and tweaks to the legal immigration system, meant to meet Trump’s demands. Trump rejected the bill when Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) presented it to him last week, but they formally introduced it on Wednesday evening anyway, and said it has support from seven Republicans in total. Advocates and Democrats in the House have some concerns with the bill, but stressed it was still a good step. Grijalva said he does not like its changes to family-based immigration system. Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that he did not see how the Congressional Hispanic Caucus would embrace it, but did not fully rule out the possibility that could change with the final language. A potential piece of contention is the fact that the bill would make significant changes to the diversity visa lottery, as requested by Trump. The Congressional Black Caucus has been particularly opposed to past efforts to end the lottery because African immigrants make up a large proportion of the people granted green cards through the program. Trump strengthened the resolve of supporters of the diversity visa lottery last week when he reportedly referred to African nations as “shithole countries” and dismissed senators’ proposal to help Haitians living in the U.S., said Jonathan Jayes-Green, a Dreamer and the co-founder of the advocacy group UndocuBlack Network. His organization, which represents black immigrants, believes a deal should protect the visa lottery and grant relief to people who are losing temporary protected status, including from Haiti. “Up until last week, partners and the general public might have been willing to compromise on it [the visa lottery],” he said. “But where we are right now is everyone has clear indication of what we’ve been saying for a while: that Trump’s policy changes have racist motivations.”The entire bill put forward by another group of House Republicans, led by Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is a non-starter for both Democrats and advocates for reform, both from the left and libertarian-leaning side. That bill would make a host of changes to the entire immigration system, including cutting legal immigration, criminalizing being in the U.S. without legal status and mandating that employers check immigration status and provide massive funding for the border.One of the items Democrats and advocates find most disturbing is that it would change the law for asylum-seekers. Durbin said on Wednesday that Republicans had said narrowing protections for asylum-seekers was part of border security, something he rejected. “I told them it’s unreasonable,” Durbin told reporters. “We can’t fix the entire immigration system in a matter of hours.” Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a former immigration attorney, said Thursday that changing asylum law as part of a deal was “not going to happen.” “We’re not going to throw out settled law that the world has been proud of since the Nazis as a hostage payment for saving the Dreamers,” she said. “The Dreamers wouldn’t agree to that.” "

79,POLITICS,Trump Is Scared Of Sharks And 10 Other Things Stormy Daniels Revealed,Elyse Wanshel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-sharks-stormy-daniels-interview_us_5a620056e4b074ce7a07a008,"In Touch published its full 2011 interview with the porn star, and boy, is it entertaining.",2018-01-19,"Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, at the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Las Vegas on Jan. 18, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6218ba220000251ab4f2ef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In Touch magazine printed its full 2011 interview with former adult film actress Stephanie Clifford on Friday. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, talked at length about her previous relationship with President Donald Trump.And there is one detail that many found pretty Jaws-dropping — Trump is terrified of sharks, she said.According to Clifford, she once met Trump for a date in his bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Over dinner Clifford learned something rather interesting about the then-reality show personality.“The strangest thing about that night — this was the best thing ever,” she said. “You could see the television from the little dining room table and he was watching Shark Week and he was watching a special about the U.S.S. something and it sank and it was like the worst shark attack in history. He is obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks. He was like, ‘I donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.’ He was like riveted. He was like obsessed. It’s so strange, I know.”The anecdote about sharks made quite a splash on Twitter.As odd as that story is, Trump has expressed his dislike of the predatory fish in the past.Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a Trump lawyer had arranged a $130,000 payment to Clifford in October 2016 to keep quiet about their relationship. This was right before the presidential election.Both Clifford and Trump’s legal team have since denied the affair and the payment.So earlier this week, In Touch released a few tempting details online from its unpublished 2011 interview with Clifford.The magazine’s initial disclosures included how the two met at the American Century celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July 2006 — the year after the future president married Melania Trump and just months after she gave birth to their son, Barron. In Touch also highlighted such details as Trump brushing off the subject of Melania during that first date with Clifford and Clifford describing their sex as “textbook generic.” She also talked about how Trump promised to get her on his show, “The Apprentice,” and used that as an excuse to keep in touch over the next year.With the release of In Touch’s full interview on Friday, here are 10 more fascinating tidbits:Trump did not dress up for his first date with Clifford.“I went in [to his Lake Tahoe hotel room] and I was all dressed up because I had just assumed that we were going to go to dinner, but he meant to have dinner in his room. Like he wasn’t dressed to go out at all, just lounging. I remember taking a jab at him. I remember saying, because he was all sprawled out on the couch, watching television or something. He was wearing pajama pants. And I was like, ‘Ha, does Mr. Hefner know that you stole his outfit?’”Trump bragged about himself during their first date.“He kept showing me he was on the cover of a magazine that had just come out and it was some sort of money magazine, I wish I could remember which one it was. But he had it in the room and he kept showing it to me and I was like, ‘Dude, I know who you are.’ He was trying to sell me, I guess.”Later she adds:“He just kept talking about this magazine that he was on the cover of, like, ‘Look at this magazine, don’t I look great on the cover?’”Trump is superstitious about his hair. “He said that he thought that if he cut his hair or changed it, that he would lose his power and his wealth. And I laughed hysterically at him.”Trump has some pretty slick moves. Of their first date, Clifford recalled:“I had to use the bathroom and I went to the restroom, which was in the bedroom. Like I said, it was a big suite. I could describe the suite perfectly. When I came out, he was sitting on the bed and he was like, ‘Come here.’ And I was like, ‘Ugh, here we go.’”On their second date at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Clifford recalled Trump saying to her:“’You know, you’re so beautiful. I love your little nose, it’s like a little beet.’ I go, ‘Did you say a beet? Like, what the f―?’ I started giving him a hard time about it. And he goes, ‘No, no, no, no! It’s majestic. It’s a very smart nose, like an eagle.’”Clifford has a part of Trump’s anatomy etched in her memory.“I can definitely describe his junk perfectly, if I ever have to.”The two didn’t use protection that one time they had sex.“It was kind of in the moment. And I was really kind of upset about it because I am so, like, careful. The company I work for is condom-only. But I remember for a fact that we didn’t because I’m allergic to latex. And I didn’t go up there with condoms on me. I know that for a fact because 99% of men don’t carry non-latex condoms on them, so I usually always have one in my backpack but I thought I was going to dinner, so I only had a tiny little cocktail purse.”After sex, Trump had a request for Clifford.“Here’s the weird thing. He had one of my DVDs and he asked me to sign it for him and I did.”After their initial affair, Trump would always call Clifford from a blocked number.“The number was always blocked. He called me about every 10 days. He always called me ‘honeybunch.’ He’s like, ‘How’s it going, honeybunch?’”Trump never got Clifford on “Celebrity Apprentice.” When Jenna Jameson appeared in an episode, he used it as an excuse to call Clifford.“So he called me and was like, ‘Did you see Jenna Jameson on my show? I didn’t know she was going to go on. That’s bullshit. She made a fool of herself.’ He said, ‘She’s a bimbo. You’re so much better.’ I was like, ‘I didn’t even know about it.’ I just thought that was really funny. Don’t care. Totally over it.”In retrospect, Clifford feels sorry for Melania Trump.“At the time, I didn’t think that much about it. But now that I have a baby that’s the same age that [Barron] was at the time, I’m like, ‘Wow, what a d―.’”"

Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) was so moved by the story of Jorge Garcia, a 39-year-old man deported to Mexico this week after living most of his life in the U.S., that she plans to bring his wife Cindy Garcia as her plus-one guest to the 2018 State of the Union address.“This week, America watched in horror as Jorge Garcia, a father of two and husband to an American citizen, who was brought to this country at 10 years old and has never received so much as a traffic ticket, was torn from his family and the only home he knows,” Dingell said in a statement on Thursday.“Jorge’s wife Cindy has shown incredible resilience and courage in the face of these impossible circumstances,” Dingell continued. “I am honored that she will join me at the State of the Union to be a voice for the hundreds of thousands of aspiring Americans who are part of the fabric of our communities, and who deserve a pathway to legal status in the country they call home.”Garcia, who lived with his family in the Detroit area, received temporary extensions during President Barack Obama’s administration that allowed him to avert a deportation order from 2009, according to the Detroit Free Press. Immigration and Customs Enforcement renewed the order in November. Dingell said she asked ICE to extend the order until Jan. 15, allowing Garcia to spend the holidays with his family.Garcia’s attorney, Mayra Miles, is petitioning to reunite him with his family, she told HuffPost. The process typically takes about a year, although Garcia may encounter difficulties because he didn’t leave the U.S. voluntarily.A handful of House Democrats, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), John Lewis (Ga.), Frederica Wilson (Fla.) and Maxine Waters (Calif.) said they’re planning to skip the State of the Union."

Amanda Thomashow, who reported Nassar to police in 2014, was joined by sister Jessica in court earlier this week, and Katie Payne and Maureen Payne Baum were on the “Today” show late last year to tell their stories. More than 100 accusers and their family members have shared victim impact statements in court. Nassar served as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University until he was fired in 2016. Nassar, who is already serving 60 years in prison for possession of child pornography, faces a new sentence of up to 125 years after pleading guilty in November to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct.In court, the Johnson sisters recalled trusting Nassar largely because he was an Olympic doctor with framed photos of the athletes he had treated.“I felt so lucky that I got to see the same doctor as all of my idols in the gymnastics world,” Maddie said.Their father, Brad Johnson, who is also a doctor, called out MSU and USA Gymnastics for allowing Nassar’s behavior to continue for so long.“These institutions emphasize the importance of safe spaces. Ironically, the only safe place that was created was for Larry Nassar,” he said, per Deadspin’s Dvora Meyers, who first noted the number of siblings appearing together in court.The Johnson sisters said Nassar didn’t abuse them during appointments when their father accompanied them, but other former patients have said the misconduct occurred within feet of their parents.Maureen Payne Baum said Nassar once briefly assaulted her while standing in between her and her father. She and her sister have said their gymnastics coaches encouraged them to see Nassar when they competed in the sport around ages 12 to 14. Victim 11 and Victim 136 said Nassar asked other medical staff to leave the room during appointments.Amanda Thomashow said in court that she has experienced anxiety and depression since reporting Nassar for abuse in 2014, adding that she had put aside her dream of becoming a doctor. “When Larry Nassar assaulted me and MSU covered for him, it changed the trajectory of my life,” she said. “Someday I will be whole again.”Jessica Thomashow said Nassar abused her when she sought treatments for gymnastics-related injuries when she was 9 and 12. “What you did to me was twisted,” she said. “You manipulated me and my family. How dare you.”Brian McKeen, the attorney for Katie Payne and Maureen Payne Baum, criticized MSU’s attempt to dismiss lawsuits brought by Nassar’s accusers while simultaneously purporting to support the survivors.“MSU’s hypocrisy is shameful,” he said in a statement issued this week. “The University claims that many of the assaults happened so long ago that the law now bars the claims from being brought. This firmly places the blame on teenage girls for being terrified to speak up, or for their naiveté regarding the assaults.”More than a dozen MSU employees were tipped off to Nassar’s behavior in the two decades before his arrest but did nothing, according to a Detroit News report.

82,POLITICS,White House Rolls Back Protections For Planned Parenthood,Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/white-house-rolls-back-protections-for-planned-parenthood_us_5a62134be4b01d91b2551fa4,The administration justified the move by saying it wants to give states more control over their Medicaid programs.,2018-01-19,"Women dressed as handmaids from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" demonstrate against cuts for Planned Parenthood in the Republican Senate health care bill at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on June 27, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a62180c1f00003c00db97e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The White House announced Friday that it will no longer discourage states from attempting to defund Planned Parenthood, further restricting women’s access to health care. President Donald Trump wrote a letter to state Medicaid directors in which he said he was rolling back an Obama-era guidance that advised states not to defund the family-planning provider. “Reinstating the pre-2016 standards frees up states to once again decide for themselves what reasonable standards they use to protect Medicaid programs and their beneficiaries,” Charmaine Yoest, assistant health and human services secretary for public affairs, said in a call with reporters.The Department of Health and Human Services said the initial guidance “restricted states’ ability to take certain actions against family-planning providers that offer abortion services.”Dawn Laguens, Executive Vice President for Planned Parenthood Action Fund, called the President’s actions an attempt to infringe on American freedoms.“On the anniversary of the historic Women’s March, the Trump-Pence administration makes their agenda crystal clear: They are laser-focused on using their power to control women’s bodies and lives,” Laguens said in a statement. “Their latest action encourages states to try to block access to care at Planned Parenthood and control where women can go for health care. Without Planned Parenthood, many of our patients would lose access to health care altogether — either because there are no other providers in their community or because other clinics cannot serve all of our patients.”Planned Parenthood says abortions make up about 3 percent of the services it provides. The group primarily provides sex education and birth control options.Trump also used a live video stream on Friday to address thousands of people at the March for Life rally. The rally, which took place in Washington, D.C., is the largest anti-abortion rights gathering in the country. Activists plan to march to the Supreme Court to protest outside of the building.There is some evidence that limiting access to abortion does not mean fewer women seek the procedure. The rate of teen abortions actually surged in Texas after Republicans cut the state’s family planning budget in 2011 and shut down more than 80 women’s health clinics, according to Texas A&M University research published last year. “Not only is blocking care at Planned Parenthood dangerous, it’s unpopular ― which is why it failed in Congress six times,” Planned Parenthood said in a statement. “Poll after poll shows that the American people overwhelmingly support Planned Parenthood and strongly oppose these attacks on their health care.”"
