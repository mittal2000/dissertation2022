2,POLITICS,The Most Controversial Democratic Ad Of The Virginia Election Was Based On A True Story,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/latino-victory-fund-video-pickup-truck-true-story-colin-rogero_us_5a0b78c9e4b0b17ffce1149b,The creator of a Latino Victory Fund video was once chased by bigots in a pickup.,2017-11-15,"The ad ""American Nightmare,"" released by the Latino Victory Fund, depicted supporters of Ed Gillespie, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, chasing minority children.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b7c0b1b00004800377129.png?cache=PwsgI8bHMX&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The summer after Colin Rogero’s freshman year in high school, a group of white upper-classmen began spreading the word that, as a Latino, Rogero was not welcome in town. “Whether they were rednecks or not, they were certainly playing the part,” Rogero recalled of his tormentors in 1992, who he noted sported cutoff T-shirts and boasted of their chewing-tobacco consumption.Rogero, the grandson of Cuban immigrants, had recently moved with his family from the city of Miami to the Broward County suburb of Coral Springs, where he was one of the only Latino students at his school. Thanks to his speed, he quickly won a spot on the high school football team as a running back.Walking home from football practice one summer afternoon with his cousin, Rogero saw the group of xenophobic white teenagers trailing him in a black Toyota pickup with hi-riser-style wheels. They yelled threats at the two boys, whom they called “the gangsters from Miami.”Rogero quickly went into running-back mode, bolting down the street as fast as he could, his cousin close at his heels. After hopping the palmetto bushes that lined the main road and cutting through several streets by way of people’s yards, they jumped into a canal and swam to another cousin’s house, where they took shelter for the rest of the day.“They would have hurt us had they caught us, but they weren’t able to,” Rogero recalled.Twenty-five years later, the incident would become the germ of a minute-long video advertisement, “American Nightmare,” that Rogero, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based political advertising firm 76 Words, produced for the Latino Victory Fund, a pro-Democratic political action committee.The Latino Victory Fund commissioned the hard-hitting ad in order to inspire Virginia residents, especially Latinos, to vote for gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, who went on to win last week.In the ad, released Oct. 30, a diverse group of young children ― including a Latino boy and a Muslim girl in a headscarf ― flee menacing white men in a pickup sporting a Confederate flag and a bumper sticker for Northam’s Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie.The brief video spot immediately provoked a barrage of attacks from right-wing media outlets and Republican politicians who claimed Democrats were unfairly painting Gillespie and his supporters as violent white supremacists. Some Democrats even sought to distance themselves from it.Just a day and a half after the ad went on the air, the Latino Victory Fund took it down from television, its website and social media accounts. The group maintains that the withdrawal of the ad was not a response to the uproar but rather a decision to err on the side of sensitivity after the terrorism-motivated truck attack in New York City on Oct. 31.In the following days, controversy over the ad became one of several flashpoints that anxious Democrats worried would muddle Northam’s message in the final stretch of his campaign.Northam’s comfortable win and the Democratic Party’s overall strong performance, boosted by a spike in Latino turnout, effectively put the lie to those fears.But until now, Rogero, 39, has not revealed that the polarizing spot was rooted in his own experience.“There’s a little bit of the artist in every piece of their work. That was true for me in this particular case,” Rogero said.Rogero’s cousin George Fernandez remembers the day that his cousins swam across the canal and popped up in his backyard, soaking wet in T-shirts and shorts. The canal, more than 100 feet wide, was known by locals as a lake.Fernandez’s grandmother said she thought she saw an alligator in the water, but as the figure came closer, it became clear that it was Rogero swimming over.“I was, like, ‘Dude, what are you doing?’” Fernandez remembered. “He told me the whole story about rednecks chasing him in the truck.”It was not hard for Fernandez, who is about the same age as Rogero, to believe. He had encountered similar harassment. And the following year, a group of white men beat Fernandez senseless while calling him a “spic.”“They were just a bunch of rednecks,” he said of the town’s Latino-hating bullies. “That’s all they did ― just messed with people like us. For no reason, they would just chase us.”Two and a half decades later, the country is more diverse than when Rogero and Fernandez were growing up. With strength in numbers has come more acceptance in some parts of the country.But for many Latino Americans, Donald Trump’s election revived fears of vigilante violence and harassment.“We have got a president who started his campaign, on the first day, by attacking our community, calling us rapists and thieves, who has since surrounded himself in the White House by white supremacists and has since put our community in the crosshairs,” said Cristóbal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Fund and a veteran of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.The murder of a progressive activist at the hands of a white supremacist in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August heightened anxiety about the climate that Trump has helped engender with race-baiting rhetoric.Then Gillespie’s gubernatorial bid poured gasoline on these fears. In an attempt to appeal to Republican base voters, Gillespie, the consummate establishment Republican, leaned heavily on racially tinged ads that played to the xenophobic side of Trump’s populism.With the help of graphic and misleading imagery, Gillespie’s campaign warned that Northam would free convicted sex offenders, take down Confederate monuments and implement permissive immigration policies that would enable the Salvadoran gang MS-13 to murder, rape and enslave young women more frequently.Looking at a private poll that showed lackluster enthusiasm for Northam among minority voters, the Latino Victory Fund’s Alex began to worry that Virginia’s Latino voters were insufficiently attuned to the stakes of the contest. And if Gillespie won using the Trump playbook, Republicans could duplicate his efforts in other states, a prospect Alex dreaded.“Our team decided that when Gillespie decided to run these very anti-Latino and anti-immigrant ads that we needed to respond with something powerful,” Alex said. “We wanted to portray the feeling in our community and our neighboring communities, immigrant communities, about what that fear really looks like.”In late September, Alex approached Rogero to discuss the development of an ad that would frame the campaign as a referendum on racially incendiary rhetoric and the violence it is capable of inspiring.Alex’s inspiration for the ad was a bad dream about white supremacist violence, which he said featured xenophobic violence of the kind the ad portrays. Rogero never told him about his experience. The final product contained a combination of both of their ideas. At the end of the ad, the minority children wake up in their beds; the men in the pickup chasing them were just a nightmare. The children’s parents arrive to comfort them and the camera shows them watching television footage of white supremacists marching in Charlottesville with tiki torches.“Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by the American dream?” the ad’s narrator asks.Once the ad went live on Latino Victory Fund’s Twitter and Facebook pages, it quickly went viral, racking up 1 million views, according to Latino Victory Fund. A video about the ad created by the progressive news outlet NowThis was viewed 1.3 million times.Latino Victory Fund purchased a $50,000 test-run of the ad in Spanish on Telemundo and Univision on Oct. 30. But given the free exposure the ad got on television and the internet, the group felt no need to make a larger buy.Right-wing media outlets had a field day with the video, giving it wall-to-wall coverage, even as they, and the Gillespie campaign, condemned it for unfairly smearing Gillespie supporters as racist. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denounced the ad for “stoking political racism.”Northam’s campaign initially stood by the ad. But later in the week, the campaign distanced itself, emphasizing that Northam’s team had no role in the ad’s production.“Ralph Northam would not have run this ad and believes Virginians deserve civility, not escalation,” a Northam spokeswoman said.The Latino Victory Fund believes that, even though it was on air for only a short time, the ad helped motivate Latinos to vote for Northam. The organization points to election eve polling conducted by the Latino Decisions firm showing that Latino voters who had seen ads connecting Gillespie to racism were 50 percentage points more supportive of Northam’s bid than those who had not.Statewide, Latinos made up 6 percent of voters, an increase from 2013, when they constituted 4 percent of voters, according to exit polls. And in precincts where one-third of voters were Latino, Latino turnout went from 33 percent in 2013 to 38 percent this year, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project.One reason Rogero’s story might not have come out until now is because so many people of color and other minorities have had experiences like his. No one needed to tell them that it was inspired by real events.“When I saw it, I’m going to be honest with you, I had chills over my body, because it put, in a nut, the experience of many immigrants in this country,” said Virginia delegate-elect Elizabeth Guzman, who won the race to represent Virginia’s 31st House District with the backing of the Latino Victory Fund.Guzman immigrated to the United States from Peru 20 years ago and at times has felt unwelcome, she said.But the ad also resonated with her because of the experiences of her friends and colleagues. The day the ad came out, one of Guzman’s black campaign volunteers fled a white neighborhood in her Prince William County district after a man in a truck chased after him, according to Guzman.“When I saw that ad, I immediately felt connected,” she concluded. “It was intense. I could say it was extreme, but it was real.”"
3,POLITICS,Roy Moore's Attorney Holds News Conference To Demand Release Of Accuser's Yearbook,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roy-moore-yearbook-handwriting_us_5a0cbb2ee4b0b17e5e13c7dc,Phillip Jauregui wants a handwriting expert to analyze the signature.,2017-11-15,"Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama, speaks during a campaign event on Tuesday. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0cbb931c0000e62eb34fe8.jpeg?cache=RTBRVIjHLe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In an attempt to discredit one of the Senate nominee’s accusers, Roy Moore’s lawyer Phillip Jauregui is demanding that attorney Gloria Allred release a high school yearbook her client said Moore had signed before he sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s. In a news conference Wednesday, Jauregui called on Allred to hand over Beverly Young Nelson’s yearbook to a “neutral custodian” so that the Alabama Republican’s legal team can have a handwriting expert analyze the signature.Jauregui also called on reporters to analyze the handwriting themselves. “I want you to look at it,” he said. “Use your judgment.” He also disputed Nelson’s claim that she had not had contact with Moore since the 1977 incident, saying that Moore presided over Nelson’s 1999 divorce. He then implied that Nelson had forged Moore’s signature in her old yearbook using her divorce papers, claiming that Moore had no recollection of signing “D.A.” after his name but had an assistant with those initials at the time of Nelson’s divorce who would have stamped it on court filings. “I’ve been with him in probably over 100 different meetings and been around probably an excess of 10,000 different ladies,” the attorney said. “Not one time have I ever seen him act even remotely inappropriate against any woman.”Moore’s press office later echoed that sentiment by releasing a statement featuring 12 female “character witnesses” vouching for the candidate:Jauregui, however, did not specifically challenge Nelson’s allegations. She came forward on Monday to say that Moore had sexually assaulted her when she was 16. Four other women, in accounts detailed by The Washington Post, have also accused Moore of preying on them when they were teenagers. A sixth woman came forward Wednesday, claiming Moore groped her in his office when she was 28.Allred responded to the news conference later on Wednesday, saying she will agree to have the yearbook examined by an independent handwriting expert if the Senate agrees to investigate the claims against Moore. Moore, who is running for Alabama’s open Senate seat in a Dec. 12 special election, has denied any wrongdoing and has refused to drop out of the race, despite calls from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other Senate Republicans to do so. Moore’s campaign has lost funding support from the Republican National Committee as well as the National Republican Senatorial Committee since the accusations emerged.Republicans are still weighing whether to stage a write-in campaign for a different candidate, McConnell said earlier this week. This article has been updated with details on the accusations against Moore and the status of his campaign, as well as with comment from Allred and a statement from Moore’s press shop. "
4,ENTERTAINMENT,'Wonder' Makes A Case For The Classic Tear-Jerker,Leigh Blickley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wonder-review_us_5a049ec3e4b0937b51106619,Is it mawkish? Maybe. But the Jacob Tremblay film seems to have arrived in the nick of time.,2017-11-15,"Jacob Tremblay and Julia Roberts in ""Wonder,"" based on the bestseller by R.J. Palacio.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a09c9231c0000c018b3489c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the last year, many of us have felt downtrodden by a slew of tragic events. The Charlottesville rallies. Hurricane devastation after Harvey and Irma. The Las Vegas shooting. Unimaginable violence in Sutherland Springs. Even the traditionally escapist realm of Hollywood has narrowed as more and more sexual assault allegations emerge from behind the curtain. That’s why it’s a better time than ever to embrace a film genre long maligned: the classic tear-jerker. Enter Stephen Chbosky’s latest film, “Wonder,” a poignant effort that, melodrama be damned, arrived in the nick of time. “Wonder” is based on the bestselling novel by R.J. Palacio, which follows Auggie Pullman, a 10-year-old boy with a congenital facial deformity, played beautifully by “Room” standout Jacob Tremblay. In both Palacio’s and Chbosky’s stories, we meet fifth-grader Auggie as he’s being mainstreamed into a public school after being home-schooled by his devoted, protective mother (Julia Roberts) for most of his life.Auggie has had over 20 surgeries to treat what’s presumed to be a form of Treacher Collins syndrome, which affects the development of bones and tissue in the face. But other than his outward appearance, his interests and hobbies are ordinary. Halloween is his favorite holiday. “Star Wars” is his favorite movie. Science is his favorite subject. His family ― with a “cool” dad (Owen Wilson) and seemingly perfect teenage sister, Via (Izabela Vidovic) ― makes his day-to-day life bearable, but Auggie struggles to embrace who he is and what he looks like outside of this safe space, choosing to wear a plastic astronaut helmet every time he leaves the house. His mind is in outer space while his body is tethered to the ground, in a world where his classmates look past their similarities to harp on all the ways he’s different. What happens to Auggie over the course of Chbosky’s nearly two-hour film is both troubling and triumphant. He’s siloed, picked on, made an outcast. He’s bullied for being smart, for being “ugly,” for being weird. People gawk at him as he walks solemnly into school, and he sits alone with his head down in both the classroom and cafeteria. He collapses as soon as he gets home, telling his parents he just doesn’t belong. It’s hard to watch these scenes, and deliberately so.“You are not ugly, Auggie,” his mom tells him when she hears about the name-calling he endures each day. “You just have to say that because you’re my mom,” he says through tears.“Because I’m your mom it counts the most because I know you the most,” she assures him.Auggie eventually picks himself up and returns to school. He makes a new friend, Jack Will (Noah Jupe), paving the way for other students to side with Auggie over the school bully, Julian (Bryce Gheisar). The tear-jerker turns rosier with the help of a teacher (Daveed Diggs) and principal (Mandy Patinkin) who see Auggie for what he is: a kid who could teach them a little something about humanity. Today, movies like “Wonder” ― and the admittedly mawkish messages they put out into the world ― are welcome additions. Although this particular genre tends to fall prey to saccharine stories, sentimental dramas play a specific role amid a deluge of bad news.“This film promotes kindness as a successful way of living your life, in a time when we’re being inundated with our leaders preaching hate,” Daveed Diggs, who plays teacher Mr. Browne, told HuffPost. “It also is a film about the bravery that it takes to just show up and be honestly who you are. The more we can all be responsible for presenting our whole selves in any situation, the more the world has to embrace difference, the less that we hide the things that are different about us, the more we force everybody else to deal with that ― and not only to deal with it but to celebrate it.”It’s worth noting that many teachers have already found the novel Wonder to be essential reading for their students; it’s not only a redemptive case study on bullying but a lesson on a new generation of kids who operate within their own set of social constructs. (Tremblay told HuffPost that his class is taking a field trip to see the movie upon its release.) With access to smartphones, tablets and social media, they distance themselves from one another, slamming the door on physical and emotional connectivity. Teachers, who spend more time than most with kids coming of age, stand to have an inarguable impact on the way their students grow up.In a memorable scene from the film, Mr. Browne poses an unforgettable question on the first day of school: “Who is it that I aspire to be? That is the question we should be asking ourselves all the time.” Moments like this are sugary, yes, but they’re also a salve. As Tremblay explained to HuffPost, “Humanity could learn a few things about choosing kind.” And sometimes, a movie about kindness deserves a shot at the box office.“Wonder” is in theaters Friday."

Just like last year, the brand is offering free two-day shipping on all online orders.Tucked away on page 30 of Target’s Black Friday flyer is perhaps one of the Black Friday deals at Target: If you spend $50 at Target on on Black Friday, Nov. 29, you can get 20% off coupon to use on a future order between Dec. 3 and Dec. 14.

Voters across political lines largely agreed that the allegations against Weinstein are credible. On the rest, there are significant political divides. Hillary Clinton voters are less likely to believe the allegations against Bill Clinton than they are to trust any of the other accusations. Trump voters almost universally find the accusations against Bill Clinton credible, but are far less likely to believe O’Reilly or Trump mistreated women. A 52 percent majority of Trump voters outright dismiss the allegations against Trump.Polling from the 1990s indicates that Democrats were considerably less concerned about Bill Clinton’s behavior while he was in office. A 1999 Fox News poll found that 79 percent of Democrats said Clinton accuser Juanita Broaddrick’s allegations were “not worth investigating because the alleged event happened 20 years ago,” and that just 27 percent considered the multiple allegations against the president to represent a pattern of behavior on his part, rather than a pattern of behavior by his political enemies. In a 1998 Time/CNN/Yankelovich Partners survey, 44 percent of Democrats believed that Clinton had made an unwanted advance toward Paula Jones, while 38 percent thought he had not. Since then, Democrats’ concerns about sexual harassment in general have risen sharply.The HuffPost/YouGov survey also offers a hint of the way partisanship may affect not just responses to individual accusations, but also to the issue of sexual harassment itself. Not everyone who participated in the HuffPost/YouGov poll saw the same questions. Those surveyed were divided into two groups, with half asked about Bill Clinton and Weinstein, and the other half getting the questions about O’Reilly and Trump.After the questions about the credibility of the accusations, both groups were also asked a series of questions about workplace sexual harassment, including whether it’s more common for sexual harassment to go unreported and unpunished, or for people to make false accusations.Trump voters who were asked about the accusations against Weinstein and former president Bill Clinton said by a 26-point margin, 44 percent to 18 percent, that it’s more common for sexual harassment to go unreported or unpunished than it is for people to make false accusations. Those who were instead asked about Trump and O’Reilly were about evenly split, 26 percent to 25 percent, on what pattern was more common.Hillary Clinton voters in the two groups showed little difference on the question — those asked about Weinstein and Bill Clinton considered unpunished sexual harassment to be a more widespread occurrence by a 74-point margin, while those asked about Trump and O’Reilly said the same by a 79-point margin. But in response to another question, those who were asked about O’Reilly and Trump were 10 points likelier than those asked about Weinstein and Bill Clinton to describe workplace sexual harassment as a “very serious” problem.Use the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 27-28 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

10,POLITICS,Republicans Explain Why They Want Permanent Tax Cuts For Corporations But Not People,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/permanent-tax-cuts-corporations_us_5a0cbbcce4b0c0b2f2f78bea,"Corporations are people, my friends!",2017-11-15,"Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill, Sept. 12, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0cbbf61f0000e7394a5f33.jpeg?cache=loCxjBOK1E&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans say their tax reform bill will benefit middle-class families. But the new version of their legislation in the Senate actually lets almost all of the individual income tax cuts expire in 2025.Meanwhile, the heart of the plan ― a reduction in the top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent ― would still be permanent in the Senate bill.The last-minute change, unveiled by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) Tuesday night, was made to comply with Senate rules that forbid certain legislation from adding to the federal budget deficit after 10 years. Those rules, dictated by a process known as reconciliation, would allow Republicans to pass their bill with a simple majority instead of with 60 votes.In short, Republicans were forced to alter the bill in order to more easily pass their tax cuts. In doing so, however, they weakened the talking point that the plan would primarily benefit the middle class.Democrats were quick to cite the change as evidence of a double standard.“Nothing highlights what this plan is truly all about more than the fact that its tax cuts for massive corporations are permanent, while the middle class gets crumbs that last only a few years,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement.Republicans countered by arguing that individuals and corporations alike could receive a permanent tax cut if Democrats agreed to work with them outside the reconciliation process.“There’s a simple solution. If our Democratic colleagues work with us to get 60 votes,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said during a Finance Committee markup hearing on Wednesday, “we could make it permanent.”In reality, though, Republicans never attempted to work in a bipartisan fashion on tax reform in the first place. They similarly eschewed trying to reach a bipartisan consensus on health care this summer. In that effort, they failed to bring 50 Republican senators on the same page to repeal Obamacare.So why do corporations deserve a permanent tax cut under the Senate bill, but individuals do not?Republican senators on Wednesday said the problem stemmed from the rules they’d imposed on themselves at the beginning of the process. Others insisted that cutting corporate taxes would benefit individuals in the long run anyway.“Let me correct one thing,” Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) told HuffPost. “Individuals own corporations. So the best benefit that I can give the American worker is to make an American corporation competitive with the rest of the world. That’s what this is about.”Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) argued that permanent tax cuts would indirectly benefit consumers by lowering prices, increasing employee wages and encouraging investment.“To try to create an argument between two sides of the ledger, when in fact the only side that pays the tax is the individual, is at least insincere, if not just completely wrong,” Scott told HuffPost.Asked why middle-class families would only get temporary tax relief under this bill, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said it’s “probably [because of] the way the rules are.”Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) said he hoped individuals and corporations would both receive a permanent tax cut, but he didn’t have an answer as to “why there would be a disparity between” the two groups in the Senate bill.The GOP’s efforts to pass tax reform hit a speed bump Wednesday afternoon after Ron Johnson became the first Republican senator to publicly announce his opposition to the current Senate bill. The Wisconsin Republican said the legislation unfairly benefits corporations more than other types of businesses.“If they can pass it without me, let them,” Johnson said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “I’m not going to vote for this tax package.”Johnson similarly opposed the effort to repeal Obamacare early on, though he ultimately voted for a bill to rescind the law.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who is being closely watched over his concern about the enormous cost of the bill, argued Wednesday that businesses deserve a permanent tax cut because they generate economic growth. “The personal side, candidly, does not,” Corker told reporters.Corker, who is not seeking re-election next year, brushed off concerns about the political implications of making tax cuts temporary for the middle class.“But I understand,” he added, “what the other side is going to do with that. They’ve already given me their slogan, and I understand it’ll be messaged in a very different way on the other side.”"
11,IMPACT,'They Never Talked To Me Like A Real Person': Fighting a Diabetes Epidemic With Empathy,"Dianna Wray, on assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/houston-diabetes-epidemic-empathy_us_5a0aae48e4b0bc648a0d6817,Houston is tapping into faith communities to tackle soaring diabetes rates.,2017-11-15,"Marguerite Butler (left) has worked with nutritionist Joy Ashby Cornthwaite (right), who has helped her understand and manage her diabetes. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b53f51f00003b004a5bb2.jpeg?cache=vOPP0saCb3&ops=crop_0_664_2025_1358%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"When Marguerite Butler plunked into a chair in nutritionist Joy Ashby Cornthwaite’s Houston office in October 2016, she was spoiling for a fight. Butler, a then-65-year-old law professor at Texas Southern University, had been living with Type 2 diabetes ― mostly by ignoring it ― for more than a decade. At just over 5 feet 5 inches tall and more than 200 pounds overweight, she was not interested in being pressed into weighing herself, taking up an exercise program, counting calories, learning to cook at home or measuring her glucose levels. She just wanted Cornthwaite to sign off on her planned weight loss surgery.Diabetes didn’t scare Butler. In Houston, one of the most obese cities in the U.S., she belonged to the 10 percent of adults diagnosed with the condition, in which the pancreas no longer produces enough insulin to break down the body’s blood sugar.Left untreated, complications from diabetes are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control, but Butler had been pushed to lose weight for so long, and had failed so often, that it was too painful to talk about.“People always told me what I needed to do, but they never talked to me like a real person,” Butler says now. “Even though my father had died from complications of diabetes, I was never going to respond to that.”Cornthwaite was different. She listened, and asked about Butler’s life and experiences. “You have to approach each person as an individual and to guide each person to feel like they can change, and they can be hopeful,” Cornthwaite says. “It has to come from the right approach at the right time or they’ll never listen.” Houston officials are working to reach various communities in the city with the same kind of empathy and understanding, according to Dr. Faith Foreman, assistant director of the Houston Department of Public Health and Human Services. Diabetes affects Houstonians from all walks of life, according to a 2016 study from University of Texas Health Center. The study suggested that a loss of community, poverty, family food traditions and long driving commutes all contribute to the epidemic. More than 30 percent of Houston’s adult population is obese, one of the primary factors determining whether a person will develop adult-onset Type 2 diabetes, according to data from the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk.At this rate, more than 1 in 5 adults in Houston will be living with diabetes by 2045. Houston officials are fighting the problem, which the World Health Organization has dubbed “the new urban epidemic,” by joining Cities Changing Diabetes, a program partially sponsored by Novo Nordisk in which public and private organizations gather in eight world cities to find new ways to educate people about preventing and managing diabetes. A new program, slated to be rolled out in January 2018, is called Faith and Diabetes, and is designed to train congregants at churches, temples, mosques, synagogues and other houses of worship to promote healthy living and fight diabetes.The hope is that by using the expertise of Cornthwaite ― who has been involved with Cities Changing Diabetes ever since the program started in Houston ― and others who have been finding new ways to engage patients, the Faith and Diabetes program will ultimately send people back into their communities to share their knowledge and skills.Tapping into religious organizations makes sense in Houston. Even though there has been a decline in attendance in recent years, more than 40 percent of Houstonians attend a religious service at least once a week. Houston has more than 1,900 houses of worship and 4.9 million people in the area identify as actively religious.Two congregation members from each of 15 religious organizations will begin a six-week-long seminar in January. The workshops, led by healthcare experts, will discuss everything from diabetes prevention to exercise and healthy eating. Participants will also learn how to communicate with their respective congregations and about making tactical choices like not pushing for a diet program that starts in December and using the scriptures and religious texts to tie faith into healthy living. This can be a powerful motivator for people who are actively religious. “It has to come from the right person for a lot of people, or they won’t hear the message,” says Abiya Malhotra, who works at Northwest Assistance Ministries and volunteers in Houston’s South Asian communities.Someone “might not make a lifestyle change based on recommendations from a doctor,” Malhotra says, “but if they hear if from their religious leader or see it tied to the scriptures, they may decide to serve fruit instead of sweets, or to form a community garden.”Some churchgoers may resist giving up doughnuts, coffee and fried chicken at functions, Foreman says, but with time and trial and error, volunteers should be able to tailor their programs to the people in their audience. The main point is to use every tool available to reach people, Foreman says. “In all my years as a public health official, the public and private efforts have stayed separate, with everyone doing their own thing, but the numbers alone make it clear this doesn’t work,” Foreman says. “Working together makes so much more sense. I think it’s the only way we will actually be able to reduce the impact of diabetes on the Houston community and figure out how to really make a difference.”After her first meeting with Cornthwaite a year ago, Butler came away finally understanding diabetes and feeling ready to deal with it. She even started monitoring her glucose levels after years of refusing to do it.A month later, she stepped on a scale and, for the first time in 20 years, she had lost weight. Since then, she has continued working with Cornthwaite. She’s lost inches, but the real victory came one night when she was out with friends.Everyone started dancing, and Butler jumped out there, too. “It felt like a miracle. I’ve changed,” Butler says. “Change is the most difficult thing for anybody to do, but Joy helped me see it was my choice. It’s so different. I know what to do now.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

And not even members of the Grammy-winning band knew what he was up to.As people waited in line for the box office at the Charleston Music Hall on Thursday, the “Lost in Translation” star purchased remaining tickets and doled them out until show time.“It is something that everyone who experienced it will never forget,” Adam Gloeckler, who took the picture above, told WCSC. “If only everyone in the world was like Bill Murray!”SteelDrivers’ manager Jules Wortman told Entertainment Weekly that the band, which appeared with Murray in the movie “Get Low,” had no idea of his plans.“They had gone to dinner and he’s just a big fan of theirs,” Wortman said. “They did not know he was going to buy tickets and surprise fans.”Tickets listed on the venue’s site for that show were in the $30 range.Murray is known for random acts of kindness. Last year, he gave away one of his World Series tickets to a fellow Chicago Cubs fan after she followed him. And the seat was right next to his.

The bear looks basically proportional in most of the photos provided by JoyFay on its website and Amazon profile:But some Amazon users, who either received the bear as a gift or bought it themselves, were kind of horrified to find out that the bear gets its height mainly from its very long legs: Other people who reviewed the bear on Amazon praised the massive size of the toy, but some folks just couldn’t get over those legs. “Hideous! The legs are like 4 feet long making the bear look like a creepy gumby thing,” wrote an Amazon reviewer who gave the toy one star. “I got this for Valentine’s Day and would have rather had a cheaper more proportional bear...I mean this isn’t even cute.” An individual named K. Erikson accused JoyFay of falsely advertising the height of the bear in a VERY descriptive review from 2016. I feel there should have been more emphasis on the lower portion of the teddy bear. The photos mostly show a proportional torso and typically oversized head as is common in large, human-sized teddy bears. Where the emphasis is lacking is in the giant pendulous legs that haunt the lower two thirds of this stuffed freak bear. It appears to be some sort of bipedal giraffe bear hybrid. After we took him out of the box with my daughters, I expected it to hop up and sprint away down the street with a fingerless fist raised in victory. My daughter tries to hug the bear and she gets trapped in a serpentine mass of bear legs. She won’t keep it in her room anymore because her friends won’t visit because of the nightmares. Joyfay should sell some sort of amputation and patch kit for parents that want a more desirable short legged bear.Nikola Matic, the owner of Joyfay Bears, told HuffPost in a statement that the shape of the bear has been modified.

Referencing a New York Times report on Louis C.K.’s “gross sexual misconduct,” Oliver noted that the revelation “inevitably resulted in the cancellation of his new film, ‘Exhibit A if This Ever Goes to Trial.’”Louis C.K.’s film, actually titled “I Love You, Daddy,” was on the verge of release when the reports of misconduct emerged. If it were any old project, it likely would have been dropped in the face of these allegations ― and it was ― but it can’t be denied that Louis C.K. did his work no favors by giving it an almost ludicrously creepy project title. It reads like fiction, like parody, like he was mocking his own grotesque narrative in advance, so that we needn’t bother.There’s something icky about the title, so much so that it seems like a blatant provocation now. It’s coy ― the sexual undertones are undeniable in this era, but there’s also a level of plausible deniability: What’s wrong with a daughter loving her dad?Louis C.K.’s choice of title was clearly deliberate, and the content of the movie is just as unsettling as the title. The narrative centers on industry hack Glen Topher, played by Louis C.K., who bats aside the rumors of abuse and child molestation surrounding his favorite filmmaker until that same filmmaker begins to put the moves on his adored and adoring 17-year-old daughter, China. China (Chloë Grace Moretz) is ostensibly the motivating force of the movie, but she is not a fleshed-out, substantial character. She’s a visually pleasing trope, and a learning tool for her father, who has to grapple with female sexual agency, his duties as a parent and his moral blindness to abusive great men. China’s sexual awakening is viewed through the eyes of the older male characters, especially her father; what we see is only the effect her maturation has on them.But the title is in China’s voice, and that is perhaps the really unsettling thing about it. She’s given enough of a voice to flirt, enough of a voice to flatter and disarm. She’s the one who says “I love you, Daddy” (nearly every line of hers begins or ends with this blandishment) and thus weaves a spell of pleasant oblivion over her father. He’s happy to accept her kisses and snuggles rather than actually raise her.“A girl that age is getting into trouble,” says an ex-girlfriend played by Pamela Adlon to Glen, correctly, “and if she loves her daddy that means you’re doing nothing.”Part of the unease of hearing a nubile 17-year-old cozy up to her “daddy” is, of course, that the term has been thoroughly sexualized. That’s not new per se ― it’s been an endearment for a male sexual partner for many years, especially in kink and queer communities. But what was once siloed or glossed over is now pervasive. In 2016, amid the Republican primary, poet Patricia Lockwood tweeted “fuck me daddy” at Donald Trump during a takeover of The New Republic’s Twitter. In 2015, Pope Francis could barely tweet without being deluged with graphic responses: “fuck me daddy,” “choke me daddy,” and infinite variations. Broadly interviewed some of the young people who tweeted these things at the pope, and, unsurprisingly, found most of them were trolling for reactions. Regardless, if you follow His Holiness on Twitter, you’ve probably seen “daddy” used in a less-than-wholesome context.The most unsettling part of this framing, though, is that “daddy” doesn’t just capture the sexualization of male power and female infantilization, but the extent to which the culpability for that is put onto girls. “Daddy” doesn’t connote any particular type of dad, necessarily ― instead, it tends to characterize the speaker, a certain genus of spoiled post-pubescent daughter who performs an exaggerated version of dependence and youthfulness in service of her own ends.In an important way, this framing is specific to fathers and daughters. Oftentimes we don’t see men as having power until they are daddies, kings of their own domestic realms. Young boys who need to be fed and sheltered by their parents are children, not wielders of influence; using your gap-toothed grin to charm your mom or dad into getting you a video game is nothing compared to the ability a boy will one day have to provide for himself ― no flattery or performed affection necessary.But the way we view the power of young girls is warped by the fact that, even as adults, we expect women to achieve financial and personal influence through men. A daughter’s ability to wrap her daddy around her little finger long seemed like the apex of female power: The patriarch of the family is under her sway.In “I Love You, Daddy,” China lounges in bikinis and curls up next to her dad on the couch as she wheedles him into sending her to Florida to party with her friends. “With the exception of Ivanka Trump,” writes The New Yorker’s Alexandra Schwartz, “I have never known a teen-age girl to spend so much time on her daddy’s lap.” She acts more like a trophy girlfriend than a teenage daughter ― she opens conversations with a syrupy “How are you, daddy?” and flirtatiously tilts her dainty chin at him, just before suggesting he let her skip school and use his shared jet to return to spring break.Glen tries feebly to tell her that she should stand on her own two feet, get a job, but the film seems invested in the idea that his attempts at parenting are doomed by her cunning performance of childish helplessness. But if a teenage girl is sitting on her dad’s lap to earn treats and favors from him, we can only conclude that he has long incentivized that behavior.Typically, of course, this has to do with access to money. For a long time, a father’s primary, if not sole, role in a nuclear family was to work outside the home and bring in money for everyone else to live on, while the mother’s role was, ideally, to care for the household and children. Some women have always worked outside the home ― usually poor and lower-middle-class women who were driven to work out of economic necessity. Success, for a woman, has, in tandem, been defined as marrying a rich man and living comfortably without working; being the beloved daughter of a rich man means similar access to his resources. An adolescent girl sweetly asking her pop to let her go shopping at the mall is just a precursor to an adult woman coaxing her husband into upgrading her car.Are these retrograde notions of female roles? Yes, but powerful ones that have been difficult to completely dislodge ― partly because they’re baked into cherished works of art and entertainment, from Lolita to “Clueless.” (Cher was a smart girl, but it’s not hard to imagine that her relationship with her father ― and his credit cards ― would have been painted much differently if she were a he.)Even into the 21st century, a T-shirt or license plate that flaunts the phrase “daddy’s girl” connotes the privilege of being lovable enough to have a benefactor. Ivanka Trump, a businesswoman in her own right, wields an influence over her father that was best captured by her request to join a presidential trip: “She said ‘Daddy, can I go with you?’” Donald Trump told a crowd during the trip. “I like that. I said, ‘Yes, you can.’”In this weird little scenario, only by flattering the ego of her more powerful father could Ivanka get something she wanted: a trip to North Dakota. (If this is the quality of influence Ivanka has over the president, it’s little wonder that it’s resulted in her face cropping up on international junkets and at high-level meetings, rather than in a moderation of his policies.)The incursion of women into the workplace has, if anything, increased the stigma of girls behaving in this way (hey, they’re able to succeed without cozying up to men these days) without changing the base assumption that women are fundamentally willing to exchange sex or affection to get crumbs of power or money from male gatekeepers (but they choose to, those manipulative tarts). Harvey Weinstein’s alleged serial predation remained nothing but an industry open secret for years, in large part, thanks to the assumption that the starlets he pursued were willingly and affirmatively making the choice to have sex with him for career advancement. And that, in society’s eyes, would be on them. Our suspicion of ambitious women is so great that we side-eye them for, we assume, playing the game, far more so than the male gatekeepers who make the rules. It’s 17-year-old China, not her daddy or her much-older love interest, who truly needs to change her ways. Oddly enough, even Glen’s vaunted attempts at parenting his daughter are actually exercises of this kind of undermining. When she responds to an erotic slasher they’re watching with some nascent feminism (men, she says, have “fucked us for long enough. Now it’s time to fuck them”), he doesn’t engage with her ideas. Instead, he snorts with laughter and shames her, a high school student, for living off of her wealthy father instead of getting a waitressing job. In the climactic blow-up between Glen and China, newly 18, she alternately protests that she’s an adult now and can make her own choices, and that she’s in high school and needs support. Glen responds, basically, that she can’t have it both ways. But he’s the one who has wanted to have it both ways, letting her make her own decisions like an adult so that she will keep loving him with the unreserved affection of a child.With conflict comes the blessed disappearance of “Daddy” from the film’s dialogue. In one horrifying moment, when China walks in on her father asking filmmaker Leslie Goodwin if he is fucking his daughter, she shouts at him in disgust ― and she calls him “Dad.” That he, soon after, has her move out on her own says something still more unsettling about what behavior he needs from a daughter in order to support her.“I Love You, Daddy” traces a necessary arc, with China assuming a healthier distance from her father, but the lessons that remain do little to disturb the “daddy” paradigm. Glen is ultimately a sad sort of hero, a man who did what he needed to do for the daughter he loved. Leslie, in a disturbing way, is also a hero. Instead of having a sexual relationship with China, he’s painted as a sort of unthreatening “pervert” who enjoys watching a young girl shop for shorts at Barneys, yes, but who rewards her with a highly educational trip to Paris and provides necessary friction with her father that launches her into adulthood. During a postcoital argument with Rose Byrne’s character, in which Louis C.K. has Byrne voice a rigorous defense of old men sleeping with teenage girls, she argues that a relationship with Leslie might be just the thing to “grow China up.” The movie winds up cosigning this argument, though to do so it lets Leslie off the hook on a technicality. “I Love You, Daddy” is the silver-screen embodiment of what makes “daddy” feel so creepy in 2017. Men remain the gatekeepers to money and life experience, but we still see girls and young women as the ones with the power ― the power to cajole and seduce it from their daddies and their boyfriends. The solution, apparently, is for women simply to stop doing this, to stop trying to exploit and compromise the men around them.The most depressing part of this cultural narrative, of course, is how little control women actually have over it. We have long been incentivized and expected to perform, like China, a sort of alluring childlikeness that soothes the egos and tickles the libidos of powerful men. Our society celebrates that murky melding of woman and girl: Old enough to sexualize, but young enough not to know better. We want women to behave nearly the same way as daughters and lovers ― deferential, attentive, admiring and dependent. No wonder the word “daddy,” voiced by a teenage girl, makes us squirm. It should."

There, he used an alias to board a commercial flight, which took him to San Jose, California, police said.In July 1979, Saito was accused of randomly shooting 29-year-old Sandra Yamashiro with a pellet gun and then stabbing her to death at a shopping center. Two years later, Saito was found not guilty by reason of insanity.Since that time, Saito, who’s reportedly been diagnosed with sexual sadism and necrophilia ― sexual attraction to corpses ― has repeatedly petitioned courts for release from the hospital. Each time, the courts found Saito remained a danger to society.In the early 2000s, a prosecutor in Hawaii called him a “psychopathic predator whose mental condition continues to represent a serious danger to the community.”Authorities in Hawaii are trying to determine how Saito obtained a backpack ―seen on surveillance video inside the taxi he took to the Honolulu airport ― that contained a change of clothes, a cellphone and an unknown amount of cash.Saito is being held at the San Joaquin County jail pending an extradition hearing on sending him back to Hawaii, where he faces a felony escape charge, police said.

On Monday, another woman came forward accusing Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s.While lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for Moore to suspend his campaign, far-right outlet Breitbart spent days coming to Moore’s defense, largely by attacking the Post’s reporting and unsuccessfully attempting to poke holes in the allegations.Alex Marlow, the site’s top editor, even suggested the Post may be conspiring to take down Moore’s campaign. “It does look more and more like some sort of a politically coordinated attack on Judge Moore,” he said Monday on the site’s radio show. “The fact The Washington Post really put the effort in to track down these women and try to convince them to come forward, tell their story. Why did they want them to come forward? Because they just love good journalism? You guys believe that?”"

Bush, Clinton and Obama administrations wrote in a Tuesday letter to the panel. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who chairs the committee, introduced legislation last week that would require that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke approve at least two lease sales for drilling — each no less than 400,000 acres — in the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).Murkowski said the Congressional Budget Office estimates the move would bring in slightly more than $1 billion in federal revenue over the next decade, although that figure has been widely disputed.The signees said they are “deeply concerned at the prospect of oil development” on the coastal plain, also known as the 1002 Area. Drilling, they said, “risks significant damage to this national, cultural and ecological treasure, and it is currently a needless risk,” as a glut of supply and the low price of oil make “economic arguments for risking this incredible resource ring hollow.”The group describes the refuge, which covers more than 19 million acres in northeastern Alaska, as “among the world’s most important ecological resources.” The region is home to polar bears, moose and hundreds of species of migratory birds, and serves as the calving ground for Porcupine caribou. Murkowski and the Trump administration have touted the economic benefits that would come from drilling in the refuge. In announcing her bill last week, Murkowski called the proposal “a tremendous opportunity” for the country. At a hearing in early November, she said Alaskans have waited decades for the right technologies to come along in order to ensure the environment would remain protected.In 1980, with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Congress expanded ANWR but opted not to give wilderness status to the 1002 Area, setting it aside for potential oil and gas development. Granting leases for that purpose, however, requires an act of Congress. The Senate budget plan includes a provision that requires Murkowski’s committee to find $1 billion in additional revenue over the next decade to help pay for tax reform. As a result, Murkowski’s legislation requires just a simple 51-vote majority to pass in the Senate, rather than the 60 typically needed to avoid a filibuster, because it is part of Congress’ 2018 budget plan that is being considered under special “reconciliation” provisions.Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, the committee’s ranking Democrat, other members of her party and environmental groups have blasted the passage rules for Murkowski’s bill. They accuse her and other Alaska lawmakers of circumventing the normal legislative process and putting short-term economic gains over environmental protection. The group of former Interior leaders argue that drilling for oil in the coastal plain “is ethically, environmentally, and economically untenable.”“As former officials at the Department of the Interior, we know our public landsintimately, having travelled, studied, managed and championed these incomparable lands and waters,” their letter reads. “In our view, there is no place like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and no place more deserving of protection for future generations of Americans. Some places are just too special to drill. We call on you to defend our natural heritage and native Alaskan culture by protecting our most vital national wildlife refuge.” The letter is signed by Nathaniel Reed, assistant secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks under President Richard Nixon: Lyle Laverty, assistant secretary for FWP under President George W. Bush; Donald Barry, assistant secretary for FWP under President Bill Clinton: Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under Clinton; Steve Williams, director of USFWS under Bush; and Dan Ashe, director of USFWS under President Barack Obama.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), center, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, confers with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), right, during a committee hearing Nov. 14 in Washington, D.C. Also pictured is Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b53ba1b000048003770bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The only people standing between an impulsive and angry President Donald Trump and thermonuclear war would be high-ranking military officers willing to declare a first-strike order “illegal.”That was the message Tuesday from an extraordinary, first-time-in-four-decades hearing convened by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ― who last month said he worried that Trump could “start World War III” and called the White House an “adult day care center.”“We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said at the hearing Tuesday. “Let’s just recognize the exceptional nature of this moment.”Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, did not criticize Trump during the two-hour session, and instead framed the issue as a review of Congress’ war-making authority as prescribed in the Constitution.The experts testifying at the hearing said that while the protocols for nuclear weapons use give the president unilateral control when the United States is under attack from a nuclear strike, the commander in chief is far more restrained when trying to initiate a pre-emptive strike.“The system is not a button that the president can accidentally lean against on the desk and immediately cause missiles to fly, as some people in the public, I think, fear it would be,” said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor.C. Robert Kehler, who once led the United States Strategic Command as a four-star Air Force general, said military officers given a first-strike order are obliged to consider whether such an action was “proportionate” to the potential threat. If the answer is no, the order would have to be considered illegal, he said.“The military does not blindly follow orders,” Kehler said. “And that is true with nuclear orders as well, and I think that should be a reassuring piece for the American public, and it ought to be reassuring to our allies and our adversaries as well.”Brian McKeon, a top Pentagon official under former President Barack Obama, acknowledged under questioning from committee members that an officer in the chain of command who refused to comply with a presidential order would face removal. “You’d either get a new secretary of defense or get a new commander. But you’d have a real constitutional crisis on your hands if that occurred,” he said.And that, said Sen. Edward Markey, is why his bill requiring a president to seek congressional approval before launching a first strike is so necessary.“I don’t think that the assurances that I’ve received today will be satisfying to the American people,” said Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts. “I think they can still realize that Donald Trump can launch nuclear codes just as easily as he can use his Twitter account without the check and balance of the United States Congress.”Republican members on the committee said they worried that adversaries would see and read about the committee hearing and infer that Trump was losing support in his role as commander in chief, making them more likely to attack the United States or its allies.“Particularly … people that are isolated from the world, don’t get a lot of information, and have never had anyone tell them they’re wrong or no,” said Florida’s Marco Rubio (R). “It’s basically one guy, who has a bad night and gets up and decides he wants to do something about it.”Rubio was referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ― but his description was similar to the way Democrats on the panel were describing Trump.“I want the president to act in a way that acknowledges input from a lot of experts, and not to act based on a Twitter post,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).Trump in August warned North Korea against threatening the United States: “They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” In a September speech at the United Nations, Trump said the United States would “totally destroy North Korea” if it had to.The president has been even less restrained on Twitter. In a September tweet, he warned about North Korean leaders: “They won’t be around much longer!” And during his recently concluded visit to Asia, Trump called Kim “short and fat” after the young dictator reportedly called him old.“Even Gen. Kelly, the president’s chief of staff, can’t control the president’s Twitter tantrums,” Markey said. “As a result, many Americans share my fear that the president’s bombastic words could turn into nuclear reality.”"

Many believed Pence leaving the stadium was a premeditated stunt orchestrated by the White House, costing taxpayers thousands of dollars. That belief was confirmed when President Donald Trump tweeted that he had told Pence to leave once players knelt.Journalists covering Pence at the time were not allowed in the stadium, told instead to stay in the vans and informed by a staffer that “there may be an early departure from the game,” according to CNN.Estimates of how much taxpayers spent for the political points were upwards of $88,000, primarily from air travel aboard Air Force 2. But documents obtained by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington show the IMPD spent an additional $14,163 in security costs for the vice president.The police department spending included multiple teams on the force working traffic and security, as well as overtime costs. “The tone is set at the top when it comes to this administration’s disregard for ethics,” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “Vice President Pence should know better than to use taxpayer money to make a rhetorical point, but carelessness with taxpayer money seems to be a common theme with senior administration officials.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the name of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department as the Indiana Metropolitan Police Department."
25,POLITICS,Bad Policy Threatens Promise Of Expanded Use Of Police Body Cameras,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-body-camera-policy_us_5a0a22bfe4b0bc648a0d5419,"Many departments have rules that limit accountability and transparency, according to a new report.",2017-11-14,"No police department’s body camera policy earned a perfect rating, and almost all failed across multiple metrics.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b411d1c0000e62eb34c23.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even as nearly 70 major U.S. city and county police forces have begun outfitting their officers with body cameras, departmental policies limit the cameras’ ability to bring accountability and transparency to law enforcement, according to a study published Tuesday.Amid the ongoing uproar over police shootings, police reform activists and law enforcement officials have touted body cameras as a tool that can help keep cops and civilians honest. Supporters argue that the devices create objective, first-hand accounts of police encounters, which encourage good behavior on both sides and serve to clarify what happened should interactions go awry.That sounds good in theory. But the cameras’ benefits are less clear in practice.A new body camera scorecard ― from the Leadership Conference, a civil rights coalition, and Upturn, a firm that works on technology policy issues ― finds deficiencies in police department policy nationwide. The report grades the policies in 75 departments, including every major city that has begun to deploy body cameras as well as several large counties and smaller jurisdictions. No department’s policy receives a perfect rating, and almost all fail across multiple metrics.The scorecard looks at a range of criteria, beginning with the accessibility of body camera policies. Police departments in some major cities ― including Boston, Cleveland, Dallas and Detroit ― are still failing in the basic step of making their policies available to the public online.The report finds pervasive problems with when officers use their body cameras and how they handle the footage after it is captured. Although most of the departments have developed clear policies outlining which incidents its officers must record, they generally don’t require officers to provide “concrete justifications” should they fail to record those incidents. Most departments have weak or, in many cases, non-existent rules prohibiting tampering with or other unauthorized access to recorded footage.Under these policies, officers in many departments have failed to record critical incidents. In other cases, key footage has mysteriously gone missing. Only three major departments ― in Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Washington ― expressly allow individuals who are filing misconduct complaints against the police to view all relevant footage. Elsewhere civilians are left at a disadvantage when they try to seek recourse for alleged abuse.The overwhelming majority of departments do allow or even encourage officers to review body camera footage before filing their initial incident reports or statements. This process can “taint” evidence-gathering by altering an officer’s memory of an event, according to an accompanying study titled “The Illusion of Accuracy.”“This practice will make it more difficult for investigators, internal affairs, and courts to accurately assess what occurred and whether an officer’s actions were reasonable given what he or she perceived at the time,” the authors of the study write. “Unrestricted review policies undermine longstanding principles of procedural justice, violate the law enforcement community’s best practices for preserving eyewitness evidence, and threaten to erode community trust.”The authors argue for a two-step system of “clean reporting,” in which officers write their initial incident report before reviewing any footage, after which they’re allowed to review video and file a supplemental report.The main policy scorecard also considers a number of issues regarding personal privacy and the potential for body cameras to increase surveillance in already heavily policed communities. Most departments have failed to establish clear rules regarding the timely deletion of footage not associated with a specific case. As a result, these videos could remain in databases indefinitely and be used for questionable purposes in the future. Additionally, only a few departments have placed explicit limits on the use of biometric technologies like facial recognition to identify all the people recorded on body cameras. Critics worry that with these cameras, officers could essentially conduct a real-time surveillance dragnet, scanning each and every person they encounter while on patrol.Overall, the troubling picture painted by the policy scorecard could feed into an ongoing debate about whether the equipment is truly worth the potential tradeoffs. In Washington, where all of the city’s uniformed patrol officers have been outfitted with body cameras, the devices have had no measurable effect on civilian complaints, use-of-force incidents, policing activity or judicial outcomes, according to a recently published study from The Lab @ DC, an organization affiliated with the D.C. government.On the plus side, the Leadership Conference/Upturn scorecard gives relatively high marks to Washington’s body camera program. But if further studies suggest the technology doesn’t actually improve policing, it may become harder to justify the financial cost and privacy concerns.Over the next few years, police reform advocates say departments need to revamp body camera policies to promote accountability and transparency. But they say it’s also important to recognize that body cameras are only one aspect of the reform equation.“Ultimately, we must recognize that these cameras are just a tool, not a substitute for broader reforms needed to address police misconduct, build trust between police and communities of color, and ultimately fix our broken justice system,” said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference, in a statement accompanying the report.Read the entire report below:"

And it is for that reason that I was holding that Black Lives Matter sign.,2017-11-14,"<p>White men abuse students during a sit-in at a Woolworth lunch counter in Jackson, Mississippi, protesting the store's ""Whites-only"" policy</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b19fb1b00002a00376fd7.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I write this letter to the man I met this past Sunday in front of my Unitarian church while I was holding a homemade sign that read “Black Lives Matter.”I was on the sidewalk in front of my Unitarian church, when you drove up in your pickup truck, stopped suddenly and rolled down your window to yell profanities at me. In between insults, you said you believed that more white people are killed by police than blacks. A friend who was with me tried to calmly explain that blacks represent only 12 percent of the population but are between two and three times more likely to be killed by police than whites.In response, you exited your vehicle and approached me to continue your verbal abuse. You then spat on my “Black Lives Matter” sign. After observing the results of your defacement ― and apparently deciding it was insufficient ― you drew up a larger piece of phlegm and spat on my sign again. You then returned to your vehicle and drove off in the same reckless fashion as you drove up.You were not alone that day in spewing venom at me. Several people, all of them white males, yelled profanities at me from their vehicles in passing, though you were the only one to turn that ire into a physical assault.I understand that the issue of racial justice is one fraught with emotion. Tempers can flare and words can become heated. This has happened even among members of my church as we have wrestled with how to support the fight for racial equality. But when words cross the line into (admittedly minor but nevertheless disgusting) physical assault, then you have entered new territory. By all accounts, I would have been within my rights to file a police report, and indeed I was urged to do so by one of my fellow churchgoers who photographed your license plate. Instead, I ask you to consider your actions.Consider how your behavior reflects on your position. Certainly, these are not the actions of someone speaking from a place of moral superiority. In fact, your actions are remarkably similar, in kind if not in degree, to those of opponents to the civil rights movement of decades past. Your actions do not put you in good company.You did not ask, but allow me to explain the reason why I was standing on the sidewalk with a Black Lives Matter sign this past Sunday. I believe that all lives matter. And it is for that reason that I was holding that “Black Lives Matter” sign. It is because I believe that all lives matter that I am compelled to declare that black lives matter. While we may say that all lives matter, we as a society are not acting like all lives matter. In many ways, our society acts like black lives do not matter―from police violence to mass incarceration, to the coded racist language used by politicians to justify these policies, to the de facto segregation of people of color, to communities that are economically and environmentally devastated, to the racist justifications that white people offer to explain these inequities.There is not space here to detail the myriad ways in which systemic racism is manifest in our society. But you really need look no further than your own actions this past Sunday. Why should the statement that black lives matter provoke such rage and violence in you? Are you similarly enraged by the statement “Blue Lives Matter” because it does not acknowledge firemen, EMTs and paramedics? Of course you aren’t. “Black Lives Matter” doesn’t mean that white lives (and all other lives) don’t matter, any more than “Blue Lives Matter” is meant to say that non-police lives don’t matter. “Black Lives Matter” is an acknowledgement that, even though we speak the language of colorblindness, we still live in a very racist society. One need look no further than the vile reactions of whites like yourself to Black Lives Matter signs to see the truth of this.I don’t know you. And it would be easy to dismiss your actions as simple ignorant racism. But I suspect there is something more complex and profound going on. I suspect that your anger is born of a deep-seated assumption about the world. An assumption that all of our social relations are necessarily competitive, which results in a zero-sum game in which more for someone else means less for you. And so you feel threatened by the demand for justice for people of color, because justice seems like a finite resource.There are those in power who want you to believe this lie. They benefit from your believing it. They are the 1 percent, and they have a vested interest in keeping whites and black, especially working class and poor whites and working class and poor blacks, from recognizing their solidarity with one another. So long as whites and blacks are busy fighting for the scraps from the “master’s” table, no one bothers to question the real source of inequality in our society, the fact that the top 20 percent controls 85 percent of the country’s wealth and the bottom 80 percent of the population owns just 15 percent.And so the economic elites sow the seeds of racism and white supremacy, in order to keep us divided and, hence, powerless. The history of this strategy goes back to the times of slavery, Jim Crow, and the opposition to the civil rights movement. At the turn of the 20th century, the populist politician Tom Watson told mixed groups of white and black farmers:“You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings. You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both.”The same is true today, as people of color demand for racial justice and are resisted by whites who believe that equality for blacks means a smaller slice of the pie for them. Your anger allows you to be made a tool of the 1 percent. It keeps you from turning your eye on the economic elites and demanding real economic justice—for everyone.Allow me to suggest an alternative paradigm, an alternative to the view of the world in which we are all in competition with one another. In the world I see, you and I and our black and brown brothers and sisters are interconnected as members of the human species and co-inhabitants of Planet Earth. Recognition of those connections dictates that we fight for the rights of each other. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.:“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.”And so it is for everyone―even people like yourself―that I stand on that sidewalk with a Black Lives Matter sign.In the world I see, the desire for justice for some demands that we seek justice for all. In the world I see, justice is not a finite resource, and a rising tide of equality raises all of our boats. In the world I see, all lives do matter. And this requires me to recognize the unique plight of people of color. It requires me to say “black lives matter.” It requires me to stand with a sign in front of my church and endure the abuse of White men like yourself.But it is my hope though that you will come to see that your hopes and dreams are inextricably intertwined with the hopes and dreams of people of color. It is my hope that, recognizing this, you might one day join me on that sidewalk and declare that black lives matter."

McGowan turned herself in at the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office after a warrant was issued Feb. 1 by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department, authorities confirmed. The sheriff’s office told HuffPost that the actress was arrested and booked before being released later Tuesday on a $5,000 unsecured bond.“The Class 5 felony charge stems from a police investigation of personal belongings that tested positive for narcotics and were left behind on a flight (United 653) arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport on Jan. 20, 2017,” Robert Yingling, public information officer for the MWAA police, told HuffPost.Police checked the belongings, believed to be McGowan’s, left at Dulles airport on Jan. 20, and they tested positive for narcotics, The Associated Press reported. McGowan has been a leading voice among the sexual harassment accusations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The former “Charmed” actress says that the producer raped her and then gave her a $100,000 settlement in 1997. The actress tweeted about the arrest warrant in October, claiming it was an attempt to silence her. “Are they trying to silence me?” McGowan’s tweet read. “There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia. What a load of HORSESHIT.” McGowan told the New Yorker Tuesday that she noticed her wallet was missing as she ordered a car service from the airport in January. The actress said she was not using cocaine.“Imagining I’m going into sisterly solidarity, I can think of nothing more opposed to that, energetically, that I would want in my body at that moment,” McGowan told the New Yorker.McGowan and her attorney, Jim Hundley, believe that the the drugs were planted and intend on pleading “not guilty” to the charges. “Depending on when and where the wallet was lost, individuals other than Ms. McGowan had access to the wallet for somewhere between approximately 5 hours 40 minutes and more than 11 hours,” Hundley wrote to the Loudoun County Commonwealth’s Attorney Jim Plowman.McGowan’s representatives did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. This story has been updated to include McGowan and her attorney’s comments."

As we work with the Administration, Ethics, and Rules committees to implement mandatory training, we will continue our review to make sure the right policies and resources are in place to prevent and report harassment.”The policy came after a congressional hearing Tuesday morning, in which several representatives described stories of sexual misconduct involving lawmakers and/or their staff.“Today’s hearing was another important step in our efforts to combat sexual harassment and ensure a safe workplace,” Ryan said. “I want to especially thank my colleagues who shared their stories.”Like in many industries, sexual misconduct among lawmakers and staffers in Congress has been an open secret for years. Tuesday’s hearing, held to review Congress’ policies regarding sexual harassment, detailed a convoluted process for reporting such incidents that often discourages accusers from coming forward.The issue has embroiled Capitol Hill this week, as a growing number of GOP lawmakers have called on Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore to withdraw from his race because multiple women have accused him of sexual misconduct.Ryan said he agreed with those calls, telling reporters on Tuesday that Moore should “step aside” and that he believes allegations against the candidate are “credible.”"

I tried to think about it in terms of, you know, I’ve had friends who have had compulsions and have done things ― gambling or drinking or drugs,” Stewart said during an appearance on the “Today” show. “And we’ve lost some of them. Some of them have died.”Stewart, who has been friends with Louis C.K. for over 30 years, said he hasn’t spoken to the comedian since the fallout.“You always find yourself back to a moment of, ‘Did I miss something? Could I have done more?’” he said. “In this situation, I think we all could’ve. So you feel anger at what you did to people.” Stewart noted that the comedy environment has never been kind to women, despite some changes over the years. “The idea that there was this added layer of pressure and manipulation and fear and humiliation,” Stewart said before trailing off. “It’s endemic...” “We’re used to being in charge,” he said. “And I think if you talk to women they’re in a very difficult position. You get mad at yourself, too, for laughing it off or for thinking, ‘That didn’t happen.’ And it’s hard.” Stewart also addressed a video from 2016 that shows him laughing off allegations against Louis C.K. during a taping of the David Axelrod’s podcast, “The Axe Files.” “My first response was, ‘What?’ And then, joke, joke, and as he kept going, I was like, ‘Look, I know this is very serious, but I know Louis, he’s always been a gentleman to me,’” Stewart said. “Which, again, it speaks to the blindness that I think a man has.” A New York Times report published last week detailed five women’s accounts of unwanted sexual advances from Louis C.K. The comedian later confirmed in a statement that the stories were true. “These stories are true,” he said. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn’t a question. It’s a predicament for them.” "

November 7, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b6dd41f0000e7394a5c17.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Run for Something started just a few months ago, but since our launch on inauguration day, we’ve had a clear vision ― recruit progressive millennials to run for office. Last Tuesday, people around the world saw that vision take shape with 32 wins and another four that are still too close to call. To keep the momentum going, we’ve created a new holiday, National Run for Office Day, to tell real people now is the time to step up.The idea is simple, or least it should have been. More local candidates running grassroots-style campaigns means more authentic voices talking to voters, which means Democrats up and down the ballot do better. But the party institutions for decades have chosen to focus resources in “winnable” races, avoiding contested primaries and largely ignoring campaigns at the local level.This strategy hasn’t worked out. State and local offices never truly received the respect or resources they deserved. The party didn’t understand just how key these races are in mobilizing voters. Progressives in these areas have been left unengaged for decades. In the eight years following Democrats control of the presidency and both chambers, Democrats have lost about 1,000 total seats― from state legislatures to governors’ mansions. Today, Republicans control 56 percent of all state legislative seats.On Tuesday, the game was changed― just look at Virginia. Seven of RFS’s 10 candidates for Delegate won or are still too close to call. Nationwide, nearly 50 percent of our endorsed candidates won their elections. The usual win rate for candidates challenging an incumbent is 10 percent.These victories provided an enormous boost to statewide candidates. In districts with highly competitive Delegate races in Virginia, Democratic vote turnout increased by 40 percent. That is a phenomenon that we refer to as “reverse coattails.” Essentially, it means that the folks running for state and local offices were responsible for increasing turnout for statewide candidates like Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General. In all but one of our Virginia House races, our candidates performed better than Gov. McAuliffe did in 2013.As they say in Silicon Valley, this is a feature, not a bug.That’s why RFS is launching National Run for Office Day. This new holiday is part of our continued push to tell every American about their potential to lead in 2018 and beyond. The microsite, www.runforofficeday.com, is where folks can sign up for candidate resources. A series of videos from high profile people, including Sens. Kamala Harris, Kristen Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren, Jason Kander, Ai-jen Poo, Alicia Garza, Our Revolution’s Nina Turner and Voto Latino’s Maria Teresa Kumar, are urging people across the country to run.This partnership of over 40 key progressive organizations is the largest recorded effort to recruit potential candidates to put their name on the ballot.We’re at a crossroads and it’s entirely possible that if we don’t invest in state and local races, in the next few cycles that we could lose another 1,000 seats, leaving the party in ruins. The key to winning in 2018 and beyond doesn’t lie in hoping that a Congressional or statewide candidate will carry everyone else to victory, or betting on a national ad campaign or gimmicky messaging. Building the movement and gaining ground means remembering the old Tip O’Neill adage that “all politics is local.”Over the last ten years Democrats have lost 1,000 state legislative seats. We can’t afford to lose another 1,000. Let’s get new voices heard and new names on the ballot."

The Global Wealth Report 2017 reveals that while the world’s total wealth is increasing, it’s largely controlled by a sliver of the global population. The world’s wealth is divided extremely unequally between regions and within age groups. And everywhere on Earth, the gap between rich and poor is growing.“While the bottom half of adults collectively own less than 1% of total wealth, the richest decile (top 10% of adults) owns 88% of global assets, and the top percentile alone accounts for half of total household wealth,” the Credit Suisse report says. Such growing inequality has far-reaching political and social consequences. Since the financial crisis in 2008, economically disenfranchised citizens have been demanding radical changes to the status quo. In recent years, many nations have seen a growth in populist narratives of taking back power from a corrupt elite. In some places, this has been linked to anti-immigrant or anti-refugee ideology, based on the dubious idea that those groups are threats to the welfare state and social cohesion.The levels of inequality are shocking when considered in individual monetary terms. Around 70 percent of the world’s adults have less than $10,000 in total assets, not accounting for debt, according to Tuesday’s report. In order to be part of the richest 1 percent, an individual would need to own at least $770,368. And the financial gap between the average person and the very, very wealthy is only increasing.Since 2000, the wealth of the richest 1 percent has grown. In 2000, the report estimates, the top 1 percent held 45.5 percent of global household wealth. That figure is up to 50.1 percent in 2017 ― down a fraction from 2016, when it hit 50.8 percent.While the wealthiest have benefited from an overall growth in global wealth since 2000, many other groups have been left out of the spoils, in a worrying trend for the future. Although no generation has been better educated than millennials, this group has a harder time building up wealth than previous generations. Baby boomers still hold “most of the top jobs and much of the housing,” the report notes. “Millennials are not only likely to experience greater challenges in building their wealth over time, but also greater wealth inequality than previous generations,” the report says.In total, global wealth rose 6.4 percent in 2017 ― an increase over the 3.9 percent growth that occurred in 2016. But due to economic inequality in much of the world, the median wealth still decreased in Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, which excludes China and India.“Our projections for 2022 suggest more pessimistic scenarios for the immediate years ahead,” the report says, regarding the median wealth drop.Experts have long warned that such persistent inequality is a threat to stability and democratic institutions everywhere. If established systems of government and party structures can’t provide economic well-being, citizens could be driven to seek out more radical alternatives. As inequality has grown, far-left and far-right parties alike have seen their support rise in response to grievances against the status quo.Earlier this year, the World Economic Forum declared that inequality was a driving force behind both the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and the 2016 Brexit referendum.

Five of these women shared the stage in Brooklyn on Monday night in an emotional showing of perseverance and force. They were each honored for contributions and achievements they were the first to make. Those honored were Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first Muslim American woman to represent the U.S. during the Olympics competing in a hijab, Sarah Weddington, who represented “Jane Roe” in the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case that legalized abortions, Katie Couric, the first solo female anchor of a nightly news program, Laverne Cox, the first transgender woman to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy for an acting role, and Ruby Bridges, who became the first black student to attend William Frantz Elementary School in New Orleans. These women have encountered diverse obstacles, but they’re connected by their refusal to let adversity stand in their way. Weddington told the crowd her desire to break barriers for women started on her high school basketball team, where she was told by coaches she could only play a certain amount as to not impact her “reproductive capacity,” which they called her “meal ticket.” “I thought I could find something else,” she said, to laughs from the audience.Bridges, who recalled the “hundreds of parents” who pulled their children out of school on the day she arrived for class in 1960, shared what she’s learned spending time in schools throughout her adult life. “Racism is a grown-up disease, and we should stop using our kids to spread it.”Cox, who garnered her acting nomination for her role on “Orange is the New Black,” stressed the importance of working together to create change. “I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone in the waters to create many ripples,” she said, quoting Mother Teresa and crediting transgender actress Candis Cayne for casting a stone that kept her pushing forward in her career. “Today, as more of us declare our right to exist in public space, our many ripples will become tidal waves of change.”To call the visual of these five women sharing a stage inspiring would be an understatement. But their messages, both of success and struggle, spoke directly to the hundreds of high school students in attendance. They were encouraged by presenter and actress Zazie Beetz to follow these women’s leads.″Girls up top, that’s how you do it,” she said. “So whether any of you plan to be the first female NFL coach, the first female Navy SEAL, the first female goddamn president ― remember the women on this stage, and then go get your first.” Watch the entire awards ceremony ― and fast forward to the 1:58 mark to see the “Firsts” segment ― above.

And these companies’ response to it thus far has been deeply inadequate.But lost among the outrage is the damage that has been done to the communities targeted by the false and bigoted content. In short, the Russian social media content took an already toxic election campaign and made it far worse.It is no coincidence that Russians used anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, anti-Latino, anti-LGBT, anti-Muslim, and anti-black messages to stoke divisions, since candidates were already stoking them.This is not just a crisis for marginalized communities. It is a crisis for our democracy.According to Facebook’s testimony earlier this month before the Senate Committee on Intelligence, at least 126 million Americans—or more than one-third of the country—were exposed to this Russian content. That means millions more people than we realized were exposed to the falsehoods and hyperbole that are being used as the rationale for the immigration polices the Trump administration pursued.And the Russians joined the many homegrown actors online already peddling this corrosive content. In other words, communities of color have been fighting a tidal wave of misinformation with a bucket.This is not just a crisis for marginalized communities, it is a crisis for our democracy. And it is far past time for the tech companies involved to treat it as such.That is why it is so dismaying to us that for months these companies dismissed these concerns as overblown, even though they have been aware of the dangerous use of their platforms for a long time. While they have pledged to “do better,” they have been woefully short on specifics. And we are most concerned that they have yet to fully acknowledge their role in giving bigots both credibility and a platform beyond their wildest dreams.These companies have to address this crisis with concrete specifics. We know that companies are wary of solutions that could restrict free speech, but there is nothing against creating more speech.Social media companies must work with organizations representing affected communities on how to most effectively counter hate speech on their platforms. The companies should provide the opportunity, the resources and the training to help these organizations create and disseminate this content.There is something to be said for fighting hate speech with better speech and falsehoods with facts. We want to see tech companies adhere to the kind of accountability and transparency that is the hallmark of companies that practice sound corporate responsibility.But ultimately, the failure to fully see or acknowledge the impact on Latinos and other communities of color points to another longstanding issue—the profound lack of diversity in Silicon Valley.The Russian crisis underscores why diversity matters. A more diverse workforce could have helped these companies understand the deep impact of what was happening online. And that includes taking demonstrable and quantifiable steps to not only diversify the pipeline of potential new employees, but also their current workforce, leadership and boards of directors.The issue of diversity in tech has been raised for years, by us and a host of other organizations, elected officials, and leaders. And while the companies have been very open to dialogue and most have made steps in the right direction, the results are dismal.In 2014, 4 percent of Facebook employees were Latino; today it is just 5 percent. For Twitter and Google, it was 3 percent in 2014, and is only 4 percent currently. At the highest and decision-making levels for all companies, those percentages plummet even further.Polls show that the vast majority of Americans believe diversity is one of America’s greatest strengths. These companies need to decide whether they will be a party to the erosion of that cherished value, or if they will do what it takes to both prevent the use of their platforms to destroy the ties that bind us as Americans.These companies and their platforms must reflect the customers they serve. We stand ready to help if they make the right choice."
37,POLITICS,Lawmakers Want Facebook To Expose People Behind Fake Ads In State Elections Too,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-ads-state-election-disclosure_us_5a0b5e63e4b00a6eece4ea62,"For now, the social media giant is focusing just on federal elections.",2017-11-14,"An ad from the Facebook page for ""New York Immigrant Rights Coalition"" targeted New York Assemblyman James Skoufis.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b5f721f00003b004a5be8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― When Facebook announced details of a new disclosure policy for political advertisers last month, it said the policy would roll out in the U.S. starting with ads in federal elections. The buyers of Facebook ads targeting elections for president and Congress would have to be disclosed and collected in a database. The buyers of ads aimed at state and local elections could stay secret — at least for now.But fake ads don’t all come from a Russian troll factory trying to take advantage of America’s national fault lines on race, religion and immigration. Candidates up and down the ballot are the target of deceptive digital ads from groups masking their true identities. Without mandatory disclosure, it’s impossible to know the true source of these online ads.“We hope to expand to the state and local levels in the future ― and are actively working on that now,” a Facebook spokesman told HuffPost.A handful of legislators at the state level want to speed up that process and have introduced measures to require disclosure from anonymous online advertisers.California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) last month signed legislation that would mandate disclosure from “dark money” nonprofits and any group or political candidate buying advertising on digital platforms. Illinois state Sen. Ira Silverstein (D-Chicago) introduced an online advertising disclosure bill. New York state Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Long Island) also proposed a bill to mandate online ad disclosure.New York’s state elections have seen their fair share of deceptive online ads from fake groups. But no one has been targeted quite like state Assemblyman James Skoufis, a Democrat representing Woodbury in New York’s Hudson Valley.Beginning in December 2015, Skoufis was inundated with a stream of ads, at least 30 by his count, that accused, praised and attacked him on nearly every issue imaginable. In many ways, these ads mirrored the activity in last year’s federal elections by Russian trolls, who took on false identities and created fake groups to irritate Americans about the issues that would bother them the most.The groups targeting Skoufis had names like “My Hudson Valley,” “New York Immigrant Rights Coalition,” “I Love Bear Mountain New York,” “Lyme Disease Awareness―New York,” and “Not Our Tax Dollars.” Their creators and backers were anonymous. An ad from New York Immigrant Rights Coalition thanked Skoufis for supporting “free college for illegal immigrants,” a position he had never expressed. My Hudson Valley accused him of winning his previous election thanks to support from the Kiryas Joel ultra-orthodox Jewish community, a not terribly popular voting bloc that isn’t even in his district. One ad from Lyme Disease Awareness—New York even claimed that he was pro-Lyme disease.Skoufis believes this online campaign was aimed at hurting him in case he decides to run for the Hudson Valley state Senate seat, which is currently occupied by Republican Bill Larkin. The ads were targeted within the boundaries of the state Senate district. Facebook allows advertisers not only to target specific ZIP codes, but to microtarget individuals who might be most susceptible to messages from anonymous groups about immigration, taxes or Lyme disease.“I think at a minimum there should be adequate disclosure on these ads,” Skoufis told HuffPost. “People should know who is paying for them. I was glad to see that Facebook finally took some steps to do that on their own.”Kaminsky, the state senator who introduced the New York disclosure legislation, also faced attack ads from anonymous groups when he ran for office in 2016. One group that attacked him was called “NYS Public Schools”; it had no apparent connection to the state’s public school system. Another claimed to represent law enforcement officers in Nassau County, but there was no way to verify if it did or not.It’s difficult to track these sorts of campaigns because the buyers of the ads are not disclosed and the ads are often targeted to very specific audiences who would be more likely to react as the advertiser wants them to react than to raise an outcry. Online ads are also ephemeral; they vanish when the advertiser no longer backs them with money. Many candidates may not even know that they were targeted.“We’re talking a lot about Russia and the presidential election,” Kaminsky told HuffPost. “But these types of ads, people coming up with false pages, false identities — that’s happening right here under our noses.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the state senator for Skoufis’ district is Terrence Murphy. It is Bill Larkin.HuffPost wants your help reporting on digital political ads. Digital advertising is targeted to specific individuals, groups and geographic regions so we don’t see the same ads that you do. That’s why we need you to send us links, screenshots or copies of political ads from Facebook, Google, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter or other online platforms.

(How about as dessert? Maybe not...)However delicious it may be (and delicious it is), it is unremittingly beige-brown in appearance and does not make an alluring snapshot. I take solace in Nigella Lawson’s recent observation that unphotogenic brown food can taste best. Anyway, once cut into wedges to expose its interesting layered cross-section, it’s perfectly nice looking.You can and should make all the elements a day or two in advance. Start, if you like, with the pastry. Any buttery tart/pie dough will do (not puff pastry). For an 11-inch (28 cm) removable-bottom tart pan, I used 8 oz (225 g) flour, 6 oz (170 g) butter, a generous 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (half that of fine salt), and just enough cold water to bring it together into a pliable dough. Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for at least an hour or for a day or two. Roll it out, line the tart pan, place this in a plastic bag and freeze it if you have time. I like to bake empty tart shells from frozen, though I’m not really sure it makes much difference.Finely chop (I recommend a food processor) a pound (450 g) of mushrooms and cook them down in, say, an ounce (30 g) of butter with some thyme and some salt. Use medium heat and stir from time to time; the water should cook out, though (mushrooms being very wet things) the mixture will remain moist. Set aside to cool. If you don’t have fresh thyme, substitute sage or parsley. What mushrooms should you use? Regular white mushrooms are delicious, or you can add extra character by using, say, half white mushrooms and half wild or cultivated varieties such as hen-of-the-woods (maitake). If you have access to plentiful porcini (cèpes) or chanterelles, either by itself would be unimaginably good.Also with butter and thyme, cook down three medium-large onions, sliced. When they are very soft and lightly golden, which could take as long as 40 minutes over low heat, food-process them to a rough puree and set aside. After you’ve done this dish a few times, you could substitute leeks for the onions; they make an elegant change.The last cook-ahead element is the celery root (celeriac). Peel a moderate-sized one (say just shy of 4 inches – 10 cm in diameter) and cut it crosswise into three slabs. Cook it in a covered skillet with a tablespoon of butter in half an inch (15 mm) of simmering water. Turn the pieces after 15 minutes and check for doneness after 20. It should be easily pierced with a skewer or knife but not mushy. Almost always, I cook two or three and use the rest for gnocchi or for pureeing with boiled potatoes.An few hours before serving, heat the oven to 375º F (190º C – lower in convection oven) and bake the tart shell blind, lined with foil weighted with beans or pie weights. Remove the foil and weights after 20 minutes and bake until completely brown and crisp, about another 15 or 20 minutes – but monitor it to ensure it doesn’t burn.Meanwhile, combine the mushrooms and onions in a food processor with 2 egg yolks and 1/3 cup (80 ml) heavy cream; on occasion I’ve also added a handful of grated parmesan cheese, which is good but unnecessary. Process until homogeneous, but not completely smooth – some texture must remain. Check for salt and pepper; if necessary, add more fresh thyme (or whatever herb you’re using).Cut each slab of cooked celery root in half crosswise, then slice each piece into 1/4 inch (6 or 7 mm) semicircles. Arrange these on the baked tart shell and season with salt, pepper and thyme, then use a flexible spatula to spread the mushroom-onion mixture over the celery root; try to use the mixture to fill any gaps between celery slices. Bake 30 or 40 minutes at 375º F (190º C), until the mixture is set: it shouldn’t be exactly springy, but when you touch it your finger shouldn’t come away wet. Note: It is best to let the mushroom-onion mixture and the celery root come to room temperature before assembling the tart; if they are fridge-cold, allow an extra 10 minutes of baking time.Let the tart cool for at least 10 minutes (or, if you like, to warm room temperature) before serving. Just don’t serve it really cold (you can warm it up in the oven).It’s earthy and savory and, though beautifully integrated, retains the flavors of its main components. It truly does work equally well as a snack, a first course, a main dish (with a salad or leafy vegetable) or an accompaniment, preferably to a dish that has some sauce to it."

Climate Change Conference would be an understatement. On Tuesday war-torn Syria became the latest country to sign the 2015 pact, which means the U.S. is now the only country in the U.N. that has said it will not participate in the collective effort to reduce emissions. But another group of Americans is also here in Bonn to offer a counterweight to the Trump administration ― an alternate delegation that includes state and local leaders who say they are committed to the climate action Washington has shelved. The alternate delegation was out in force on Monday, as Banks prepared to preside over a panel on cleaner uses of fossil fuels. Minutes before the panel began, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) strode into the room and delivered a statement to the press. The Trump administration’s position “is a sideshow,” Inslee said. “It is a blip.” Then as panelist Barry Worthington, executive director of the U.S. Energy Association, told the crowd that the world will be “using fossil fuels and nuclear for some time to come,” half the audience stood up and protested. “So you claim to be an American, but we see right through your greed,” they sang, before walking out of the room.Dyanna Jaye of Virginia was among the protesters. “These people do not speak for us,” she told HuffPost. “We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground.”Monday’s walkout was yet another symbol of how dramatically the U.S. presence at the annual climate summit has changed. In previous years, the government funded an official pavilion to showcase its climate action, among booths from dozens of other countries. The Trump administration declined to sponsor a pavilion this year, so former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is footing the bill for the U.S. Climate Action Center, a sprawling series of inflatable domes just outside the main conference area. At a packed launch event Saturday, Bloomberg said he had gathered support for the Paris pact from public officials and leaders who represent some 130 million Americans, and he suggested their alternate delegation is just as relevant to the climate talks as the official U.S. negotiating team.“If Washington won’t lead, mayors, governors and civil society will,” Bloomberg said. (“Well, I represent 300-something million Americans,” Banks countered in an interview.)During a day of panels, mayors from Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Iowa took the stage alongside Walmart Senior Vice President for Global Sustainability Laura Phillips, who said her company is about a quarter of the way to its goal of getting all its power from renewable energy. “We found that it’s been very good for our business,” she said. The attention the unofficial U.S. delegation received has overshadowed the near-silent American negotiators. “The United States is playing a very minor and inactive role this time,” said Ken Berlin, who has attended three previous negotiations as head of the Climate Reality Project, a group former Vice President Al Gore founded. During the Obama administration, Berlin said, the official American delegation was larger and highly visible, working to bring other countries on board in the climate negotiations.With the U.S. delegation stepping back, some U.N. brass are looking to the unofficial American delegates. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, moderated a discussion on Monday that featured Inslee, Oregon’s Brown, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R).Schwarzenegger, the sole Republican, wore a green tie and told the crowd that Trump’s plan to revive coal is “like bringing back Blockbuster.”Figueres asked the panelists how they plan to deal with a “hostile national environment.”McAuliffe pointed to upcoming congressional elections as a chance for voters to pick Democrats who could potentially oust Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, and other prominent climate change skeptics. California Gov. Brown said his state is already tightening its emissions standards and investing heavily in electric vehicles ― though he conceded other countries might have to take the lead for the next few years. “The rest of the world is going to carry the ball while we’re temporarily in America off to the sidelines,” he said.It’s too early to tell if governors can achieve what Washington won’t, Figueres told HuffPost, adding that she doesn’t think “it’s impossible.”One of the major achievements of the Paris agreement was bringing both the United States and China together in a shared commitment to addressing emissions. But now, the two countries have diverged. Chinese environmental researcher Nellie Wang came to Bonn from Beijing to speak about low-carbon urban development at her government’s pavilion. She said she stopped by the U.S. Climate Action Center “to find out what is America’s commitment without Trump’s commitment.”Wang said Bloomberg’s public commitment to climate is impressive, but her country’s leaders are taking a centralized approach. “They are developing a concrete plan, step by step.”Members of the U.S. alternate delegation hope their presence shows there is still a shared commitment to action in the U.S. ― with or without central leadership.“I wanted people to understand that America is not crazy,” McAuliffe said.

At a packed launch event Saturday, Bloomberg said he had gathered support for the Paris pact from public officials and leaders who represent some 130 million Americans, and he suggested their alternate delegation is just as relevant to the climate talks as the official U.S. negotiating team.“If Washington won’t lead, mayors, governors and civil society will,” Bloomberg said. (“Well, I represent 300-something million Americans,” Banks countered in an interview.)During a day of panels, mayors from Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Iowa took the stage alongside Walmart Senior Vice President for Global Sustainability Laura Phillips, who said her company is about a quarter of the way to its goal of getting all its power from renewable energy. “We found that it’s been very good for our business,” she said. The attention the unofficial U.S. delegation received has overshadowed the near-silent American negotiators. “The United States is playing a very minor and inactive role this time,” said Ken Berlin, who has attended three previous negotiations as head of the Climate Reality Project, a group former Vice President Al Gore founded. During the Obama administration, Berlin said, the official American delegation was larger and highly visible, working to bring other countries on board in the climate negotiations.With the U.S. delegation stepping back, some U.N. brass are looking to the unofficial American delegates. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, moderated a discussion on Monday that featured Inslee, Oregon’s Brown, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R).Schwarzenegger, the sole Republican, wore a green tie and told the crowd that Trump’s plan to revive coal is “like bringing back Blockbuster.”Figueres asked the panelists how they plan to deal with a “hostile national environment.”McAuliffe pointed to upcoming congressional elections as a chance for voters to pick Democrats who could potentially oust Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, and other prominent climate change skeptics. California Gov. Brown said his state is already tightening its emissions standards and investing heavily in electric vehicles ― though he conceded other countries might have to take the lead for the next few years. “The rest of the world is going to carry the ball while we’re temporarily in America off to the sidelines,” he said.It’s too early to tell if governors can achieve what Washington won’t, Figueres told HuffPost, adding that she doesn’t think “it’s impossible.”One of the major achievements of the Paris agreement was bringing both the United States and China together in a shared commitment to addressing emissions. But now, the two countries have diverged. Chinese environmental researcher Nellie Wang came to Bonn from Beijing to speak about low-carbon urban development at her government’s pavilion. She said she stopped by the U.S. Climate Action Center “to find out what is America’s commitment without Trump’s commitment.”Wang said Bloomberg’s public commitment to climate is impressive, but her country’s leaders are taking a centralized approach. “They are developing a concrete plan, step by step.”Members of the U.S. alternate delegation hope their presence shows there is still a shared commitment to action in the U.S. ― with or without central leadership.“I wanted people to understand that America is not crazy,” McAuliffe said.

Church of the Trinity minister Sue Wickham wrote on her Facebook wall that she had received a call from the local council that someone had filed a complaint about the pride flag.“Now we have to take it down and apply for Council approval,” Wickham wrote.She added that the council most likely asked her to take the flag down because it’s attached to the building, which is “locally heritage listed.” According to Australia’s Office of Environment and Heritage government site, when a building is on the National Heritage List ― as the Adelaide church is ― it requires owners to get more approvals when altering the building in any way.The rainbow flag was hung several weeks ago in anticipation of Australia’s vote on same-sex marriage, according to Australia’s Gay Star News.The outcome of the vote is due Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET.

44,RELIGION,Alabama Pastor Won't Believe Allegations Against Roy Moore Unless He Admits It Himself,Carol Kuruvilla,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-pastor-roy-moore_us_5a0b2410e4b0b17ffce0aa7c,"""If he says he didn’t do it, I believe it,” Dr. Michael Allison said of the sexual assault accusations.",2017-11-14,Roy Moore is the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b4e031f00003b004a5b9f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This Alabama pastor has a lot of faith in his Senate candidate, Roy Moore. Dr. Michael Allison, pastor of Madison Baptist Church in Madison, Alabama, said on Saturday that he refuses to believe the women who have accused the former judge of sexual assault. The only thing that could convince Allison that Moore acted inappropriately, he said, would be if Moore himself admits it, or if “he’s found guilty of it.”“I’d like to hear it from his lips,” Allison told CNN. “Until then, all it is is an allegation.” At least five women have said they were pursued sexually by Moore when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. One of the women, Leigh Corfman, told The Washington Post that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old. The Post says it interviewed more than 30 people who knew Moore between 1977 and 1982, the period when the inappropriate behavior allegedly occurred. The Post also confirmed through divorce records that Corfman’s mother attended a hearing at the Etowah County Courthouse, where Moore was working in 1979. Corfman says she first met Moore outside that courtroom.Still, Allison said he’s convinced that Moore is not guilty.“I know the man. I know that he’s a good man, he’s a godly man,” Allison said of Moore. “He’s a man who stands for right, and he has shown himself to be a man of great character. And if he says he didn’t do it, I believe it.” The allegations against Moore have elicited mixed reactions from evangelicals around the country, with some standing firm in their support of the candidate and others wavering. Moore has earned a reputation in Alabama as a staunch conservative Christian. He was removed from Alabama’s Supreme Court on two separate occasions ― once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from state grounds, and once for attempting to get the state’s probate judges to refuse to issue same-sex marriage licenses.Allison claims to have known Moore for the past 20 years. The website of Allison’s church describes his congregation as “an independent, fundamental, old-fashioned, King James Bible-preaching, Bible-believing church.” He’s one of more than 50 Alabama pastors who signed a letter endorsing Moore before the GOP primary in August.Kayla Moore, the candidate’s wife, rereleased the letter on her Facebook page on Sunday ― although it appears she may not have contacted all the pastors on the list to ask whether they would still like to be included in the letter, given the sexual assault allegations. At least two pastors have asked for their names to be removed, according to AL.com.Allison told WHNT News 19 on Monday that while he finds the alleged predatory behavior abhorrent, he doesn’t believe Moore is capable of doing such things.“He’s been a man who has been known for his character, for standing for things according to the word of God,” Allison said. “And of course, we’re a Bible-believing church and we really appreciate a politician who takes a similar stand.”“I’m not going to believe some spurious allegation that is made right at the height of a political campaign that is very important for our country,” he added."
45,POLITICS,Congresswoman Says At Least 2 Members Of Congress Are Sexual Harassers,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/speier-sexual-harassment_us_5a0b0d36e4b00a6eece46f84,Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) has been an outspoken advocate for making it easier for Congress workers to report sexual misconduct.,2017-11-14,This graphic shows what you must go through if you report sexual harassment in Congress.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b20b91f0000e7394a5ae1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said Tuesday that she knows of two members of Congress who are currently in office ― a Democrat and a Republican ― who have sexually harassed staffers. Speier has been an outspoken advocate for making it easier for individuals who work in Congress to report sexual misconduct. The current lengthy and convoluted process makes it difficult for accusers to step forward and discourages them from doing so. Speier recently revealed that when she was a staffer on the Hill, the chief of staff in her office sexually assaulted her. Since sharing her story, she said she has heard from a number of men and women, both current and former staffers, who have been subject to sexual harassment. “In fact, there are two members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, right now who serve, who have been subject to review or have not been subject to review, but have engaged in sexual harassment,” Speier said in her testimony before the House Administration Committee, which held a hearing on sexual harassment in Congress Tuesday morning. Speier did not name the members. The congresswoman also said she had heard of victims “having their private parts grabbed on the House floor.”Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), a member on the committee, also said she had heard of a congressman who is currently serving who had exposed himself to a young female staffer. She did not know the identity of the congressman.“This member asked a staffer to bring them over some materials to their residence. And a young staffer ― it was a young woman ― went there and was greeted with a member in a towel. It was a male, who then invited her in. At that point, he decided to expose himself,” Comstock said. “She left, and then she quit her job.”“What are we doing here for women right now,” she added, “who are dealing with someone like that?”In recent weeks, after women have spoken out against film producer Harvey Weinstein and other high-profile men for sexual assault, staffers on Capitol Hill have also been telling their own stories about how toxic the culture is in Congress.Sexual harassment is an open secret on the Hill, with female staffers warning one another about which members or which male aides to stay away from. Former Rep. Mary Bono (R-Calif.) recently told The Associated Press that when she served in Congress, a male member approached her on the House floor and told her he had been thinking about what it would be like to see her shower. That man, whom she did not name, is still in office.Recently, 1,500 former congressional staffers signed a letter to the leadership of the House and Senate urging them to put in place mandatory sexual harassment training and revamp the procedures for reporting such behavior. Women who have spoken with HuffPost said they had no idea where to go when they experienced harassment, especially when the person harassing them was a high-ranking aide like a chief of staff or a legislative director. How the problem is dealt with varies by office. Speier put up a graphic during Tuesday’s hearing showing the confusing process that staffers have to go through if they want to report harassment.A staffer reports the incident to the congressional Office of Compliance and then the victim ― not the accused ― must go through mandatory counseling for 30 days. Speier noted that the entire process seems tilted toward the accused, with the harasser receiving free legal counsel through Congress, while the victim is on his or her own. “I’ve also heard from mediators who say the congressional process is atypical in that survivors don’t have the option to be in separate rooms as defendant’s counsel. And survivors are often addressed in an aggressive manner,” she said. Interns and fellows don’t even have access to this process.Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said he was worried that an unfortunate consequence of the increased awareness around sexual harassment is that offices would avoid hiring female staffers so as not to get caught up in any scandals. “I have a female-led staff, and I asked them their opinion,” he said during the hearing. “They were concerned ... that an unintended consequence may be some offices just take a shortcut and not hire women as a way to avoid these issues. Obviously that’s not the right approach.”Gloria Lett, the counsel for the Office of House Employment Counsel, said people in her office had also raised that concern and that they were working to remind everyone that such discrimination in hiring is illegal."

No. 2: If he cares about the values and the people he claims to care about, then he should step aside.”Ryan had previously taken the stance that the allegations of sexual assault and initiating sexual contact with women in their teens when Moore was in his 30s were “disqualifying, if true.” But after another woman came forward to detail an aggressive episode where she says Moore grabbed her by the neck and forced her head toward his crotch when she was 16, and after Moore presented a less than convincing defense, Ryan is no longer qualifying his call for Moore to end his campaign.Republicans all over the Capitol are struggling with the “Roy Moore question” ― whether they should hedge their support, whether they should simply say he’s unfit to serve, or whether they should threaten to expel him from Congress if he wins.Moore, meanwhile, has shown little deference to the Republicans calling on him to drop out of the race ahead of the Dec. 12 election, and President Donald Trump has yet to weigh in."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0ac0311f0000e7394a59e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump failed to speak out about two of Asia’s biggest humanitarian crises ― the ethnocentric violence in Myanmar and the alleged extrajudicial killings in the Phillippines ― during his 12-day visit to the area, even as some of America’s closest allies delivered strongly worded responses.In a statement released on Monday, the White House said that Trump and Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte discussed the crisis in Myanmar during their meeting on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit in Manila. Trump did not make public remarks about the intensifying violence enveloping Myamnar’s Rakhine state, which has forced more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslim people to flee their homes into Bangladesh. He also didn’t give any indication that he spoke to Myanmar’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, about the conflict.“Both leaders called for the expeditious delivery of humanitarian assistance to affected communities, and welcomed the Myanmar government’s commitment to end the violence, restore media access, ensure the safe return of displaced persons, and implement all of the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, and urged all parties to support these government commitments,” the statement said.The White House also said that the two leaders spoke about human rights, though a spokesman for Duterte, who has allegedly ordered thousands of extrajudicial killings as part of his war on drugs, denied that. Duterte also shot down questions from reporters on the subject.Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was also in Manila, said he had a “firm” discussion with Duterte on Tuesday about the alleged human rights abuses. He also met with Suu Kyi last week to call for a “sustainable and just solution” to the Rohingya crisis. “Canada has earned a reputation for being able to have strong and frank, sometimes firm, discussions around the rule of law and human rights with its partners. It’s very much what people expect of Canada and it comes as no surprise when we bring it up,” Trudeau said. “The president was receptive to my comments, and it was, throughout, a cordial and positive exchange.”Trudeau said he would nominate a Canadian special envoy to the region to “engage in diplomatic efforts, and identify ways in which Canada can support the response to the situation and the plight of the Rohingya minority.”Austalian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, also in Manila, said he spoke to Suu Kyi directly on Tuesday to express his concerns with the refugee crisis.In London, British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday night condemned the “inhuman” treatment of the Rohingya people, which she said “looks like ethnic cleansing.”“It is something for which the Burmese authorities ― and especially the military ― must take full responsibility,” May said.Human rights advocacy groups decried Trump’s missed opportunity.“President Trump has spoken about his ability to talk tough with foreign leaders, and the ASEAN summit was a renewed opportunity to raise the horrifying human rights abuses that the region is facing,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Philippines researcher for Amnesty International. “It is very disappointing that President Trump appears to largely have ignored this opportunity, and instead stayed silent on the suffering of the Rohingya while in Asia.”Government-backed forces have been accused of waging a brutal campaign against the minority group, including atrocities such as sexual assault, torture and indiscriminate killings. Satellite imagery has shown hundreds of Rohingya villages burned to the ground.Trump has yet to speak about the crisis directly, so far only condemning the violence through intermediaries. Vice President Mike Pence said in September that Trump urged the United Nations Security Council to take “strong and swift action” to end the bloodshed. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said he was “very concerned.” “Everybody is trying to figure out who can move the officials in Burma,” she added.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is set to meet later this month with Suu Kyi, who has been chastised over her handling of the crisis, which she once blamed on “fake news.” The U.S. is said to be considering sanctions on Myanmar’s regime in response to the alleged crimes, and the State Department withdrew aid to the Burmese military last month. But Tillerson, who has repeatedly condemned the violence, has stopped short of labeling it as ethnic cleansing."

It’s a night that never goes unnoticed. On Monday night, Glamour celebrated 2017 by paying tribute to the work of many artists, humanitarians and game-changers, including Dior artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri, astronaut Peggy Whitson, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Muzoon Almellehan, “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, “Full Frontal” host Samantha Bee, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, artist Solange Knowles, supermodel Gigi Hadid, the minds behind the Women’s March and actress Nicole Kidman.The show included special tributes to the women of the #MeToo movement and five pioneers ― Ibtihaj Muhammad, Katie Couric, Ruby Bridges, Laverne Cox and Sarah Weddington ― who “kicked open a million doors for us,” among others.Kidman took her time onstage to celebrate the “good love” in our lives and how we can use it to bring about change. After being introduced by “Beguiled” director Sofia Coppola, Kidman accepted her award with grace and poise, recognizing her successful yet trying year. “It’s been an extraordinary year and I use that word extraordinary in all of its meaning because we’re in uncharted territories right now,” she began. “But I think tonight we’re here to celebrate the phenomenal contributions that so many people in this room are giving to the arts, to culture, to exploration, to human rights. So I just want to take this moment to say, let’s celebrate all of us and what makes us us.” Kidman went on to acknowledge her parents, particularly her mother who “came from the generation where a lot of the things she would have liked to have been she didn’t have the opportunity to achieve.” The actress said with her mother’s drive and the partnership she shared with a “supportive, caring and loving” man like her father, she and her sister, Antonia, were able to chase after their dreams.Her parents’ empowering union is something Kidman calls “good love,” and she hopes to pass it on not only to her four children but to others who may need it. In a sweet nod to her husband, Keith Urban, who was sitting in the audience as she gave her speech, Kidman explained that without her “extraordinary” spouse, she would be lost. “He gives me so much strength at times and he gives me so much love,” she told the crowd and a teary-eyed Urban. “I’m very, very fortunate and I know so many people in this room don’t have that, but I do have it and I want to acknowledge it because as much as I’m a strong woman, I need help and I need support.” Kidman concluded by saying we need to bridge the gaps between us and share the good love, supporting those who are different from us and making sure they’re seen and heard. “Let’s offer our support and let’s create change,” she said. “It is about building bridges. Bridges bring understanding, they bring empathy, but they bring change, and that’s what we need. We need change.” Watch Kidman’s full speech in the video above. "

Wade.",2017-11-14,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn introduce the Republican tax reform plan at the Capitol on Nov. 9. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0b18ad1b00004800376fd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans are making tax reform about abortion rights.A widely criticized provision that would give fetuses access to college savings plans made it into the draft tax bill Senate Republicans released last week.The measure is similar to one included in the House’s tax plan. The provision would enable an embryo or a fetus ― defined by the proposed legislation as “an unborn child” ― to be named as a beneficiary to a 529 college savings account, a tax-advantaged way parents can invest money to save for education costs.It’s already relatively easy, under current tax law, to open a 529 before a child is born. The real intention here is to sneak anti-abortion language into federal law, according to feminists and abortion rights advocates.The tax bill’s language is part of a broader strategy employed by the White House and Congressional Republicans to chip away at Roe v. Wade, says Sarah Lipton-Lubet, vice president for reproductive health and rights at the National Partnership for Women and Families. For years, anti-abortion activists have tried (and mostly failed) to get “personhood” laws passed that would give embryos and fetuses rights ― ultimately making it a crime to abort them.This time around they’re trying to worm “personhood” language into other places. These include a draft strategic plan for the Department of Health and Human Services released last month that says the department’s mission is to protect “Americans at every stage of life, beginning at conception.”Personhood language also makes an appearance in a bill under consideration by House Republicans that would ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. If a physician performs an abortion after that and “thereby kills a human fetus,” he or she would be subject to jail time, under the proposal. “The hope is that if they throw enough anti-abortion language at the wall something is going to stick,” said Lipton-Lubet. “It’s a dubious strategy. It’s an affront to women.”She notes that overall the tax plan doesn’t offer much relief to women and families. A proposed increase to the child tax credit, for example, is mainly geared to benefit upper-income earners. The Senate also is proposing to get rid of a widely used tax deduction on state and local taxes, which would likely wind up hitting local services like schools.The Senate’s bill goes out of its way to define a “unborn child,” according to a passage from the bill sent to HuffPost by a representative of the Senate Finance Committee: “The provision provides that an unborn child may be treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under section 529 plans. An unborn child means a child in utero. A child in utero means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.”Under current law, you can open a 529 account before a child is born. A parent-to-be would simply list him or herself as the account’s beneficiary, and change the name on the account once the baby arrives.Still, anti-abortion groups hailed the measure when it popped up in the House’s bill. “The inclusion of the unborn in 529 college savings plans recognizes the humanity of the unborn child and gives parents the opportunity to save for a child’s education from the earliest stages of his or her life,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, in a statement released after the House’s tax bill came out.Her group was also adamantly opposed to another provision of the House’s tax plan that would’ve killed a tax credit given to parents who adopt. That measure did not make it into the Senate’s bill."

54,POLITICS,Interior Decorator: Zinke’s Push To Redesign Flags And Accessorize With Dead Animals,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/interior-department-ryan-zinke-flags-stuffed-animals_us_5a0369d7e4b0937b510f5554,"“You can’t make this stuff up.""",2017-11-14,Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke brought in a taxidermy menagerie to decorate his executive suite.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a09b60d1b00006a17376c8a.jpeg?cache=GokaQCTgxW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — A week after taking over the Department of the Interior, Ryan Zinke inquired about redesigning the agency’s flag, according to internal emails HuffPost has obtained.The department flag is emblazoned with a bison and has gone largely unchanged for a century. The emails indicate that Zinke wanted to redesign the flags and make them bigger, so that neither his secretarial flag nor the agency flag would be smaller than the United States flag that flies atop the Interior Department’s headquarters on C Street in Washington, D.C. The emails do not indicate how he wants to redesign the flag.The emails shine more light on Zinke’s revival of an obscure military flag-flying tradition. As The Washington Post reported last month, when Zinke enters the building, “a security staffer takes the elevator to the seventh floor, climbs the stairs to the roof and hoists a special secretarial flag.” When he goes home, the flag comes down.Zinke was sworn in March 1 and arrived at his post the following morning sporting a cowboy hat and riding a horse. The flag inquiries by the former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL were part of a broader revamping at Interior that included outfitting his office with a slew of taxidermied creatures and a bronze bust of his hero Teddy Roosevelt.The redesign seems to have left Interior staff scrambling and scratching their heads. “You can’t make this stuff up,” Joe Nassar, director of Interior’s Office of Facilities and Administrative Services, wrote to several other Interior employees a few weeks later, referring to the pending delivery of a stuffed bobcat. One week after Zinke took office, Elena Gonzalez, Interior’s deputy assistant secretary for technology, information and business services, sent an email to Douglas Domenech, then a senior adviser to the new secretary, addressing several flag-related queries. “We think the Interior flags can be any size so long as they are not larger than the American flag,” Gonzalez wrote, adding that Nassar would look into current flag proportions. “I am not sure whether the Secretary can re-design either his flag or the Interior flag. Happy to find out if you need that information as well.” “Great,” replied Domenech, who was later nominated and confirmed as Interior’s assistant secretary for Insular Areas. He requested the chapter of the agency manual on displaying and flying flags and wrote, “Yes find out if [Zinke] can change the DOI flag and how.”In an email the next day, Gonzalez wrote that the questions about redesigning flags were “taking a bit longer to answer.” “Apparantly [sic] not a common question,” she wrote.The Interior Department first adopted a flag in 1917; the first appearance of the flag’s distinctive bison. Over the last 100 years, the bison seal, and presumably the flag, have twice been replaced — first with an eagle in the 1920s and later to an image of hands holding the sun, mountains and water in the late 1960s, but both times reverted to the bison. The current flag design appears to have gone largely unchanged since the 1960s, according to “The Flag Book of the United States.”If the flagpole atop the Interior building is any indication, Zinke has thus far been unsuccessful in his bid to replace the flags with ones that have his own touch. Interior does appear to have ordered larger flags, at least, ensuring that Zinke’s personal flag will not be dwarfed by Old Glory. When Zinke is in the building, three proportional flags fly atop the building.In a March 9 email, Nassar brought Domenech up to speed on the dimension of the flags atop headquarters — at the time, the U.S. flag was significantly larger than Interior’s — and said he “checked with several folks and no one recalls any Secretary (at least from the 1980′s until now) having the Secretarial flag flown from the roof.”Charles Spain, a co-director of the Houston-based Flag Research Center, said it is unusual for an agency flag to be the same size as the U.S. flag. And, Spain said, it seems as if President Donald Trump and several members of his Cabinet are “enamored with military trappings.” Less than a month after the bear showed up, it was temporarily moved to allow for artwork to be hung on the wall behind it. A self-proclaimed “Teddy Roosevelt guy,” Zinke has also adorned his office with items commemorating the 26th president of the United States. Among the dead creatures is a black-and-white portrait of the former Montana congressman’s hero. Zinke and his wife purchased it at an estate sale in Indiana, and Teddy now hangs neatly above his office fireplace. A few feet away, below the century-year-old bison mount, is a 10-pound bronze bust of “the conservation president.”The bust is one of two that Sagamore Hill National Historic Site had reproduced in 2001, museum curator Susan Sarna told HuffPost. It is cast from an original sculpture by American artist Gutzon Borglum, which he used as a model for the face of Roosevelt blasted into Mt. Rushmore. The original bust of Roosevelt has been in Sagamore Hill’s collection since the site became a national park in 1963, Sarna said. It is unclear when exactly it was made. The copy — which the Interior Department paid $864.75 to have shipped from New York to Washington — is on loan to the secretary’s office for three years. It has been loaned to Interior secretaries and exhibited at both the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum and the National Rifle Association’s National Firearms Museum.Zinke talks often about his fondness for Roosevelt, describing himself as an “unapologetic admirer and disciple.” But his actions — in particular his recommendation that Trump shrink or otherwise weaken several national monuments designated under the Antiquities Act, which Roosevelt signed into law in 1906 and used to establish and protect 18 national monuments — have caused many in the conservation and outdoor sporting communities to turn on him.Equally as frustrated with Zinke’s leadership are many of the people now working under him, current and former agency employees say. Scientist turned whistleblower Joel Clement, who resigned from his agency post citing Zinke’s “poor leadership,” told HuffPost last month that morale at the agency is “in the toilet.”A current Interior official who requested anonymity to comment candidly echoed Clement and said the only effort they’ve seen from Zinke to boost morale has been his establishment of “Doggy Days,” when employees are allowed to bring their dogs to work. In a similar move, Zinke had installed a “Big Buck Hunter” arcade game in the cafeteria, a bizarre attempt to highlight the contributions the hunting and fishing communities make to conservation.“You’re not going to make real dents in negative morale with that type of thing,” the current official told HuffPost. “It comes with people feeling like their daily work is respected, that they are valued as employees. That the work that they care about and do is also cared about by the people in charge. And I think that’s the biggest thing that employees do not feel right now.”The emails HuffPost has obtained detailing Zinke’s arrival at the agency do little to paint a picture of a happy workforce. And the feeling is apparently mutual. “I got 30 percent of the crew that’s not loyal to the flag,” Zinke told an oil industry group in September. One person Zinke did quickly earn his wings with is his boss. At a signing ceremony in April, Trump praised Zinke for the “incredible job” he is doing. But instead of noting Zinke’s speedy efforts to advance the administration’s fossil fuel-friendly energy policy, Trump pointed to some exterior landscaping he did at the Lincoln Memorial early in his tenure.“He never overlooks the details. He’s a detail person,” Trump said. “Soon after he was confirmed, we had a snow storm — big one.” (It was less than 3 inches.) “And he was out there on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shoveling the snow all by himself. And he’s a strong guy. He did a good job. He did a very, very good job. But we’re proud of him.”Do you have information you’d like to share about Ryan Zinke or the Department of the Interior?

55,QUEER VOICES,Why Is The U.S. Denying This Young Trans Woman A Student Visa?,"Robyn Alice McCutcheon, ContributorForeign Service Officer, U.S. State Department",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trans-student-visa-kazakhstan_us_5a0a2626e4b0bc648a0d5569,A State Department foreign service officer shares the story that broke her heart.,2017-11-14,"The author, pictured here with U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan George A. Krol.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0af5531b0000e72a376f6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Aktau, Kazakhstan ― I was the last person to board the rusting Soviet-era ferry to cross the Caspian Sea to Baku. Sultana Kali gave me one final hug. We’d been crying for days, as this chapter of my life drew to a close. Our final embrace was no different. I boarded and sobbed on the deck. Sultana, left behind on shore, kept watch and wept until the ferry was out of sight.Failure.That was my prevailing feeling as the coastline faded in the distance last month, marking the end of an exhilarating, and ultimately heartbreaking, tour as a diplomat in Kazakhstan.It was exhilarating, in large part, because it began as the Obama administration called on its foreign service officers to champion lesbian, gay, and transgender rights abroad. As the first American diplomat to have come out as transgender on the job, I felt that I had much to offer, even in a deeply conservative, Muslim-majority nation like Kazakhstan.It was heartbreaking, ultimately, because I walked away having managed to do little more than spark a glimmer of hope in a small community that came to see me as a beacon. It was particularly wrenching because earlier this year, one of my colleagues at the embassy dashed what I had hoped would be the lasting legacy of my tour: enabling Sultana, a young transgender woman, to get an American college education.Some history is in order before we get to that fateful moment on the visa line.I arrived in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, in September 2014 as the regional officer monitoring environmental, science, technology, and health issues in the five post-Soviet countries in Central Asia. I accomplished a fair amount in this realm and enjoyed the work, but my day job was not what made Kazakhstan feel like home. It was the constellation of Kazakhstanis who gravitated toward me as I took on the unofficial role of American envoy to the country’s marginalized lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.It began with a series of informal discussions I hosted at home. I later managed to steer small grants to civil society groups led by lesbian, gay, and transgender Kazakhstanis.Openly transgender people in Kazakhstan are shut out of schools, universities, and all almost all lawful work. Getting personal identification documents changed to reflect a person’s new name and gender identity is virtually impossible. That made my story seem inconceivable to my new friends.I came out under stressful circumstances in 2010 while serving in Romania. A letter written by a colleague disclosing the fact that I was transgender was making the rounds at the State Department, turning my lifelong struggle to reconcile how the world saw me and how I saw myself into the subject of workplace gossip and speculation.When I told the embassy nurse in Romania that I was, in fact, transgender, I feared I would be marched out of the foreign service for conduct not appropriate for a diplomat. That, after all, was how several federal government careers came to a disgraceful end in the not-too-distant past.As it happens, that was the initial bureaucratic instinct within my chain of command: to send me home to seek mental health treatment and make my personal struggle somebody else’s problem. But I had a stroke of incredible luck. A few months earlier, Hillary Clinton, then the Secretary of State, had instituted new anti-discrimination protections for transgender employees. These did more than save my job. I got to complete my assignment in Romania. I was the first State Department employee allowed to change my name and gender marker in our personnel system. And after returning home, I took the helm of the State Department’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employee group, a position that gave me significant visibility and clout.Had I come out a few years later, I would have been more likely to become a pariah than a role model. My lesbian, gay, and transgender friends in Kazakhstan were enthralled by my story. I was living and breathing proof that the world can and does change for the better ― sometimes stunningly fast. Being the face of this facet of America’s evolution toward a more just society was a true honor, one that more than made up for the darkest days of my journey, like the time I spent in a psychiatric ward in the early 1990s after telling family members that I was transgender. It also instilled in me a sense of purpose: how could I make the path easier for L.G.B.T. people who had no legal or community support to lean on?I met Sultana in early 2016 at one of the dinners I hosted. I spotted her kneeling in front of my record collection.“May I look at them?” she asked.Of course, I replied. A few moments later she exclaimed: “You have Joni Mitchell! Could we listen to Joni Mitchell?”I was hooked. There was something about this vivacious, young woman that compelled me to try to shape the trajectory of her life.Sultana was expelled from high school in a provincial city in 2015 after she came out as transgender, when she was less than a year away from graduating. She was one of the most poised, well-spoken teenagers I had ever met. I asked her if she wanted to complete her education. Of course, she replied. I offered to help, assuming that as an American diplomat I would have the clout to get her enrolled in school.I was naive. When I approached school and university officials to advocate on Sultana’s behalf, doors were politely but firmly slammed in my face. No one would own up to transphobia, of course. But my pleas fell on deaf ears, even at international schools and the elite Nazarbayev University, where officials told me that administrative rules prevented them from enrolling a transgender student. Perhaps, the admissions officer at Nazarbayev suggested, Sultana would be better off studying abroad. The director of an international school recommended trying a community college in the United States. So that’s what we set out to do. Sultana moved into my apartment, as did her mother, who kept us fed through the frigid winter in Kazakhstan’s futuristic capital city. I got to know her family intimately. They were loving and supportive of their daughter, a rare blessing, given how transgender people are regarded in her part of the world. Sultana’s grandfather called me his second daughter. They all believed I could pull off a miracle.Sultana and her mom weren’t my only guests. My apartment became a sorority house of sorts for young women in need of a safe haven. A college student took up residence in my guest bedroom. A nuclear physics graduate student whose father sometimes drank to excess laid claim to the couch in my living room for several months. There were a few others who stayed for shorter stretches. They became my family. Beyond a mentor, I became something more akin to an older sister or second mom to them.Sultana and I spent last winter working on college applications. The dream of studying abroad filled her with hope and confidence. Sultana was among the Kazakhstanis featured in the United States embassy’s Human Rights Day video and introduced the American ambassador at an embassy-sponsored L.G.B.T. event. Soon, she became recognized as a fearless young feminist and L.G.B.T. activist. The lack of a high school degree did not dissuade Lane Community College in Oregon from admitting her. School officials offered her a scholarship after reading the essay submitted with her application, titled “I Just Want to Live an Ordinary Life… and Create a Revolution.” It described Sultana’s desire to use her American education to fight for L.G.B.T. equality in her home country. Her only misgiving about studying abroad was how much she would miss her mom, her grandfather, her boyfriend, and her two cats.With a college admission letter in hand, her visa application was something of an afterthought for us. Having once adjudicated visas myself, I had no reason to think Sultana’s application would raise red flags. Again I was wrong, but this time, it was about how things work in my own country these days.The morning of her visa interview, I gave Sultana a warm hug and told her she had nothing to worry about. I had walked her through the process, which is fairly straightforward ― international students generate billions of dollars each year for American universities.I came home to find Sultana curled in a fetal position on her bed. She’d been refused after the senior consular officer spoke to her for about three minutes. The officer told Sultana she didn’t appear to have enough money to make ends meet in the United States for four years.This was a hurdle we could overcome, I assured Sultana. Nothing in the law says international students must demonstrate they have enough money to stay afloat for four years, but consular officers have vast discretion and are not required to explain their decisions in a detailed manner. Sultana submitted a second application. This time, besides the money her family had put forward, supporters who responded to an online crowdsourcing appeal contributed $10,000. Additionally, I filled out a document known as an attestation of support, committing to cover whatever expenses Sultana’s family could not.Sultana went for a second visa interview in July. Refused again. The vice-consul didn’t even glance at the additional documentation. Not one to give up, Sultana tried a third time, this time after Senators Tammy Baldwin, Ben Cardin and Susan Collins, contacted by a number of Sultana’s supporters, had made inquiries on her behalf. Denied again.I despaired, but there was nothing I could do internally. State Department rules forbid officials like me from intervening in visa cases. What, I wondered, had the consular officer seen in Sultana as she was standing across the window, handing over forms, bank statements, and her passport?From my time adjudicating visas in Moscow years ago, I know that consular officers often suspect that young, beautiful women applying for visas intend to work as prostitutes. Could Sultana have sparked that suspicion? Additionally, she carries a passport that bears a male name and gender marker. Is it possible she got rejected because, as an openly transgender woman in Kazakhstan, she appeared to the consular officers to be an intending immigrant ― someone who intends to move permanently to the U.S.? Under the law, that finding would make her ineligible. Since I can’t ask directly, I may never know.But I know this: Of 16 Kazakhstani students accepted by Lane Community College since 2010, Sultana is the first to be turned down for a visa.It pains me to think that this type of dream-crushing, arbitrary determination may be coming more naturally to my consular colleagues at a time when our president has set out to curtail travel by citizens of certain Muslim countries, calling them inherently dangerous, and has referred to transgender troops as a “burden” America cannot afford. And it pains me terribly that there is no avenue for redress or appeal.I spent my last week in Kazakhstan trying to leave Sultana’s family with some hope. I gave them a medal the ambassador awarded me for service. And I promised I would not give up on finding a way to empower Sultana by giving her an education.For now, it seems that delivering on that promise will require finding a third country that will see in Sultana the same sparkle and promise that drew me to her. That’s a devastating realization as I head to Washington to report for a new assignment, mindful of the profound political and societal shifts underway that have made my country feel less welcoming and tolerant. I will continue to serve faithfully, recognizing that the kind of progress that saved my life and career has never been linear.But let’s not kid ourselves: For the foreseeable future, I will be serving the United States with a broken heart.Robyn Alice McCutcheon received a Superior Honor Award from the State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs “for exceptional dedication and creativity in advancing LGBT rights in Kazakhstan.” In her next assignment she will be the senior watch officer in the State Department’s Nuclear Risk Reduction Center. Although Ms. McCutcheon is employed by the U.S. Department of State, the views expressed in the notes published here are strictly her own and do not necessarily represent the views of the Department of State or the U.S. Government.Sultana Kali continues to speak her mind as an open activist.

56,POLITICS,"Thank You, Steve Bannon","Robert Kuttner, ColumnistColumnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thank-you-steve-bannon_us_5a0907d8e4b01d21c83f6bda,A Democratic wave in 2018 is looking more and more likely.,2017-11-13,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to reporters about allegations made against Alabama senate candidate Roy Moore. November 9, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a090a3c1c0000c018b34794.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Steve Bannon, the avenging angel of establishment Republicans, recently told the New York Times, “I have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be [Senate] majority leader, and I believe will be done before this time next year.” Bannon could well get his wish, though not quite in the way he intends. Suddenly, a Democratic takeover of the Senate in the 2018 elections is not such a long shot. McConnell could well hand the gavel over ― not to some Tea Party Republican backed by Bannon, but to Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.Thanks to Bannon, Republicans are now saddled with a nominee in the December 12 Alabama special senate election, ousted Judge Roy Moore, who was already at risk as too crackpot even for Alabama — and that was before several women came forth and credibly accused Moore of molesting them as teenagers. Polls now show the Democrat, Doug Jones, tied or even slightly ahead.Meanwhile, in neighboring Tennessee, Bannon and Trump hounded incumbent senator Bob Corker, a standard-issue right-wing Republican and chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, to the point where Corker decided not to run for re-election. Bannon has been hoping for a Tea-Party replacement; Trump wants someone more loyal to himself (note that these are not the same things). But instead they may get Phil Bredesen, a popular Democratic governor between 2006 and 2011, who is seriously considering running for the seat.The serial insults of Trump and Bannon also induced Arizona senator Jeff Flake to forego re-election (as a Republican anyway.) Unlike Tennessee and Alabama, Arizona is a genuine swing state. If a far-right candidate is chosen as nominee, score Arizona as a potential Democratic pickup.Likewise in nearby Nevada, Trump and Bannon have been savaging the incumbent, Sen. Dean Heller, as insufficiently radical right, and disloyal to Trump. This infighting will leave Nevada Republicans either with a wounded incumbent or with an insurgent nominee well to Heller’s right and a divided party. Nevada, which Hillary carried and whose other senator ― Catherine Cortez Masto ― is a Democrat, is another likely Democratic pickup.Winning all four seats would create a Democratic majority of 52-48.Bannon talks a good game about the greater electability of “economic nationalist” conservatives. But people who fit Bannon’s criteria tend to be so far to the right on other issues that they risk throwing swing seats to Democrats. In the past decade, Republicans lost winnable Senate elections to Democrats because their nominees were just too far outside the mainstream or turned out to have embarrassing personal histories. Remember such candidates as Todd (“Legitimate Rape”) Akin in Missouri, whose sheer extremism helped elect Claire McCaskill? This is the toxic pool in which Bannon is fishing. We can only wish him well.Until last Tuesday’s elections, the prospect of Democrats picking up the Senate and the House seemed wishful. Trump’s popularity ratings were low, but his base still mostly loved him. Winning the 24 seats needed to control the House seemed possible, but something of a stretch. Hardly anyone thought the Senate was conceivable, because Democrats are defending five or six difficult seats, and among GOP incumbents only Nevada and Arizona seemed vulnerable.But after last Tuesday, it’s looking increasing as if the 2018 mid-terms could be a wave election — a blue wave.For one thing, statewide and local legislative elections showed that Trump is monumentally unpopular in politically moderate suburbs. Trump carried disgruntled rural and working class white voters, plus just enough suburban voters to get elected. But the suburbs have had enough — and off-year elections are turning out to be referenda on Trump.That puts GOP candidates for Congress and state legislatures in a real bind: either identify with Trump and alienate a good chunk of the Republican electorate; or distance yourself from Trump and alienate a different chunk. The failed Republican candidate for Virginia governor, lobbyist Ed Gillespie, attempted the impossible straddle of distancing himself from Trump personally while trying to use Trump’s own racist and anti-immigrant playbook. It didn’t work.The other stunning thing that happened last Tuesday is that new people turned out to contest local races in droves, and energized the Democratic side up and down the ticket. The conventional wisdom in politics is that down-ticket races don’t make much difference on the top-of-the-ticket outcome. That was also proven wrong.This was bottom-up democratic politics, at its best. It was the excitement that the novices brought to the campaign — nearly all of them progressives — that helped lackluster moderate Ralph Northam win the governorship of Virginia by an impressive nine points.Normally, the two off-year gubernatorial elections, in Virginia and New Jersey a year after the presidential year, are ho-hum, low turnout, low energy affairs. Not this time. Past off-year governors’ elections have been good predictors of whether a wave is coming.Last Tuesday was also very good news in another respect. In recent weeks, the news about Democrats has been mostly glum — mainly stories of infighting between Bernie and Hillary factions, and between some groups focused on identity and others focused on economics. But Tuesday’s sweep showed that Democratic candidates and energized voters could put aside differences on behalf of the larger cause.During the past several months, thousands of young progressives have expressed a willingness to run for office. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee began the year thinking that there were a maximum of 50 House seats held by Republicans that were worth contesting. After a large number of impressive candidates came forward to challenge Republicans who’ve gotten free passes, the number was increased to 70, then to 80. According to one source at the DCCC, after last Tuesday’s wins, it has been increased again to 91.The phrase, “resistance candidates,” is now in common usage, and happily, it transcends factional divisions. But if Democratic schisms are healing, Republican ones are only widening.Even without Steve Bannon pouring oil on the flames, the Republican Party would be seriously split between Trump-loyalist factions and ordinary conservatives who are quite sick of Trump. Now, to add to the mess, Trump is trying to unhorse right-wingers like McConnell and company, not over loyalty to Trump but because they do not subscribe to Bannon’s brand of white supremacist nationalism. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Bannon faults Trump. On Mondays and Wednesdays, he professes support for him. So, what was a deep two-way split is now a deeper three-way split. Brother Steve, Bring it on.

57,POLITICS,The White Nationalist Movement Is About To Get A Legal Warrior -- If Pennsylvania Allows It,"Abraham Gutman, ContributorAbraham Gutman is an Israeli economist and independent writer ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-white-nationalist-movement-is-about-to-get-a-legal_us_5a09b17ee4b0f1dc729a6cae,"Let Evan McLaren march with his tiki-torch, but don’t let him stain the state’s assembly of lawyers in good standing.",2017-11-13,"<p>Evan McLaren, executive director of the National Policy Institute, marching in he white supremacist march in Charlottesville , August 2017</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a09b2871b00001700376c82.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored by Rory FlemingIn late July, 1,301 law school graduates took the Pennsylvania Bar Examination to get a license to practice law in the State of Pennsylvania. Of those, almost 1,000 passed and are one step closer to call themselves esquires. Each one of these lawyers has a different dream. Some took the bar exam to join the corporate world, while others to become public defenders or prosecutors. One man, Evan McLaren, took the bar exam to become the “legal warrior” of the White Nationalist movement, and the Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners should reject his admission.According to Board’s Admission Rules, admission to the bar is dependent on an “absence of prior conduct by the applicant which in the opinion of the Board indicates character and general qualifications (other than scholastic) incompatible with the standards expected to be observed by members of the bar of this Commonwealth.” State bars usually reject applicants due to a criminal record, untreated mental illness and substance abuse, lack of candor, or financial irresponsibility. Almost 40 states have reciprocity with Pennsylvania, which allows other states to admit lawyers from Pennsylvania after a period of time.The Pennsylvania Bar recently rejected Parthiv Patel, seemingly for his status as an undocumented immigrant and grantee of former Pres. Obama’s DACA program. (The ACLU of Pennsylvania is helping Patel with his case, which is currently pending.)If the Pennsylvania Bar accepts McLaren, it sends the message that a man like Mr. Patel is somehow “worse” than him because of immigration status alone.McLaren, who graduated this year from Penn State’s Dickinson School of Law, describes himself as being “dedicated to the preservation of white heritage and identity.” He insists that Jews do not fit the definition of “white,” claims that rap music is the “cesspool where black music has been festering for about twenty-five years now,” and recently retweeted a tweet implying that transgender people are “dogs.” When McLaren found out he passed the bar exam, he stated that “I passed the Pennsylvania bar exam. Hail victory!” ― using the English translation of the famous Nazi rallying chant, “Sieg heil!” A Twitter user congratulated him and added “we need more legal warriors,” to which McLaren responded, “yes we do.”If that was not enough to cause alarm, McLaren spends his days as Richard Spencer’s right-hand-man. He is the executive director of Spencer’s white nationalist “think-tank.” This is the same Richard Spencer who led 200 people in chanting “hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory” while performing a Nazi salute, was described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a “kind of professional racist in khakis,” and co-organized a white supremacists’ torch march on Charlottesville. Heather Hayer was killed in that march after a white supremacist hit her with his car, but McLaren expressed denial, insisting that Heyer was not even in the collision.If the bar rejects McLaren, he would not be the first white nationalist to be denied the ability to practice law. In 1998, Matthew Hale, who told the Illinois Board of Law Examiners that he wanted “to be an advocate for white people in the courtroom,” was denied admission to the Illinois Bar. Illinois’ Board of Law Examiners explained that while Hale was “free, as the First Amendment allows, to incite as much racial hatred as he desires and to attempt to carry out his life’s mission of depriving those he dislikes of their legal rights,” he could not also do so “as an officer of the court.” Hale lost his appeal, but the bar examiners exercised sound judgment in denying Hale, considering that was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison in 2004 for trying to order the assassination of a federal judge.Even if you won’t take it from us, another man might convince you. Cumberland County District Attorney David Freed, a conservative district attorney recently nominated by President Trump to be the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, recently expressed his own discomfort when confronted with his former intern’s identity as a white nationalist. Freed responded that McLaren “had no discretionary role in the office,” and that he would look more closely at the “social media backgrounds of interns.”The Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners would do justice by declining to admit Evan McLaren to the bar. Let him march with his tiki-torch carrying kin to exercise his First Amendment rights, but don’t let him stain the state’s assembly of lawyers in good standing. The practice of law remains today a privilege, not a right.For more from Abraham and Rory follow them on Twitter at @abgutman and @RoryFleming8A, respectively."
58,POLITICS,Did Trump Collude With Russia Or Obstruct Justice? Probably Both,"Richard North Patterson, ColumnistColumnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/did-trump-collude-with-russia-or-obstruct-justice_us_5a0980c9e4b0f1dc729a6c7f,Just follow the facts.,2017-11-13,"Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak meet with President Trump in the Oval Office. May 10, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a09a65a1c0000f718b34842.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"American intelligence agencies have definitively concluded that Russia interfered with our 2016 election to assist Donald Trump. The president’s response is disloyal to his office and his country.He defends Vladimir Putin’s pusillanimous denials. He rejects any suggestion that Russia sought to help him. He calls the leaders of our intelligence community “political hacks.” He insists that the intelligence assessment is a “Democratic hit job” fabricated to place “an artificial barrier” between America and Russia. He bridles at Congressional sanctions imposed on Russia for its comprehensive efforts to undermine our election. Only when his own intelligence directors affirm Russian interference does he temporize at all, before reverting to his pro–Putin talking points. Time and again, he is unable or unwilling to defend American democracy – the most basic obligation of a president.These repeated behaviors transcend the bizarre. That Russia attacked our election process is beyond doubt – no responsible officer of our government questions this. The intelligence reports are authoritative, and Trump himself has read them.So what explains Trump’s angry repudiation of fact and blatant dereliction of duty? Some toxic compound of narcissism, nastiness, naïveté, Putin-worship and sheer stupidity? Or did America’s president become Putin’s knowing pawn?Start with two critical questions of character: Would Donald Trump welcome Russia’s assistance against Hillary Clinton? And would Vladimir Putin want Trump to know that he was in Russia’s debt?The logical answers? Of course – and absolutely. The remaining question is how such a collaboration evolved.In itself, the pattern of entwinement is striking. During the campaign Trump’s son, son-in-law, campaign manager, future National Security Advisor, future Attorney General, and two foreign policy advisors met repeatedly with Russians connected to the Kremlin – then lied about or “forgot” these contacts. Little wonder. What we already know about this web of communication and concealment is damning – including to Trump himself.In March 2016, campaign advisor George Papadopoulos told Trump and others that his Russian contacts could arrange a meeting with Putin. In April, a Kremlin – connected professor told Papadopoulos that Moscow had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, including “thousands of emails.” At the least, a Trump advisor knew that Russia was dangling hacked emails; Trump that his advisor was enmeshed with Russia. Yet Trump continuously denied any connection between his operatives and Russia; subsequently, Papadopoulos lied about these conversations to the FBI.The hidden contacts deepened. In early June, a British publicist connected to Trump and figures close to Putin emailed Donald Jr., proposing that he meet with highly-placed Russians offering documents damaging to Clinton ― part of their “government’s support for Mr. Trump.” Junior replied: “If it’s what you say I love it...” He then arranged a meeting which included himself; campaign manager Paul Manafort; the director of campaign digital operations, son-in-law Jared Kushner; a Kremlin – connected Russian lawyer, a Russian- born lobbyist and former intelligence agent; and a Russian “financier” steeped in money laundering.This, experts believe, was a classic Russian intelligence operation. If leaders of Trump’s campaign welcomed ― then concealed ― such a meeting, that would establish the campaign’s willingness to collude against Clinton, and its susceptibility to manipulation and even blackmail, giving Russia leverage over a potential president.In the event, that is precisely what happened. The three Americans became the Kremlin’s partners in subterfuge: after the meeting, Manafort and Donald Junior indignantly denied any connection between the campaign and Russia; Kushner omitted the meeting from a disclosure form detailing foreign contacts. Particularly inculpating are Junior’s serial deceptions in 2017, after Russia’s efforts to elect Trump became public knowledge.The first lie ― that the meeting concerned Russian adoption ― was crafted by President Trump himself on Air Force One. Unless Junior was lying to his father, Trump knowingly put falsehoods in his son’s mouth. Only the latter is in character.When this fabrication evanesced, Trump went silent. Instead, Junior admitted to some vague notion that the Russians might be helpful information. Confronted at last by his unsavory emails, Junior conceded that the meeting concerned sanctions against Russian human rights violators ― some close to Putin ― but insisted that it was so inconsequential that he never told his father.To start, it defies belief that Trump, who demands obeisance from all, would not know of a meeting which included his son, son-in-law and campaign manager ― let alone with Russians angling to barter Russia’s help in defeating Clinton. When the meeting occurred Trump was in his office, one floor above. And only Trump, if elected, could give Russia what it wanted ― including relief from other sanctions for its aggression in Ukraine.Equally implausible is Junior’s claim that nothing came of the meeting. Subsequent events suggest otherwise.On June 15, a Russian hacker posted documents stolen from DNC ― which, a sophisticated observer could conclude, was a signal from Russia to Trump. On July 18, the Trump campaign inexplicably amended the Republican platform to remove support for arming Ukraine against Russian domination. On July 22, WikiLeaks published 20,000 more emails stolen hacked from the DNC, providing Trump with further ammunition against Clinton.The seeming pas de deux between Russia and Trump’s campaign continued. In July, Trump foreign policy advisor Carter Page informed members of the campaign that a Russian Deputy Prime Minister had “expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together towards devising better solutions...to a vast range of current international problems.” Throughout the campaign, Trump’s principal national security advisor, Michael Flynn ― whose unusually close ties to Russia included Putin himself ― maintained continuing contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, a principal advocate of sanctions relief. Kislyak also met twice with a principal Trump surrogate, Jeff Sessions, now Trump’s Attorney General ― including at the convention which amended the platform in Russia’s favor.Trump’s defenders argue that these meetings were innocent. But no one familiar with politics can remember another instance where a presidential campaign was so intimate with representatives of a hostile foreign power. A further negative indicia is the participants’ obfuscation of these contacts: until confronted with evidence, Page and Flynn concealed key aspects, while Sessions kept “forgetting” them altogether ― even when testifying before Congress.In parallel to these meetings, Russia’s assistance to Trump’s campaign intensified. By election day, Wikileaks and two Russian-sponsored sites had released over 150,000 emails. Notably, within hours after the salacious Access Hollywood tape surfaced on October 7 ― dealing Trump’s candidacy a potentially lethal blow ― Wikileaks began releasing emails hacked from Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. While Julian Assange of Wikileaks denies that Russia was his source, U.S. intelligence affirms that Russia hacked Podesta’s emails.Concurrently, Russia targeted specific demographic groups with fake news calculated to depress the Clinton vote among women and minorities, or to inflame racial and religious anxieties which could drive white voters toward Trump. The sophistication which informed this targeting has caused the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to investigate whether Trump’s digital operation – run by Kushner – was pointing the Russians toward selected precincts in pivotal states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where narrow victories made Trump president.As president-elect, Trump could now grant Russia’s wish list, including sanctions relief ― a principal subject of the early July meeting between Don Junior, Manafort and Kushner and the Russians dangling documents damaging to Hillary Clinton. But by December our intelligence agencies had revealed Russia’s meddling in our election ― for which President Obama imposed yet further sanctions on Russia.Putin threatened retaliation. A series of secret conversations regarding sanctions followed, in which Kislyak seems to have asked Flynn for the ultimate favor: that, as president, Trump relieve Russia of sanctions for its systematic attack on our election ― a patent act of disloyalty. That Flynn responded favorably may be suggested by the fact that Russia chose not to act.Here potential collusion ― including the swap of Russia’s electoral help for subsequent concessions in America’s foreign policy ― morphs into obstruction of justice by Trump himself. The apparent motive, as before, was to conceal the true relationship between the parties.Unbeknownst to Flynn or Trump, during the 2016 campaign the FBI had commenced monitoring Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak. This ongoing surveillance picked up their discussions in December. On January 12, the Washington Post revealed their occurrence and asked Flynn whether they had concerned sanctions.A cover-up ensued. Repeatedly, Flynn denied discussing sanctions with Kislyak ― to the press, Vice President Pence, Chief of Staff Priebus and press secretary Spicer. When Pence and Spicer repeated those denials, Trump said nothing.Shortly after Trump’s inauguration on January 20, Flynn lied yet again ― this time to the FBI. On January 26, acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed White House counsel Donald McGahn that Flynn was lying and, therefore, subject to blackmail by the Russians. Immediately, McGahn told Trump.Again, Trump said nothing to correct Flynn’s lies. Nor, clearly, did he reprimand Flynn. The most logical explanation is that Flynn was lying to conceal Trump’s knowledge of his conversations with Kislyak.Whatever his motives, as of January 26 Trump began actively concealing Flynn’s mendacity ― from the public, the press, and close advisors. On February 8, when Flynn again denied discussing sanctions with Kislyak, Trump remained silent. On February 10, after the Washington Post suggested that Flynn was lying, Trump ― remarkably ― denied to reporters knowing anything about the Post story, omitting that he already knew of Flynn’s lies through Sally Yates. Effectively, Trump himself had begun to lie.Three days later, the cover-up unraveled ― the Washington Post reported Yates’ warning, shredding Trump’s pose of innocence. Only then did Trump seek Flynn’s resignation, citing his deception of Pence and others ― deceptions Trump had known about for 18 days.In the meanwhile, the revelation of Sessions’s own contacts with Kislyak had compelled him, as Attorney General, to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, leaving it in the hands of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Stripped of the ability to act through Sessions, Trump took several direct steps to protect Flynn from prosecution and, obviously, to protect himself.First, Trump directly solicited then-FBI director James Comey to sideline its investigation of Flynn. Upon failing, Trump importuned Intelligence Director Dan Coats to intercede with Comey. When Comey persisted, Trump fired him in the apparent belief ― shared with Russian officials ― that he had shut down the FBI’s investigation.Instead, this egregious miscalculation led to Rosenstein’s appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller. Seemingly desperate, in July Trump crafted Donald Junior’s initial lie about the critical meeting between Manafort, Kushner and the Russians. In the months since, like a monarch gone mad, Trump has raged at Sessions, Rosenstein, Mueller, the Democrats, the intelligence community, the “haters and fools” questioning his connections to Russia, the Russia investigation itself, and every witness who implicates his campaign, praising Putin while obsessively denying the reality of Russia’s behavior ― and his own.The latter is most serious of all. More than arguably, conspiracy to commit election fraud, or obtain information or other things of value from foreign adversary, is a crime. Also criminal, quite possibly, is secretly accepting campaign assistance from Russia in exchange for changing our foreign policy in its favor. Obstruction of justice surely is. And any one of them calls out for impeachment.Obviously, Trump grasps that all too well.So does Vladimir Putin and Russian intelligence, steeped in the arts of kompromat: seduction, recruitment, conspiracy, leverage and blackmail. The otherwise inexplicable pattern of Trump’s conduct raises a grave and inescapable question ― whether we unwittingly elected Russia’s “Siberian candidate” as America’s 45th president."

Previously:Fifty-three pastors in Alabama have signed a letter throwing their support behind Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.“For decades, Roy Moore has been an immovable rock in the culture wars ― a bold defender of the ‘little guy,’ a just judge to those who came before his court, a warrior for the unborn child, defender of the sanctity of marriage, and a champion for religious liberty,” the pastors wrote. Their letter was posted to the Facebook page of Kayla Moore, the candidate’s wife, on Sunday and published Monday on Alabama news site AL.com.The letter detailed the two times Moore was suspended from court during his tenures as chief justice of Alabama ― first for refusing to take down a Ten Commandments monument he had erected in the Alabama Judicial Building and later for defying federal orders on same-sex marriage.The pastors described these incidents as evidence of Moore’s “unwavering faith in God and his immovable convictions for Biblical principles.”The letter did not address that multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. “We are ready to join the fight and send a bold message to Washington: dishonesty, fear of man, and immorality are an affront to our convictions and our Savior and we won’t put up with it any longer,” the pastors wrote. “We urge you to join us at the polls to cast your vote for Roy Moore.” “The Washington establishment has declared all-out war on his campaign,” they added.The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate’s campaign arm, severed its ties with Moore on Friday. The committee’s decision came one day after The Washington Post reported that four women had said Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. One woman, Leigh Corfman, said she was 14 years old when Moore sexually assaulted her in 1979.Another woman, Beverly Young Nelson, came forward with allegations on Monday. She said in a press conference that she met Moore while working as a waitress roughly four decades ago. Nelson said Moore offered to give her a ride home one night in 1977. But instead of taking her home, she said, he drove around the restaurant and assaulted her. “I thought that he was going to rape me,” she said.“He looked at me, and he told me, ‘You’re just a child.’ And he said, ‘I am the district attorney of Etowah County, and if you tell anyone about this, no one will ever believe you,’” she added. Carol Kuruvilla contributed to this report. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the circumstances of Roy Moore’s first removal from the Alabama supreme court. "
60,IMPACT,The Tiny Soccer Club Fighting For Survival Against A New York Investment Fund,"Angus Harrison, On assignment for HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dulwich-hamlet-soccer-displacement_us_5ad86a26e4b0e4d0715d94d6,"Evicted from its stadium, Dulwich Hamlet, a 125-year-old soccer club with strong community ties, is standing firm.",2018-04-21,Dulwich Hamlet supporters celebrate a goal against Thurrock F.C. in an April match.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad9d6fa1f0000270616daed.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"SOUTH LONDON, U.K. ― Cut grass prickles under the rising heat as the first waves of coaches and players mill around the dugout. It’s the latest home game that tiny South London soccer team Dulwich Hamlet has been forced to play away from Champion Hill, the ground it’s called home since 1912.The mid-April match, against Thurrock F.C., takes place at the home field of local rivals Tooting and Mitcham and is some nine miles from Dulwich.The club’s displacement is due to a rift between Southwark, the local council, and a multinational property development firm Meadow Residential, an affiliate of New York City-based property fund Meadow Partners, which owns Champion Hill and wishes to knock down the current stadium to build apartments. At the start of March, when Southwark Council rejected Meadow Residential’s proposal for a $112 million-plus apartment development on the site ― partly for its failure to meet rules on providing a set percentage of affordable housing ― the company evicted the 125-year-old club. One of Meadow Residential’s subsidiaries even went as far as to trademark “Dulwich Hamlet” and send a letter to the club demanding it cease to use its own name (the company has since withdrawn the demand).Meadow has filed new proposals that include building a new stadium for the club on public land next to the development, but the club says it would be much smaller and not fit for a soccer team that regularly draws crowds of 1,500.Yet Dulwich Hamlet, despite its size, has refused to capitulate, mounting an unprecedented fight back that’s won mainstream media support, the backing of leading British politicians and even garnered interest from ex-England international star Rio Ferdinand. Strong community ties and the unique network of personalities that make up its team and supporters are keeping Dulwich Hamlet alive.The club’s manager, Gavin Rose, played for Dulwich Hamlet 16 years ago and returned as a manager nine seasons ago after working at a handful of other clubs. He has tried to protect his players from the club’s difficulties, but media attention and moving grounds have made that difficult. “There are a lot of boys who have come through the academy at various times, so they’ve got a lot of trust in us,” he explained.Thurrock F.C., Dulwich Hamlet’s opponents, will cease to exist at the end of the season due to its chairman’s ill health, and Dulwich Hamlet has offered the visiting fans free entry to the game. Club closures are not unusual in the world of non-league soccer – which floats below the big money top leagues in the U.K. and is a mixture of amateur and semi-professional soccer – a sad fact that makes Dulwich Hamlet’s resolve all the more impressive.Rose attributed the club’s resilience to its place within the community, specifically its initiatives to reach the “forgotten parts of society,” as he put it. “That sort of spirit is probably what has stood us in good stead when we’ve had our own battles to face.”Mishi Morath, who has supported Dulwich Hamlet since 1974, is the club’s community officer, and responsible for many of these initiatives. Growing up in a public housing block behind the ground, he was 7 years old when he watched his first game. “Once you pick your local team, you’re stuck with them,” he shrugged, masking his affection. Under his watch, the club has worked with local schools and youth groups, run trade union days, raised funds towards the Syrian refugee crisis, organized collections for local food banks, supported local living wage campaigns and played a landmark friendly against Stonewall FC, Britain’s premier gay football team, with all money from ticket sales going to the Elton John Aids Foundation. However, these efforts have come to a halt due to the team’s current challenges.“Not being at [our ground] means we haven’t got a community, our community has got to travel to us,” Morath stewed, one eye on the game. “Not just that, but East Dulwich [the local neighborhood] is feeling it as well. Without the crowds we’ve built up over recent years, the local pubs have had to lay off staff on Saturdays.” He attributed Meadow Residential’s conduct to pure pettiness ― “the kid in the playground taking the football away so nobody else can play.”Meadow Residential did not respond to HuffPost’s emails or calls asking for comment. The company’s website says it has supported Dulwich Hamlet to the tune of just over $1 million, but has been “unable to financially support the Club” while the dispute with Southwark Council over the development continues. Tom Cullen ― a content producer and social media strategist ― came to the club in 2013. After taking over Dulwich Hamlet’s online presence in 2016, he was soon invited to become a committee member, going on to become the director the following year. It was during his tenure that relations with Meadow Residential broke down. He’s spent the past six months working pro bono, alongside Rose and fellow board member Liam Hickey, to keep Dulwich Hamlet afloat.Cullen sees the fight as an opportunity for Dulwich Hamlet to set a political precedent. “This isn’t just about us,” he insisted. “We want to spearhead change to legislation so that other clubs know what to do.” The Save Dulwich Hamlet campaign has attracted the attention of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, along with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. Cullen credits the club’s unique following for its continued survival. “[Meadow] could have picked any other club in the country at our level or below and gotten away with it, frankly,” Cullen said. He is optimistic that a corner has been turned in the battle to save Champion Hill ― with heavyweight political backing, he believes Dulwich Hamlet will be back home within two years.It’s a sentiment shared by Hugo Greenhalgh and Ben Sibley ― the faces behind “Forward the Hamlet,” an irreverent podcast and Twitter account. Greenhalgh and Sibley also sense a sea-change in the club’s fortunes, pinpointing a recent Friday when Helen Hayes, member of Parliament for Dulwich and West Norwood, raised the club’s plight in the House of Commons ― a motion that resulted in Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport, promising the involvement of an independent mediator should negotiations with Meadow Residential fail. “[Hayes] finished this powerful speech by saying ’Forward the Hamlet,’” Greenhalgh explained, beaming.“I lost my shit,” Sibley added.Greenhalgh and Sibley represent the new wave of fans contributing to the club’s boom in popularity in recent years ― young creatives drawn to a different sort of football in the capital. This has led some to write off Dulwich Hamlet as a “hipster club,” but it’s a caricature that fails to recognize its rich heritage.During the match, we’re introduced to people who have been with the club for decades, like volunteer turnstile operator Paul Griffin and Jack McInroy, unofficial club historian, who leans on the far corner pitch barrier to share his personal collection of old shirts and newspaper clippings. Dulwich Hamlet’s roots are deep and speak to the vacuum that would be left in its absence.In the seats of the main terrace sits 98-year-old Bill Kirby. He’s supported the Hamlet since 1932, and has always lived within a mile of Champion Hill. His memories of the team’s interwar heyday are vivid. He recalls average crowds of 10,000, special trains to ferry supporters to local derbies in Wimbledon or Kingston, and drinking shandy from the amateur cup in 1937. “To be honest, I wasn’t 18,” he whispers, confessing he hadn’t reached the legal drinking age, “but I went home pissed that night.”In its match against a dogged Thurrock F.C. on April 14, Dulwich Hamlet scraped its way to a 2-1 victory, keeping the team in the mix for promotion at the end of the season. The fight is far from over, but hope is in the air.For more content and to be part of the “This New World” community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s “This New World” series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

61,ENTERTAINMENT,'Austin Powers' Actor Verne Troyer Dead At 49,Carla Herreria,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/verne-troyer-dead_us_5adb9d77e4b089e33c88ad92,"The actor, famous for his performance of Mini-Me, “was a fighter when it came to his own battles,” his representatives said.",2018-04-21,Verne Troyer's representatives confirmed the actor's death to HuffPost.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adba04b180000410038438f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Verne Troyer, who rose to fame after playing Mini-Me in the blockbuster “Austin Powers” films, died on Saturday, the actor’s representatives confirmed to HuffPost.Troyer was 49 years old.“Verne was an extremely caring individual,” an official statement shared with HuffPost read. “He wanted to make everyone smile, be happy, and laugh. Anybody in need, he would help to any extent possible.”Troyer’s representatives did not disclose a cause of death but said that the actor “was a fighter when it came to his own battles.”“Over the years he’s struggled and won, struggled and won, struggled and fought some more, but unfortunately this time was too much,” the statement read.“Depression and Suicide are very serious issues. You never know whatkind of battle someone is going through inside. Be kind to one another. And always know, it’s never too late to reach out to someone for help.” Troyer was born with a form of dwarfism in Centreville, Michigan. He, his older brother and younger sister grew up in an Amish community, although his parents had left the religion when he was young. “My parents taught me to be optimistic and independent,” Verne said in a 2015 interview with the Guardian.“They made me feel that I could do anything I set my mind to, which has really helped me,” he added. “They didn’t make allowances for me because of my height.”In a 2013 Ask Me Anything reddit forum, Troyer said his parents were his role models.“They never treated me any different than my other average sized siblings,” he wrote. “I used to have to carry wood, feed the cows and pigs and farm animals.”While Troyer became a pop culture icon for playing one of the most memorable villains of the late 1990s ― Mini-Me ― he has had roles in many other films, including, Percy in “Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,” Coach Punch Cherkov in “The Love Guru” with Michael Myers, and Griphook in “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.”Troyer got his first gig in the entertainment industry in 1993 as a baby’s stunt double for a film titled “Baby’s Day Out.” After that, he found success as a stuntman for several films, including the 1996 comedy “Jingle All The Way” with Arnold Schwarzenegger.In his reddit AMA, Troyer suggested that he did all of his own stunts in the “Austin Powers” series.“Nobody else can do my stunts except for a doll,” Troyer wrote. “I’m only 2 foot 8 dude!”“Verne was the consummate professional and a beacon of positivity for those of us who had the honor of working with him,” his “Austin Powers” co-star Mike Myers said in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. “It is a sad day, but I hope he is in a better place. He will be greatly missed.”In recent years, the actor had launched his own YouTube series where he shared his recipes, interviewed people, reviewed products and answered questions from fans.Troyer was hospitalized in Los Angeles for an alleged poisoning two weeks before his death. At the time, celebrity news site The Blast confirmed with the Los Angeles Police Department that Troyer was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold.

On Friday, grassroots gun reform group Survivors Empowered launched a campaign called “30 Billboards Outside Cowardly Incumbents,” inspired by the movie “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” The group bought ad space on 13 billboards in nine states, from California to Iowa to Alabama, and are fundraising for 17 more.

They’ve already taken our daughter.”The billboard campaign launched the same day hundreds of students walked out of schools across the country to mark the anniversary of Columbine and call for legislative action on guns. In the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school massacre and the subsequent wave of student activism, young protesters have repeatedly called out lawmakers for their ties to the NRA. Last month, the NRA lobbied against gun regulations proposed in Florida, which included raising the minimum age for firearms purchases to 21 and banning the sale of bump stocks. The legislation passed. “There are a lot of Americans out there saying, ‘We’ve had enough and want these politicians called out,’” Phillips told HuffPost on Friday. “What’s great is these students aren’t afraid ― they’re showing better leadership than many politicians.”The billboards were placed in congressional districts of politicians who had received what the group deemed “substantial” financial support from the NRA. The contribution figures listed on the billboards were from gun reform group Everytown for Gun Safety and represented the total donations the NRA had made to the politicians over their careers. While the billboards had been slowly going up over the past week, the campaign officially launched Friday with candlelight vigils planned at most locations. So far the billboards have been funded to stay up for about six weeks, Phillips said, but the group hopes to raise enough to purchase more billboards and keep them up through the November midterm elections.

The White House said this week he wanted to avoid disrupting the service with added security.Hours before the service’s scheduled start at 11 a.m. local time (1600 GMT), security was tight, with bomb-sniffing dogs checking media equipment and police officers searching bags.Guests arrived at a different church several miles away to be bussed to the venue, walking past a throng of media. Bush made it possible for her husband to have “the arc of his life,” said Karl Rove, who served as a chief political adviser for George W. Bush and spoke with him a few days ago.“This is a family of great faith, of great conviction,” Rove said. “He has every comfort, every confidence of where his mother is.” Following Saturday’s service, Bush will be buried on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Library and Museum at Texas A&M University in College Station, next to her daughter, Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of 3. The motorcade carrying her body will traverse both George Bush Drive and Barbara Bush Drive on its way to the burial site.Members of the public paid their respects on Friday, when Bush lay in repose at the church. The 93-year-old George H.W. Bush, seated in a wheelchair in front of the casket, greeted mourners in turn with a handshake.Reporting by Erwin Seba; Writing by Joseph Ax; Editing by Diane Craft and Matthew Lewis"
65,POLITICS,Montana Democrat Rips Sinclair Broadcasting In Ad On Sinclair Stations,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/montana-democrat-john-heenan-ad-blasting-sinclair_us_5adb877ae4b009869bf9ee5f,Congressional candidate John Heenan says the local news giant is abusing its power and taking advantage of journalists.,2018-04-21,Democrat John Heenan is running an ad against Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of his populist campaign against Rep. Greg Gianforte (R).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5adb89141a00004800533b92.jpeg?cache=V7nM6rHU6V&ops=crop_0_22_959_817%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Montana Democrat John Heenan is blasting Sinclair Broadcast Group for “using its power to take advantage of journalists” in paid advertisements on local TV stations owned by Sinclair.Heenan, a consumer rights attorney and restaurant owner from Billings, is one of four Democrats challenging incumbent Rep. Greg Gianforte (R).The 30-second spot highlights Heenan’s populist bona fides, potentially providing a model for other Democrats trying to exploit grassroots’ anger over Sinclair’s support for President Donald Trump’s agenda. Sinclair, which owns or operates more TV stations than any other company, drew fire earlier this month when it emerged that it had forced news anchors at all of its stations to read an identical message denouncing “fake news,” which Trump has used to characterize coverage he dislikes.“This station is owned by Sinclair Broadcasting, a powerful corporation that forces its journalists to read corporate talking points on the air,” Heenan says in the advertisement. “A corporation using its power to take advantage of journalists, our democracy and the people of Montana? Not on my watch.”The ad is due to air on the three Sinclair-owned NBC affiliates in western and south central Montana, reaching viewers in the cities of Missoula, Butte and Kalispell. Heenan’s campaign has made a four-figure buy that will run the spot during the “Today” show on Monday and Tuesday mornings, as well as during the evening and late-night news blocs on those days.Tammy Wegman, general manager of KECI, one of three Sinclair-owned NBC affiliates, told The Associated Press that the station would air the ad, because its executives “don’t turn away candidate ads.”Earlier this month, the liberal group Allied Progress succeeded in buying airtime for an ad on at least one Sinclair station, attacking the company’s coordinated “fake news” scripts and encouraging the Federal Communications Commission to deny Sinclair’s proposed acquisition of 40 additional TV stations. Sinclair, which says it now operates 193 TV stations in 89 markets, would control stations that reach more than 70 percent of the country’s homes if the acquisition wins approval.But Sinclair bookended the 30-second Allied Progress spot with 15-second disclaimers noting that the “ad was purchased by a group known for its liberal bias and we hope you won’t buy into the hysteria and hype.”Wegman did not immediately respond to a question on whether Sinclair stations would show Heenan’s ad with similar disclaimers.Since the 2016 election, Sinclair has joined Fox News and conservative talk radio as a media bogeyman for Democrats and liberals. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner revealed in December that the Trump campaign had brokered an agreement with Sinclair to provide greater access to Trump and the campaign if the company’s channels aired uninterrupted interviews with Trump. After Trump’s election, Sinclair hired former Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn as a political commentator. The company requires its local TV stations to air Epshteyn’s pro-Trump analysis nine times a week.What distinguishes Sinclair from the overtly conservative Fox News, however, is that it claims to be an objective local news provider. “All of us thought that local media was off limits,” Heenan told HuffPost in an interview.Heenan said the goal of his ad is to educate voters about the issue of corporate interference in media and give voice to concerns that some Sinclair employees have expressed. He decided not to mention Trump in the ad, because he believes that the issue would be the same if it were top-down corporate pressure on behalf of a Democrat. (Omitting Trump offers potential political benefits too: Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in 2016.)“Does it bother me that local newscasters here were forced to read these talking points? Yeah,” Heenan said. “But whether it was Donald Trump talking points or frankly, Barack Obama points, the thing that bothers me is corporate media forcing reporters to say political talking points instead of honest, straightforward news.”For Heenan, who successfully sued the country’s five largest banks for fraudulently foreclosing on Montana homeowners, the issue of corporate power in media fits nicely into his campaign themes. Heenan has made the corrupting influence of corporate money in politics a key plank of his campaign, claiming that the “system is rigged” against ordinary people.And in Gianforte, Heenan has the perfect foil for a debate over journalism and corporate influence. Gianforte won the Montana seat despite body-slamming a reporter the day before the special election. Frederick Smith, vice president and director of Sinclair, donated $1,000 to Gianforte’s campaign the day after the attack. Smith’s brother and fellow Sinclair owner, Robert, has donated over $10,000 to Gianforte in the past two years.Heenan is running on a platform of fighting for ordinary people against big corporations, including by championing a Medicare-for-all system in which the federal government would provide health insurance to all Americans. It’s one of several stances that won Heenan the endorsement of Justice Democrats, a group that backs left-wing candidates in congressional Democratic primaries.Heenan dismissed the idea that his support for Medicare-for-all could prove a political liability in a general election fight with Gianforte.He noted that Gianforte had lost his gubernatorial bid to Democrat Steve Bullock in the same election as Trump’s landslide, a fact that complicates the notion that Montana is a uniformly red state.And Heenan, who has sued health insurers on behalf of clients and managed health care-related personal bankruptcies, maintains that Medicare-for-all is an idea that has the capacity to appeal to Republican and independent voters as well.“What I see is a health care system set up to protect insurance company and pharmaceutical company profit margins instead of serving the people,” Heenan said. “Protecting those profits is not a conservative value.”“Everyone’s frustrated with the Affordable Care Act. The worst platform to run on in is, ‘Vote for me and I’ll tweak the ACA,’” he added.Asked whether he plans to vote for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to become House speaker, in the event that he is elected, Heenan said that it was unlikely.“I want to know what my choices are. I would say at this point no,” Heenan said. “I would hope to have someone who’s better reflective of what the folks in Montana want.”Heenan has a large fundraising lead over his three Democratic rivals: oil industry geologist-turned-land conservationist Grant Kier; former state Rep. Kathleen Williams; and former Department of Justice attorney Jared Pettinato.The Montana Democratic primary is scheduled for June 5."

Will it work now?",2018-04-21,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been going after Republicans for a “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8e0d02000002d00eb5291.jpeg?cache=P3VJL2rRMK&ops=crop_0_49_4795_3086%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats are looking back to the last time they took control of the House for lessons on what may work this year, and they’re starting to narrow in on a major theme: the Republican “culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”In 2006, Democrats won majorities in both the House and Senate, breaking the hold Republicans had on Congress for more than a decade. “In Iraq and here at home, Americans have made clear they are tired of the failures of the last six years,” Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada (D-Nev.), who became the majority leader in the new Congress, said at the time.There’s no doubt that deep dissatisfaction with then-President George W. Bush ― from his handling of Hurricane Katrina to the Iraq War ― created a tough atmosphere for Republicans. Getting out of Iraq, in particular, was a rallying cry for a growing progressive base that mobilized and organized in a way that’s similar to what has happened with the resistance movement on the left in the wake of President Donald Trump’s win. But in the House, a number of scandals besieged Republicans.“Choking your mistress. Touching little boys. Taking money from the Russians. Questionable business dealings. You name it, we had it. On and on, never ended,” said a GOP strategist who worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2006 and requested anonymity to speak openly. Democrats seized on these issues and created a “culture of corruption” refrain that another former NRCC operative said was extremely effective. In many ways, it pulled from what former Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich (R) did in the 1980s, when he portrayed Congress as a corrupt institution and hammered various internal scandals. It led to the downfall of the Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and eventually installed a Republican majority in the House with Gingrich as the new guy in charge. In 2006, the scandals dripped out bit by bit. Republicans watched them pile up, but still thought they might be able to keep the House ― until September when the Mark Foley scandal broke. The news that the GOP congressman from Florida had been sending sexually explicit text messages to teenage boys was the final nail in the coffin. “Literally overnight, everybody’s polling data went down 20 points. I’ve never seen anything like it since,” said one of the former NRCC aides. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is bringing back her 2006 refrain for this cycle. It first appeared in an April 6 statement calling for the resignation of Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, saying he was “a part of the Trump Administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.”It then popped up later that day in one of her press releases, and then three days later in a letter to her colleagues about their priorities in the coming months. In her weekly press conference the following day, she used the phrase twice, reminding reporters of that earlier election: “Some may recall that in 2005, 2006, one of our mantras during the campaign was to drain the swamp, to end the Republican culture of cronyism, corruption and incompetence, and that is exactly what we did. The president has misappropriated that term of art, ‘drain the swamp,’ and what does he do but have an administration that is wallowing in it.”Other Democrats say that the message has been talked about in strategy meetings as something they want to do more of. The targets in Congress aren’t as obvious as they were last time, with many of the men who were caught up in recent sexual harassment scandals quickly resigning on their own. But there’s plenty of material for them to work with in the Trump administration, including abuses that the Republican leadership in Congress has been unwilling to speak up against. Also expect Democrats to go after Republicans for how they, or their corporate donors, benefitted from the tax cut law. Of course, many of the Democrats’ gains were short-lived. In 2010, the next midterm cycle, Republicans swept back into office in dramatic fashion, buoyed by the momentum of the tea party. They retook the House and picked up seats in the Senate. In particular, the 2010 elections all but wiped out many of the more conservative Democrats who won in redder districts.“It was a great short-term strategy,” one of the former NRCC aides said. “It allowed them to pass Obamacare. But the joke was up four years later.”With Democrats competitive in more seats than usual this year, there’s concern that they could see their gains wiped out in cycles where the progressive base is less energized.But Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, notes that the expanded map this year is different than it was in 2006. Democrats then won a bunch of seats “that they had no business winning” because they were such long shots ― Republican districts that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had won in the presidential race in 2008.This year, however, Democrats are trying to pick up seats in districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Take Texas’ 7th Congressional District, for example. Republican Mitt Romney won it by 21 points in 2012, but Clinton then won it by two points last year. “Massive shifts in these districts,” Greenberg said. “I think those changes are enduring because this is built on an actual trend that is happening around college-educated voters becoming more Democratic, and they’re much more likely to live in these suburban areas. I don’t necessarily see a radical swing back to the norm like we did in 2010.” Karin Johanson, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 2006 cycle, and she said she had no idea this far out that they had a chance to retake the House. “The most anybody saw was that we were going to pick up some seats,” she said. “By March, we still didn’t know we could take the House back. It always seemed really really hard, the number of seats we’d need.” There also wasn’t the same grassroots energy that is present this time, Johanson said. Groups like MoveOn, Americans Against Escalation In Iraq and VoteVets mobilized people around the war and helped turn the tide of public opinion toward withdrawal. That movement sparked a generation of activists who are still in politics today. But online organizing was still relatively new and while effective, didn’t happen on the scale of 2018. Democratic candidates have said they’ve never seen anything like what’s happening in the resistance now. “There is no one single figurehead to take on the president, and that gives us an opportunity for new leadership to arise naturally from the grassroots standpoint,” said Jon Soltz, the co-founder of VoteVets. “That’s the sort of momentum you’re seeing.”But this time, Republicans have more warning signs, which is helping them prepare. Scott Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin, has urged his party to take all the recent Democratic wins in special elections seriously ― otherwise the party will be drowned in a blue wave in November.

He’d recently learned that his character Bernard Lowe, the reserved head of Westworld’s programming division and guardian of all robots contained within the futuristic Wild-West amusement park, was an android. Like the subjects he’d be monitoring throughout the series’ first season, Bernard was not, in fact, as human as fans had been led to believe. Rather, he’d been designed by Westworld mastermind Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) and modeled to appear like his late business partner, Arnold Weber.This colorful secret informed every morsel of Wright’s performance in Season 1, unbeknownst to his colleagues. In an early scene with Evan Rachel Wood, who plays Westworld’s oldest robotic host, Dolores Abernathy, for example, a suited-up Wright calmly asks her, “Do you remember our last conversation, Dolores?” She looks at him sweetly, responding, “Yes, of course.” At the time, Wood assumed this was a typical programming exchange between her character and Bernard. By the end of the season, however, the actress realized she’d been acting across multiple timelines ― that Wright had at times been playing Bernard and at other times Arnold. Slight shifts in Wright’s personality and wardrobe, and each scene’s setting, artfully camouflaged the reveal. “No one knew until they got the script of the seventh episode, and then texts were flying my way,” a bearded Wright told me during the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, earlier this year. “People had their wigs blown off that I held this from them for the many months that we were working on it.”“I texted him, ’You! You! How did you do that? How did you keep that from everyone?’” co-star Luke Hemsworth, who plays security officer Ashley Stubbs, expressively told me. “There are all these little cookies and Easter eggs where you go, ‘Oh, that’s what that is’ or ‘That’s why Jeffrey’s doing that!’ ... There’s not a gesture or an eye movement that doesn’t make sense when you go back and watch it again.” “I’d been working with Jeffrey for half a season and I find this out, and I’m like, ‘Did you know?!’” Wood reiterated. “You find out these people who you love, who you work with every day, are holding these secrets from you!” Wright is good at stoking mystery. Before I met him, I associated the actor with the broody, bookish characters he’s played on TV and film ― like Bernard, who lives in suit vests and laboratories. On the day of our interview, Wright was nothing like Bernard. He was dressed casually in a baseball cap and unzipped jacket, puffing from a vape pen in between laughs. We’d just escaped the snow-covered sidewalks of Park City and landed comfortably inside a pop-up vodka lounge, where he was smirking at the thought of his colleagues’ “Bernarnold” ignorance. As we sat across from each other, he took his time crafting answers to my questions, hitting each beat with a sort of temperate ease. Off-screen, it was easy to see why he’s HBO’s go-to guy, the kind of player who can pop in and out of any thematic narrative, molding himself into an array of dense supporting characters. “Westworld” is Wright’s sixth project with the premium cable juggernaut, which has become the artist’s de facto television home. He first appeared on the network as Martin Luther King Jr. in 2002’s “Boycott,” which won a Peabody Award “for refusing to allow history to slip into the past.” Since then, HBO has refused to let Wright out of its clutches. Over the past 16 years, he’s starred in the “Angels in America” adaptation (2003), the R&B-fueled “Lackawanna Blues” (2005), the Prohibition-era drama series “Boardwalk Empire” (2013) and the Anita Hill biopic “Confirmation” (2016). “He’s a world-class actor,” HBO Programming Chief Casey Bloys said. “Just on our network alone he’s played MLK, he’s played a gangster and he’s played an empathetic robot. I don’t know many actors who would be able to pull that range, not only of characters but also of tones of shows and movies. He brings this depth and humanity to his characters, and I think that’s why we continue to go back to him and why he’s so in demand.”Now he’s the glue holding “Westworld” together. And maybe, after all this time, HBO, too. On screen, Wright is the kind of performer who captures your gaze the minute he enters a frame, his deep, gravelly voice entrancing viewers into a meditative-like state. His affectations are subtle yet deliberate, like the creaking of an old wooden floor in a suspenseful thriller. Wright is, as Bloys and others have said, a first-rate actor.“Jeffrey has this real intensity,” his “Angels in America” co-star Mary-Louise Parker told me. “I have not talked to him about it, but I feel like it’s largely inspired by his intellect. And he’s not putting it on. He doesn’t come in with a whole lot of need, which is really,” Parker paused, gathering her words, “I don’t know, it’s kind of hot,” she giggled over the phone. “He’s a super sexy guy, obviously, but you don’t feel like he needs a lot from you, and he doesn’t. He doesn’t. But he has a bucket-load to offer both from his life experience and from his ideas.” That sex appeal might be hard to comprehend if you’re a fan of the Jeffrey Wright who’s played Bill Murray’s mystery-obsessed neighbor in “Broken Flowers,” electricity wiz Beetee in “The Hunger Games” franchise or Bond’s CIA operative pal Felix Leiter in “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace.” The beauty of Wright, though, is his chameleon-like qualities, which allow him to be cast as a nerd in one project and a well-worn prison inmate in another. It’s why, according to him, Wright no longer auditions for parts.“I look at it this way: I’ve been doing this for 30 years now. If a director can’t figure out what they might get from me or whether he or she wants to work with me based on what I’ve done, then I can’t tell them anything more than what they don’t know already.”Another thing I learned about Wright during our Park City encounter: He’s a certified jock. He played lacrosse in college (there’s even a U.S. Lacrosse Magazine story to his name), surfs often (with a Hemsworth brother, no less) and does what most celebrities are too busy red-carpeting to do: skis when he’s in Utah.“I skied yesterday,” he told me, “with a woman who lives out here who’s a stunt woman on ‘Westworld’ ... she dragged me across the mountain like a rag doll.” Wright went on to bemoan his 52-year-old knee and praise his ski partner’s ability to eviscerate the slopes, but a quick glance at Wright’s Instagram proves his deprecation is another element of illusion.“It was a big surprise to me that he surfed,” Luke Hemsworth said, “but then I got to know him and learned he used to be a big skater. He’s like a 12-year-old grommet when he’s in the surf. He’s so amped and wants to go surfing every single day, whether it’s big, small, wind sideways ― it’s an infectious energy.”Wright was at Sundance for the premiere of his film “Monster,” in which he plays the father of a teen named Steve Harmon (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), who’s wrongfully accused of a deadly crime in a Harlem bodega. The film immediately hit home for Wright, “as the father of a 16-year-old brown-skinned boy in New York City, in America.” The actor, whom Parker calls “a great father,” has two children with his ex-wife, British actress Carmen Ejogo ― son Elijah and daughter Juno. Their home base is Brooklyn, New York. “When we shot the film, there was what seemed like a much more productive conversation around policing and police-community relationships or justice reform or bipartisan conversation, so it was timely. But I think it’s even more urgent now, because that conversation has been overshadowed by retrogressive political thinking and action, particularly through the [Department of Justice] and the attorney general,” he said. Wright is comfortable speaking about the current administration. He grew up in Washington, D.C., in the 1960s and ’70s with a mother who served as a lawyer for U.S. customs for 30-plus years. (His father died when Wright was a young child.) “Her responsibility at headquarters was processing and assigning penalties to certain cases. If I’m not mistaken, she actually was the first black woman and second or third overall woman working for the U.S. Customs Service,” Wright explained during a phone call earlier this month. He happened to be with his mother at the time of our follow-up chat. He spent many hours in the hallways of her office, he recalled, doing homework and waiting for her shift to end. He became familiar with the inner workings of a government, one that he said functioned far differently than the oft-lambasted administration of today.“The conversation around the nature of those who work in government has been so poisoned of late by bad-acting politicians who are actually the ones who are far more likely to be corrupt and corrupted than those who make it their life’s work to serve the government of the United States,” he explained. “I’m not saying that across the board, but it was my experience growing up.”Wright was a staunch supporter of Barack Obama, and he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. So one doesn’t have to assume what he and his mother think of the current president.“I can tell you this, having been in law enforcement and within the federal government for all those years, [my mom’s] antennas have been up for many, many months,” he stated. “The more we learn, the more, in my case, it seems Mom is often right.”For a long time, Wright assumed he’d venture into politics, too. Theater, however, became a childhood fixation more interesting than the outside of his mom’s office.“My mom used to take me to the theater to see the tours that would come through D.C., and I loved it. I loved it,” Wright remembered. “I was absolutely enthralled by the theater and by that world.“I think that informed me later, but I was afraid, in some ways, to act on it until it was too late and I couldn’t resist anymore.” At Amherst College, Wright majored in political science and organized rallies against apartheid in South Africa. But by his third year, he’d joined a theater group. After graduating with his bachelor’s degree, Wright earned a scholarship to attend the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. He dropped out after two months, but not for lack of interest. He simply realized he didn’t need a teacher to tell him what he already knew.“I took a class in college... I think we were reading some short Chekhov plays, and I knew the first day of the class that I was going to be an actor. It was just the bizarrest thing, but it just felt like home.” The project that would become the spur of Wright’s career landed in his lap a few years later. After working in theater “to build an understanding of the craft,” he was cast in the 1993 stage production of Tony Kushner’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “Angels in America” as charming nurse Norman “Belize” Arriaga and Mr. Lies. Wright seared onstage. Even then, he knew it was a role that would change the course of his life.“It was the ideal work for me. It was the work that I think I aspire to do and that was work that was timely and smart, that was topical and fierce, and deeply, unabashedly political. So it was the merger of these two seemingly competing interests that I’d had growing up: theater and politics.“It was also pretty damn good,” he added with a laugh. The complex, allegorical show about AIDS and gay culture in America during the Reagan administration is back on Broadway today, with stars Andrew Garfield, Nathan Lane, Denise Gough and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, among others. Wright has yet to see it, but he’s looking forward to catching the two-part production in a different light. “I perceived the play, up until very recently, as being almost archival,” he said. “But it has perhaps as great a resonance now as it did 25 years ago when we first performed it on Broadway, and that speaks to two things: It speaks to the power of Tony’s writing and his mind, but it also speaks to the unfortunate nature of the political climate that we currently find ourselves in.” Although Wright remains unaware of any criticism lobbed at the play back in ’93, he understood even then that the subject matter could incite opposition. “As far as the politics [of the play] go, yeah, I’m sure there were some conservatives on the right who took issue with it. I hope they did, because it was definitely right to the jaw of the complacency and absence of empathy that the Reagan administration and conservatives applied to his response to Americans who were dying at an alarming rate from this horrible disease,” he said. “What I remember is being onstage at the curtain call, taking a bow with my fellow cast mates and feeling this response from people in the audience. I remember clearly on many nights standing there and thinking to myself that I was exactly where I was supposed to be in my life … and it was perfection. So, any criticism, any resistance meant nothing to me because we were doing what we were to be doing, and I didn’t give a shit what anybody had to say about it. “Wright went on to win the Tony Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Play and in 2003 reprised the role of Belize in Mike Nichols’ HBO adaptation. The HBO show, co-starring Parker, Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Patrick Wilson and Emma Thompson, earned Wright an Emmy for Best Supporting Actor.The miniseries aired a year before Bloys joined HBO, first as the director of development for independent productions. “It’s one of the reasons why I and a lot of people wanted to work here,” Bloys said of Wright’s performance in “Angels in America,” to be a part of “that sort of groundbreaking television.”“When I think back on the work that I’ve been able to do and the work in my career of the highest quality, a huge portion of that has been on HBO,” Wright told me. “That didn’t happen by accident.”No, it makes sense. The type of acting he sought to do ― “timely and smart … topical and fierce … deeply, unabashedly political” ― required the kind of high-altitude budget and cable chutzpah HBO was willing to throw behind projects. But HBO profited, too. When it came time to cast recent tentpole programming ― first the lavish period piece “Boardwalk Empire” and then the hopeful “Game of Thrones” replacement, “Westworld” ― the network turned to one of its most valuable players. If anyone was going to carry the wildly expensive, $100 million series to success, it’d be Wright.And the actor was eager to do it. He’d keep the show’s secrets in exchange for the opportunity to work alongside Wood, Hopkins and Thandie Newton. “It’s,” he paused, inhaling his e-cigarette, “deeply gratifying stuff.... It’s grueling, brutal. It’s intensely challenging, complicated but alive and fresh, and exists on the horizon of things that I have done in the past. So it’s really where I want to be right now.” Back in January, Wright had just wrapped the “seriously ambitious” six-month shoot for “Westworld” Season 2, which he said was equivalent to filming six feature-length films. The days were long, the content intricate and the schedule unrelenting. At times, he said, the production team had four units shooting at once (“on average we have two units shooting at once”), barrelling their way through 15- and 16-hour days (“sometimes 19- to 20-hour days”).“We’re really trying to expand what’s possible in this type of storytelling, doing it on a scale that’s epic and all on film,” Wright said. “If anyone has the impression that it’s a luxurious, glamorous process that goes into putting these things together, they’re wildly mistaken.”The show’s subject matter alone would scare some performers off. Here we have a futuristic theme park that functions as a source of expensive entertainment for guests who want to escape the real world and perhaps kill, befriend or romance a couple of robots ― robots who are reaching levels of self-realization. There are graphic shootouts, metaphorical mindfucks, and, of course, HBO’s typical quota of nudity. It’s thrilling yet complicated, confusing yet enlightening. Wood describes “Westworld” as “intense and violent” but capable of displaying these “incredible moments of humanity.” It’s those moments of humanity ― the show’s ability to be a “meditation on many things” ― that keep Wright coming back. In fact, according to Wood, Wright describes their scenes as “dual meditation,” in which they embrace the rhythm and the tone of the content ― content that, if he had to distill it down to its essence, is about “personal self-examination. It’s about personal awareness. It’s about our relationship to freedom or to restriction.” Season 2 will certainly tackle this idea of freedom and what it means to discover your personal potential. When we last left Westworld, the robots had revolted and were out for blood. In new episodes, Bernard continues to struggle with his dual identity while Dolores rallies her fellow androids for revolution. As Wood explained, “I had some [secrets] of my own this season, and the tables have turned for Jeffrey.” “In some ways, the first season was really the table of contents — you understand who, what, where, when, when and when,” Wright said. “But the second season makes the first season look like a kitchen drama,” he added, letting out a hearty laugh.Don’t be fooled: There’s much more to Wright than prestige TV. This year, in possibly his first leading film role since playing American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1996’s “Basquiat,” Wright stars in “O.G.” as maximum-security inmate Louis, who, 24 years after committing a violent crime as a young man, finds himself on the cusp of release. His involvement with a new prisoner weeks before his departure, however, stirs up some unneeded trouble for the remorseful offender. The film, directed by Madeleine Sackler, will make its debut at this month’s Tribeca Film Festival. Wright is also set to appear in the highly anticipated film adaptation of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch as Hobie alongside the likes of Nicole Kidman, Ansel Elgort, Luke Wilson and Sarah Paulson. (The John Crowley movie is expected to be released in October 2019.) Although he’s extremely comfortable as an ensemble character at the top of HBO’s roster, his star-turning role on “Westworld” has certainly opened new doors for Wright, doors he can’t even believe ever opened. “I remember I used to imagine the world beyond the stage – backstage ― in my little 7- or 8-year-old head,” Wright said. “Now, I realize I’ve been working as an actor for 30 years .... It’s gratifying stuff.”"

He’d recently learned that his character Bernard Lowe, the reserved head of Westworld’s programming division and guardian of all robots contained within the futuristic Wild-West amusement park, was an android. Like the subjects he’d be monitoring throughout the series’ first season, Bernard was not, in fact, as human as fans had been led to believe. Rather, he’d been designed by Westworld mastermind Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins) and modeled to appear like his late business partner, Arnold Weber.This colorful secret informed every morsel of Wright’s performance in Season 1, unbeknownst to his colleagues.

He’d keep the show’s secrets in exchange for the opportunity to work alongside Wood, Hopkins and Thandie Newton. “It’s,” he paused, inhaling his e-cigarette, “deeply gratifying stuff.... It’s grueling, brutal. It’s intensely challenging, complicated but alive and fresh, and exists on the horizon of things that I have done in the past. So it’s really where I want to be right now.” Back in January, Wright had just wrapped the “seriously ambitious” six-month shoot for “Westworld” Season 2, which he said was equivalent to filming six feature-length films. The days were long, the content intricate and the schedule unrelenting. At times, he said, the production team had four units shooting at once (“on average we have two units shooting at once”), barrelling their way through 15- and 16-hour days (“sometimes 19- to 20-hour days”).“We’re really trying to expand what’s possible in this type of storytelling, doing it on a scale that’s epic and all on film,” Wright said. “If anyone has the impression that it’s a luxurious, glamorous process that goes into putting these things together, they’re wildly mistaken.”The show’s subject matter alone would scare some performers off. Here we have a futuristic theme park that functions as a source of expensive entertainment for guests who want to escape the real world and perhaps kill, befriend or romance a couple of robots ― robots who are reaching levels of self-realization. There are graphic shootouts, metaphorical mindfucks, and, of course, HBO’s typical quota of nudity. It’s thrilling yet complicated, confusing yet enlightening. Wood describes “Westworld” as “intense and violent” but capable of displaying these “incredible moments of humanity.” It’s those moments of humanity ― the show’s ability to be a “meditation on many things” ― that keep Wright coming back. In fact, according to Wood, Wright describes their scenes as “dual meditation,” in which they embrace the rhythm and the tone of the content ― content that, if he had to distill it down to its essence, is about “personal self-examination. It’s about personal awareness. It’s about our relationship to freedom or to restriction.” Season 2 will certainly tackle this idea of freedom and what it means to discover your personal potential. When we last left Westworld, the robots had revolted and were out for blood. In new episodes, Bernard continues to struggle with his dual identity while Dolores rallies her fellow androids for revolution. As Wood explained, “I had some [secrets] of my own this season, and the tables have turned for Jeffrey.” “In some ways, the first season was really the table of contents — you understand who, what, where, when, when and when,” Wright said. “But the second season makes the first season look like a kitchen drama,” he added, letting out a hearty laugh.Don’t be fooled: There’s much more to Wright than prestige TV. This year, in possibly his first leading film role since playing American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1996’s “Basquiat,” Wright stars in “O.G.” as maximum-security inmate Louis, who, 24 years after committing a violent crime as a young man, finds himself on the cusp of release. His involvement with a new prisoner weeks before his departure, however, stirs up some unneeded trouble for the remorseful offender. The film, directed by Madeleine Sackler, will make its debut at this month’s Tribeca Film Festival. Wright is also set to appear in the highly anticipated film adaptation of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch as Hobie alongside the likes of Nicole Kidman, Ansel Elgort, Luke Wilson and Sarah Paulson. (The John Crowley movie is expected to be released in October 2019.) Although he’s extremely comfortable as an ensemble character at the top of HBO’s roster, his star-turning role on “Westworld” has certainly opened new doors for Wright, doors he can’t even believe ever opened. “I remember I used to imagine the world beyond the stage – backstage ― in my little 7- or 8-year-old head,” Wright said. “Now, I realize I’ve been working as an actor for 30 years .... It’s gratifying stuff.”"

The Korean Central News Agency said that the country was halting nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missile launches as of that day, according to The Associated Press. It also plans to close down a nuclear test site in the country’s northern region. In a statement published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un promised to “never use nuclear weapons” unless there is a nuclear “threat or provocation” to the country.“North Korea’s nuclear test center will be discarded in order to ensure the transparency of the suspension of the nuclear test,” the statement said.“The suspension of nuclear testing is an important process for global nuclear disarmament, and the DPRK will join international efforts and efforts to halt the nuclear test altogether.”President Donald Trump commended North Korea’s suspension of the tests in a tweet about 7 p.m. Friday EDT, calling it “very good news.”“North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site,” Trump wrote.The decision comes months after tensions between the Trump administration and North Korea reached historic heights. Trump and Kim taunted each other in an exchange of tweets and official statements as North Korea test-launched several intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Last year, Trump continually referred to Kim as “Rocket Man,” while the dictator described Trump as a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”In August, North Korea vowed to retaliate against the U.S. “thousands of times over” after the United Nations Security Council imposed new sanctions against the country. Shortly after, Trump promised North Korea “fire and fury like the world has never seen,” pushing North Korea to threaten Guam, where the U.S. has a major military presence, as a potential target.The threats continued into this year as Trump and Kim argued over which country’s nuclear weapons were more powerful.Tensions between North Korea and the U.S. have eased in recent months, beginning with the Winter Olympics hosted by South Korea in Pyeongchang. North Korean and South Korean athletes marched together holding a unified flag during the Opening Ceremony at the Games. Both countries, engaged in a war for over 60 years, used the event as an opportunity to re-establish dialogue.Now Kim is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a summit in the Demilitarized Zone next Friday. This summit would be only the third meeting of its kind between leaders of the two Koreas, according to The Guardian.Trump is also expected to meet with Kim in May or early June. He has said that he hoped to discuss denuclearizing North Korea with Kim but warned he would “respectfully” walk out of the meeting if they did not.“There’s a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearization in a complete and verifiable and irreversible way,” Trump said Wednesday. “It will be a great day for them. It will be a great day for the world.”Pyongyang has made significant advancements in its nuclear and missile development programs since Trump took office last year. In July, North Korea test-launched its first ICBM, then tested a second one more than three weeks later. In total, the country fired 23 missiles during 16 tests between February and December 2017, according to a CNN count.Some experts believe that the entire continental U.S. is now within those ICBM’s striking range.After meeting with North Korea in March, South Korean officials said that Kim was willing to hold talks with the U.S. about denuclearization and would suspend testing throughout negotiations.On Thursday, President Moon said North Korea has agreed to drop its long-held demand that the U.S. withdraw 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea as a condition for denuclearization.This article has been updated with background information on how tensions eased between the two countries."

In case the newspaper’s owners decide not to engage, the committee added that it is in the process of “preparing a class action lawsuit, as a second option, with assistance from the law firm that also represents the Guild.”Last week, the union released a comprehensive analysis of the newsroom’s pay structure, based upon data provided by the paper’s parent company, Tronc, as a part of the collective bargaining process. The union determined that “Tronc has underpaid women and journalists of color by thousands of dollars a year at the Los Angeles Times, suggesting systemic salary gaps by race and gender.”The release of the report led to widespread frustration within the newsroom.“People are angry, rightfully so,” said one newsroom source, who added that many employees felt “abused and taken advantage of.” Just who will end up fixing the newsroom’s pay structure ― if anyone ― remains unclear. In February, less than a month after the newsroom voted to form a union, Tronc agreed to sell the Times to health care mogul and billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong for $500 million. The sale has yet to be finalized. In a separate email sent Friday to Times Deputy Managing Editor Colin Crawford and cc’ed to Soon-Shiong, a union representative said that any ambiguity related to ownership was no excuse not to start discussions over the pay gaps. “If the Employer believes its authority to negotiate over this issue may be limited because of the impending sale, we stand ready to discuss such limitations when we meet,” the email read in part. A Tronc spokesperson said, “We at the Los Angeles Times strive to pay our employees fairly and competitively in the context of our dynamic media business. Many legitimate factors weigh into the salaries for our professional journalists, who each bring individualized talents, experiences and contributions to our news operations. We plan to evaluate the Guild’s assessment of generalized pay differences in light of the realities of our news operation.”Times Editor-in-Chief Jim Kirk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“The leadership of the LA Times, be it current owners or future, need to fix this as soon as possible,” said the newsroom source, adding, “This newsroom is yet again in revolt.”Here is the full email sent out to newsroom staffers on Friday: Colleagues,"

At the end of the shoot, she added, ” I think I was living on tomato soup and Marlboros.”Pound for pound, this had to be the most awkward moment of the night.Pfeiffer and “Scarface” stars Al Pacino and Steven Bauer, along with director Brian De Palma, had gathered for a 35th-anniversary screening of the movie."

(Reuters) - Colorado gun control activists rallied on Thursday near Columbine High School, calling for an end to gun violence one day before the 19th anniversary of the massacre there and a planned nationwide student walkout.The roughly 200 demonstrators who gathered in the Denver suburb of Littleton on a windy afternoon included a survivor of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 dead.The walkouts and drive to sign up voters are aimed at pressuring U.S. politicians to enact tighter restrictions on gun sales in the run-up to November’s mid-term congressional elections.“The idea is to unite and empower survivors, to stand together,” said Emmy Adams, an 18-year-old senior at nearby Golden High School.On April 20, 1999 two Columbine seniors killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher before committing suicide. Since then mass shootings have occurred with shocking frequency across the United States.Among the speakers at the “Vote for Our Lives” event were Parkland High School student Carlitos Rodriguez, who told the crowd that politicians would listen if their seats were at stake.Students from more than 2,600 schools and institutions are expected to walk out of class at 10 a.m. local time on Friday, organizers say.Activists asked students to wear orange, the official color of the campaign against gun violence, and observe a 13-second silence to honor the victims killed at Columbine.Columbine has not held classes on April 20 since the massacre, a district spokeswoman said, so there would be no walkout at the school. Students were encouraged to take part in community service.The latest national rally comes more than a month after tens of thousands of students from some 3,000 schools participated in the #ENOUGH National School Walkout to demand that lawmakers seek tighter gun control regulations.It also follows “March For Our Lives” rallies in cities across the United States on March 24 that were some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, with hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters taking to the streets to demand tighter gun laws.Dudley Brown, president of the Colorado-based National Association for Gun Rights, said the gun-control movement seeks to have the government take away rights, “precisely opposite of what the civil rights activists did in the 1960s.”“The main objective of these students is to ban firearms completely, and confiscate the firearms of law-abiding Americans,” Brown said. “We will oppose them at every step.”"

According to The Washington Post, Trayon White Sr., a member of the D.C. Council, and his staff made several unusual observations about the exhibitions. Then, White abruptly left, citing an event he had to attend, only to be spotted later on the sidewalk outside the museum. During his time inside, White pointed to an image of Nazi stormtroopers surrounding a woman who was wearing a sign that read: “I am a German girl and allowed myself to be defiled by a Jew.” He asked Lynn Williams, the museum’s director of leadership programs, if the stormtroopers were “protecting her.” When told that they were forcing her to march down a street in Norden, Germany, White offered that “marching is a form of protecting.”“I think they’re humiliating her,” Williams explained, per the Post.Read the full account of the unusual visit here.White made headlines last month when he posted a video of himself blaming “the Rothschilds” for late-winter snow in Washington. “Man, it just started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,” White said. “And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful.”The wealthy banking family has been the target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for generations. White later apologized, reached out to Jews United for Justice and vowed to “continue to be allies” with the Jewish community. On Thursday, he didn’t mention his visit to the museum on his social media accounts. However, he told the Post he planned to return.“This opportunity has given me the chance to meet a lot of great Jews, a lot of people. A lot of good Jews that I’ve never had the chance to meet before,” White said after a long silence. “It’s an awesome experience.” The rate of violence against the Jewish community in the United States has soared recently. Last year, anti-Semitic incidents jumped nearly 60 percent, with 1,986 cases over the course of the year, the Anti-Defamation League reported."
