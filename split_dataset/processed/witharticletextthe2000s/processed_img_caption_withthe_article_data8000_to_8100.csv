0,SPORTS,Progressive Groups Fight Vegas NFL Stadium After Nevada Senate Approves $750 Million Tax Subsidy,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/las-vegas-nfl-stadium-sheldon-adelson_us_57fd3b5ae4b07b9b8752e668,"Grassroots groups warn lawmakers ""there will be consequences.""",2016-10-13,"Groups of protesters have rallied outside the Nevada state capital in Carson City, while others have met with lawmakers in an effort to persuade them to vote against the stadium deal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Nevada state senate on Tuesday approved legislation that would put $750 million in taxpayer money toward the construction of a new Las Vegas football stadium ― the first step in giving away the largest public subsidy ever for an American pro sports facility.The stadium, with an overall proposed price tag of $1.9 billion, is meant to entice the NFL’s Oakland Raiders to move to the Sin City.The senate approved the legislation ― which raises taxes on hotel rooms in Las Vegas to fund the stadium ― over the opposition of progressive, libertarian and conservative groups that argued the subsidy is a giveaway to billionaire casino mogul and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $650 million to the project. Raiders owner Mark Davis would contribute $500 million under the current plan.Now those groups have vowed to fight the legislation as it moves to the state assembly, which could vote on the stadium bill as soon as Thursday night. “We’re working with Republicans and Democrats on that side to see if we can stop it,” said Bob Fulkerson, the state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, or PLAN. “We’re going to get the troops rallied and get everybody there in the next couple days. The assembly is the peoples’ house. I think we can give them a good run for the money on that side.”Despite good arguments against the stadium, they are up against steep odds, including Adelson and others in the casino industry, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), and an army of lobbyists Adelson unleashed in the state legislature this year in an attempt to push the project across the finish line. Sandoval, whose political action committee has received donations from Adelson in the past, called a special legislative session to get the stadium deal done. Aside from the typical (and widely discredited) arguments about stadiums having major economic impacts, Sandoval has argued that the arrival of the Raiders will create a “new era for tourism” in Las Vegas.“Now is the time to capitalize on the opportunity before us to invest in Nevada’s most foundational industry, tourism, by providing for the infrastructure and public safety needs of the 21st century,” Sandoval said in a statement when he called the special session. “As I have said before, we can and must usher in a new era for tourism in the Las Vegas market, while keeping our citizens and visitors safe, and ensuring our position as the global leader in entertainment and hospitality.”That argument gained even more traction in the legislature Monday, when Adelson’s fellow casino magnates and other stadium backers received “almost a full day,” Fulkerson said, to persuade senators to back the legislation.“We’ve been offered a gift here,” said former Las Vegas mayor Jan Jones Blackhurst, who is now an executive at Caesars. “We’ve been offered a gift that takes us from 45 million visitors, to 55, to 65 million visitors.”But there is almost no evidence the stadium or the Raiders would have that effect. The claims that stadium backers have made about tourism increases have “no basis in reality,” said Stanford economist Roger Noll, who has studied the tourism effects of stadiums and sports teams.“No NFL stadium in the country generates tourism for regular season games that accounts for more than a few percent of attendance,” Noll said in an email to The Huffington Post. “And people who do travel for games typically spend minimal time – one night at most.”That this is Las Vegas, a city already built on tourism, only lessens the potential impact.“Because Vegas already has a lot of tourism, a tiny percentage drop in other tourism would swamp any plausible estimate of the additional tourism due to the stadium,” Noll said. Groups like PLAN have raised other objections, and complained that they received comparably little time to make their case in front of state senators during an abbreviated session Tuesday morning.“The fix was in to jam this through with as little public scrutiny as possible,” Fulkerson said. “They knew the more the public got to look at this, the more they would vomit all over it.”Nevada, the groups argue, is already facing a potential $400 million budget deficit over the next two years. The existing hotel tax, meanwhile, is meant to help fund education, and raising it to fund the stadium could make it harder to find new revenue sources for gaps in education funding in the future. In addition, state taxpayers will be on the hook for any gaps in funding if the hotel tax fails to meet revenue projections ― a regular occurrence in stadium financing plans.“We have a woefully underfunded education system. We can’t build new schools ... because we don’t have the money for it,” said Annette Magnus, the executive director of Battle Born Progress, another progressive group fighting the deal. “We haven’t properly funded our mental health system since the ‘90s. They’re going to have to balance this budget, so they’re going to have to cut critical services. But they’re willing raise a tax to build a billionaire a stadium.”Nevada political observers have already predicted that the legislation will pass the state assembly during the special session. But at least on the progressive side, the groups that oppose the legislation are pulling out last-second stops in an effort to persuade Democratic assembly members to oppose the plan.“We’re letting them know, there will be consequences. There will be primaries,” Fulkerson said. “The left has a chance to take out some of the people who have betrayed us.”If they vote in favor of the stadium, he said, “We’re going to make sure it hurts them.”"

The comedian has reportedly signed a $40 million contract with Netflix for two stand-up specials, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The specials will mark Rock’s return to stand-up after an eight-year absence. The website reports the massive contract is rumored to be a record high for a stand-up comedian; $20 million per special is reportedly more than fellow comedians like Louis C.K., Jerry Seinfeld and Amy Schumer earn. THR says the first special will begin taping in 2017 and follow Rock on a world tour that is currently being planned. “Chris Rock is a beloved actor and director, and his remarkable stand-up makes him comic royalty. There is no one like him, and Netflix offers the global platform and creative freedom that will serve as a perfect home for someone with his incredible talent,” Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said in a statement to THR. According to THR, Netflix beat out various cable networks for the specials after going through a bidding war. Rock, who is seemingly ending his 20-year relationship with HBO, previously aired specials on the network, including “Bigger & Blacker” and “Never Scared.” “Increasingly, Netflix is becoming the preeminent destination for stand-up comedy, partnering with top-tier talent across a wide variety of styles and humor, enabling them to bring their fresh, distinctive and hilarious voices to our members in 190 countries around the world,” Lisa Nishimura, VP of original documentary and comedy at Netflix, told THR. “Our members discover every day that we truly offer something for every comedy fan, and the comedians we partner with understand the power of having a direct line to our ever-growing global audience. Coming on the heels of our first Emmy win in the category, now is the perfect time to take things to the next level with Chris Rock.”For his part, Rock told THR he’s excited to work with “all the good people at Netflix.” “I can’t wait to get back on stage,” he said.

4,MEDIA,BuzzFeed Will Team Up With Twitter On Election Night,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/buzzfeed-twitter-election-night_us_57fe874fe4b05eff5581128b,"Editor-in-chief Ben Smith hopes to reach political junkies and bring transparency to the ""mystical"" process of declaring election winners.",2016-10-13,BuzzFeed and Twitter are teaming up for election night broadcast. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe876c1a000067145b9047.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― As politics obsessives turn to Twitter on Election Night, BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith wants his site’s coverage to be right there with them. BuzzFeed and Twitter are teaming up for an Election Night broadcast streamed exclusively on the social media platform. “We’re going to be doing this live from inside the platform that is the beating heart of the election,” Smith told The Huffington Post.Twitter, which has been a second screen for viewers of major sports and politics events on television, is increasingly providing live video within its platform.The social media company has recently streamed NFL games, partnered with CBS for the summer Democratic and Republican conventions, and joined Bloomberg for the recent presidential debates. Its live stream of Sunday’s second Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton debate reached 3.2 million unique visitors, an estimated 70 percent of who were younger than 35.Twitter’s partnership with BuzzFeed gives the social platform an opportunity to capitalize on the high level of youth engagement it’s seen throughout the presidential race, with more than half of election-related tweets from users 25 and under. Adam Sharp, Twitter’s head of news, government, and elections, suggested the company may be the first screen for a mobile-first, cord-cutting audience. He said there’s “absolutely an appetite among these younger, really engaged” news and politics users for a combined experience of live video and conversation. On Election Night, for instance, Twitter’s audience could watch key speeches and discuss them without ever turning on CNN or Fox News. But Sharp acknowledged many Election Night Twitter users will be watching results live on television, with BuzzFeed’s broadcast serving as a second-screen experience offering “unique vibrancy and perspective.”In addition to BuzzFeed journalists sharing reporting and analysis through the night, Smith said he hopes to demystify how winners are called in key races. Smith said television anchors still announce decisions as if they require “mystical, special knowledge ― like tablets coming down from on high.” Yet he said there’s “intense, sophisticated conversation among analysts” in real-time on Twitter about the state of key races. BuzzFeed will work with Decision Desk HQ, a volunteer-run polling and data operation launched by Brandon Finnigan, a blogger from conservative site Aces of Spades. Smith described Decision Desk HQ as “America’s fairest new election night vote counter” in a 2014 profile of the group. He wrote how Finnigan and his growing team were disrupting the Election Night model in which major networks and The Associated Press have traditionally announced the winners.Smith said there “ought to be a very transparent conversation, where these calls are coming from and why.” Sharp noted how Decision Desk HQ volunteers brought primary election viewers into the process into how they counted precincts using live-streaming app Periscope. “This is not going to be your grandparents election night broadcast,” Sharp added. Smith suggested BuzzFeed’s partnership with Twitter would differ greatly from the manner in which television networks graft elements of social media onto otherwise traditional broadcasts. “Cable news is largely just people reading tweets,” he said. “One of the opportunities of Twitter, you don’t have to pretend it’s 1976,” Smith added. “It’s an open conversation.”"
5,POLITICS,Trump Debuts 3-Part Defense Against Sexual Abuse Allegations,Christina Wilkie,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-harassment-excuses_us_57fff345e4b0162c043afeba,Expect to see a lot more of this before Election Day.,2016-10-13,John Casablancas and Donald Trump were both present at the 1996 dinner where Lisa Boyne said she felt violated by Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fff73a170000c316acbd41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump on Thursday addressed the barrage of new allegations that he engaged in sexually aggressive and inappropriate conduct in a supremely Trump way: First, he went out of his way to blame anyone but himself; then he attacked the alleged victims; and finally, he recast himself as a martyr. Speaking at a rally in West Palm Beach, Florida, the GOP presidential nominee began by lashing out at The New York Times. On Wednesday, the newspaper published an article in which two women accused Trump of groping them. “These vicious claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false,” Trump said. “These claims are all fabricated, they’re pure fiction and they’re outright lies.”A global conspiracy led by his Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, helped perpetuate these lies, Trump claimed. “With control over our government at stake, and trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign,” Trump said. “And the most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press.” As a candidate, Trump has held that the media is secretly plotting against him ― a claim that sounds bizarre at times, coming from a reality TV star who has avidly courted press coverage his entire life. Trump told his supporters in Florida that the press was determined to elect Clinton “at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy. For them, it’s a war, and for them, nothing at all is out of bounds.” This appeared to be a not-so-subtle reference to The Washington Post publishing leaked audio from 2005 last week, in which Trump can be heard bragging about grabbing women’s genitals without their consent. In Trump’s view, the villain in that story seems to be the reporter who published his words.“Many of my friends and many political experts warned me that this campaign would be a journey to Hell, but they’re wrong,” he said. “It will be a journey to Heaven, because we will help so many people that are so desperately in need of help.”Not content to blame simply the media, the Clintons and the global elite for his collapsing poll numbers, Trump pivoted to attacking the integrity of the women who spoke out in the press. “These events never, ever happened, and the people that said them fully understand that. You take a look at these people,” Trump told the adoring crowd, “you study these people and you’ll understand, also.” As is typical for Trump, he offered no evidence as to what anyone might be able to tell from looking at either of the women who told their stories in The New York Times: Jessica Leeds, 74, or Rachel Crook, who is in her 30s.Trump went on to claim that he has “substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time, very soon.” He said a lawsuit against the paper would also mention another article written by the two reporters behind Thursday’s story ― earlier this year, they wrote a piece quoting a number of women talking about Trump behaving cruelly or inappropriately toward them. Hours after the publication of the new Times story, Trump’s lawyers sent the newspaper a letter demanding a retraction on the grounds that the piece damaged the GOP nominee’s reputation. The Times responded Thursday afternoon, effectively saying it would be impossible for it to have damaged Trump’s reputation, because he had already destroyed it himself. It’s unclear whether Trump’s lawyers actually plan to file a lawsuit in the coming weeks.The Gray Lady wasn’t Trump’s only target, however. He also viciously attacked Natasha Stoynoff, a writer for People magazine who alleged in an essay published Wednesday that Trump forced himself on her while she was interviewing him and his wife in 2005.“Trump shut the door behind us,” she wrote. “I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat.”On Thursday, Trump gave the rally crowd a series of excuses for why he couldn’t possibly have done what Stoynoff said he did. Firstly, Trump said, he had taken her to a public space with “people all over the place.” Secondly, he implied that Stoynoff wasn’t attractive enough for him to have groped. “Take a look, you take a look, look at her, look at her words, you tell me what you think,” he told his supporters. “I don’t think so. I don’t think so.” Trump then parroted a common method of discrediting women who report sexual harassment years after it happened. “Why wasn’t [the harassment] part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? Why didn’t they make it part of the story?” Trump asked the crowd, indicating it must not have happened if it hadn’t been reported at the time.“These people are horrible people. They’re horrible, horrible liars,” Trump said, before repeating all of his excuses in a stream-of-consciousness manner. “This is a room that everybody can see in. It’s got glass walls, can you believe this? Why wasn’t it in the story [12 years ago]? Biggest story of the year?”Having already blamed the perceived left-wing conspiracy against him and discredited his alleged victims, Trump needed only to make himself out to be a hero.  “They would stop at nothing to try to stop me, but I never knew, as bad as it would be, I never knew it would be this vile,” Trump told his fans. “Nevertheless, I take all of these slings and arrows gladly for you. I take them for our movement so we can have our country back. Our great civilization here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.”“I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive, it’s only a question of when. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve,” he continued. Even as the GOP nominee was busy playing the role of a savior in a Florida expo center, still more women were coming forward with stories of having been demeaned and sexually violated by him. Entrepreneur Lisa Boyne told The Huffington Post on Thursday about a dinner she attended with Trump in the mid-1990s.Trump asked for a group of women to parade before his table, then “stuck his head right underneath their skirts” and told everyone whether they were wearing underwear, and what their vaginas looked like, Boyne said.“It was the most offensive scene I’ve ever been a part of,” she said.HuffPost confirmed the events of the evening with three separate attendees. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, however, denied the account, saying, “Mr. Trump would never do that.” Need help?

The plot is reportedly inspired by the Republican candidate’s recent hot-mic scandal, which brought to light crude comments he made with currently suspended “Today Show” host Billy Bush.Trump has come under fire for his many offensive comments about women ― most recently, his suggestion that his celebrity allows him to “grab them by the p***y” whenever he wants. But, according to the episode description, Cole’s “SVU” politician character comes undone after “several women go public with damaging accusations.” It’s slated to air on Oct. 26, just a few days before the presidential election.The upcoming storyline comes at a difficult time for the show’s network, NBC, which also airs the “Today Show.” Trump’s reality TV show, “The Apprentice,” aired for years on the network, as well. Unsurprisingly, recent Associated Press report claims the “Apprentice” host was “lewd and sexist” behind the scenes.Sources told Variety that “Unstoppable” required a few extra looks from NBC higher-ups, who forced some adjustments to the script. The outlet also reports that the network waffled on the episode’s air date ― whether to schedule it before or after the election ― before finally settling on late October.“Law & Order: SVU” airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Let’s take back our country!”According to Politico, Pannebecker wrote an Amazon review in 2001 calling the former KKK leader’s autobiography, titled My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding, an “honest, fair and well documented book on the important and sensitive issue of race.” After reading the book, Pannebecker promised, one “will be able to discuss the issue of race without the fear of being labeled a racist because you will have the facts and the truth on your side.” The ADL had a different take in its own review: calling the book an affirmation of Duke’s “racist, anti-Semitic, sexist and homophobic roots.”Reached via phone on Wednesday, Pannebecker claimed he was the victim of a “political smear.”“I made a comment online 15 years ago that said people should read books and judge for themselves,” he said, adding that the “author of that book had denounced much of his past.”“Why don’t you stop digging up dirt, and stop trying to conform everybody to your political correctness,” he told HuffPost. “Stop trying to embarrass people, and cause guilt by association.”Pannebecker’s scheduled appearance last year at a House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing on so-called right-to-work laws also caused some controversy. The committee rescinded its invitation to Pannebecker to testify at the panel after it became aware of the Amazon review.It’s unclear whether the Trump campaign was aware of the review. A spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.Trump has attracted the support of a number of prominent white nationalists over the course of the campaign, including Duke, who used the GOP nominee’s name in a robocall urging people to vote for him in Louisiana’s senate race.HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

9,POLITICS,Another Dreamer Sues In Federal Court To Help Millions Get Expanded Immigration Relief,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-relief-lawsuit_us_57fe303de4b044be301636fe,A young undocumented student from Chicago hopes to achieve what the Supreme Court couldn't.,2016-10-12,José Lopez came to the United States when he was 3 and has called Chicago home since. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe35b01a00006e145b8e65.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A second undocumented college student has filed a lawsuit aimed at unblocking parts of a nationwide order that froze President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration last year.With the help of immigrant advocacy groups, José Lopez, 24, sued in federal court in Illinois on Wednesday with his sights set on limiting a Texas judge’s injunction in favor of 26 states that challenged the president’s deportation relief program.That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, but the justices deadlocked in the case and failed to reach the merits of the original order, leaving states and immigrants that support Obama’s plan under the effects of a single federal judge’s decree. The high court declined to revisit the case last week.“I hope it sets a precedent,” Lopez said of the lawsuit ahead of its filing. His parents brought him to the United States from Mexico when he was 4 and both would’ve been eligible for Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, the program that is now at a standstill in the courts. He’s called Chicago home for the past 21 years.Lopez’s legal action mirrors one filed in New York in August, where another young immigrant who was a recipient of Obama’s original deferred action program turned to the courts in hopes of undoing the part of the countrywide order affecting his home state.Melissa Keaney, a staff attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which is behind both lawsuits, said in an interview that the judge assigned to the New York case, in Brooklyn, noted at a recent hearing that he might not be keen to go as far as her client wanted.“The judge made it clear than he didn’t see his jurisdiction extending beyond New York or perhaps the Second Circuit,” she said, referring to the appeals court with authority over New York, Connecticut and Vermont.Keaney said that given the potential for a limited ruling, her organization and the National Immigrant Justice Center determined that a new lawsuit in a different region might be a way to chip away at the Texas order incrementally.In a sense, the New York and Illinois lawsuits both put the immigrant rights groups in the awkward position of suing the Obama administration, which supports the president’s vision of expanded relief for undocumented immigrants.“Certainly, even though they may agree and want to see the same thing happen, they don’t like to be sued,” Keaney said. She noted that the federal government filed a motion to dismiss the New York case and will likely do the same in Illinois. A key hearing in the former will take place next January.The main legal theory behind the cases is largely technical. In essence, Lopez’s lawsuit alleges that the Department of Homeland Security violated federal law when it revoked his three-year work authorization under Obama’s expanded version of deferred action, which the judge in Texas had halted a day earlier. The government then reissued Lopez a two-year work permit under Obama’s first Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is still in effect.As for the young man behind the case ― who works full-time, has two associate degrees and is hoping to attend the University of Illinois at Chicago soon ― he says his main desire is not to live life “in two-year increments.” He hopes this litigation will help people who support broader immigration relief not to live in fear of deportation.“I think it’s definitely important that we can come out of the shadows,” Lopez said. “The peace of mind that I received with DACA... that relief should come their way.”"

Jennings told the Houston Press that after he had decided to preside over the wedding, he heard from many people who told him it didn’t seem like something a Republican judge would do. “[T]hat’s when I started thinking, ‘Well maybe I’m not in the right party then,’” he told the news outlet. Jennings had been thinking about becoming a Democrat for some time, and he began to think about it more as his children ― who are in high school and college ― asked him how he could still identify as a Republican with everything going on in the party these days.Jennings announced his party switch on Saturday at a Democratic Party fundraising dinner, saying he feels like the party he knew has changed too much.“As the father of two daughters, and the son of a woman born before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, I am equally excited that we are about to elect our first woman president,” he said in his remarks. “Too many Republicans are not. I appreciate and embrace that we are a nation of immigrants, of individuals of many different faiths and ethnicities — all one people under our Constitution — all of whom are guaranteed equal protection under the law. Too many Republicans do not.”Jennings has been a justice on the court of appeals since 2000.This sort of party switch is exactly what worries many GOP strategists as they see their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, increasingly alienate moderate Republicans with things like bragging about sexual assault.

11,WOMEN,What You Learn When You Help Register Voters On A State's Deadline Day,Emma Gray and Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-you-learn-when-you-help-register-voters-on-a-states-deadline-day_us_57fd5e05e4b0d505a46add7d,It's actually pretty easy to let it slip through the cracks.,2016-10-12,A cute puppy definitely gets people excited about democracy -- woo!,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe4d29170000bc16acb659.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Are you registered to vote?” “Are you registered to vote?”This week, we spent hours asking hundreds of passersby in Philadelphia on the final day they were eligible to register to vote in Pennsylvania for the 2016 presidential election. We were there with Rock The Vote to help register students at the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University and the Community College of Philadelphia as part of a broader cross-brand effort with some of the biggest names in women’s media to encourage women to vote and make their voices heard. Young adults make up a significant chunk of the eligible voting population, but many of them just don’t get to the polls. In 2008, for example, roughly 20 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds said they didn’t vote because they simply missed the registration deadline. As journalists who sometimes cover politics, we spend a lot of time ― especially this election cycle ― writing about political engagement on the macro level, but we often do so from behind our laptops. We’ve been encouraging women all over the country to register to vote online, but just one day on the ground talking to potential voters gave us far greater insight into the small roadblocks that can add up to decreased engagement with our nation’s political process. Here’s what we learned:Even the simplest forms can be confusing. Registering to vote should be super easy. That was our whole sales pitch. It’s just one form! It will take two minutes! But even that one form left questions. Sure, you know your city and state ― but do you know your municipality off the top of your head? What about your county? If you access the form online without someone to speak to, you might find yourself wondering if you can re-register if you’ve been registered in another state. None of these things are impossible to figure out, of course, but registering to vote, like many things in this country, is definitely easiest for those who have the time to do the research and the luxury of having people around them who have been through the process themselves. Couldn’t we make this even simpler? Voter ID laws hurt people. It’s one thing to hear about how voter ID laws can disenfranchise voters; it’s another to see it play out in real time. We spoke to several people who weren’t sure if they could register to vote at all because they didn’t have an ID. (In Pennsylvania, you can actually use the last four digits of your social security number if you don’t have an ID, but if you don’t have someone there explaining that to you directly, it’s easy to see how you’d assume you’re just out of luck.) These laws vary state-to-state, and they disproportionately hurt black and Latino voters, low-income voters and women. Also, many students who live out of state don’t necessarily get a new license, so they’re not sure what that means for them in terms of where they vote, if they have to travel home or vote absentee, etc.It’s so easy to let voter registration slip through the cracks. When you’re running to class, or work, or shuttling your kid around, or meeting friends or doing any of those mundane things that make up daily life, it becomes tough to put even 10 minutes aside to fill out forms. And when voter registration deadlines are poorly publicized, it’s easy to miss your window altogether. “I’ll do it later,” one young woman told us as she rushed off to class, before realizing that in just under three hours, she’d be too late. Once she was informed of the evening deadline, she put her stuff down and filled out the form. The young people we encountered were overwhelming engaged with the political process, not apathetic about it. Of course we ran into a few people who were adamant that they’d rather sit out this election than cast a ballot, but most of the Philadelphians we spoke to ― the majority of whom were students ― were enthusiastic about voting. “Of course I am!” was a refrain we heard more than once from students when we asked if they were registered. “Well, I can’t let that a**hole win,” said another. (Inelegant language, perhaps, but the point stands.) For all the talk of millennials being too lazy or self-centered to tune into politics, we saw evidence on the ground that young people are a force to be reckoned with ... if they are given the chance.

(REUTERS/Gary Cameron/File Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fea7801b0000df1cef6a05.jpeg?cache=YTCyLXnqct&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wells Fargo & Co’s veteran chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf abruptly departed on Wednesday bowing to pressure over its sales tactics that has damaged the bank’s reputation and put Wall Street under renewed scrutiny.San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said Stumpf, 63, was retiring and would be replaced as chief executive by President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan, 56.The bank is splitting the role of chairman and CEO with Stephen Sanger, its lead director, becoming chairman.Stumpf leaves as Wells Fargo has a steep challenge in rebuilding its reputation and overhauling its hard-charging sales culture without gutting profits.The departure is a stunning reversal of fortune for Stumpf, who successfully navigated Wellsthrough the financial crisis and built it into the world’s most valuable bank with a focus on Main Street-style lending that was the envy of Wall Street.“I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside,” he said in a statement.The bank’s shares, which have slumped in the wake of the scandal, rose 2 percent in after-hours trading after the bank announced Stumpf’s exit.Sloan said his immediate priority was to restore trust in the bank.Long considered Stumpf’s successor, Sloan has spent most of his career at Wells working with corporations and institutional investors not the retail division, where the fraudulent accounts were opened.But as the former CFO, and president and COO of the company since November, he has been responsible for the entire company, including the retail bank at the heart of the scandal.Carrie Tolstedt, the woman who ran the retail division when the misconduct occurred, reported to him from November of last year. She left the bank last month.“They had three goals in replacing Stumpf: speed, integrity, and competence. If you want to move very fast and find someone intimately familiar with the business, you’ve got to hire an insider,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a business ethics and law professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.“If you want to hire someone with unimpeachable integrity, that’s going to take time to find,” Conti-Brown said.Sloan will preside over the bank’s third-quarter earnings on Friday.FALL FROM GRACEStumpf’s fall from grace started with a $185 million regulatory settlement between the bank, regulatory authorities and a Los Angeles prosecutor over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge.The misconduct, carried out by low-level branch staff to meet internal sales targets, shattered the bank’s folksy image and a raft of federal and state investigations followed.Stumpf was summoned before the U.S. Senate and faced calls for his resignation after repeatedly deferring responsibility to low level workers and decision-making authority to his board of directors. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called him a “gutless leader” who “should be criminally investigated.”A week after that hearing, he agreed to forgo $41 million in unvested stock awards.However, that was not enough and at a second hearing, some lawmakers called for the bank to be broken up.Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic lawmaker from New York, said Stumpf’s departure was only a first step.“Wells Fargo must commit to fully compensating all of their customers who were harmed by this fraud, and to comprehensively reforming their culture to ensure that this can never happen again,” she said in a statement.(Additional reporting by Sarah N.

The Y2 Analytics poll finds Trump tied with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton at 26 percent. Independent candidate Evan McMullin, who has been considered a long-shot candidate, trails close behind with 22 percent. Libertarian Gary Johnson takes 14 percent in the poll. Prior to the poll, Trump was averaging 45 percent and Clinton 27 percent in the largely Mormon state, according to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate of publicly released polls. The last time Utah voted for a Democratic candidate was in 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson won. This is the first and so far only poll released in Utah that was conducted after the Access Hollywood tape surfaced, and thus should be taken with some caution.But it could signify a real shift in the race. Earlier this week, Utah Republican leaders launched “an all-out revolt” against Trump, as one Brigham Young University professor called it. Several state officials, including Gov. Gary Herbert (R), rescinded their support for Trump, citing the crude video. Utah’s oldest daily newspaper, Deseret News, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, published an op-ed calling for Trump to drop out of the race just one day after the video surfaced. The paper’s editor and publisher clarified, however, that LDS church leaders had nothing to do with the editorial piece. On Wednesday, The Salt Lake Tribune officially endorsed Clinton, calling her “the only candidate who comes close to being qualified and fit for the post.” The HuffPost Pollster election forecast model predicts a 9 percent chance that Trump will win the presidential race and a 90.8 chance Clinton will. The Y2 Analytics poll surveyed 500 likely Utah voters and was conducted using live interviewers to landlines and cell phones on Oct. 10-11. This piece has been updated to include the Deseret News editorial.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

In light of the scandal surrounding the crude comments about women made by Bush and Donald Trump in 2005, her words are oddly prescient. “Billy, I know you’re a lot of fun. Very spontaneous. But the ‘Today’ show is under the ‘News’ division, so you may want to think before you speak,” Couric says in the video, which was part of a tribute to Bush’s 15 years on “Access Hollywood.” He started as a host of the morning show’s 9 a.m. slot in August.“Very sage advice,” Bush replies. Later, after thanking his family, his colleagues and NBC executives, he notes, “Everyone who leaves ‘Access Hollywood’ always regrets it. They all want to come back.”The host is now negotiating his exit from the “Today” show after just three months on the job in the wake of his part in the lewd video recording. In the tape, Bush is heard encouraging Trump’s despicable comments and adding a few of his own.How much NBC executives knew about Bush’s behavior problems is unknown; a TMZ report published Wednesday claimed that he often made sexist remarks about women in the newsroom and did not face consequences. But Couric’s warning certainly suggests Bush had a reputation for ill-advised words."
15,POLITICS,N.C. Authorities: No Evidence To Support Father's Claim Muslim Boy Was Assaulted On Bus (UPDATE),Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muslim-family-fled-america-islamophobia-usmani_us_57fd058fe4b0e655eab7aa3c,"Oh and by the way, his dad fights terrorism for a living.",2016-10-12,The Usmani family at Disney World earlier this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe48ee170000bc16acb647.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Oct. 16 ― The Cary Police Dept. and the Wake County School System say they have not found any evidence to corroborate Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani’s claim that his son was assaulted aboard a school bus on Oct. 7. “Our police department has been coordinating with the school system to uncover details related to this matter,” Town Manager Sean Stegall said in a statement. “At this time, nothing has been found, and no police report has been filed.” In a letter to parents with children at Weatherstone Elementary School, Principal Tim Chadwick wrote that information from an investigation “does not support an altercation.” He added, “No students who were interviewed witnessed an altercation. The bus driver did not witness an altercation. The child did not report to the bus driver any injury.” PREVIOUSLY:“I’m done with the U.S.,” Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani’s wife told him on Friday.Seeing her youngest son, just 7 years old, walk off the school bus bruised and battered that afternoon outside their apartment building in Cary, North Carolina, was the final straw. Little Abdul Aziz, a first-grader and the youngest child of Usmani and Binish Bhagwanee, was traumatized. He told his parents a classmate had tried to force him to eat food that wasn’t halal. When Abdul Aziz refused, five of his classmates ganged up on him, making fun of his name. They punched him in the face, kicked him in the stomach, and twisted his arm while calling him “Muslim” again and again, Usmani said.“He was born and raised [in the United States]. He was born in Florida. As American as you can think of. He likes Captain America. He wants to be president of the United States of America,” Usmani told The Huffington Post on Tuesday, speaking over Skype from Pakistan.Bhagwanee landed in Islamabad on Monday with their three sons. Usmani has an apartment there, and it’s where they all plan to live now, because America doesn’t feel safe. “It’s very heartbreaking and sad,” said Usmani, twice a Fulbright Scholar and an award-winning computer scientist who uses big data to save lives from terror attacks. “It’s not the America we know about, care about and want to live in,” he said. Usmani remembers his middle son, 8 years old, being very angry one day after being picked up from school. Apparently his classmates had told him his dad ― a Pakistani man with a beard ― was a terrorist.“He asked me if I was a terrorist,” Usmani recalled. After that, Bhagwanee asked him not to go to the school anymore, “just so my children would not face any discrimination because of my face.” There was the time Usmani’s eldest son, 14, saw a classmate bring a knife into school that his dad had bought in Colombia. When Usmani’s son brought a knife into school that his dad had bought in Pakistan, students called him “ISIS” and “terrorist.” The school went on lockdown and he was suspended for six months, Usmani said. He added that the experience was traumatic for his son, who’s been homeschooled ever since and now suffers from depression and anxiety.Earlier this year, there was the neighbor that constantly harassed them, once calling them “motherfuckers” and threatening Usmani’s wife. “He came to our apartment twice at midnight and at 2:00 AM, passing racial slurs, teaching us how to ‘behave’ and “’live in this country,’ mentioning Donald Trump and his desire to vote for him to kick us out of this country,” Usmani wrote in an email to the Cary Police Department in July. (That type of harassment from neighbors is sadly familiar to Muslims or people perceived to be Muslim, and has culminated in the murders of three people in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and one person in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the last two years.)The neighbor eventually moved, Usmani said, adding that the local police department was “really great” in handling the situation.In June, a man brandished a handgun at the mosque the Usmani family attends in nearby Fayetteville, telling parishioners there that was going to kill them and bury them behind the mosque. The man allegedly behind the threats, Iraq War veteran Russell Thomas Langford, also left packages of bacon outside the mosque, a common insult to Muslims, whose faith forbids them from eating pork. When police arrived and arrested Langford, they found multiple guns inside his truck along with 500 rounds of ammunition. While Usmani’s family wasn’t at the mosque that day, the event still left them shaken, he said. In September, the Fort Pierce, Florida mosque where Usmani says he used to attend Eid services when he was a student, was set on fire. The alleged arsonist, Joseph Screiber, had made anti-Muslim and pro-Trump Facebook posts in the months leading up to the attack. All that happened in just the last year.Over the course of that year, the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, proposed a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., called for the creation of a national database of Muslims, said that mosques should be surveilled and Muslims should be profiled, told an apocryphal story about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood, suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier wasn’t allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention because of her faith and said: “Islam hates us.”Anti-Muslim hate crimes have surged nationwide. A recent report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino, documented at least 260 hate crimes targeting Muslims in 2015 ― a nearly 80 percent rise from 2014 and the highest annual number of such crimes since 2001. So far in 2016, The Huffington Post has documented nearly 290 acts of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and political speech in the U.S. After Abdul Aziz walked off the school bus Friday, Usmani said he and Bhagwanee reported the incident to the school. Lisa Luten, a spokeswoman for Wake County Public School System, said Principal Tim Chadwick immediately launched an investigation into the alleged attack, but said that initial interviews with other students and the bus driver didn’t corroborate Abdul Aziz’s version of events. No students on the bus, nor the bus driver, reported seeing an altercation, Luten said. One student, however, did remember seeing “play-fighting” on the bus. Luten also said the Usmani family did not report that students made references to Islam, Muslims and Pakistan, as the Council on American-Islamic Relations said they did in a Monday press release.But in an email Usmani sent to Chadwick early Tuesday, he explained that he had talked to Abdul Aziz “in detail” about the alleged attack.“The kids who beat him up mentioned Muslims, makes fun of his name starts with Abdul and reference his preference of eating only certain (halal) food,” Usmani wrote. “My son is very traumatized and shocked as he has just celebrated his birthday with his classmates few days ago.”Luten, the spokeswoman, emphasized that the school’s investigation is ongoing and that the principal wants to interview the Usmani family. “The behavior alleged in this complaint is not tolerated in our schools,” Luten said. “We have policies that specifically prohibit bullying. Any incident that is brought to our attention is fully investigated.”Usmani said his family had planned on moving out of Cary anyway, perhaps to Berkeley, California, where his current employer is based. But after what happened to Abdul Aziz on the school bus, Bhagwanee decided it was time to go back to Pakistan. Usmani said there was an irony in having to get his two youngest sons ― both of whom were born in America and are U.S. citizens ― visas to get into Pakistan.And still more ironic, after a year of such anti-Muslim vitriol, is the award-winning work Usmani does to protect people from terror attacks around the world. Formerly the chief technology officer of the data company PredictifyMe, he’s used big data to help better understand who in Europe and the U.S. is vulnerable to being recruited by ISIS. And in a collaboration with the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, he’s developed software that models the damage of suicide bombings, in an effort to protect schools and other buildings in Pakistan, Sudan, Nigeria, and Syria from terror attacks.His 21-page resume lists two Fulbright scholarships, an Eisenhower fellowship, four degrees including a Ph.D., visiting professorships across the world, a slew of awards and links to profiles of his work in the Wall Street Journal, CNN and many other major news outlets.While his family stays in Islamabad, Usmani, because of his work, will have to split his time between Pakistan and the U.S., he said. He also said his family would consider moving back to the U.S. if Donald Trump loses the election next month. They would “absolutely” feel safer in the U.S. if Trump loses, Usmani said. That said, Pakistan hasn’t always been safe for the Usmani family either. In 2013, Usmani was part of a team that won the TiE StartUp Cup Pakistan, a business model competition organized by StartUp Cup USA with TiE and the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan. “On our way back from the competition, we got robbed,” Usmani wrote in an email to friends and colleagues at the time. “They were 9 Dacoits, they beat me up very badly, beat my wife and 10 years old son and took away all the cash, mobiles, laptop, camera, all debit/credit cards everything. So now I have a lazy eye, injured rib, and few less teeth.”Usmani told HuffPost he believes he and his family were attacked because of his counter-terror work. “I’m in a very interesting dilemma,” he said, noting that his work against ISIS and terrorists around the world makes him feel unsafe when he’s in Islamabad. But the Islamophobia in the U.S. has also made him concerned for his and his family’s well-being, he said.He added, “I guess I can’t live anywhere in world.”The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate."
16,WOMEN,Woman’s Mastectomy Tattoo Shows 'Cancer Doesn’t Always Leave The Last Mark',Alanna Vagianos,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womans-mastectomy-tattoo-shows-cancer-doesnt-always-leave-the-last-mark_us_57fe79b8e4b05eff5580ee89,Sue is a straight up badass 💪,2016-10-12,A photo after Cook's second preventative mastectomy in 2010. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe7c1c1b0000df1cef6907.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"”To me it is a thing of beauty and every morning when I see it ― it’s like it’s for the first time ― it puts a smile on my face.”That’s how 62-year-old breast cancer survivor Sue Cook described her badass mastectomy tattoo to The Huffington Post. When the London native was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008, her doctor told her she had about a 40 percent change of surviving another five years. She underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a single mastectomy, and in 2010 she had a second preventative mastectomy. Today, Cook is cancer-free. Eight years after her diagnosis, Cook shows off her breast cancer battle scars with a stunning tattoo that spans both her shoulders and stops right below her sternum. “After reaching my unexpected five-year remission I began reclaiming my body to show that cancer doesn’t always have to leave the last mark,” Cook told HuffPost. “I decided the tattoo would transform my scars into art. Now, every morning I can wake up to see a beautiful piece of body art.”Cook, the chief examiner for Foundation Art and Design at the University of the Arts in London, says she chose not to have reconstructive surgery because her body had been through so much. “I decided that I didn’t want to put my body (or mind) through an extensive process of reconstruction,” she said. “I had already lived through a big enough battle, now was the time to acknowledge that fight.”Undergoing reconstructive surgery after having a double mastectomy is a very personal decision. Cook said that for her she simply didn’t want to “deny the impact” that cancer had on her. The surgery itself can also be extremely invasive: “I didn’t want to re-arrange any other parts of my body,” Cook told HuffPost. “Taking a flap from my back with muscle and then implants to recreate what is no longer there was a step too far for me ― it wouldn’t be me as I am now.”Cook said the tattoo took a total of 30 hours to complete, but it was “worth every minute.” “During treatment you are told what to do, when to be still, to breathe in, what to take etc... The list goes on,” she said. “But this was me making a decision for myself about my body. It is empowering and gives me a feeling of strength.”While Cook said mastectomy tattoos aren’t for every survivor, she urged women to explore all of their options after breast cancer. “Listen to your heart, what do you want now? There is going to be the right solution for you ― if one doesn’t sit well with you or feel right, find another,” she said. “Above all don’t forget to find some way to celebrate and rejoice in your own victory. Cancer doesn’t always have to leave the last mark!” Amen, Sue. Cook is hosting an auction, “Curating For A Cure,” to raise money for Cancer Research UK. Find out more about the event here. "
17,POLITICS,On-Duty Texas Police Officers Wore Pro-Trump Hats. That's A Problem.,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-antonio-police-donald-trump_us_57fea9a7e4b0e8c198a5dfb0,"“You cannot take that position while in uniform,” said a San Antonio city councilman.",2016-10-12,"San Antonio police officers who wore ""Make America Great Again"" hats on the job will be disciplined, according to Police Chief William McManus.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57feacf01a00006e145b9119.jpeg?cache=hQ7ibgPXY3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of San Antonio police officers violated city policies when they donned “Make America Great Again” hats and posed for photos with Donald Trump on Tuesday. The Republican presidential nominee recently tweeted a video of the officers in hats bearing his campaign slogan. The footage shows Trump thanking them and some officers responding with a thumbs-up. Text at the bottom of the video reads, “We will make America safe and great again, together.”San Antonio city employees are prohibited from participating in political activity while on the job. Tess House, a civil rights lawyer in San Antonio, said the display was inappropriate. “They were acting within the scope of their employment. We’re talking about taxpayer money. They are on duty and abusing their position in order to take a stance and support a political candidate,” House told The Huffington Post. House is requesting a Justice Department investigation into the law enforcement agencies operating within the city ― specifically, the San Antonio Police Department and the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office.The officers’ display of support for Trump also worries Maria Garcia, a former deputy in the Bexar County Sheriff’s Department, since her grandchildren are black.“My granddaughter’s going to be driving because she’s 16 and it makes me afraid for her,” Garcia said.Trump, the self-proclaimed “law and order candidate,” has built up his campaign by peddling destructive racial stereotypes: He has claimed that Mexicans are “rapists,” that black people are murderers and living in extreme poverty, and that Muslims are terrorists who should be banned from entering the United States. Garcia was on the force for five years before leaving to become a school counselor, and she says it worries her to think the officers support Trump’s policies and uphold his beliefs.“It’s showing that they’re not gonna give [my grandchildren] a fair chance because anyone that follows him ― the stuff that comes out of his mouth ― it’s just upsetting,” she said. “As a police officer, you should be a role model. That’s not being a role model.” Community relations with police officers were already strained in San Antonio before the Trump hat incident. Sixty-three percent of the city’s population is Latino and 6 percent is black.Of the seven people killed by police in San Antonio so far this year, based on data from The Guardian, five were Latino or Hispanic, one was black and one was white.The San Antonio police union recently fought a new contract that would have given the police chief more power to punish officers for repeated misconduct. Union leaders wanted additional compensation for agreeing to new standards.In the end, officers got a raise but the contract passed without reforms ― meaning that all misconduct marks over two years old still cannot be used to justify discipline for new incidents, and that short suspensions still get reduced to simple reprimands after two years if officers do not appeal them. Black Lives Matter protesters rallied against the reform-free contract that ended up passing, prompting San Antonio Mayor Ivy Taylor to create the Council on Police-Community Relations.“These officers exercised poor judgment at a time when we’re trying to build bridges between community and police. These officers decided it was a good idea to pull a stunt,” said Rey Saldaña, a San Antonio city councilman who has worked to reform policing in the city. The Trump hat incident will only make resentment over the lack of police reform worse, Saldaña added. “That message, on top of this stunt, gives the community the sense that there is a loss of ... the ability of the city, or the ability of the community, to hold a police department accountable,” he said.Indeed, some community members were outraged that uniformed police officers would wear pro-Trump hats.“The actions of the SAPD officers while in uniform show the audacity to which they believe they can behave without repercussions,” said Mike Lowe, a San Antonio-based activist. “As easy as it was to don a hat representing a presidential candidate who has proven himself to be everything but presidential speaks to the heart of how police continue to carry out systemic oppression with impunity.”Police Chief William McManus said the officers who were involved in the photo will be disciplined.“I expect them to know better than to give the appearance of endorsing a candidate while on duty and in uniform, regardless of the political campaign or the candidate,” he said in a statement. Saldaña said officers should be “politics-blind to the people that they serve.” “It doesn’t matter if these folks were wearing a Hillary T-shirt or a Bernie Sanders hat. The fact that it was a Donald Trump hat does not change city policy,” he said. “You cannot take that position while in uniform.”UPDATE: Oct. 15: ― A second statement the police department released on Friday explains how the officers will be disciplined. Six supervisors who were present will receive a written reprimand, 17 officers will receive written counseling and all officers involved will undergo impartiality training. “As Chief of Police, I understand the concerns over this incident. Beyond violating Departmental and City policy, the officers used poor judgment,” McManus said. “San Antonio Police Officers have always and will always remain dedicated to professionally serving all citizens. We will continue to work tirelessly to remain a national model for police agencies across the country.”This story has been updated with more complete data from the Guardian.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The teachers union and students — who hadn’t been consulted about the authorities’ decision — organized protests to raise awareness, but these largely went unnoticed. By early November, Brazilian students boldly decided to occupy the Fernão Dias state school — a move replicated in 200 more schools across the state in the span of a week.“We won’t give up!” was the students’ official motto. They were forced to repeat it as they continually faced violent confrontations with local security forces.Following weeks of resilience, the movement succeeded in halting the state’s scheme to shut down 94 public schools and pushed Education Secretary Herman Voorwald out of his job.Three Brazilian researchers ― Marcio Ribeiro, Antonia Malta Campos and Jonas Medeiros ― conducted interviews with the protesting teens and visited a number of the occupied schools. Their work culminated in a book, titled Escolas de Luta (Combative Schools), published earlier this month. The book, which documents the student protests, is interspersed with images shot by Brazilian photojournalism collectives.Scroll down to see some of the photos.

19,ENTERTAINMENT,Ally Sheedy Knows You Still Think Of Her As An '80s Basket Case,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ally-sheedy-little-sister_us_57fd2011e4b0e655eab7d802,"With ""Little Sister,"" the ""Breakfast Club"" actress lands her best role in years.",2016-10-12,"Peter Hedges, Ally Sheedy and Addison Timlin star in a scene from ""Little Sister.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fd56261a000067145b8c35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ally Sheedy doesn’t mind if you still think of her as the basket case from “The Breakfast Club.” But maybe we can do her a solid and move on. For now, let’s think of Ally Sheedy as the weed-smoking, somewhat unstable mother of a former goth teen (Addison Timlin) who left home to become a nun. That’s her character’s biography in “Little Sister,” a charming new indie drama directed by Zach Clark (”White Reindeer”). Thanks to “WarGames,” “The Breakfast Club,” “St. Elmo’s Fire” and “Short Circuit,” Sheedy, 54, is inextricably linked to 1980s Hollywood. Most of Sheedy’s post-’80s résumé comprises independent projects that have struggled to find mainstream attention. In the late ‘90s, stuck in professional limbo, Sheedy proved herself as a proverbial Serious Actress, starring in the psychosexual festival drama “High Art” and the title role in an Off Broadway production of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” an intense experience that prompted bouts of crippling stage fright. That pair of gigs didn’t return Sheedy to the top of Hollywood’s A-list, partly because she then opted not to work much outside of New York City, where her child, who has since come out as transgender, was struggling through middle school. No matter: “Little Sister,” which opens in limited release on Friday, is one of the actress’ finest films, a sweet dysfunctional-family gem that taps into the off-center characters to which Sheedy is attracted.In June, when the movie premiered at the BAMcinemaFest in Brooklyn, I sat down with Sheedy to reflect on her 35-year career, what she learned from “Hedwig” and the “mixed blessings” of remaining an ‘80s queen.There’s no assurance that an indie film like “Little Sister” will find the audience it deserves. Having done a lot of small projects, are you used to having no idea whether your work will find a shelf life?It’s not weird for me. I’ve been in some really good ones that didn’t sell, and then some middling ones that did, and I’ve been in some that have done well and some that you never see. So the biggest first part of it is, “What is this character, and, just for myself as an actor, what am I going to get to do?” And then after that, it’s going to have its own life and there’s nothing I can do about it. So, as an actor going through the trajectory of what I can do and developing my career, I’d rather work my way through the part and figure out the scene and have it be some kind of challenge. And if it makes it out into the world, whatever. I will be different at the end of shooting it than I was if I hadn’t done it. You’re often labeled as a queen of the ‘80s. How have you moved forward from that, knowing that your livelihood is attached to people’s nostalgic perceptions of you?It’s a mixed blessing, everything that happened in the ‘80s. And in the ‘90s, there was TV stuff here and there ― there was a lot of stuff coming in. But I guess when I was about 27, something started to settle in me where I was thinking, “I want to think about the long-term. I’m going to be doing this for my entire life. Who do I admire? Gena Rowlands.” I was looking at actors like that. Juliette Binoche and so many French actresses have this long life, and I was in Hollywood thinking, “How do I transform what’s happening with me now into that? How am I gonna be that?” And I realized that was what was going to drive me. I was going to be able to continue.All of the “Breakfast Club” stuff was happening, and I could just feel this bizarre shift inside of me. What was it that I really wanted? What I really wanted was to not be just this teen-movie star. What I wanted was to actually be able to do this for my whole life and be able to continue developing as an actor and changing through my whole life. That shifted the universe for me.I’m sure you’re constantly asked about “The Breakfast Club.” Is it encouraging to know you’ve made a dent that people remember, or is it stifling to know that’s still what comes to mind when people think of your name?No, listen, it’s the calling card that I have with people who are my age and kids who are still seeing the movies. The movie was this incredible blessing as far as having some kind of impact with my work in a way that I’m actually quite proud of. I can’t imagine what my life would have been like without it because it’s informed the experience of my life. I don’t find it suffocating, and I also don’t feel particularly hooked into it. I created the life that I have, and the priorities and focus of my life are not actually on movies. I don’t feel that I’m leashed to it. I think it’s this really cool, amazing thing that happened, and sometimes it leads to other great things. Zach Clark had this tiny movie, but somehow or other, they thought of me for it. Why did they think of me? Because they already knew who I was. If I hadn’t done all this stuff, you never know what might cross your path. It was exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.You earned rave reviews for “High Art” at Sundance, and it seemed like you might be on the cusp of a resurgence. The movie made hardly any money at the box office, but your performance got a lot of critical attention and some awards buzz. What did and what didn’t open up to you after “High Art”? “High Art” was such a weird bird. I think the perception that I actually was an actor of some kind of weight changed from that part. Suddenly there was this other dimension ― it’s not just teen movies. It was a role that came along that was the perfect role for me at the time. There was a shift in how I could feel and how I was perceived. That role was where I was. Then, after that, I took a lot of chances. I did “Hedwig” ― that was a whole thing. It’s a role of the dice. A lot of the work came to me, but the work that came to me was not the kind of stuff that kept advancing my career forward.Because it was small?No, it was a mixture ― there was television stuff, and there was nothing that came to me that made my career go up and to another level. It was sort of like continual, steady work, but also, right after that movie, it’s always, “What was the last thing you did?” So there certainly was this perception of me as being this trouble-y, problematic kind of person who was no longer, “Oh, she could maybe play the girl-next-door role.” Instead, “She has to play the dark character,” which I prefer. But it wasn’t like leading-lady roles started coming to me because of “High Art.” It was the opposite. And then it’s just been the roads that continued out from there. I’ve just taken some pretty big chances, I think, in my career, and it’s led me crazy places.You played Hedwig in 1998. Our understanding of gender has evolved greatly since then. I don’t think anyone would cast a cisgender woman in the role today.It wasn’t received well then either. I understand now that the gender question was a big question. To have an actual woman playing Hedwig, who’s supposed to be a transgender man to woman, I understand now why that would have been something that would have caused some problems for certain people. [Editor’s note: Hedwig is genderqueer.] My kid is trans, so I’m looking at gender through an entirely different angle now, so I can understand now what the problem with that would have been, in a way that I didn’t understand back then.You missed a handful of shows during your stint as Hedwig, and there were reports that stage fright got the best of you. Was the reaction to a woman taking the part why it didn’t go over swimmingly?I think there were a couple things. I think that my interpretation of that part, it worked for me, and the person who was always my big supporter was [Stephen Trask, who wrote the music and lyrics]. He was really on board with me. But I’m not a singer ― John is. I think when I was starting to do it, I didn’t realize that was going to be as big of a problem as it ended up being.It’s a two-part show. There are only certain people, like Michael Cerveris and obviously Neil Patrick Harris, who can kick the crap out of that monologue, which is really heavy, and be able to handle the songs. And John Mitchell, of course, could do it. For me, the monologue part of it was where my focus was, and I felt like I could do a lot with it. I had seen some versions of the show where the actor was a fab singer, but something got lost in the writing in the monologue. So I thought, “OK, that part of it I can do. If I can sing the songs but I can’t sing them as well as some other people, that can be OK.” But it just didn’t quite work for a lot of people.Did it take a while to process that experience, or did you bounce back quickly?It was really tough when I was doing the show because the support for what I was doing was kind of scattered. It’s hard to do that, and it was kind of a dangerous, challenging thing to go out there every single night. But to go back to your original question, the way that my career has gone for me, I really do not know when I take something if it’s going to be received well or if it’s going to be seen. Really, the criteria is, “How much can I bring to this, and how much better will I be at what I do after I’ve done it?” With “Hedwig” at that moment, it was the most challenging thing I could think of possibly doing. And I thought, if I can get to the end of this show, I don’t think I’ll ever be afraid of doing anything ever again, except maybe Shakespeare in the Park. And, in fact, that’s what happened. I got a thicker skin and I got more courageous in my work from having done “Hedwig.” There’s not much that really scares me right now. There’s a lot I’d like to do.Like Shakespeare in the Park?I’d love to do Shakespeare in the Park, if somebody wanted me to.Have you done Shakespeare?I’ve actually worked on Shakespeare in workshops. And also I’ve been working with teenagers on Shakespeare. I teach it to juniors. We do Shakespeare for a few months during the spring. They have to do some Shakespeare scenes, so I’ve gotten immersed in that. I’ve learned a lot about working on Shakespeare and working with the language from actually working on it with 16-year-olds.You said in the ‘80s that you used to keep diaries for your characters. Do you still do that?Yeah, there’s writing that goes into it, thoughts usually. Now, more, it’s a feeling I get in my body: “Who’s this character?” But then, as I look through the script and I read through the scenes, stuff occurs: things, thoughts, an image of this or that. So that gets jotted down now on the actual pages of the script, which is why the digital thing drives me crazy. I need paper so I can write those things down. But I used to actually just write and write and write for the characters. It’s kind of morphed a little bit.Do you still have all of your characters’ diaries?I have all the diaries from when I was younger, but since it’s changed, I have years of scripts full of notes. They’re in my bedroom. I want to keep and remember them.Not that this will happen anytime soon, knock on wood, but have you thought about what will happen to those diaries and scripts once you’re gone?I haven’t thought about it, but everything in my life will go to [Beck, my kid]. Beck will probably think, “Oh, god, why do I have all these cartons of stuff? Let me put them in an attic somewhere.” I don’t know. But it’s all going to Beck.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.Watch our Facebook Live chat with Ally Sheedy and Zach Clark below."

Kim Campbell, who served as Canada’s prime minister in 1993, excoriated Trump over his candid remarks in a now-notorious “Access Hollywood” video. The 2005 tape features the candidate bragging about kissing women without their consent and explaining how he can “grab them by the pussy” because he’s famous.“He has described himself as a sexual predator. The behavior he has admitted to and celebrated in himself is predation,” Campbell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. “He has unleashed a wave of misogynistic rhetoric that is in the guise of being opposed to political correctness,” she added. Campbell has previously criticized Trump over his foreign policy and the way he has conducted his campaign, describing him in August as “a complete vandal who doesn’t understand anything, and shoots his mouth off.”The former prime minister’s latest remarks are her strongest yet, however, as well as some of the most damning from any past or present world leader.“Unconsented sexual touching is a sexual assault. And somebody who does that, who thinks he has a right to do that, who does it thinking that it’s a reflection of his value because he’s a celebrity, etc., I mean, that is predation,” Campbell said.In addition to condemning Trump’s talk of sexual assault, Campbell highlighted the danger of his repeated suggestion that the election would be rigged.“The notion that you would want to open a wound and encourage people ― who may do who knows what as a result of your encouragement ― to believe that somehow an election was stolen against their candidate ... is really a crime against democracy,” she said.As Canada’s justice minister in the early 1990s, Campbell worked to strengthen the nation’s sexual assault laws and reform aspects of the criminal code concerning rape.

Richard Burr is under fire for being too close to industry groups, which spent more than $100,000 to send him around the world, a review shows.",2016-10-12,Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) traveled around the world without having to pay for it.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe833f1a00006e145b9034.jpeg?cache=iHnmD9o8OU&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — There used to be something very special in the air for North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr (R), and it had a lot to do with the interests he is now being pummeled for catering to in his increasingly tight re-election bid.What was so special? Free travel, and lots of it.A review of travel records from various sources finds that Burr racked up more than $100,000 in trips for himself and often his wife all around the United States and the world.From 1996 through 2002, Burr, who was then a member of the House of Representatives, accepted four or five special interest-funded trips per year.By far the most expensive were visits to glamor destinations, such as a weeklong pre-Christmas junket to Paris in 1999 that cost $16,270, paid for by Time Warner and trading technology firm Instinet.Burr’s most luxurious provider was Nuclear Energy Institute, which ponied up $18,413 to send Burr and his wife to Paris and Marseilles, France, in 2001. The NEI, among the many energy industry groups that have also been generous to Burr’s campaigns, spent $16,907 to send Burr to Barcelona and Seville, Spain, the next year.A close second to NEI was the Ripon Educational Fund. It was known to exploit loopholes that allowed the use of money from lobbyists and corporations to fund joint travel for lobbyists and lawmakers. The Ripon Fund sent Burr and his wife to Prague for a week in 1997, costing $4,800; to Madrid for a week in 1998 for $12,000; and to Stockholm in 1999 for $9,229.In all, Burr accepted 26 trips over 11 years. The cost was a minimum of $103,000, but the price tags for a half dozen excursions in 1996 and 1997 are no longer available.Burr started dialing back his trips in 2003, and the gravy plane was finally grounded in 2007 when Congress passed the Honest Government and Open Leadership Act, spurred in part by the revelations about Ripon’s lobbyist funding, but especially by the Jack Abramoff bribery scandal. Since then, Burr has accepted just three trips under the new rules, with the most expensive being a $2,876 jaunt to Tanzania sponsored by the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, according to data maintained by Legistorm.None of Burr’s actions, while unavailable to average citizens, were against the law when he did them. His campaign declined, however, to offer any explanation about why he thought they were appropriate at the time.Now, his past globe-trotting is likely to figure in his race against Democrat Deborah Ross, a former state lawmaker who spends much of her time arguing that she is the better choice for regular North Carolinians, while accusing Burr of losing touch with the people and becoming a far different politician from the one he promised voters more than two decades ago.And that’s where those old trips become relevant again.Ross and other opponents of the two-term senator already have been playing the insider card with regularity. She has been highlighting numerous stances of Burr’s that her campaign hopes will convince voters that the incumbent has gone entirely Washington.They’ve pointed to his vote against the STOCK Act, a measure that Burr and just two other senators opposed. It barred lawmakers from using congressional knowledge to engage in insider trading. Burr argued at the time that the bill was a waste of “taxpayer time and money.” They have also pointed to Burr’s deep and remunerative ties to industries, his extensive fundraising from interest groups and his opposition not just to the STOCK Act, but to most other efforts to reform government.Indeed, a look back at Burr’s career finds that criminalizing insider trading for lawmakers is not the only reform he tried to bat down. With some exceptions, he’s also consistently blocked efforts to rein in campaign spending, opposed bans on soft money in elections and, more recently, voted against even disclosing the unlimited spending that the Supreme Court allowed in 2010. He also opposed measures in 2006 aimed at stopping lobbyists from giving lawmakers gifts, which was one of the first reform efforts launched amid the Abramoff scandal. And that leads back to the travel issue. After at first backing a 2007 measure to crack down on special interest-funded travel and numerous other lobbyist abuses, Burr twice voted to block the legislation.His campaign did not respond to a request asking for the senator’s reasoning for flip-flopping on the bill, but he suggested to the Roll Call newspaper at the time that the reforms went too far, saying the bill was “poorly put together, and puts members and staff in a vulnerable position that will become a tool for campaign tactics.” Of the few other senators who opposed the reforms, most, including Sen.

The only way they can get worse is if a war starts,” said Zhirinovsky, speaking in his huge office on the 10th floor of Russia’s State Duma, or lower house of parliament.“Americans voting for a president on Nov. 8 must realize that they are voting for peace on Planet Earth if they vote for Trump. But if they vote for Hillary it’s war. It will be a short movie. There will be Hiroshimas and Nagasakis everywhere.”Zhirinovsky’s comments coincide with deep disagreements between Washington and Moscow over Syria and Ukraine and after the White House last week accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations.Even as WikiLeaks released another trove of internal documents from Clinton’s campaign on Wednesday, Putin insisted his country was not involved in an effort to influence the U.S. presidential election.THE RUSSIAN TRUMP?Zhirinovsky likes to shock liberal public opinion and he has frequently heaped scorn on the West, which he and other Russian nationalists regard as decadent, hypocritical and corrupted by political correctness.His combative style, reminiscent of Trump’s, ensures him plenty of television air time and millions of votes in Russian elections, often from the kind of blue-collar workers who are the bedrock of the U.S. Republican candidate’s support.Zhirinovsky once proposed blocking off mostly Muslim southern Russia with a barbed wire fence, echoing Trump’s call for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.Zhirinovsky, who said he met Trump in New York in 2002, revels in his similarities with the American businessman - they are the same age, favor coarse, sometimes misogynistic language and boast about putting their own country first. Zhirinovsky has even said he wants a DNA test to see if he is related to Trump.But unlike Trump, a billionaire real estate developer who casts himself as the anti-establishment candidate in the U.S. presidential race with no past political experience, Zhirinovsky is a consummate political insider who has sat in the Duma for more than two decades.Putin has also praised Trump as “very talented,” while the Republican candidate has said the Kremlin boss is a better leader than U.S. President Barack Obama. Clinton has accused Trump of being too cozy with Putin and questioned his business interests in Russia.In other comments that have delighted Moscow, Trump has questioned the value of NATO for Washington, has spoken ambiguously about Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and suggested that the United States under his leadership would adopt a more isolationist foreign policy.“He (Trump) won’t care about Syria, Libya and Iraq and why an earth should America interfere in these countries? And Ukraine. Who needs Ukraine?,” said Zhirinovsky, who once counted himself a friend of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and whose deaths he still laments.“Trump will have a brilliant chance to make relations more peaceful ... He’s the only one who can do this,” he said, adding that Trump could even win a Nobel peace prize.CLINTON “CRAVES POWER”In contrast, Zhirinovsky described Clinton as “an evil mother-in law” and said her record as secretary of state under Obama in 2009-2013 showed she was unfit to lead her country.“She craves power. Her view is that Hillary is the most important person on the planet, that America is an exceptional country, as Barack Obama said,” said Zhirinovsky. “That’s dangerous. She could start a nuclear war.”In typically chauvinistic remarks, Zhirinovsky said Clinton’s gender should also bar her from the presidency.“Most Americans should choose Trump because men have been leading for millions of year. You can’t take the risk of having one of the richest, most powerful countries led by a woman president,” he said.Asked about lewd comments Trump made about women in 2005 that have harmed his campaign, Zhirinovsky defended the Republican: “Men all round the world sometimes say such things that are just for their comrades. We must only consider his business (and political) qualities.”Though Putin and Trump have never met, Zhirinovsky said he believed they could establish a close working relationship, adding: “Victory for Trump would be a gift to humanity. But if Hillary Clinton wins it will be the last U.S. president ever.”"

Being watched all the time, with infrared at night, that drives one crazy, and that is a consequence of a political decision (to put Abdeslam on continuous monitoring,” he said.Abdeslam’s Belgian lawyer Sven Mary said the solitary confinement was causing Abdeslam to clam up.“The real victims of this are the victims of the Paris attacks. They have a right to know,” he said.French authorities suspect Abdeslam, who fled the scene but was captured later, of playing a part in the organization of the multiple machine gun and suicide bomb attacks on a music venue and bars in Paris and at a football stadium on the edge of the city.Abdeslam had been spirited out of France and back to Belgium, his country of residence, by car in the hours after the attacks.

But this has nothing to do with Russia’s interests,” President Putin told a business forum in Moscow.Putin said the accusations were a ploy to divert U.S. voters’ attention at a time when public opinion was being manipulated.“Everyone is talking about ‘who did it’ (the hacking),” said Putin. “But is it that important? The most important thing is what is inside this information.”The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday it took a negative view of White House statements about a planned “proportional” response to the alleged cyber attacks.Putin complained that all sides in the U.S. presidential race were misusing rhetoric about Russia for their own ends, but said Moscow would work with whoever won the election “if, of course, the new U.S. leader wishes to work with our country”.“About a decade ago, they wouldn’t mention Russia at all, because it was not even worth talking about, such a third-rate regional power and not interesting at all. Now Russia is problem number one in the entire election campaign,” said Putin.“All they do is keep talking about us. Of course it’s pleasant for us, but only partly because all participants are misusing anti-Russian rhetoric and poisoning our bilateral relations.”On Tuesday, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. told an audience in Washington that his country bears no responsibility for email leaks affecting the U.S. presidential race.(Reporting by Katya Golubkova and Alexander Winning; Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Andrew Osborn)"

High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein cited Trump’s views on vulnerable communities, including minorities, and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as “deeply unsettling and disturbing”.“If Donald Trump is elected on the basis of what he has said already - and unless that changes - I think it is without any doubt that he would be dangerous from an international point of view,” Zeid told a news briefing in Geneva.Trump lashed out at House Speaker Paul Ryan and other “disloyal” Republicans on Tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him. This occurred after a 2005 video surfaced last week showing him bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances.Trump has said he would immediately re-authorize the waterboarding of suspected militants if elected on Nov. 8, contending that “torture works”.U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, signed an executive order after taking office in January 2009 that banned waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques”. Such executive orders can be rescinded by a successor.Zeid said that he would rather not interfere in political campaigns. But when a candidate’s comments pointed to a potential use of torture, prohibited under the Convention against Torture, a pact ratified by Washington, or to vulnerable groups possibly losing their basic rights, he had to speak out.In a speech in The Hague last month, Zeid accused Trump of spreading “humiliating racial and religious prejudice” and warned of a rise of populist politics that could turn violent.“I always believe that it’s incumbent on leaders to lead and to lead in a way that is ethical and moral,” Zeid said on Wednesday, when asked about Trump. “The use of half-truths is a very clever political device. Because as every propagandist knows, you allow the listener to fill in the rest.”Trump has portrayed himself as tough on national security and promised to build a wall to stop Mexican immigrant “rapists” from crossing the border.“We have to be on guard to see that in the end vulnerable populations, populations at risk do not again see their rights deprived because of a view that is in the ascendancy based on false premises,” Zeid said."

During the violent incident, West reportedly begged for her life and reminded her captors that she had children. When they grabbed her by the ankles, West told police, she thought she was about to be raped.The assault shocked Paris residents and alarmed West’s family and friends, but ultimately it is a very personal “emotional terror,” said Khloe Kardashian during a taping of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. A source also told ET Online that West is crying and having flashbacks to the traumatic night. Research on bank tellers and others who experience workplace robbery suggests that this is a completely normal reaction to the violent invasion. Many victims of a violent robbery experience acute stress disorder and psychological distress after the incident, depending on whether employees felt like their lives were in danger during the robbery. What’s more, even arriving at your home to discover you’ve been burglarized — a relatively non-violent incident — can cause victims to feel fear, guilt and shame, reported Pacific Standard. The psychological distress of being violently robbed can manifest itself as a sleep disorder, heightened awareness of one’s surroundings, difficulty concentrating, headaches, feeling suspicious of future customers, and generally feeling unsafe and no longer wanting to continue working at the same job, according to studies on employees who have witnessed a workplace robbery.In a small minority of workers who experience a robbery or other traumatic workplace event, these symptoms can develop into full blown post-traumatic stress disorder. Risk factors for developing PTSD include pre-existing psychiatric disorders, previous exposure to trauma and some characteristics of the robbery itself, such as use of weapons.If there’s any silver lining in experiencing such a terrifying ordeal, research also shows that support from friends and family can help people recover, especially if loved ones listen and take the experience seriously. Contact with other victims is also helpful. West’s friends and family have rallied close, vowing publicly to support her as she recovers from the traumatic event. But rumors that the reality TV star fabricated the entire incident for money have been circulating the internet, and on Oct 11, West filed a lawsuit against celebrity gossip site MediaTakeOut for a story they wrote alleging that the robbery was a staged stunt to defraud her insurance company. We’re hoping that no one in her immediate circle takes the same callous, suspicious approach to her trauma. West’s recovery may depend on it. "

Dragons roam free, vampire slayers go to high school and teen wizards save the world. Despite the freedom this kind of storytelling permits, there’s still one imaginary hurdle that’s too far-fetched for most creators to overcome: featuring actors of color (besides Zoe Saldana) in prominent roles. As one of the most-watched series on television, “Game of Thrones” has attracted its fair share of criticism for bungling depictions of one too many rape scenes and perpetuating a white savior complex in the name of Daenerys Targaryen.However, HBO’s prized pony has adapted as its season-count grew, incorporating more characters of color into the fabric of the series and throwing in a couple full-frontal male nudity scenes for good measure. But according to actor David Oyelowo, the series still has a long way to go when it comes to diverse casting. In a recent interview with Radio Times, the “Selma” star said there was “no excuse” for why “Game of Thrones” doesn’t feature main characters of color.“The fact that they put any ethnic minorities in that means that there should be space for bigger characters,” Oyelowo explained. “Because you’re not just saying, ‘OK this is purely a white world, and here are very story-driven reasons why that’s the case.’”“You are interspersing people of color into it,” he added, “and so therefore it’s a conscious decision to put them on the margins, as opposed to put them front and center.”As Radio Times notes, a handful of characters of color have appeared on the series over the course of six seasons, including Salladhor Saan (Lucian Msamati), Xaro Xhoan Daxos (Nonso Anozie), Areo Hotah (DeObia Oparei), Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson) and fan favorite Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel). Rarely, however, are these characters given a compelling storyline like their white counterparts, or survive longer than a season or two.“Even if for whatever reason, it’s a world in which people of color in those stories are subservient, or they are more in a helper role, that doesn’t mean they can’t have prominent storylines,” Oyelowo continued. “All you have to do is shift the focus to focus on those characters.”When series creator George R.R. Martin addressed fans’ wishes to see themselves represented in their favorite fantasy world, he, like many before him, explained that despite his world’s fantastical creations, the historical constraints of the time period led him to make white people the focal point of his story. “Westeros around 300 AC is nowhere near as diverse as 21st century America, of course … but with that being said, I do have some ‘characters of color’ who will have somewhat larger roles in The Winds of Winter,” he responded to an African-American female fan in 2014. “Admittedly, these are secondary and tertiary characters, though not without importance.”Um, for the record, Lupita Nyong’o is DOWN.

And if he is elected president, he does not plan to end the use of these controversial facilities, he told The Huffington Post. Private prisons can have an economic incentive to keep as many people locked up as possible at a low cost. The Obama administration doesn’t think they should be used at all. But during Johnson’s two terms as governor of New Mexico, from 1995 to 2003, two new private prisons were built in the state, and he signed legislation that solidified standards for private facilities. Between 1999 and 2010, the number of inmates in New Mexico’s private prisons grew by more than 50 percent, according to a report by the Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that advocates for criminal justice reform. In both years, New Mexico led the nation in the proportion of inmates held in private facilities.Johnson’s critics say his administration’s embrace of private prisons did not go as well as he claims. They say there was not sufficient oversight, new staff was less experienced, and there were a series of violent incidents, including a deadly prison riot.“There were more, and more serious, problems at the private prisons than at the state-operated prisons,” said Jeffrey Schwartz, referring to his time consulting for the New Mexico Corrections Department in the 2000s, working on training to handle major emergencies. Among them, he cited “serious inmate violence, riots, and the assassination of at least one correctional staff officer.”But Johnson points to his state as a success story. “I am often asked about private prisons ― and whether they create political and financial pressure to unnecessarily incarcerate drug offenders and others,” Johnson wrote in February. “When I was Governor, it simply didn’t happen.” In an interview this week with HuffPost, Johnson elaborated that based on his experience, he believes private prisons can provide equivalent services at a lower cost. Private prison companies in New Mexico predated Johnson, but he spurred their rise. In 1980, New Mexico had one of the worst riots in the country at a state prison, where correctional officers were taken hostage, and more than 30 inmates died. Directly afterwards, several state prisons were built, but in the 1990s and 2000s, the population outgrew state facilities, said Alex Sanchez, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Corrections Department. The way state-run prisons were built, they did not meet the space requirements of a subsequent federal consent decree, she said. Johnson recalls that hundreds of inmates were being housed out of state because of the consent decree. “Private prisons stepped in and offered the same goods and services at about two-thirds the cost,” he said. He signed legislation, enacted in 2001, that set forth some minimum standards for these facilities, like making sure guards completed a training course approved by the secretary of corrections. “He just thought this was the way to go — it was cost savings,” said Mark Donatelli, an attorney who served from 1980 to 1983 as director of New Mexico’s Prison Riot Defense office, which was created to represent inmates suspected of riot-related crimes. “The real mistake he made was, ironically, given his distrust of governmental competence ... he didn’t protect the state from the private entities the way he should have.” Donatelli said Johnson replaced agency heads with less experienced people, and failed to ensure adequate oversight of the private companies. “We have operated facilities and have provided leading offender rehabilitation services in New Mexico in partnership with and under strict oversight and monitoring from the New Mexico [Department of Corrections.],” said a spokesman for the GEO Group, which operates multiple prisons in the state.Private prisons can work if state officials provide strict oversight of contracts, said NMDC’s Sanchez. She says current New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration is doing that. (Under her administration, the state fined major private prison companies more than $1 million for issues related to inadequate staffing and contract violations.) But Sanchez couldn’t speak on previous administrations, including Johnson’s. A federal court would never have signed off on private prisons in New Mexico if they had offered subpar services, Johnson said. And the free market in legal services for prisoners boosts oversight, he later added. “There is an entire cadre of attorneys that look out for the civil rights of prisoners,” he said. “In many ways, they do a great job of making sure that there is no lesser goods or services.” In 1999, almost 300 inmates were involved in a riot at the Guadalupe County Correctional Facility, which opened that year under Johnson. A group of inmates stabbed a guard to death. In the nine months before the riot, five people died in Wackenhut-run prisons in New Mexico, according to The Associated Press. The inmate homicide rate in Wackenhut’s prisons at that time was “off the charts,” at 1 for every 400 inmates, compared to 1 for every 15,000 inmates nationwide, according to a paper published by a fellow at George Soros’ Open Society Foundations. Republican state senators blamed Johnson for helping incite the riot by threatening to move inmates back into state facilities if they continued the violence. “It’s clear private prisons aren’t working in New Mexico,” State Sen. Michael Sanchez, then-Democratic chairman of the courts and corrections committee, told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal.Johnson, who the year before received $5,000 collectively from two private prison companies — Wackenhut and CCA — opposed an independent study of private prisons after the riot. (He believed it was duplicative of a state review.) Johnson also told HuffPost the donations were routine, and there was “certainly no quid pro quo.” Private prisons create an incentive for states to lock more people up. And private prison contracts in New Mexico have, in fact, stipulated a minimum number of inmates a facility had to hold. Alex Sanchez, the NMCD spokeswoman, said the current administration is trying to move away from those provisions, and regardless, “whether you put a minimum in a contract or not, New Mexico does not have enough state beds to house the population.” But at least one major private prison company, CCA, has acknowledged that it loses with criminal justice reform. “The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws,” the company wrote in 2005.Johnson insists that his support for private prisons does not conflict with his criminal justice platform ― which includes legalizing marijuana ― because he believes private prisons will be easier to empty than public ones. But he does not plan to go as far as the Obama administration in preemptively shutting them down. Rather, he said, he will weigh costs and benefits on a case-by-case basis. “All I have to base my experiences on is having been governor of New Mexico,” he said. “People really appreciate good stewardship of tax dollars ... is it a bargain or isn’t it?” Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

Burnett issued a statement on Wednesday that he is “not now and have never been a supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy.” He further stated and he and his wife are appalled by “the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign.”Diller, a supporter of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, told Politico that he isn’t easily shocked, but called Trump’s remarks about groping and sexually assaulting women “so astounding it’s almost beyond belief.”This story has been updated to include Burnett’s statement.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Hernandez, 44, was found at approximately 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, after which she was transported to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A firearm was found by police at the scene.Whittier police are investigating the death as a suicide and have found “no signs of foul play” as of yet, according to the police department’s website. But Lt. Steve Dean noted that the investigation is ongoing and that the department had not entirely ruled out the possibility of homicide, according to the Los Angeles Times. The Los Angeles County coroner’s office released Hernandez’s name Wednesday, and the LAPD confirmed to The Huffington Post over the phone that Hernandez worked in the police department’s Robbery-Homicide Division and was one of the investigating officers in the Derrick Rose criminal investigation.Criminal charges have yet to be filed against Rose, but the former NBA MVP is in the middle of a civil trial over the allegation that he and two other men drugged and then sexually assaulted a former partner of Rose’s in August of 2013. Brandon Anand, the attorney for Rose’s accuser, included a letter by Hernandez in a request last month requesting to have the name of the accuser remain anonymous during the trial. Hernandez wrote in the letter that the promise of anonymity to accuser’s was “an invaluable investigative aid to investigators as well as a great comfort to victims of crimes of such a sensitive nature.” "

Pat McCrory said during a debate Tuesday that transgender Olympian Caitlyn Jenner better plan on using the men’s bathroom if she visits the state.McCrory, continuing his defense of the state’s sweeping anti-LGBT law, blamed “liberals” for “a major change in culture” that forced Republicans to respond with the legislation. “In the private sector in North Carolina, she can go wherever the private sector wants her to,” McCrory, a Republican, said of Jenner, who as Bruce Jenner won Olympic gold 40 years ago. “If she’s going to a shower facility at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill] after running around the track, she’s going to use the men’s shower.”The question about Jenner, the country’s best-known transgender person, was asked during Tuesday’s debate between McCrory and his Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Roy Cooper.North Carolina’s House Bill 2, passed in March, removes anti-discrimination protection for LGBTQ people and mandates that individuals use the public bathrooms that correspond to the sex they were assigned at birth. The law has stirred public outrage, political backlash and the loss of millions in business.  It faces a legal challenge from the U.S. Department of Justice. Cooper refuses to defend the state in the case.  McCrory, however, continues to stand behind the so-called bathroom bill. He pointed the finger at “liberals in Charlotte,” who he said “started this whole bathroom mess” by demanding people recognize “a brand new concept of gender identity and gender expression ― a major change in culture.” “If you’re a man, you’re going to go to the man’s locker room, restroom or shower. If you’re a woman, you’re going to go to their appropriate shower,” McCrory said. “No change whatsoever.” Cooper said the law must be repealed. “It writes discrimination into our law and it has been a disaster for our economy,” Cooper said. “Governor McCrory continues to go across the state telling people that this is not hurting our economy. He attacks businesses who are opposed to it and says that everything is going fine. Governor, what planet are you on?”The fallout has been extensive. In April, rock star Bruce Springsteen canceled a concert in protest. In July, the NBA pulled the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte. More recently, 60 investment managers representing more than $2.1 trillion called for the state to repeal the law, warning the damage could soon be “irreversible.”McCrory also addressed recently revealed lewd comments made by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. He said Trump “needs to have his mouth washed out with soap,” but his strong stand on certain issues makes him a “role model.”McCrory on Friday condemned “in the strongest possible terms” Trump’s sexual assault boast, calling it “disgusting.”Asked Tuesday why he didn’t go further and withdraw his support, McCrory said Trump remains the best candidate for president. “I think what makes him a role model is where he does stand strong on certain issues that need to be said, especially from outside Washington, D.C.,” McCrory said. “The Syrian refugee situation, it’s a disaster.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Relations between the mostly white, longtime residents and the small but growing Latino community had been tense. But the ordinance made them far worse. For a time, the town was ground zero for anti-immigrant politics in America, and an emblem of the cultural tensions those policies inflame.In recent years, the animosity began to dissipate. Courts blocked the most controversial provisions of Hazleton’s ordinance, the Latino population ballooned and many residents moved on. Then came Donald Trump. The real estate mogul launched his presidential campaign on a harsh anti-immigrant platform reminiscent of Hazleton’s decade-old ordinance. And when it came time for Pennsylvanians to vote in the Republican primary, Trump won big, both statewide and in Luzerne County, which includes Hazleton. Now, with weeks to go before the general election, there are pro-Trump signs scattered around neighborhood lawns and in windows. Trump’s calls for a border wall and his harsh criticism of unauthorized immigration resonate here. And because of that, the conflict that broke out a decade ago is surfacing once more, even in the most mundane of places. When I arrived here in early September, I witnessed it at my very first stop: a local Wendy’s. It was midday. A middle-aged woman waiting behind me became agitated that our line wasn’t moving fast enough. When a man in front of us began speaking Spanish to the cashier, her frustration boiled over. “Hurry up,” she blurted out at him. She then turned to an elderly white man and to me, hoping we’d commiserate: “That’s why I’m voting for Trump.” The Hazleton City Council passed its Illegal Immigration Relief Act Ordinance in July 2006. The goal was to make Hazleton “one of the toughest cities in America for illegal aliens,” then-Mayor Lou Barletta (R) said at the time. Barletta has since been elected to Congress. The ordinance declared English the official language, imposed $1,000-per-day fines on landlords who rented to undocumented immigrants and heavy penalties on employers who hired them. The city council continued to pass and amend anti-unauthorized immigration ordinances into the next year, arguing they were necessary to combat crime and help manage government resources. Opponents said the ordinance was unconstitutional, discriminatory and so broadly written that even U.S. citizens could be forced out of their homes if they couldn’t prove their citizenship. It took years, but the ordinance’s critics eventually won. In 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund and the Community Justice Project filed a lawsuit. They received an injunction that year to keep the ordinance from being enforced, but the legal battle wasn’t fully resolved until 2014, when the Supreme Court declined to review the lower court decisions that struck down the ordinance. Latino residents didn’t feel like the ordinance was just about undocumented immigrants. They felt like it was directed at legal residents and citizens, too. Retired ophthalmologist Agapito Lopez, a Puerto Rico-born U.S. citizen who helped lead the fight against the ordinance, received hate mail and threats, sometimes slipped under his office door. To this day, he keeps many of the letters and flyers, along with news clippings, together in a large binder. One flyer was from the National Socialist Movement, which the Southern Poverty Law Center calls “one of the largest and most prominent neo-Nazi groups in the United States.” “IF IT’S BROWN, FLUSH IT DOWN,” the flyer reads, with a photo of a man wearing a sombrero. Francisco Torres-Aranda Jr., an engineer who owns a local business, said many Latinos felt they were being singled out because of their surnames. He was born in the area, but raised in Mexico until he returned to Hazleton with his family as a teenager.In 2006, when family members visited from Mexico, Torres-Aranda took them to dinner in a nearby town because he was worried someone in Hazleton would use slurs or tell them to speak in English.“After the ordinance was passed, you were surprised at times by some of the reaction and people that thought it was a good idea,” Torres-Aranda said. “Sometimes, you may lose friendships over that, and I did lose a couple friendships over that.”This was disturbing to some non-Latinos, too. Anne Marie Shelby, 66, said she and her husband stopped telling people outside of Hazleton where they were from. They also saw a side to their friends, family and neighbors that they hadn’t realized existed. “The bigotry wasn’t out in the open,” Shelby said. “Well, when [the ordinance] came,  it was like, ‘Where the hell did these Confederate flags come from? I live in the North.’ That was the big thing. It was like they came out. Everybody that wasn’t a bigot came out. And that was the shock.”The atmosphere left the city vulnerable to economic trouble and demagogues, pollster John Zogby wrote in 2007, when his firm, Zogby International, was commissioned to assess the economy and demographics of the city.In spite of the Hazleton’s rich ethnic tradition, “now fear reigns supreme, and the biggest fear is that this great tradition can be hijacked, especially by national demagogues trying to accent the worst,” Zogby wrote in a supplement to the report.Despite the hostile atmosphere that followed the 2006 ordinance, the number of Latinos in Hazleton increased rapidly. In the past 15 years, Latinos have gone from about 5 percent to more than 45 percent of the town’s population. Many came from New Jersey and New York to work in food processing, manufacturing and warehouses. The largest portion of Latino immigrants in Hazleton are originally from the Dominican Republic, and most are in the U.S. legally.Like their counterparts elsewhere, Hazleton’s immigrants came in search of jobs and a steady life. And they largely flourished. For all of Trump’s talk about jobs moving to Mexico, the exact opposite has happened here. Mexican-owned corporations are major employers in Luzerne County. Bimbo Bakeries USA, the American arm of a Mexican manufacturing company, currently employs 380 people there. To accommodate the rising immigrant population, the city has tried to better cater to Spanish-speaking residents. Government documents are translated into Spanish. There are more translators in schools. The Hazleton Police Department hired a bilingual officer and is teaching others Spanish ― a notable departure from the English-only provision that was one of the centerpieces of the 2006 ordinance.Community groups have popped up to help foster greater integration as well. Concerned Parents of the Hazleton Area, a group Shelby co-founded, started a reading program for kids. That program’s success inspired the group to begin providing English and citizenship classes for parents. In 2011, Chicago Cubs manager and Hazleton native Joe Maddon helped launch the Hazleton Integration Project, which offers pre-K and after-school programs and aims to promote unity within the city. Up to 200 people volunteer at the organization each year. And the group’s executive director, Ben Medina, said community relations have improved significantly as a result.“The integration project, it is working,” Medina said. “We’re coming together.” But integration hasn’t been seamless. Some longtime residents are uncomfortable with the changes and how they have affected schools, businesses and the health care system, said Rick Morelli, a former Luzerne County Council member and a Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention. “I wouldn’t call it tension ― I think it’s something that people talk about often here,” said Morelli, who is white and grew up in the Hazleton area. “It’s the elephant in the room that they might not always talk about, but people, they see it.”And it’s most visible at the intersection of politics and daily life, especially during this increasingly heated election cycle.Morelli said people in Hazleton grow frustrated about unauthorized immigration when they see lines at Walmart with people using SNAP benefits, often called food stamps. Latino residents say they hear that criticism, too. Often, it’s a non-Latino muttering under his or her breath ― or sometimes louder ― about how the food stamp system is being abused. It’s usually accompanied by derisive references to undocumented immigrants, even when the people they’re complaining about are here legally.“They’ll make comments like, ‘That’s why Donald Trump is going to send them back,’” said Guillermo Lara, 49.Lara was born in Mexico but has lived in Hazleton for 25 years and is a U.S. citizen. Trump has made people less reserved about expressing racism openly, he said.“Now that Donald Trump is running, he brings back all of this hate, all of these emotions and feelings, and some of the people believe they have the right to tell you, ‘Go back if you don’t like it,’” Lara said.Lopez, likewise, has seen a change in Hazleton. In the era of Trump, he says, the city has begun reverting back to what it was a decade earlier: firmly at the vanguard of anti-immigrant sentiment. “They were racist inside, but they didn’t dare to say anything,” Lopez said of some of his fellow residents. “Now, after Trump, they can tell you anything. They see you going out of a store, they think you’re stealing something.”Both Lara and Lopez are supporting Hillary Clinton for president. The Democratic nominee has an office in the area, and on a recent early fall evening, the two of them went there for a Latino organizing event along with about 40 others. The group watched a video on how to register and vote, and received a pep talk from organizers. “This is our country ― your country, my country,” former Mayor Mike Marsicano, the Democrat running to take Barletta’s seat in the House of Representatives, told them. A translator helped convey his message in Spanish. “You know who Barletta is,” Marsicano said. “He ruined my town. He’s given Hazleton a very, very bad reputation.” Barletta has remained aligned with Trump even as other Republicans are backing away. On Monday, he appeared with the Republican nominee at a rally in nearby Wilkes-Barre. Trump gave Barletta a shout-out and brought him up on the stage, joking that it was “hard to believe” that he liked actually liked a member of congress. He called Barletta “unbelievable.” Beyond heaping praise on Barletta, Trump has also tried to plant roots in Hazleton. His campaign has an office there. And Morelli said he thinks the Republican nominee will get strong support in the city ― even from some Democrats.“I get around, the people talk to me and ask me questions,” he said. “These people who I know who are staunch Democrats and say they’re going to vote for Donald Trump. ... I think his tough stance, as well as not being an insider, is going to help him get elected.”At least one Clinton supporter agrees. City Councilman Jack Mundie, a Democrat, voted for the 2006 immigration ordinance. Asked who he believes most residents will support for president, he didn’t hesitate. “I would say Donald Trump,” Mundie said. “Most people in Hazleton are going to support Donald Trump.”For longtime Hazleton residents who opposed the 2006 ordinance and were relieved when the dust it kicked up largely settled, it’s been distressing to see how Trump’s campaign has brought those tensions back to the surface. Shelby, who used to hide that she was from Hazleton out of embarrassment, is a Clinton supporter. She sometimes goes to the campaign office to make calls, and will sometimes get a friend on the line who doesn’t realize it’s her. They’ll say things they’ve never told her before ― that they can’t vote for Clinton because Trump is going to bring back jobs, or “get rid of all of these illegals,” or not “allow all of these Muslims to come in.” “I can’t believe the people that are voting for him,” Shelby said. “I guess that’s one of the hardest things. I look at them and I’m thinking, ‘I know you, I didn’t think you were this way. So is this in your heart and I didn’t know this?’”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

Shelby, who used to hide that she was from Hazleton out of embarrassment, is a Clinton supporter. She sometimes goes to the campaign office to make calls, and will sometimes get a friend on the line who doesn’t realize it’s her. They’ll say things they’ve never told her before ― that they can’t vote for Clinton because Trump is going to bring back jobs, or “get rid of all of these illegals,” or not “allow all of these Muslims to come in.” “I can’t believe the people that are voting for him,” Shelby said. “I guess that’s one of the hardest things. I look at them and I’m thinking, ‘I know you, I didn’t think you were this way. So is this in your heart and I didn’t know this?’”HUFFPOST READERS: What’s happening in your state or district?

She was turning blue and fading fast.”Knox said he immediately began reverse CPR, performed with the baby lying on her chest with her head turned to the side.”I did reverse cpr and was able to suck the cereal out of her throat,” Knox wrote on Facebook. After she could breathe again, “she smiled at me for a second and then starting crying which was music to my ears.”Knox, a police officer for 25 years, explained how the moment was one of the most life-changing of his career.“Out of my 25 years being a cop this is my greatest and most profound accomplishment and it made every second of those 25 years worth it all,” he wrote. “I am forever humbled and changed by this.”Ma’Yavi’s parents asked Knox if he would be their baby’s godfather ― a request Knox wholeheartedly accepted.“It is my honor, privilege and pleasure,” he wrote on Facebook. “Ma’Yavi Parham...my precious angel...I swear I will forever be your guardian and love you with all my heart.”"
39,POLITICS,"Republicans Endorse, Unendorse And Then Re-Endorse Donald Trump",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deb-fischer-donald-trump_us_57fe4819e4b0d505a46b3c76,"Mmm, political expediency tastes good.",2016-10-12,Sen. Deb Fischer says she plans to vote for Donald Trump on Election Day. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fe4ba2170000c316acb64e.jpeg?cache=Lq02UxkzrR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Multiple Republicans who called for Donald Trump to step down as the Republican presidential nominee over the weekend are now saying they will still vote for him.In an impressive bit of rhetorical gymnastics, some are also saying that they never technically un-endorsed Trump in the first place ― even though they all said that he should be replaced by his running mate Mike Pence as the Republican nominee for president.Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.) and Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.) all confirmed on Tuesday that they will support the Republican ticket, even if it’s led by Trump instead of Pence, the governor of Indiana. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said the same day that he would likely vote for Trump.Over the weekend, the four were among the many high-profile Republicans who dropped their support for the nominee, after The Washington Post published 2005 video footage of Trump bragging about using his celebrity status to kiss and grope women without their consent.Trump has remained steadfast that he will not quit the race, and has lashed out against Republicans who dropped their support. If Republicans still plan to vote for the GOP ticket, they’re saying they’re still OK with voting for Trump.Some were more direct than others.“Like most Nebraskans, I am fully committed to defeating Hillary Clinton,” Fischer said on Lincoln, Nebraska, radio station KLIN, referring to the Democratic presidential nominee. “I support the Republican ticket and I plan to vote for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence on Nov. 8.”Fischer and her campaign’s chief of staff said the senator never actually said she would not support the Republican ticket.But it’s not difficult to see why people got the impression that Fischer was opposing Trump, since she tweeted that Pence should take over the nomination.Byrne called for Trump to step down as the nominee because of the “disgraceful and appalling” remarks he made in the 2005 video.“It is now clear that Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States and cannot defeat Hillary Clinton,” Byrne said in a statement on Saturday. “I believe he should step aside and allow Gov. Pence to lead the Republican ticket.” But Byrne’s still willing to vote for Trump, spokesman Seth Morrow said on Tuesday.“He will support the Republican ticket on Election Day, as he has pledged to do all along,” Morrow said. “He just believes that person should be Mike Pence.” Byrne said so himself in response to questions on Twitter.Garrett similarly said after the release of the Trump video that Pence would be “the best nominee for the Republican Party.”On Tuesday, Garrett’s campaign manager, Sarah Neibart, told the Observer that the congressman will vote for Trump if he is the nominee.“He has always believed that [Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton is not the candidate whose leadership and policies are right for America,” Neibart said. “Donald Trump remains the nominee of the Republican Party, and Rep. Garrett has always said he will vote for the Republican Party nominee.”Thune, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, tweeted on Saturday that “Donald Trump should withdraw and Mike Pence should be our nominee effective immediately.”Like the others, though, Thune said Tuesday that he is likely to vote for Trump ― though he left himself some wiggle room, according to Rapid City Journal.“He has a lot of work to do, I think, to win this election,” Thune said. “But, I’m certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton.”Some Republicans have stated more clearly that they will not vote for Trump, and the list of those calling for him to drop out increased significantly after the video of the 2005 comments surfaced.Republican leaders in the House and Senate did not revoke their support. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has stayed quiet about the matter, while House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he would still vote for Trump, but would not defend him. On Monday, Ryan told House Republicans they should do what is best for themselves and their districts, and said he is focused on keeping a majority in the House.

In a new interview she’s defiantly calling out thos e double standards, once again. “When Kim Kardashian’s naked picture came out, [Sharon Osbourne] praised it, and my fans attacked her for being such a hypocrite,” Minaj told writer Janet Mock in the November issue of Marie Claire. “So it wasn’t trashy and raunchy when a white woman did it, but it was when a black woman did it? It’s quite pathetic and sad, but that is my reality, and I’ve gotten accustomed to just shutting it down.”This isn’t the first time the New York rapper has questioned the visceral, sometimes negative reactions she gets for showing off her shapely body. In 2014, after receiving criticism for the album art for her single “Anaconda,” she posted pictures on social media of herself in a thong with the caption “Unacceptable” beside pictures of white supermodels in thongs with the caption “Acceptable.”Minaj’s full Marie Claire interview will hit stands on Oct. 18."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is standing by his endorsement of Donald Trump for president, even after a bombshell video surfaced last week of the GOP nominee bragging about sexually assaulting women.Grassley’s reasoning? Other presidents have said bad things, too.“You stop to think, there’s only a few saints who have been president of the United States,” he said with a chuckle to Iowa reporters Monday.The longtime Republican senator, who is up for reelection next month, called Trump’s comments in the video “deplorable.” But asked if he’s still supporting him for president, Grassley said only, “I am focusing on my reelection.”Here’s a video of Grassley’s remarks Monday:Iowa’s other Republican senator, Joni Ernst, is still endorsing Trump for president, too. Ernst said what he said in the video “appalled” her, but that she’s still going to support her party’s ticket.Some Iowa GOP officials aren’t as forgiving of Trump. Melissa Gesing, the president of the Iowa Federation of Republican Women, resigned Wednesday because she said she can no longer stand by the GOP nominee.“I cannot in good conscience lead this organization or look at myself in the mirror each morning if I do not take a stand against the racism, sexism, and hate that Donald J. Trump continues to promote,” Gesing said.Grassley is currently polling 12 points ahead of his Democratic challenger, Patty Judge, per HuffPost Pollster.

At the same time, the GOP has seen a 2-point increase in generic House polling, which asks voters which party’s congressional candidate they’d vote for.Voters in his own party also seem to be targeting their ire at Trump specifically. Among registered GOP voters, Trump has dropped by 4 points, from 85 percent to 81 percent. But the generic down-ballot Republican candidate has seen no change, maintaining 88 percent support.Polls conducted by Morning Consult and Politico/Morning Consult before and after Friday’s revelations similarly suggest that down-ballot candidates may be insulated from Trump’s fate. The generic GOP House candidate is actually up by 4 points among all likely voters and remains stable at 86 percent with likely Republican voters in these polls. Meanwhile, Trump has dropped by 3 points among likely Republican voters.Unlike the YouGov/Economist polls, however, the Politico/Morning Consult surveys find Trump up by 2 points, a shift that may be attributable to a poll’s random variation. That one Morning Consult/Politico result aside, other recent polls indicate a decline for Trump. The HuffPost Pollster charts, which aggregate publicly released polls, also show a small declining trend for the GOP nominee, in both the head-to-head race with Hillary Clinton and polls that include Gary Johnson.Americans overall are displeased with Trump’s bragging about sexually assaulting women. In a Politico/Morning Consult poll, 47 percent of registered voters rate their feelings about the infamous video as very negative and 17 percent are neutral. Twenty-nine percent rate their feelings somewhere in between very negative and neutral.An NBC/SurveyMonkey poll finds that 55 percent of likely voters believe that Trump doesn’t respect women and 39 percent say that the video makes them less likely to support Trump in the upcoming election.It’s still too early to say what the full effect of the video will be on Trump and down-ballot candidates. These latest polls should be viewed with some caution as they were conducted within only a day or two of the video’s release. But Republican leaders are taking swift action in an attempt to repel any damage to the party overall. Since last Friday’s revelations, a growing number of lawmakers have denounced Trump’s comments and dropped their support for him.Prior to Sunday night’s presidential debate, Michael Reagan, the late president’s son, took to Twitter to encourage Republicans to “vote down ballot to save the Country and the Republican Party.” And over the weekend, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus instructed the RNC to redirect funds away from Trump and toward those down-ballot candidates.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Or maybe not.The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard arguments in one chapter of the most contentious tech battle of the smartphone era — a patent dispute between between Apple and Samsung over the iPhone’s design, with nearly $400 million on the line.The late Apple founder once said he was “willing to go thermonuclear” against those who stole his intellectual property, but the justices on Tuesday seemed skeptical of Apple’s end game in this particular case ― and may be willing to hand Samsung a partial victory that will let the dispute proceed in lower courts a while longer.At issue in the case are three design patents that more or less control the iPhone’s curved exterior shell and its screen’s icon-based interface. A jury found Samsung violated those patents, and two juries separately concluded the company should pay Apple $399 million in damages.That’s Samsung total profit from the sale of those models, and Apple urged the Supreme Court to rule that it’s entitled to all of it ― under a law that says that a design patent violator “shall be liable ... to the extent of his total profit.”Chief Justice John Roberts was quick to draw a distinction that may undermine Apple’s position.“It seems to me that the design is applied to the exterior case of the phone. It’s not applied to ... all the chips and wires,” he said. “So there shouldn’t be profits awarded based on the entire price of the phone.”Apple’s main argument is that the law of design patents was written so as to impose full liability on the tech giant’s rival. But Samsung has countered that Apple is owed far less than what the jury found because the iPhone’s outer design and icon layout ― the design patents implicated in the case ― make up only a tiny fraction of a complex device.“A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work,” said Kathleen Sullivan, Samsung’s lawyer before the high court. “A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone.”The justices appeared less concerned with the money Apple is owed than with issuing a bright-line rule that will guide similar design patent lawsuits in the future. In court filings, Samsung had presented them with a doom-and-gloom scenario where a ruling for Apple could open the door to big-money verdicts for even minor design infringements. In an exchange with Apple’s lawyer, Seth Waxman, Justice Stephen Breyer alluded to the need for a “rule of reason” ― a practical standard that will guide jurors on how to award just the right amount of damages to innovators who may lay claim to part, but not all, of a design.“And so that kind of standard, with perhaps examples to explain it to the jury,” Breyer said, would mean that something like a wallpaper design would get its patent holder all the profits from the product itself. “A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don’t get all the profit from the car,” he added.Cars, in fact, were front and center during the hour-long hearing. The Volkswagen Beetle had a starring role throughout the session, with lawyers and justices invoking its characteristic shape as the kind of thing that may inspire knockoff versions. Should knockoff-makers be liable only for copying the Beetle’s outer design, or for all their profits?“This hypothetical is not helpful to me, because I can’t get over the thought that nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,” said a seemingly frustrated Justice Samuel Alito.The federal government, which runs the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, made a special appearance at the hearing but took no sides ― and, in essence, tried to get the justices to reach a compromise, convincing them to send the case back to a lower court so that jurors may apply whatever test the Supreme Court comes up with.“We’re never going to be able to get to certainty, but on these sorts of profits questions and these sorts of remedies questions, a reasonable approximation is good enough, and it’s certainly better than awarding all or nothing,” said Brian Fletcher, an attorney with the U.S. Solicitor General’s Office.A ruling in Samsung Electronics v. Apple, which began in 2011 in federal court, is expected sometime before next June.This story has been updated with background and details from the hearing."

46,POLITICS,Think The Trump Video Changed A Lot Of Minds? Maybe Not.,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-respect-women-poll_us_57fc1146e4b0b6a43034f4ea,Voters who thought Donald Trump respected women mostly still do.,2016-10-11,Not even boasting about sexual assault could sway his core supporters.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fc1ad91b0000df1cef6077.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even before the release of a video that showed Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault, most voters didn’t think he respected women. But Friday’s revelation had only a modest effect on the minds of those who did, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey.Thirty-two percent of registered voters now think Trump respects women, identical to the percentage who said so in a poll taken days before the video’s release. The share who say he does not respect women rose from 54 percent to 59 percent, as some people left the “not sure” camp. The percentage of voters who say that a Trump presidency would be bad for women ― 46 percent ― is also up only slightly from the 42 percent who said so prior to Friday afternoon.The lack of change shows how deeply opinions can harden along partisan lines, with voters willing to rationalize away criticism of the candidate they support.While just 48 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said in April that Trump respected women, that number rose to 60 percent once he became their party’s nominee ― and it’s stayed there. In the post-video survey, 60 percent still say that Trump respects women. A quarter say that he does not, up from 20 percent in the previous poll.Trump’s political opponents, conversely, remain near-unanimous in condemning him. Ninety-one percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters now say that Trump does not respect women, compared to 87 percent in the previous survey.The biggest change was among the small slice of independent voters who don’t lean toward either party. More than 60 percent of them now say Trump does not respect women.Surveys released so far this week have found varying results on how much the controversy has affected Americans’ opinions of Trump. The HuffPost/YouGov survey differs significantly from a poll by NBC and SurveyMonkey, which found the percentage of likely voters who think Trump doesn’t respect women at all jumping from 39 percent to 46 percent in the aftermath of the video’s release.One potential reason for the discrepancy: While the HuffPost/YouGov poll laid out a binary set of options ― Trump does or does not respect women ― the NBC/SurveyMonkey offered a more gradual scale, asking people whether Trump respects women “a lot,” “some,” “not much” or “not at all.”Another poll from NBC and The Wall Street Journal, which showed Hillary Clinton’s lead over Trump growing into the double digits, found that 41 percent of voters believe what Trump said on the video was “completely unacceptable because it crosses a boundary into describing kissing and touching women in a sexual way without their consent.” Thirty-one percent said it was “inappropriate, but typical of how some men talk in private with other men.” Another 8 percent said they didn’t agree with either of those statements, while 20 percent said they hadn’t heard enough about the video or weren’t sure.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 8-10 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling. Data from all HuffPost/YouGov polls can be found here. More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov’s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate. Click here for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error."

By contrast, only 35 percent of Clinton supporters feel the same way. Similarly, the poll found that 68 percent of Trump supporters still believe that President Barack Obama “is hiding important information about his background and early life.” On the other hand, 84 percent of Clinton supporters consider this “definitely not true.”A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in September, just after Trump publicly renounced the Obama birther conspiracy, found similar results. Trump has been one of the loudest proponents of the birtherism myth, but apparently even his rejection of the conspiracy isn’t enough to change his supporters’ minds.Clinton supporters are mainly suspicious about Trump’s tax returns. Eighty-five percent of them said they believe Trump is either “possibly” or “definitely” not releasing his tax returns “because they would show his close financial ties to political and business figures in Russia.” A much lower number of Trump supporters ― 46 percent ― believe the same.The poll also asked respondents if they believe President George W. Bush knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened, consider global warming to be a myth concocted by scientists, and think 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was faked in order to increase support for gun control. Although there was some partisan divide in support for each of these theories, it was not as pronounced as it was in questions about the current presidential nominees.

Burnett said he does not have the ability or the right to release footage or audio related to the show. MGM is also restricted by contractual and legal requirements from releasing that material.However, Burnett said he has not threatened legal action to anyone who may leak such material.Burnett also pointed out in the statement that he has consistently supported Democrat campaigns. “I am not now and have never been a supporter of Donald Trump’s candidacy,” Burnett told Politico. “I am NOT ‘Pro-Trump.’ Further, my wife and I reject the hatred, division and misogyny that has been a very unfortunate part of his campaign.”Whether or not “Apprentice” recordings are released in the coming days remains to be seen, but The Huffington Post did uncover a 2010 transcript from an unaired moment of the show that reveals The Donald boorishly declaring himself to be “a skin man.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It’s the vibes. The goooood vibes, man. Over the weekend, as thousands of people sat within the festival’s dusty grounds listening to music, practicing yoga, channeling chakras, drinking beer and hanging out, the openness of the festival is what’s most notable. People smile at one another just to wish their peers well. Shoes (and showers) are most certainly optional. Hugs last minutes. People actually talk to each another ― which, if you’re familiar with California, you know is a rarity in the isolating car-culture. And people dance .... a lot. There’s happiness in the simplicity that is Joshua Tree Music Festival. Let’s be real: the indica and sativa wafting through the grounds likely enhanced the collective bliss at the festival, but the whole experience ultimately created itself thanks to the incredible music that united everyone. Over the days, musicians from different countries and genres performed on four different stages for people ― young and old ― vendors and artists reflecting the diversity music can, and should, have.From Jelly Bread and soulful Gene Evaro Jr., to Afro-funk Zimbabwe-based Mokoomba and Argentina’s Femina, to Sirens of Soul and Ronkat Spearman’s Katdelics, the music did exactly what music is supposed to do: inspire, arouse and blow your mind. Until the next JTMF festival in May 2017, share in the countercultural experience of the festival. And as always, peace and love, amigos. Peace and love. "

53,POLITICS,Of Course The Republican Party Is Going To War With Itself,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-party-war_us_57fd10ede4b068ecb5e1e65b,"A reckoning is coming, but Donald Trump thinks it's already here.",2016-10-11,"Donald Trump has blamed his sagging poll numbers on GOP leaders who give him ""zero support.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fd2c011a00006e145b8ad2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― On Monday night, hours after Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told House Republicans that he was effectively washing his hands of Donald Trump, the GOP nominee took the stage at a rally in Pennsylvania and basically vowed that, if elected, he would make sure Ryan was no longer speaker.“You have people that can’t fix the budget, and then they start talking about their nominee, but they can’t fix the budget,” Trump said, using a knock on Ryan that he tweeted the same day. “Isn’t it — isn’t it sad that we don’t have stronger leadership on both sides? But that’ll change if we win on Nov. 8, believe me.”Of course, Trump has no actual power to remove Ryan as speaker. Any one member of Congress could force that vote ― as Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) signaled in 2015 that he would do to former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) if Boehner didn’t leave on his own ― and the speaker goes up for a floor vote at the beginning of every new Congress. And Ryan may have more trouble on that vote than he expects.But what Trump is really doing, besides spewing his normal empty promises, is signaling what most Republicans have expected for a while now: There is a reckoning coming, and he’s not waiting until Nov. 9 to start it.Via Twitter on Tuesday morning ― because of course ― Trump continued his shots at Ryan, calling him a “weak and ineffective” speaker and blaming his own sinking presidential poll numbers, “despite winning the second debate in a landslide,” on Ryan.“It is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support,” Trump tweeted/fever dreamed.In discussions with Republican members of Congress and top GOP aides, everyone acknowledged that the current situation with Trump and the die-hard segment of his base was untenable. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to talk more freely about Trump and the Republican Party.Yes, these sources said, there will have to be a real battle for the soul of the GOP. But unlike Trump, they don’t think a month before the election is the right time to begin an internecine Twitter fight.“He clearly knows he’s going to lose, and he’s going to blame everyone but himself,” one aide said.The aide noted the foolishness of Republicans starting a war four weeks before Election Day, but said the GOP would have to address Trump after the election.“Come Nov. 9, there will be a fight for who we are, what we stand for,” the aide said.There isn’t any sort of formalized plan for this fight ― “How do you have any fight in politics?” the aide asked rhetorically ― but most believe it will have to begin with leaders like Ryan speaking out against Trump’s brand of politics.“We will lose voters over it,” one conservative member told HuffPost on Tuesday. “But does it have to happen? Maybe.”Another member added: “This is the fight we have to have.”Everyone acknowledged that Trump would take a segment of his most devoted followers with him, perhaps even into a new party, maybe to just a new Breibart-y cable channel, but the aim seems to be less about cleaving the most deplorable element of the Republican Party and more about trying to redirect the conversation toward something less ugly.“We don’t want the party to break in half, we want to bring it back together under more sensible principles,” that same GOP aide said.Exactly how possible, or likely, that scenario is will depend greatly on Trump himself.If his current behavior is any indication, Trump has no intention of bringing Republicans back together. He is actively engaged in a campaign blaming his electoral problems on other Republicans. And the election is still a month away. One can only imagine what Trump will be like after he loses, with extra time and extra bitterness.If Ryan does try to play the role of Trump alternative, Trump almost certainly will redirect his anger toward the January speaker election. And the conservatives who were already angry with Ryan ― but in no small part disagree with Trump ― will be forced to decide whether they’ll do Trump’s bidding. At the same time, the handful of strongly pro-Trump members, ones who have traditionally not caused problems for GOP leaders, will have to decide whose side they’re on as well.Another conservative member agreed that making Ryan’s upcoming speaker vote a “referendum” on the Trump v. Ryan battle could complicate that math. “I think Paul Ryan was already in trouble, so I don’t know if this helps or hurts him more,” the member said.“I don’t think a lot of conservatives are going to want to vote for Donald Trump’s vision of the Republican Party in January,” he said.On Monday night, on the same stage from which he suggested a leadership change for both parties, Trump called up a few of his most dedicated supporters: Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), and two Pennsylvania representatives who were early to jump on the Trump train, Lou Barletta and Tom Marino.With the addition of another dozen or so strongly pro-Trump members ― members like Reps. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) and Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.), and the five Republicans who spoke out on a conference call Monday when Ryan announced that he would no longer be defending or campaigning with Trump: Reps. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), Trent Franks (R-Ariz.), Billy Long (R-Mo.), John Carter (R-Texas) and Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) ― Ryan could have some trouble in January.For now, he seems content to ignore those issues, ignore the Trump tweets, and continue working toward keeping the Republican majority. For Ryan’s sake, and the sake of House Republicans, he’s hoping to keep as many GOP seats as possible. Perhaps the best-scenario for Ryan is that House Republicans dramatically outperform Trump, and Trump loses severely.“The worst-case scenario,” one aide said, “is that he rallies and loses a squeaker.”"
54,MEDIA,"After Clinton-Trump Debate, The Cable Panels Were Dominated By Men",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-clinton-cable-news-gender_us_57fd4558e4b07b9b875304ab,"More than 2-to-1 on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News.",2016-10-11,Cable news panels were male-dominated even as gender was front-and-center at debate. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even before it began, it was clear what Sunday night’s presidential debate would revolve around.Republican nominee Donald Trump came into the town hall event reeling from the publication of a hot-mic video in which he used lewd and predatory language about women, including speaking about grabbing women by the crotch. He responded attacking Bill Clinton for his sexual indiscretions. He then went further by holding a panel broadcast on Facebook Live just before the debate with women accusing the former president of sexual harassment and assault. He then seated them in the front row during it.The entire episode became fodder for the debate, adding yet another chapter to a campaign defined by gender: from the historic nature of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy to the routine misogyny from the Republican nominee. And yet, when it came time to analyze the one-and-a-half-hour affair, the viewing audience was offered a male-dominated perspective among the anchors, reporters and pundits tasked with dissecting the evening’s key exchanges and scoring the respective candidates.In the hour after Trump and Clinton begrudgingly shook hands, male talking heads outnumbered female talking heads by more than 2-to-1 on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News, according to a Huffington Post tally. This tally didn’t include campaign or party officials or post-debate focus groups.On ABC, CBS and PBS, post-debate coverage only went around a half-hour after the debate ended before cutting out to local east coast news broadcasts (NBC stuck to its lucrative Sunday night football franchise). On those three broadcast channels, the ratio of men to women talking heads was 14 men to 9 women.All told, the ratio across six broadcast and cable networks was 37 to 20.While total on-air staffing may appear lopsided, five of six networks notably featured women journalists as anchor or co-anchor. It’s impossible to draw firm conclusions as to how this gender disparity affected debate analysis on television. Certainly, there were plenty of male pundits and reporters who were critical of Trump’s gambit. There were also female pundits and reporters who concluded that he’d had a relatively effective night ― stabilizing a campaign that was considered on the brink of collapsing.And that may have contributed to the conventional wisdom immediately following the debate ― that Trump had a relatively decent night ― while the public opinion polls ended up showing Clinton the clear winner.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

U.S. authorities have asserted that Mesa shot Hernandez in self-defense.Lawyers for Hernandez’s family disputed that account, saying he was playing a game with other teenagers in which they would run across a culvert from the Mexican side and touch the U.S. border fence before dashing back.The FBI also said Hernandez was a known immigrant smuggler who had been pressed into service by smuggling gangs that took advantage of his youth. Hernandez guided illegal immigrants into the United States, the FBI said.Hernandez’s family sued both the U.S. federal government and Mesa. The Supreme Court appeal only concerns the claims against Mesa.The case was seized on by activists who accused the United States of using heavy-handed tactics in dealing with immigration and human smuggling.The shooting was condemned by Mexico’s government and prompted demonstrations in Ciudad Juarez.The court will hear oral arguments and decide the case in its current term, which ends in June. The justices also announced on Tuesday that they will hear three related cases on a similar legal question concerning whether immigrants detained after the Sept. 11 attacks who said they faced abusive treatment can sue government officials.(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)"
59,POLITICS,Chicago Teachers Just Avert Strike That Would Impact Hundreds Of Thousands Of Students,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-teachers-strike_us_57fc0ff3e4b0e655eab70434,"The teachers, who've worked without a contract since June 2015,  still have to vote on the tentative deal.",2016-10-11,"Teachers picket outside Morgan Park High School in Chicago during the last major strike in the city, in 2012.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Teachers in Chicago, the nation’s third-largest school district, narrowly avoided a strike Monday night. Minutes before the midnight strike deadline, the Chicago Teachers Union came to a tentative contract agreement with the city’s education board.Chicago teachers have been working without a contract since June 2015, when the previous pact expired. Negotiations stalled for months over teacher pay, pension contributions and classroom resources, according to The Associated Press. Some of the city’s 20,000 unionized teachers voted last month to authorize a strike after more than a year of negotiations with Chicago Board of Education failed to produce a new contract. Union delegates set an Oct. 11 strike date if talks continued to falter. However, the school board made a last-ditch proposal late Monday that “does look significantly better” than previous offers, said union president Karen Lewis, according to the Chicago Tribune. The tentative agreement is not “a final contract,” says a statement from the union. “Every active member of the Chicago Teachers Union will have an opportunity to review and vote on the agreement before a contract is ratified.” That process could take several weeks, CBS reports.The education board, which Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed, initially wanted teachers to make larger contributions to their own pension funds and health insurance in exchange for a pay raise. For months, teachers rejected the givebacks and said they wanted the city to give surplus tax money to schools. Under the tentative agreement, the district would continue to contribute to pension funds for veteran teachers. However, new teachers will receive pay raises in lieu of the pension help, according to CNN.“What I will tell you is that it wasn’t easy, as you all know,” said Lewis during a press conference Monday night. “Clearly, we had some issues and there’s some things we’re going to still be working on. But what we found is that what we ended up with is something that’s good for kids, is good for clinicians, is good for paraprofessionals, for teachers, for the community and we’re very pleased that we were able to come to this tentative agreement.” The mayor said all sides “came together to work together with a common purpose” in the end.“The teachers’ hard work will be respected in this contract, and appropriately rewarded,” said Emanuel, per the Chicago Tribune. “Chicago Public Schools’ finances will be stronger and on firmer ground because of this agreement.” Teachers were instructed to show up and protest outside of schools Tuesday morning if an agreement wasn’t reached. Activist and Chicago Public School student Asean Johnson told The Huffington Post Monday that he would support his teachers on the picket lines if they had to strike. “We’re not getting the funding we need. There’s too may budget cuts, too many teachers getting laid off. I know a few people who said they had to leave the city because of Chicago Public Schools and that shouldn’t happen,” the 13-year-old student said Monday. “I love my teachers ... They actually help us out if we need help, they’re the teachers you want to have in your school. They come and check on you just to see how you’re doing. If you’re having a bad day they’ll talk to you about it. That’s the type of teachers they are.”The school district in recent years has been plagued with mismanagement and financial difficulties. In 2015, former schools CEO Barbara Byrd Bennett pleaded guilty in an elaborate bribery arrangement. In August, the district laid off more than 1,000 staff members. Had an agreement not been reached, it would have been the second major strike for CTU since 2012. "
60,SCIENCE,"The Pluto Flyby Is Nearing Its End, But We Can Still Visit In VR",Bahar Gholipour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pluto-virtual-reality_us_57f5642be4b05f39c51e05bc,"From its giant icy heart to its mountain ranges, there’s a lot to (virtually) explore on the dwarf planet.",2016-10-11,"Alan Stern, a NASA scientist who led the mission for the exploration of Pluto, checks out the Pluto VR experience.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fd0ed21a00006e145b8a28.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I started tracking around the Sputnik Planum on the left chamber of Pluto’s icy heart. I picked up a rock bigger than myself and threw it to watch it float away in the slow motion that comes with low gravity. I went up icy mountains, and looked around — there were miles of rugged cratered terrain, bearing witness to the dwarf planet’s old history of meteor showers. Then I went back to my virtual spaceship, hovering under a starry sky and a dim blob of a sun, to transport myself to Krun Macula, the dark regions named after a mythical lord of the underworld.It can be both exhilarating and dizzying to walk up and down Pluto’s cliffs in the immersive world of virtual reality, especially for the uninitiated like me. But I was mostly amazed to find myself in a virtual world composed entirely of images and data acquired and sent to Earth by NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft only a year ago.My virtual visit to Pluto took place at an event held by CuriosityStream, a young company that provides subscription-based streaming of documentary film. The VR experience is an appendix to an 11-episode series called “Destination: Pluto,” said Jorge Franzini, a producer of the series. Planetary scientist Alan Stern, the principal investigator of NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto, also got a chance to put on goggles and walk around.“I was very impressed. I want them to VR the rest of the planet. The samples they did were fabulous,” he said. It all started with a postal stamp in 1991, which read “Pluto Not Yet Explored.” That’s how Stern likes to begin telling the story of the Pluto mission and how scientists were motivated to better understand the dwarf planet’s unique status in our solar system.Pluto, first discovered in 1930, is so far away that hardly any reliable data about it could make it to Earth. But in July 2015, on its 9-year, 3-billion-mile journey, New Horizons flew past Pluto. The spacecraft’s high-resolution photos revealed its surprisingly complex geology: glaciers of nitrogen ice, avalanches, old traces of once-flowing rivers, volcanoes and mountain peaks some 11,000 feet tall. (The “Pluto Not Yet Explored” stamp also traveled with the spacecraft as an onboard memento, setting a Guinness World Record for the farthest distance traveled by a stamp.)New Horizons has continued phoning home data from the flyby, which ends this month. It will then continue its journey in the Kuiper Belt ― the part of the solar system beyond Neptune’s orbit ― to reach another object some 1 billion miles beyond Pluto by 2019.About 95 percent of New Horizons data is already home, and scientists have learned about some major features in the icy world. “We were very surprised to find out that Pluto is still geologically alive,” Stern said. “It has upended our ideas of how planetary geophysics works.”Pluto is so small and so far from the sun that most scientists expected it to freeze beyond any chance of creating new geology today.“Obviously that naive idea is incorrect. And Pluto proved that once and for all,” Stern said. “Now we’re back at the drawing board, trying to figure out how small planets work.”Pluto’s complexity was another surprise. Most planetary bodies in the solar system have a few major feature types. Take the moon or Mercury. They’re virtually all craters, with some mountain ranges created by cratering. Some less-typical planetary objects have five or six features. Pluto has a dozen more.“It’s just the whole package. For being so small, it’s the most complex small planet that we’ve ever seen. It’s as complex as larger planets like Mars or the Earth,” Stern said.Pluto has also uniquely engaged people. The mission’s webpage received over 2 billion views in one day. The news of the flyby was on the front page of hundreds of newspapers. Space people or scientists weren’t the only ones interested in the Pluto mission, Stern says. It became part of the social fabric and, of course, an internet phenomenon.That massive social engagement, Stern says, illustrates the mission’s inspirational power. He’s received letters and has had conversations with people after his talks and in the airport who share their fascination or tell him their kids now want to go into science and engineering. “Hopefully, this will inspire people to do even bigger things. Because there are so many big challenges to rid the world of poverty and pollution, and to do that, it’s going to happen through technology. We need to inspire more people to go into tech careers to solve problems like these, and space exploration is one way to do that.”Now that New Horizons is off to exploring other Kuiper Belt objects, Stern is expecting many more surprises. “You could not have predicted the amazing discoveries at Pluto, even though we have been to a couple of objects in the solar system that were at least a little analogous to Pluto,” Stern said. “We’ve never been to anything like where we are going next, either. I don’t make predictions, except to say to expect to see something wonderful.”I asked Stern what really went through his mind when he first saw there was a heart shape on Pluto. “I was in a room where the data was being displayed, hot off the press, and one of our media people said it’s heart-shaped. And I thought, ‘Oh that’s silly,’” he recalled.“But then I looked up and saw that it really did look like a heart. We knew that would make Pluto a lot more approachable to the public. I mean, who can’t like a heart?” Stern continued. “Like many aspects of this mission, the public participation was phenomenal ― and I always say, ‘Pluto did its part.’”"

It’s worth emphasizing that if he actually won that role ― and it’s looking less likely that he will ― Trump would become the boss of millions of people. A man with a long track record of misogyny and sexual harassment (even before that damning video dropped) would be in charge of many, many female employees.No company would allow such a boss to operate ― not once public reports of his embarrassing behavior surfaced.

Fox has come a long way since Bill O’Reilly faced sexual harassment charges a decade ago and emerged unscathed.)The 2005 video was hardly the first report on Trump’s objectionable behavior toward women to surface. Trump and his companies have been sued for mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits, USA Today reported Monday.While there’s no doubt that there is still a good deal of unconscious bias against women in the business and political world, Trump actually appears to explicitly operate under the belief that women are inferior. Women are objects to be ranked, as he did in his appearances on Howard Stern’s shows. They’re vessels to carry babies and they’re caretakers to manage households and children, as reflected in his parental leave policy, which leaves men out entirely.The most important role a woman could ever have, Trump’s daughter said in a recent ad, is as a mother.His party members hold similar views, though maybe some of them don’t even realize it. This week, even as many Republicans condemned Trump’s treatment of women, they couched their criticism “as fathers of daughters” and “husbands of wives,” as though the mistreatment of women could only be understood via their role toward men. “[Trump]’s terribly sexist. He’s a womanizer for sure,” longtime Trump Organization executive Barbara Res told the Daily Beast’s Olivia Nuzzi in an interview this week. “He hired me for a specific reason: Because I was really good. And he told me, and he believed this, that women had to work harder and be smarter.”“‘Men are better than women,’” Res quotes Trump as saying, “‘but a good woman is better than 10 men.’”Most businesses today have a clear no-tolerance policy about sexual discrimination and harassment. Many companies are even looking at their pay practices to ensure gender equity. They’re establishing parental leave policies that include men.It’s 2016 and gender equality is the standard practice and language of the business world. Of course, sexual discrimination and harassment still exists. Just this month, a handful of McDonald’s workers filed sexual harassment claims against the fast food giant. It’s just that no one thinks it’s OK anymore.No company in the world would publicly tolerate its employees ― let alone its CEO ― publicly objectifying female employees. Never mind an employee talking about how he just grabs them by “the pussy,” as Trump did in that video.“It is not clear if Mr. Trump would qualify to be hired as a janitor, let alone a senior executive,” Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in The New York Times. The piece explains that most companies today are pretty strict about this kind of thing ― we’ve long moved past the “Mad Men” era. The business world, which the party has long championed, has moved past its misogynistic policies. When will the Republicans catch up?"

The 49ers, who started the season 1–4 with starting quarterback Blaine Gabbert, currently rank 30th of 32 teams in passing yards, according to ESPN. Kaepernick hasn’t started for the 49ers for 11 months, but he nevertheless became the center of the sports world in August when he decided to sit out the national anthem during a preseason game in August to bring light to the mistreatment of people of color in the U.S. Kaepernick has since decided to kneel instead of sit, but his protests have nonetheless led to similar protests throughout the NFL, in high schools and now in the NBA, too. Kaepernick was thwarted by injuries over the summer and was occasionally bested by Gabbert during practice. Now, however, he has his shot amid negotiations with the team to restructure his contract. Kelly said that when he told Kaepernick of the coaching staff’s decision to start him on Sunday, the quarterback simply replied, “Let’s go.”The team faces off against the 3–2 Buffalo Bills on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET."

On Tuesday, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau opened the Toronto Stock Exchange in honor of the International Day of the Girl, a day dedicated to driving attention to the challenges that girls face worldwide. The wife of the Canadian Prime Minister stood alongside three organizations ― G(irls)20, FitSpirit/Fillactive and Plan International Canada ― and called for governments and companies to increase investments in girls to keep them in school and get them into leadership roles. She also said men need to get on board to bring about real change.“Make sure that men are an active part of the solution,” Grégoire Trudeau said in a release from G(irls)20, which works to increase women’s participation in the workforce. “It is only with the full participation of all actors that we will be able to give more women and girls the opportunity to reach their potential,” Grégoire Trudeau also said.Farah Mohamed, the CEO of G(irls)20, noted at the event that people need to realize how “investing time and resources into girls pays off,” reports the Canadian Press.The Organization for Economic Co‑operation and Development estimates that reducing the gender gap in labor force participation by 50 percent across its 35 member nations would boost gross domestic product 6 percent by 2030.Just one extra year of primary school increases girls’ future wages by 10 to 20 percent, according to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. “We still have a lot of work to do,” Grégoire Trudeau said, per the G(irls)20 release. “Investing in girls is a key step in the fight for gender equality. It also gives us the opportunity to recognize that gender equality is not an issue faced by just half of the population, but by all.”"

Trump was already married to his current wife, Melania, who was likely pregnant at the time of the recording.Crouch referred to Trump as an “idolater” for indulging in “sexual immorality” and attacked him for repeatedly failing to repent for his actions. He also accused Trump’s Christian supporters of looking past the Republican nominee’s moral failings at the expense of their religious integrity.“Enthusiasm for a candidate like Trump gives our neighbors ample reason to doubt that we believe Jesus is Lord,” wrote the Christianity Today editor. “They see that some of us are so self-interested, and so self-protective, that we will ally ourselves with someone who violates all that is sacred to us.”Nearly two-thirds of white evangelical voters in the U.S. are standing behind Trump, even after the video’s release. But that percentage has declined significantly in recent months ― and it may continue plummeting as more Christians, evangelicals and Republicans speak out against their once-revered candidate.Megachurch pastor James MacDonald, a member of Trump’s own evangelical advisory council, sent an email to others in the group over the weekend calling the Republican nominee “lecherous and worthless.” MacDonald, like many others, didn’t accept Trump’s excuse that his comments in the 2005 video were nothing but “locker room talk.”On Sunday, prominent evangelical theologian and former Trump-supporter Wayne Grudem published a column condemning the nominee’s “moral character” and urging him to withdraw from the election.Trump also lost support from his Mormon base over the weekend, as several Mormon Republican officials pulled their endorsements. Deseret News, a media outlet owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, published an editorial on Saturday calling on Trump to step down. “In democratic elections,” the outlet’s editors wrote, “ideas have consequences, leadership matters and character counts.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fcdd7b1b0000df1cef6227.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British actress Emma Watson condemned child marriage during a visit to Malawi on Monday, calling on authorities across Africa to end the practice that can put young lives as risk as well as stopping girls get an education and a better future.Watson, 26, a goodwill ambassador for UN Women, was visiting the southeastern African nation a day ahead of the International Day of the Girl Child.In 2015, Malawi passed a law to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18 with UN Women working with traditional chiefs to change local practices.“Meeting with young girls, who like many in their country, are struggling with poverty and were pressured into early marriage ... made me realize just how important it is for women to be able to make their own choices,” Watson said in a statement.“It’s so encouraging to see how such a harmful practice can be stopped when communities work together,” added the actress who rose to fame as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series.U.N. data shows that globally, one-third of girls in developing countries, excluding China, are married before the age of 18, denying them their childhood and right to go to school.Even though Malawi has now made child marriage illegal, campaigners have voiced concerns that marriages regulated by custom can occur informally.During her visit, Watson met with traditional leaders who have championed the annulment of child marriages in their communities.Worldwide, 15 million girls are married as children every year, according to UK-based campaign group Girls Not Brides.Campaigners say child marriage deprives girls of an education, increases the risk of domestic violence, death or serious injuries if they have children before their bodies are ready.Yet the practice persists because some societies view girls as a financial burden while others believe a girl should marry as early as possible to maximize her fertility.In July, Gambia became the 13th nation in Africa to join the African Union’s campaign to end child marriage, which aims to raise awareness of the risks of the practice.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is unconstitutional.Rather than disband the CFPB entirely, a tribunal of judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the agency will now function under direct oversight of the president, who will have the power to fire the agency’s director at will.The decision, if it stands, would likely weaken the CFPB’s effectiveness by subjecting it to the political whims of a less hospitable White House some time in the future.U.S. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the decision that the CFPB’s “single-director structure” violates the separation of powers specified by the Constitution by vesting one person with vast power “unchecked by the president.” Prior to the decision, the president could only fire the director for very specific reasons.The president and Congress have imposed accountability on federal agencies of comparable authority to the CFPB by structuring them so they are headed by multiple individuals, according to Kavanaugh.“The CFPB’s concentration of enormous executive power in a single, unaccountable, unchecked Director not only departs from settled historical practice, but also poses a far greater risk of arbitrary decision-making and abuse of power, and a far greater threat to individual liberty, than does a multi-member independent agency,” the judge wrote.The case against the CFPB was brought by PHH Corp., a mortgage services firm fighting a $109 million fine levied by the agency. The court’s decision also does away with PHH’s fine.The panel of judges was not expected to rule in favor of the CFPB. Kavanaugh and fellow Circuit Judge Raymond Randolph appeared to be sympathetic to PHH’s case during oral arguments in April. The federal government can ask the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider its ruling. The recent wave of Obama appointees to the court may suggest a rehearing is possible. Regardless of that outcome, the next stop would be the U.S. Supreme Court, which in recent years hasn’t shied away from defining the powers of administrative agencies.The appeals court ruling represents a major victory for financial companies and conservatives, who have been dead set against the agency’s existence since it was created by the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.The agency’s role in revealing Wells Fargo’s misdeeds in September ― and punishing the bank ― illustrates why financial institutions view the CFPB as such a fierce adversary. Together with other regulators, it caught Wells Fargo secretly opening unauthorized accounts for its customers. The consumer watchdog then slapped the bank with a $185 million fine ― the largest in the agency’s history ― for encouraging the illegal behavior.Warren, a bankruptcy law expert who chaired the congressional oversight panel on bank bailouts prior to being elected to the Senate, is credited with coming up with the idea for the CFPB. She envisioned it policing financial products in a way that resembles how the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission supervises material goods.President Barack Obama tapped Warren to set up the organization, but did not choose her to lead it. Instead, he appointed Richard Cordray, the current CFPB director, during a congressional recess in January 2012, in order to circumvent congressional opposition.Kavanaugh acknowledged Warren in the ruling, arguing that Congress had departed from her original vision for the CFPB, as well as that of the White House and some House Democrats, by making it a single-director agency.“As proposed by then-Professor and now-Senator Elizabeth Warren, the CFPB was to be another traditional, multi-member independent agency,” Kavanaugh wrote.But, he noted, “Congress ultimately departed from the Warren and Administration proposals, and from the House bill.”The CFPB expressed its disappointment in the court’s decision, arguing that requiring “cause” to remove the agency director is constitutional.“The Bureau believes that Congress’s decision to make the Director removable only for cause is consistent with Supreme Court precedent and the Bureau is considering options for seeking further review of the Court’s decision,” CFPB spokeswoman Moira Vahey said in a statement.Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit coalition that supports tough banking regulations, also denounced Tuesday’s ruling.“Compromising the CFPB’s independence would be a huge gift to Wall Street greed and a loss for consumers.

President Barack Obama is weighing potential responses, said White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Tuesday. That could mean fresh economic sanctions against Russia, which is already dealing with U.S. and European sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Three other governments that have waged cyber offensives against the U.S. ― Iran, North Korea and China ― are already subject to U.S. deterrents.Russian government-linked hackers have been regularly targeting Democrats and Republicans alike for over a year, NBC News reported. But all the hacked materials made public so far through sites like Russia-friendly WikiLeaks and upstart DCLeaks.com have been embarrassing to the Democratic Party and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Meanwhile, her GOP rival, Donald Trump, has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, misrepresented Putin’s aggressive actions in Syria and Ukraine, and surrounded his own campaign with advisers linked to Russia government-linked businesses. Clinton and her allies have accused Putin of trying to ensure that Trump will win. Ambassador Kislyak declined on Tuesday to answer questions about what a Clinton or Trump victory would mean for Russia, saying only that he was unhappy with the way his country was being discussed in the context of the election.But the perception of favor is widespread, as a Washington Post editorial calling Trump “Putin’s Puppet” showed on Monday. And the Republican nominee has done little to directly combat it. By arguing at Sunday night’s presidential debate that he doesn’t even know if hacking has occurred, despite the fact that he has been briefed on the matter, Trump has helped keep the story alive.The Russians have played their part in advancing that perception, too ― by, for instance, asking a United Nations human rights official to apologize for his condemnations of hateful rhetoric by Trump and various far-right European politicians who are also friendly with Putin.Russia’s specific response to the hacking accusations has matched its general rhetorical stance: The U.S. is saber-rattling and inviting Russian aggression, while Russia only seeks peace.“Every day, Putin’s site gets attacked by tens of thousands of hackers. Many of these attacks can be traced to U.S. territory. It’s not as though we accuse the White House or Langley of doing it each time it happens,” Putin’s spokesman said last week, using a nickname for CIA headquarters.Support for Russia’s narrative relies heavily on global distrust of the U.S. and its motives. It’s this kind of suspicion that Putin played on when he went before the United Nations last year and told the West, “Do you realize now what you have done?”Putin seeks to put the blame for fueling terror on the U.S. and to exploit broader Western regret over the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent growth of the Islamic State, as well as unhappiness with past U.S. policies like aiding militants in Afghanistan in the 1980s.Meanwhile, he ignores Russia’s own role in fomenting extremism by sending radicalized individuals to Syria, where they can aid the Islamic State and other groups, and helping to violently suppress Muslim-majority populations in Syria, Chechnya and elsewhere. Kislyak denied Tuesday that Russia has targeted hospitals in its campaign to support Syrian tyrant Bashar Assad, saying any medical facilities that were attacked must not have been marked as hospitals. Doctors Without Borders has strongly disputed that portrayal.All of this hardly suggests that Russia wants to see good faith in U.S.-Russian relations.Last week, the Russian embassy in Washington publicly claimed that the U.S. might provide air support to radical Islamists in Syria.The ambassador didn’t mention the tweet on Tuesday."

In a column published by CNN, Obama shared new details about how NASA and its corporate partners plan to reach Mars and return to Earth, outlining a vision much like that of billionaire business magnate Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX.“We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America’s story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time,” Obama wrote. “Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we’re already well on our way.”Obama referenced a quote by Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan, who said, “We went to explore the Moon, and in fact discovered the Earth.”“If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last,” Obama wrote, “we won’t just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we’ll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.”Obama’s column comes amid growing excitement surrounding mankind’s push for the red planet. Last month, Musk unveiled plans to make humans a “multi-planet species.” He hopes to eventually colonize Mars with a self-sustainable population of 1 million people by building a massive “Interplanetary Transport System.” Like something out of a science fiction film, giant spaceships would shuttle upwards of 100 people ― perhaps many more in the future ― plus luggage and other cargo to and from the red planet.Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company, has promised to give Musk’s SpaceX competition. Last week, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said he’s “convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket.” Boeing is working with NASA to build a new, powerful rocket. Known as the Space Launch System, it is designed for deep space missions, including Mars and beyond. Obama’s column echoed his statements from earlier in his presidency.“By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send humans to orbit Mars and return them safely to Earth,” the president said during a 2010 speech at the Kennedy Space Center. “And a landing on Mars will follow. And I expect to be around to see it.”In a joint blog post on Tuesday, White House Senior Advisor John Holdren and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden discussed other developments in America’s planned journey into deep space. They said six companies had received awards to develop habitation systems for long-duration space missions, including to Mars.“Make no mistake, the Journey to Mars will be challenging, but it is underway and with each one of these steps, we are pushing the boundaries of exploration and imagination for the Nation,” Holdren and Bolden wrote.Obama, in his CNN column, said one his earliest memories is sitting on his grandfather’s shoulders, waving a flag as American astronauts returned to Hawaii ― years before Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon.“Someday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders,” Obama wrote. “We’ll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we’ll know that because of the choices we make now, they’ve gone to space not just to visit, but to stay ― and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth.”Read Obama’s CNN opinion piece here.

Many European neighbors including Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Spain already run such centers.Australia and Canada have also taken the same path but it is a policy that has yet to make significant inroads outside of Western Europe despite campaigns for its introduction in some places such as New York state.“It’s also a strong political response, for a pragmatic and responsible policy that brings high-risk people back towards the health system rather than stigmatizing them,” Touraine said.The new center, located in a street adjoining Paris’s Gare du Nord train station, will allow addicts to inject with clean syringes and under supervision in order to curb overdose deaths and transmission of diseases spread by needle-sharing.Touraine said that the conditions of many hard drug users amounted to a public health emergency. As many as one in 10 was HIV-positive and up to one on four infected with hepatitis C, she said.Official statistics show drug use in France is heavily tilted towards cannabis, and while figures for hard drug use are harder to compile, a report by an interministerial committee on anti-narcotics policy estimates that the number taking heroin was in the region of 500,000, with another 1.5 million cocaine consumers.Touraine said about a hundred people were expected to make use of the new injection room each day from when it opens to users on Friday.Since Berne in 1986, more than 90 government-backed centers where users can inject in a safer, supervised environment have opened across the world, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addition, an EU-funded body.That body, created to promote a evidence-based approach to a morally divisive issue, said in a report in 2004 that benefits of such injection centers help improve safety, hygiene and access to social services."

He works at a construction site in an upscale neighborhood of Peshawar, a Pakistani city on the border with Afghanistan, but he knows it’s the last thing he will build in the country where he was born.Ameer, in his early thirties, owns a truck and some construction tools. They represent a lifetime’s work that he must now sell for a pittance because buyers in Peshawar know that he, like most others of Afghan origin, has to leave.“I was born here, in Pakistan,” he says. “My mother was pregnant with me when our family was forced to flee our home in Afghanistan.”Local police have warned his family, like countless other Afghan families, that they must leave Pakistan before a government-mandated deadline. Exploitation of refugees is rife, and friends of the family have sold their homes for less than a third of their value.Ameer’s family comes from the Pashtun-dominated Bati Kot district of Nangarhar Province, where he plans to move in the next few weeks. “It’s a home I have never been to,” he says.Nangarhar is not just a strange place to Ameer, it is a dangerous one. The province has now become a stronghold for ISIS in Afghanistan. Some 200 ISIS militants were killed there recently in a military offensive led by the Afghan government.After decades of accumulating Afghan refugees in return for international funding, Pakistan is now pushing them back. It is a controversial and sweeping move that is destroying livelihoods, tearing apart marriages, dividing families and violating basic human rights.After the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, an ensuing insurgency turned into a full-fledged jihadist movement, supported and funded by the United States, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, among others.This prompted generations of Afghans to migrate to Iran and Pakistan. According to the United Nations, some 6.2 million Afghans had migrated to Iran and Pakistan by the end of 1989 – the year the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. Constant conflicts and fresh invasions have kept topping up these numbers.Aided heavily by the U.N. Refugee Agency, the UNHCR, Pakistan hosts around 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees, while the unregistered numbers may go as high as 2.7 million. Pakistan’s government receives $133 million annually from the UNHCR.But these people have become hostages to Pakistan’s deteriorating relations with Afghanistan.A series of militant attacks on targets in Pakistan, including the murder of 141 students and teachers at a military school in late 2014, saw refugee camps on both sides of the porous border denounced as safe havens for terrorists by senior Pakistani officials.In June, relations between the two countries deteriorated further when the two countries’ security forces exchanged fire, killing one Afghan soldier and a Pakistan army officer.Meanwhile anti-Afghan and anti-refugee rhetoric has exploded on social media, with people baying to “kick them out.” Twitter users used hashtags like #AfghanRefugeesThreatToPak and #KickOutAfghans, which trended for days in Pakistan.Registered Afghan refugees have lived under the constant threat that their residency permits would lose their validity ever since the government announced that the paperwork would be invalid at the end of December 2015. But backdoor diplomatic efforts and an executive intervention from Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif saw the expiration date for the permits pushed to the end of 2016.Unspecified action against the unregistered Afghan refugees is due after November 15. Most observers expect this to mean a wholesale roundup. Thousands of people of Afghan origin have already been arrested and accused of involvement in kidnapping and criminal gangs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.Dr. Imran Zaib, chief commissioner for Afghan refugees, said more than 90,000 registered refugees were repatriated during July and August. He has publicly set a target of 240,000 Afghan refugees to be sent back to Afghanistan every month until December.Truck driver Haji Zareen is one of the statistics. He has packed whatever he owns and is moving to Afghanistan in the coming days.“I was seven when we moved here, and for me, Pakistan has been my home ever since. I’m going to Jalalabad,” he says, sipping his kahwah, a traditional green tea. “I have no clue about what I’m going to do there – no business, nothing,” he adds.A father of eight, he worries for his children, who surround him as he talks. “They are very afraid of going to a land totally foreign to them.”Afghan children born in Pakistan do not qualify for citizenship, Pakistan’s interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, recently told parliament. Even those born to a Pakistani mother and Afghan father would not qualify.Shamim Bibi’s husband and sons have been banished from Pakistan. Shamim is Pakistani and her husband is Afghan, making her one of the many Pakistani women facing the dilemma of separation from their families.“Our families have divided now. They have sent my husband to Afghanistan, [and he] has also taken my sons along with him,” she told reporters outside the Peshawar Press Club during a protest.Mona Naseer, a noted Pakistani human rights advocate and blogger, explains: “In Pakistan, the law allows a foreign woman who marries a Pakistani to acquire the nationality of her husband, but the converse is not permitted. A foreign man cannot acquire the citizenship of Pakistan by marrying a Pakistani woman, and that is the reason the Afghan men married to Pakistani women are being kicked out of the country.”Peshawar resident Roohullah Razaqi is one of them.“I was born and educated here. Now that I am being forced to leave, I’m uncertain about my future,” he says. “My wife is here from Peshawar, and I am left with no choice. She prefers getting divorced over moving with me to Afghanistan.”Prime Minister Sharif addressed the United Nations in September, stating that a “dignified repatriation of Afghan refugees” was underway. Yet this rhetoric clashes with Afghan students’ reality. The University of Peshawar has revoked the degrees of many Afghan students, as hundreds are expelled from schools and colleges.Adil is one such student, now at the metric stage of his schooling, equivalent to the 10th grade. He’s set to leave Pakistan with his family October 15. He fears losing his Urdu language skills along with everything else. “My medium of instruction until now has been Urdu, which is not being taught in Afghanistan,” he says. “My whole future is at stake and nobody seems to care.”This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

79,POLITICS,"The U.S. Is Part Of A War In Yemen, And Neither Clinton Nor Trump Will Talk About It",Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-yemen_us_57fc1d20e4b0b6a4303504d3,There's no evidence the next president has a plan forward for the country where American ally Saudi Arabia has been slaughtering civilians.,2016-10-11,"A coalition led by Saudi Arabia is accused of bombing a funeral hall in Sanaa, Yemen, killing more than 140 people.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57fc27b6170000bc16acaf54.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The U.S. is in a shooting war in Yemen, where the American military has spent years vaporizing suspected terrorists in airstrikes and a Saudi-led coalition is busily slaughtering civilians with American refueling and intelligence support. You wouldn’t know it from watching the second presidential debate Sunday night. Even after one of the deadliest attacks of the Saudi campaign — a series of airstrikes on a funeral in Sanaa, Yemen’s ancient capital, that killed more than 140 people Saturday — neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton was asked about whether the U.S. should keep aiding an ally that appears to be actively targeting civilians.Since debate moderators won’t ask the presidential candidates about Yemen, we did. But neither campaign answered, and their public statements alone make it impossible to tell whether they would continue President Barack Obama’s policy of supporting the Saudi-led coalition’s war against the Houthi rebel group that now controls much of the western part of the country, including the capital.“Shouldn’t this be something we’re discussing as a country?” asked Adam Baron, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who lived in Yemen from 2011 to 2014. “Shouldn’t the American people be aware of the fact that the U.S. is a major part of a war in Yemen?”Because the U.S. isn’t directly involved in the Saudi-led fight, there are no U.S. troops on the ground and both sides have committed human rights abuses, Yemen barely registers in the political consciousness of American voters. It’s hard to quantify exactly how little the electorate cares about Yemen because pollsters don’t even ask about it.That helps explain why Clinton and Trump have been able to campaign for over a year without ever being made to outline a plan forward in the country. It’s hard to say what Trump would do in Yemen. There’s no precedent to refer to, and the one time he talked about Yemen at length was back in January. See if you can make sense of what he said: “Now they’re going into Yemen, and if you look at Yemen, take a look … they’re going to get Syria, they’re going to get Yemen, unless … trust me, a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in, but let’s just sort of leave it the way it is. They get Syria, they get Yemen. Now they didn’t want Yemen, but you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia? They want Saudi Arabia. So what are they going to have? They’re gonna have Iraq, they’re gonna have Iran, they’re gonna have Iraq, they’re gonna have Yemen, they’re gonna have Syria, they’re gonna have everything!”If Trump were to become president, he’d likely be off to a rocky start with the kingdom. A former Saudi intelligence chief broke a cardinal rule of diplomacy with foreign allies earlier this year and criticized Trump’s proposed Muslim ban at a dinner event. “I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November,” Prince Turki al Faisal said at the time. It’s possible Trump would try to rebuild relations with officials in Saudi Arabia, where he appears to be pursuing a hotel development project. At the same time, his past comments about ditching NATO allies who don’t pay enough for U.S. protection suggest he could also be quick to cut off the Saudis. Clinton hasn’t offered a plan, either. But her record offers some clues about how she might act. She made a historic trip to Yemen as secretary of state in 2011, when she pledged a “balanced approach” to the country ― meaning social and economic support as well as counterterrorism cooperation. This could mean she’d push for the U.S. to play a greater role in ceasefire negotiations between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. There’s no evidence Clinton would do anything to limit U.S. involvement in Yemen.“My guess is she’d pick up where the administration left off,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a think tank closely aligned with Clinton.The Obama administration plans to “review” its support to the Saudis, a spokesman said after Saturday’s attack. But there doesn’t yet appear to be any consensus about what that review will entail ― or any guarantee that it will take place before Obama leaves office in January. And Obama’s decision against using military force in Syria in 2013, his push for the Iran nuclear agreement, and some undiplomatic comments he made about Saudi Arabia in an interview with The Atlantic have already cost him some leverage with the Saudis, Katulis argued. “The Saudis have felt that they’ve gotten a particularly cold shoulder [from Obama],” said Jon B. Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. “In many ways, the Saudis have responded by giving the cold shoulder.” A Clinton presidency could end up bringing Washington and Riyadh closer together. Saudi Arabia and its coalition allies have been major donors to the Clinton Foundation. As secretary of state, Clinton was closely involved in securing a $29 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta co-founded a public relations firm in 1988 with his brother Tony that now counts Saudi Arabia as a client. John no longer works with the firm, but Tony, who heads it, is a major contributor to the Clinton campaign. Tony works personally on the $140,000-per-month Saudi contract, The Washington Post reported earlier this year. Clinton would be better than Obama at managing the personal part of the relationship with the Saudis, Alterman said. “It’s about having the Saudis feel that they’re going to trust you and take your advice over their better judgment,” he said. “And I think we’re at a point in the Obama-[King] Salman relationship where that’s simply not happening.”A new administration can result in a brief “honeymoon period,” Katulis said. It’s possible that Clinton could use personal leverage to pressure the Saudis to cease airstrikes against civilian targets in a way that the Obama administration has been unable to. But there’s no guarantee that improved relations between the two countries would translate into Riyadh exercising more caution in Yemen. And if heavy civilian casualties resulting from the Saudi-led coalition’s airstrikes continue, it’s hard to imagine Clinton would be willing to cut off U.S. support. “If anything, I would see her being more cautious about breaking with the Saudis,” Baron said. In the meantime, the U.S. role in the conflict in Yemen will continue to escalate. After the debate ended Sunday evening, someone in a Houthi-controlled part of the country fired two missiles into the Red Sea. They missed.

We believe in the power of public art.” The artistic statement for the protest can be read in full here:This protest comes just one month after another We Are Watching protest, also run by Silberling on UPenn’s campus, in response to a sexually suggestive email that was reportedly sent to several female freshmen students at UPenn.""While this protest is denouncing Trump, we also want this to be a platform for those who Trump has maligned to feel supported,"" Silberling said.""We want to empower the voices of the people who Trump silences, and we want to show that many students at Penn, Trump’s alma mater, do not support his hateful behavior and rhetoric.”"

They also encouraged people experiencing behavioral health conditions to reach out for support.“Mental health is not a dirty word ― we all have mental health like we do physical health, good or ill,” William said.“But not seeking help at those times when it all seems too much, or we are depressed or anxious, can impact the rest of our lives,” he continued. “Put simply, the three of us want to make asking for help no longer a big deal.”The prince’s emphasis on treatment is a necessary one: Nearly one in four people worldwide will be affected by a mental health issue at some point. Yet research shows the prejudicial attitudes toward mental illness often prevent those individuals from getting professional support.Kate acknowledged how difficult it is to “see a way forward” when experiencing issues with emotional wellbeing, but hopes people know that help is available.“William, Harry and I feel it is our duty to do what we can ... to shine a spotlight on emotional wellbeing and highlight the support that is out there to prevent or manage the pain at difficult times,” she said.The royals have been longstanding supporters of mental health. They launched Heads Together earlier this year, an initiative that aims to bring more awareness to mental illness and those who experience it. The duke and duchess also have spoken out about the importance of prioritizing children’s emotional health.“It is often said that fathers can often find it hard to talk about their own feelings so there’s no wonder they struggle to speak to their son or daughter about the topic,” William wrote back in June. “But we don’t really have a choice. I really believe that a child’s mental health is just as important as his or her physical health.”Amen to that.H/T People"

Romney had awkwardly boasted in a debate that he had “binders full of women” from which he could staff his administration as Massachusetts governor. Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin said women who are victims of “legitimate rape” cannot get pregnant because “the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down.” Conservative mega-donor Foster Friess quipped that “gals” should just put aspirin “between their knees” to prevent pregnancy. It all added up to calamity for the Republican Party. Female voters soundly rejected Romney, Akin and other male GOP candidates in 2012. A record number of Democratic women were elected to office. And frustrated Republican leaders ordered a full autopsy of the party to diagnose its image problems.“They did a whole lot of self-examination after the election and came to the conclusion that women didn’t like what they were seeing ― old, rich, grouchy white men that they didn’t have a lot in common with,” Katie Packer, a strategist the GOP enlisted to help repair its image, told The Huffington Post on Monday. Instead of emerging from the ashes of that autopsy as a more women-friendly party, the GOP has instead gone in the exact opposite direction. The Republican Party has sewed up its corpse and sauntered back out of the exam room a grotesque, Frankenstein’s-monster-like version of its former self. Even its own members view it as far more terrifying to women than it was before, with an openly misogynistic leader who once boasted that he could “grab” women “by the pussy” because he’s a celebrity. “I think we’re seeing the difference now between real attacks on women and what was very much fabricated in 2012,” Packer said. “One of the reasons I got into this business of trying to help the party message to women is because I did feel like a lot of the attacks on men were unwarranted and unfair and hyper-politicized.” “Romney’s ‘binders full of women’ comment was poorly worded, but the sentiment behind it was something we should be supporting as women ― that he was actively looking for capable, qualified women to serve in his administration,” she continued. “Now we’re seeing the difference between ‘inarticulate’ and ‘total disregard and disrespect for women.’” The problem facing Republicans is not just Donald Trump himself. It’s that Trump has forced many of them to make a choice between embracing his extreme sexism, fat-shaming, racism and xenophobia, or alienating the Trump supporters in their districts. For some, the latest scandal involving the Republican nominee ― a 2005 hot mic moment in which he talked about grabbing a woman’s genitalia ― was the last straw. Dozens of GOPers have since rescinded their support. But others have stuck by Trump. And it has put them in highly embarrassing situations, where they’ve had to defend and explain the indefensible. “I don’t characterize that as sexual assault,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) told The Weekly Standard in the spin room after Sunday night’s presidential debate. “I think that’s a stretch. I don’t know what he meant.”Even the Republicans who finally dropped their support for Trump this weekend have had to answer why this moment was their last straw. After all, the celebrity politician has openly and regularly denigrated women during the campaign, attacking a fellow candidate’s face, a fellow candidate’s wife’s looks, and even weight-shaming a former Miss Universe. But up until Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) was still planning to share a stage with Trump at a campaign event; Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) called him a “role model” and was planning to vote for him; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is still holding a Supreme Court vacancy empty for him.“They’re digging themselves deeper and deeper into a hole,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. ”It’s been this balancing act ― how much can you take? How much can you say, ‘I don’t endorse, but I support’? It’s a very complicated situation for these folks who are running for office, who are tethered to him, but haven’t stood up to him.” For Republican operatives, the long-term damage inflicted by the Trump campaign is daunting to consider. Heading into 2016, Trump and the GOP needed to appeal to more women voters to have a shot at victory. Now the party is just hoping to stop the hemorrhaging of female supporters it once had. White women with college degrees used to be a GOP-leaning demographic. Now they are defecting from the party in droves. Republican women, in particular, seem frustrated by the choice they have to make. One activist, Marybeth Glenn, expressed outrage in a series of scathing and widely shared tweets on Monday night. “I, a conservative female, have spent years defending the Republican Party against claims of sexism,” she wrote.Considering that women made up 53 percent of the electorate in 2012, the defection of Glenn and others could prove catastrophic for Trump and the GOP at large. Obama, after all, was propelled to victory over Romney in 2012 by a much-touted gender gap of 10 percentage points. A new PPRI/The Atlantic poll shows Hillary Clinton with a 33-point lead over Trump among women ― 61 percent of female voters are inclined to support her, with only 28 percent planning to vote for Trump. “Potentially, we could see the largest gender gap in this election that we have ever seen,” Walsh said.Packer believes the GOP can repair its image with women after this election cycle, starting by taking a “very strong stance” against Trump’s rhetoric.

Mitt Romney’s 2012 numbers are looking pretty good for the GOP right now. But Republicans downballot are so far being spared the effects. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, October 11, 2016.POLLS INDICATE TRUMP IS IN TROUBLE - Three new national polls show Donald Trump’s support declining, although by different amounts. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump down to 35 percent, with Clinton 11 points higher at 46 percent. That poll was conducted Saturday and Sunday, after the tape showing Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women was released Friday but before Sunday night’s debate. A PRRI/Atlantic poll conducted October 5-9, including time before and after the tape release, also shows Clinton with an 11-point lead and Trump with only 38 percent of the vote. A Politico/Morning Consult poll conducted Saturday showed Trump with 38 percent support, but that was only a 1 percent drop from their previous poll and only 4 points behind Clinton. A post-debate Morning Consult poll shows Trump dropping another point to 37 percent with Clinton holding steady at 42 percent. The margins between Trump and Clinton vary across these polls, but all show evidence of Trump declining into the 30s. That’s not a good sign 4 weeks out from the election. [NBC, PRRI, Politico, Morning Consult]ANOTHER POLL FINDS LITTLE EFFECT ON VIEWS OF TRUMP’S RESPECT FOR WOMEN - HuffPollster: “Even before the release of a video that showed Donald Trump bragging about sexual assault, most voters didn’t think he respected women. But Friday’s revelation had only a modest effect on the minds of those who did, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey.Thirty-two percent of registered voters now think Trump respects women, identical to the percentage who said so in a poll taken days before the video’s release. The share who say he does not respect women rose from 54 percent to 59 percent, as some people left the ‘not sure’ camp. ...The lack of change shows how deeply opinions can harden along partisan lines, with voters willing to rationalize away criticism of the candidate they support….Surveys released so far this week have found varying results on how much the controversy has affected Americans’ opinions of Trump. The HuffPost/YouGov survey differs significantly from a poll by NBC and SurveyMonkey, which found the percentage of likely voters who think Trump doesn’t respect women at all jumping from 39 percent to 46 percent in the aftermath of the video’s release. One potential reason for the discrepancy: While the HuffPost/YouGov poll laid out a binary set of options ― Trump does or does not respect women ― the NBC/SurveyMonkey offered a more gradual scale, asking people whether Trump respects women ‘a lot,’ ‘some,’ ‘not much’ or ‘not at all.’” [HuffPost]More than 450,000 votes were cast before anyone heard about the tape. [CNN]Many Republicans will still vote for Trump - HuffPollster: “Sixty-seven percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said congressional candidates should still support Trump, according to the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. In the Politico/Morning Consult poll, 74 percent of Republicans agreed that party leaders should continue to back the embattled nominee…. Republicans who don’t want to support Trump face an unpleasant decision: Vote for Trump, or allow Clinton to become president…. For many Republicans (and Democrats), the idea of aiding the other party is anathema. In an April HuffPost/YouGov survey, 76 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agreed that “the worst Republican candidate for president is still better than the Democratic candidates.” The same proportion of Democrats said the same thing about their party. More than half of Republicans, and just under half of Democrats, strongly agreed with the statement. Less than 10 percent of each group strongly disagreed. None of these numbers are surprising. Party identification is by far the strongest predictor of vote choice in American elections, and has been for decades.” [HuffPost] Downballot Republicans don’t seem to be suffering - Janie Velencia and Grace Sparks: “Donald Trump’s boasts about sexually assaulting women could be causing him to lose some ground in the polls, but it doesn’t seem to be hurting down-ballot Republican candidates yet. Trump has declined by 2 percentage points among registered voters, according to YouGov/Economist polls conducted before and after the release of that notorious recording. At the same time, the GOP has seen a 2-point increase in generic House polling, which asks voters which party’s congressional candidate they’d vote for. Voters in his own party also seem to be targeting their ire at Trump specifically. Among registered GOP voters, Trump has dropped by 4 points, from 85 percent to 81 percent. But the generic down-ballot Republican candidate has seen no change, maintaining 88 percent support.” [HuffPost]CURRENT HUFFINGTON POST FORECAST - Hillary Clinton has an 88.3 percent chance of winning the presidential election. Republicans have a 65 percent chance of keeping the Senate. [Presidential forecast, Senate forecast]ALL ATTENTION ISN’T GOOD ATTENTION, 2016 EDITION - Geoffrey Skelley, via Twitter: “I noticed earlier this cycle that there’s a negative correlation between getting more attention than the other candidate & poll margin. E.g. during periods where Clinton was in the news more than Trump, her lead shrank and vice versa. Gallup and Google Trends provide data on who’s getting more notice in the news. Over the past month, correlation between Trump’s margin of being heard about in the news (Gallup) & HuffPost margin is a solid -.67!! Comparing Trump’s HuffPost margin to Google Trends margin between Trump and Clinton, correlation is -.55 over the past month. So we have 2 indicators where the correlation between Trump being in the news relative to Clinton & Trump’s margin is above .5! And let me add that there’s something to these correlations over time, at least going back to after the conventions.” [@geoffreyvs]TRUMP WOULD KILL FOR MITT ROMNEY’S POLL NUMBERS RIGHT ABOUT NOW: HuffPollster: “In mid-October 2012, Romney lagged President Barack Obama by just about half a percentage point in HuffPost Pollster’s model of the race. By contrast, Trump’s current polling average, which still largely reflects polls taken before the latest revelations, puts him more than 6 points behind Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head race. That’s a gap more than 10 times larger than Romney’s…State polling tells a similar story. In most of the states where HuffPost Pollster has enough data for a model, Trump’s current margin against Clinton is less than Romney’s final margin against Obama in the 2012 election….And Romney, of course, lost the 2012 election by a larger-than-predicted margin. For Trump’s campaign to be on track to victory, he would likely need to be outperforming his predecessor. Instead, he’s behind and facing the specter of even worse numbers to come.” [HuffPost] MARRIED VOTERS DON’T ALWAYS KNOW WHO THEIR SPOUSE IS BACKING - Will Jordan, via Twitter: “I may have cracked the code of the gender gap and how American families are not ripping themselves apart...Married WOMEN who say they are voting for Hillary Clinton: 45%. Married MEN who think their SPOUSE is voting for Hillary Clinton: 33%. Married MEN who say they are voting for Hillary Clinton: 31%. Married WOMEN who think their SPOUSE is voting for Hillary Clinton: 37%.” [@williamjordann]PEW RESEARCH STEPS BACK FROM HORSERACE POLLING - Michael Dimock: “We’ve been getting questions about what people can expect to see from Pew Research Center in the final weeks before Election Day. Compared with past years, our October and November plans have changed significantly in that the Center will not be producing likely-voter estimates of the state of the race or making a final projection of the national vote total….[T]he field of pre-election ‘horse-race’ polling has become increasingly crowded, including by organizations rightfully putting a focus on polling in key battleground states. Putting resources toward an already saturated market doesn’t make much sense for us….The number of survey aggregators now giving the public a general sense of how the race is ebbing or flowing, however, makes this less of a loss. Our decision also takes away an opportunity for us to test our survey accuracy against an objective external reality: the national vote total. However, elections are only one way – and not necessarily the best way – to gauge polling accuracy…. Perhaps most importantly, this does not mean we believe that polling is no longer accurate enough to be used to predict election results. “ [Pew] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!
