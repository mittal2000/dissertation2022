Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is prepared to fight President Donald Trump for four years, on everything.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582f580c1a00002400cc8b30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democratic leaders in Congress said this week that if they can find common ground with President-elect Donald Trump, they’re willing to work with him. But at least a few House Democrats say they won’t work with Trump on anything, or that they’re close to taking that hard-line approach.“There’s nothing there,” Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “He doesn’t use power properly.”Gallego said Trump has caused too much damage with his hateful rhetoric for him to be able to work with or trust him. Even collaborating on Democratic priorities would only empower the president-elect to do other things that Democrats firmly oppose, he argued.“While we may be able to pass an infrastructure bill, he’s going to use that power to push his racist, bigoted agenda on the other end,” Gallego said.He said there are others in his caucus who plan to refuse any cooperation with the president-elect, but he wouldn’t name names or say how many. “More than you can count on one hand,” he said.Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) said she needs proof that Trump can rise to the level of the office of the presidency before she can commit to working with him. He’s not off to a good start in her eyes, with his choice of Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon as a senior White House adviser. Bannon led the website as it became a platform for the white nationalist “alt-right” movement, and his appointment drew praise from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.“The indications are that Donald Trump does not plan to live up to be a president for all Americans,” Clark said. “I find that a concerning first step.”“I’m not saying I’m going to work with the guy, I’m not saying I’m not going to work with him,” she added. “But I’ll tell you this: I have a healthy, not only dose of skepticism, but fear that he is going to continue with those themes, based on his appointment of Steve Bannon.”Democratic lawmakers are in a pickle. They’ve got Trump in the White House for the next four years and next to no leverage in Congress, which is completely under GOP control. One of the few bright spots is that Trump is a wild card, and he’s singled out a few priorities ― investments in rebuilding roads and highways, raising the minimum wage and trade deals ― that resonate with Democrats. So they can either try to team up with him on those areas, and potentially railroad some Republicans in the process, or fight him on everything he does.Progressive groups are pressuring Democrats to reject Trump outright. “MoveOn to Democrats: No Collaboration With Trump’s Hate,” reads the subject line of a Thursday email with a scathing statement from the grassroots group, issued after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) signaled a willingness to work with the president-elect in some areas.“It is unacceptable for Democratic leadership to normalize Trump and collaborate with him so long as he continues his bigotry, hatred, and division,” said MoveOn executive director Ilya Sherman. “Requiring grassroots progressives to divert their energy to holding Democrats accountable would be a serious mistake.”Some progressive lawmakers are trying to keep an open mind. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who is running to lead the Democratic National Committee next year, said he’s willing to “take a careful look” at Trump’s ideas that help working families.It’s just that he’s not optimistic.“That’s not that campaign he ran, and I don’t think that’ll be the administration he leads,” Ellison said. “The President-elect ran on deporting millions of people, building a wall on the Mexican border, lowering taxes on the super-rich, and banning Muslims from entering the country. If he governs the way he campaigned, I’ll be the first standing in his way.”Similarly, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) said he’s “not going to reject” something Trump proposes if it aligns with Democratic priorities.“But I would say overall that that will come against the backdrop of us being rightly, fairly, justifiably very skeptical of the things he’s about to do,” he said. “And prepared to resist them.”Paul Blumenthal contributed reporting."

Stress-heavy workplaces may be less productive and have more staff turnover, he added.To investigate the main causes of work stress in the ED and any trials of methods to combat that stress, the study team reviewed 25 studies found on health databases and Google Scholar.Many studies mentioned high work volume and long hours, as well as having little control over work, as sources of stress for ED workers.Some studies also emphasized that workers may have more stress because they don’t receive enough support at work, are not paid enough and are not adequately recognized for their work.The researchers also found that compassion fatigue, a type of overload that results in having less concern or empathy for others, is common in the ED.Workers experienced compassion fatigue for many of the same reasons they felt job stress, such as high job demands and having little control, the researchers write in the Emergency Medicine Journal.Workers also said that having work “targets,” such as a rule that patients must be seen within four hours, could add greatly to job stress.The researchers only found two studies of interventions meant to help reduce job stress in the emergency department.One involved aromatherapy and massage sessions for nurses in a single ED and it was found to reduce anxiety.A program teaching mindfulness and other emotional skills was found not to reduce job stress.Other interventions, including a “buddy system,” exercise programs and increasing workers’ contact with their families were described or proposed but had not been studied.“For too long the medical profession has neglected the study of its own personnel and focused on patient care,” said Manit Arora, a surgeon and lecturer at University of New England in Armidale, Australia, and University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies burnout among health professionals.“Now more and more we are realizing that the mental and physical health of doctors is critical to patient care,” said Arora, who was not involved in the study.Arora said job burnout is very common and has serious consequences. “Burnout doctors are more likely to have medical and psychological problems, abuse drugs and alcohol and higher rate of suicide,” he said.Work hours need to be regulated, Arora said. Stress workshops, more days off, more education and group bonding sessions can also help to tackle the issue of job stress, he added.“Interventions to support employees include reducing work intensity, improving workers’ control over how they do their job and helping staff feel more valued for their efforts,” Basu said.SOURCE: bit.ly/2f3Fhrx Emergency Medicine Journal, online October 11, 2016"

The blue-chip Japanese stock index closed 0.6 percent higher.Data on Thursday suggesting the U.S. jobs market is tightening and inflation is gaining traction have bolstered a view that U.S. growth and inflation could accelerate if the Trump administration cuts taxes and increases fiscal spending.Last week’s unexpected U.S. election result has prompted investors to ditch their once rock-solid conviction that growth in developed economies will remain tepid because of tough competition from emerging market economies with lower wages.That has led to a repricing of assets, most notably in currency and bond markets.“What we’re looking at is a broad shift of investment back to the U.S.,” said Richard Cochinos, Citi’s head of G10 currency strategy in London.“There are expectations for tax cuts next year - which were part of the Trump campaign’s promises - and then there’s also the idea of what type of fiscal boost are you going to have. That’s what’s driving asset prices – it’s people’s expectations for the fiscal impulse next year,” he said.Federal Reserve policymaker James Bullard said on Friday he is leaning toward supporting a rate rise in December, adding that a plethora of potential changes under Trump could affect future policy.BONDS RUMBLEDThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield US10YT=RR rose to 2.34 percent, its highest since December.

4,POLITICS,Trump Hats Are The Post-Election Gift Republicans In Congress Didn't Want Or Need,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-republicans-trade_us_582e1ef7e4b058ce7aaa13bb,It's still not clear how well the president-elect will get along with party members on Capitol Hill.,2016-11-18,"House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) holds a ""Make America Great Again"" hat at news conference on Nov. 15.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582e1fb11a00002400cc8850.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As a show of unity, GOP leaders bought “Make America Great Again” hats for each of the 247 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives. Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) didn’t grab one. “I kind of chuckled at the whole thing, that they’re gonna send out baseball caps? I found the whole experience near-bizarre,” Ribble told The Huffington Post.He was one of the first congressional Republicans to denounce President-elect Donald Trump, calling him a toddler all the way back in September 2015. Listen to Ribble’s interview on “So That Happened,” the HuffPost Politics podcast: Very few were seen actually wearing the hats after leaving the conference meeting this week where the hats had been placed on chairs, though some members carried caps in their hands.This could be because members of the Washington establishment tend to have impeccable hairstyling. Or it could be because “Make America Great Again” hats are so toxic in some quarters that “you might as well be wearing a swastika,” as the white nationalist Richard Spencer has said.Yet another reason could be that Trump’s agenda doesn’t align particularly well with the general GOP agenda. For instance, Trump’s transition team has said it will begin reviewing the North American Free Trade Agreement on day one of his presidency. Trump said repeatedly during the campaign that he wanted to hike tariffs on imports from China and companies that outsourced manufacturing to Mexico.Ribble suggested support among congressional Republicans for such policies is hat-level superficial. Traditionally, the party supports free trade. A good example of the shift is Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who has long been a huge fan of free trade, but now says trade deals haven’t been well managed. “I have seen colleagues during my six years here just move with the whim of public opinion and there’s some of that right now,” Ribble said. “The data supports trade agreements for the United States.” Like Ribble, Republicans who serve on committees that oversee trade policy seem skeptical of Trump’s trade agenda. Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said this week that he’s interested in reviving the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that has seemed to be on political life support. (House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said he has some problems with TPP and that it doesn’t have enough support in the chamber.) “Republicans are going to continue to support the freedom to trade,” Brady said Tuesday.Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), chairman of the Senate’s trade subcommittee, told HuffPost in a brief hallway interview this week that he’s still a fan of NAFTA. “I understand the president’s got strong views on this and hopefully we can talk to our trading partners and if it needs to be improved, then we can do that,” Cornyn said. “But I think it would be a mistake to just walk away from those trade agreements.” HuffPost asked Cornyn about the prospect of hiking tariffs on imported goods, something Trump has repeatedly said he supports. “I don’t know why we’d want to go down that road but again, like I said, let’s wait and get some specifics from the administration,” he said. “We’re a little short on specifics.” Liberal economists have long argued that free trade deals have hurt U.S. workers by lowering tariffs on imported goods, thereby making it easier to profit from cheap foreign labor. Ribble espoused a more mainstream view that increases in productivity are more to blame for the decline of manufacturing jobs.“The loss of manufacturing jobs are not the result of trade and never have been,” he said. “They’re the result of innovation, technology, automation, robotics.” Matt Fuller contributed reporting.

It’s unclear whether these laborers would be included in Trump’s mass deportation plan. The agricultural industry has said repeatedly that domestic workers show no interest in doing the jobs that immigrants and migrants do. That uncertainty is already bothering many of these workers, according to Bruce Goldstein, executive director of Farmworker Justice, a nonprofit advocacy group that works to empower migrant and seasonal farmworkers.“These threats of deportation are causing them great anxiety,” Goldstein told The Huffington Post. “Farmworkers and their children are aware of these discussions and it makes them fearful for what’s going to happen. It would deprive them of jobs, split up their families and subject them to great harm.”Many ag employers also appear to be feeling uneasy.Many in the industry rely on the Department of Labor’s H-2A temporary agricultural worker program for seasonal assistance harvesting their crops, which is already being criticized for having long administrative delays linked to high demand. The deportation of any significant number of undocumented farmworkers would put a dramatic strain on the program.The National Farmers Union, which represents more than 200,000 of the nation’s farms and ranches, is worried about what actions the Trump administration might make on immigration, according to its government relations representative, Zack Clark. That’s particularly true because the president-elect and his surrogates have not specifically said how they define “criminal.”Trump previously indicated that some undocumented Americans could remain in the country. However, Trump immigration adviser Kris Kobach ― the Kansas secretary of state and an architect of Arizona’s controversial anti-immigration law ― commented this week that there will be “no free pass” given to any undocumented immigrant living in the U.S.“We don’t know what to expect. It seems like there’s been a walking back of certain issues, so we’re not really sure which campaign promises will be fulfilled and which will go away,” Clark said. “It’s tough to envision any scenarios right now because of the ambiguity that exists.”Tom Nassif, one of Trump’s agricultural advisers, says the president-elect won’t hurt the industry. Nassif is also the president and CEO of Western Growers, which represents farmers in California, Arizona and Colorado.“I don’t fear what he’s going to do on immigration reform,” Nassif told HuffPost. “I believe the president-elect is very sensitive to the needs of agriculture and I would be surprised if we saw any mass deportations in agriculture.”Still, Nassif said he’d like Congress to step in to help protect undocumented farmworkers. He supports finding a path to citizenship for those laborers, similar to the “blue card” legislation approved by the Senate in 2013. Then-Speaker John Boehner blocked it, and it did not come up for a vote in the House.“They want and need and should be allowed to come out of the shadows and have a normal life, because they’re providing a service to us by harvesting our crops,” Nassif added.It remains to be seen whether such action from a Republican-dominated Congress is possible, given the vigorous anti-immigrant rhetoric that came out of the Trump campaign and has been largely reinforced by his transition team.But the alternative to an industry that relies so heavily on immigrant workers is not promising.Laurie Fischer, president and founder of the American Dairy Coalition, an industry group, said the stakes are high for farmers, especially those in the dairy sector.Mass deportations would cost the U.S. economy $32 billion, in addition to doubling the cost of milk, according to a report commissioned by another dairy industry group this year.That’s because dairy farms, unlike fresh produce operations, require a year-round workforce that can’t rely on temporary or seasonal programs like H-2A. A crackdown on its workforce would prove devastating.But Fischer is hopeful Congress will move toward creating a legal status that will allow undocumented farmworkers to remain in this country.“We are going to continue to push for this,” she said. “Or we’re likely going to be seeing farms that are not able to continue to find the labor force they need to operate their businesses.”―Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

Like any decent Catholic, I thought, I’ll go to mass to offer these negative emotions and find rest.Until then, not a single tear had dropped. Well, I cried the entire celebration.Two pews behind me, there was an older gentleman talking throughout the entire mass. He was celebrating our new President–elect. During the Sign of Peace, he waved, “It’s a wonderful day,” over and over again.My reaction: sobbing tears.After more prayer, I walked outside to overhear a conversation with the pastor and a few of his parishioners. I’m not confident in saying that they were celebrating, but they were at least talking in a positive tone, both in body and verbal language, of the outcome.My reaction: sobbing uncontrollably in my car.That’s when I realized that it was going to be four tough years ahead because I’m called to love, especially those who have hurt me. Of this commandment, I found myself extremely stressed.I have never felt more isolated, more persecuted, or more betrayed in my life.For clarification: my grave concern isn’t that Trump or Clinton hurt me; it was that my own brothers and sisters hurt me. It was, after all, people who placed them as the top runners. It is the White, Evangelical Christians and Catholic vote that gives me the greatest pain and fear.I sat in mass thinking, how can we as a Church be so divided? When did we become a one-issue Church? And why does it feel like I’m choosing a side when I never saw myself as that person – I only saw myself as Catholic.It’s my expectation to not fit in the world – I never thought that I would not fit in my own Church.It’s foolish to think that we stand united when we are surrounded by advocates, church leaders, and pastors persuading people how to vote, and then celebrating the outcome.It insinuates that we are lacking the ability to feel our brother’s and sister’s fears, pain, and being.Thus, I find myself completely and utterly at a loss for words or a desire to fight. I don’t know how to move forward. I only know what I feel – I only know my story.Perhaps if each of us took the time to truly hear each other’s story we would be more empathetic, we’d be more aware, sensitive, and caring. Out of my love for all my brothers and sisters, born and unborn, I’d like to share a glimpse of my story because love must triumph. My hope is that those who do not understand my grave sadness and despair might have their hearts softened hearing the story God has allowed me to live.My story is one of both love and deprivation.When I was a little girl, I used to avoid the sun because I didn’t want to get darker. I wanted to be white because I wanted to fit in. In fact, up until college, I worked very hard to fit in with the Anglo community. It hasn’t even been 10 years since I started learning how to love myself.Growing up, my mother and father worked one, two, or three jobs. My grandmother became my second mom. In the beginning, my dad walked from one job to another to another. And my mother worked up until the day before most of her seven births.I haven’t seen my grandma in nine years. I lost my grandfather in high school; I only met him twice and could not go to the funeral. My other set of grandparents, I’ve only met twice. I have 8+ sets of uncles and aunts, 15+ cousins that I have not seen in 11 years. My mother and father haven’t hugged their own parents or siblings in 11 years. My relationship with most of my family is broken simply because we cannot see each other. We cannot relate to each other. It’s not because we don’t desire it or because we hate each other – that would be very contrary to the Latin culture, it is because they live across the border.If you know about the current immigration system, you know that contrary to popular opinion it has never been easy to apply for documentation. It’s a waiting game. A waiting game filled with anxiety.In my family, our children are all scared of the cops because we know that they may take us from our parents.In my family, our children don’t know another homeland. We can barely speak our native language because the American culture demands that we strip ourselves of our native identity. To fit in, we are forced to learn and accept the current system of deprivation.I lost count the number of times one of my family members has been pulled over for driving without a license. Despite the number of times, with every single phone call, my stomach falls, my heart skips a beat. I wonder when was my last interaction with them? I think of my cousins and we all sit in silence with each other. We rally because we are all we have in this country. The last time one of our uncles was pulled over was in August in Georgia. The bail was $10,000. The family and local community of us pulled our piggy banks together and rallied for him. He’s out. But now, he has a pile of increasing debt for driving with a tail light that went out during that one drive. Oh, and his children were in the car with him when it happened.In my family, documented and undocumented, we are all scared all the time, but we say our prayers and live our lives. In my family, we are afraid to think that any of our family members in our native land may pass away because we will not be able to visit them to say goodbye. Two days after last year’s Thanksgiving, my 10-year-old niece lost her father due to the drug cartel. Three men were murdered in my hometown that night, all of which had relatives living in the U.S. None of them were able to go to the funeral.As Catholics, we have the tradition of praying a Novena to Our Lady of Guadalupe after someone passes away for the eternal rest of his/ her soul. I lost count of how many novenas we have prayed over the last three years – at least 15.In my family, we stand by each other no matter how much we might fight from time to time because we understand that it’s us against the world.In my town, I have met brilliant, 4.0 GPA, undocumented students; some who have discontinued their education after high school because of fear and disbelief in the system. These students see walls every day without people having to build them.In my home parish in Georgia, there have been countless experiences of racism between the Anglo and Hispanic community. Within the last 10 years, we were forbidden to use the same microphones. Even today, we, the brown people, are still not allowed to use of all their, the white people’s, equipment. For our Christ Renews His Parish retreats, we are not allowed to use the parish kitchen so our moms cook everything in their homes for the retreaters. Two years ago, the parish had a bilingual, bi-cultural Christmas party. This Hispanic community’s assignment was cleaning after the event — assigned by the pastor. Our people didn’t even attend the party, but our leaders showed up at the very end to make sure the church was clean for Sunday masses. I could go on and on and on.I could also ask my family to make a list; every single person of all ages would have a racial experience. We have all bawled; we have all felt hopeless; we have all felt fear; All due to the color of our skin, our ethnicity, and culture.Today, I go through seasons of great anxiety, panic attacks, severe insomnia, depression, self-doubt and (especially today) despair. People seem to always be surprised by my list of troubles. And they wonder why.Brothers and sisters, all I ask is that you don’t dismiss the reality of today. Just because your life goes on the same doesn’t mean it’s the same for everyone else. Believe me, you likely have neighbors right down the road to your home, work, grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants who will be affected by your action or silence. The fear that people are living with is real and valid. Do not dismiss this anguish. Acting like it’s not important will only push us into a deeper separation and desperation.Christian brothers and sisters, we have a moral duty to make a preferential option for the poor and marginalized. I don’t believe a utopia will ever exist, for we would have to be in heaven, but I do believe that brotherhood and community is possible today. I also believe we must strive and work towards it.Over the last few nights, I’ve had nightmares. I’ve cried nearly every day. My heart is on my sleeve for not just my own personal fears, but for the fears of my brothers and sisters who carry heavy crosses.I can empathize because I have experienced my own walk.I implore you; we cannot forget that we belong to each other.The longer that I’m here, the more I look forward to leaving this Earth. I fit less and less. I’m neither from here or there, literally. I long for my eternal home, but until then, I will be here, fully present to the cry of those who suffer from injustice.I don’t have a solution. I don’t have all the answers. And my story is not unique. In fact, mine is the story of millions in this nation.I only have my voice, my faith, and my life. I don’t fully know or understand my need to write this, but I felt compelled to say something because silence has never been the solution. To let others decide how the poor and marginalized will be treated is to fall to sin and prolong injustice.If our only mission in life is to love, then love demands action. If Mother Teresa would have simply prayed for people to save each other, her life would likely not be the legacy it is today. Her love of the Lord led to action. If Blessed Archbishop Romero would’ve simply prayed for the violence to stop, he would have never faced the accusations he lived through and likely, he’d be alive. His love of the Lord, of His people, led him to be the martyr we pray through today.The hate and division in our society cultivated in this election is offensive and personal. I cannot, will not, compromise my faith to appease such a vote. My fear is not nonsense and useless.To share my story is to love.I don’t have a lot. I only have my faith, the promise of heaven, and the communion of saints.Our Lady of Guadalupe, you appeared to an afflicted Mexican nation used and abused by the Spanish, hear my cry.St. Teresa of Calcutta, beloved by those hurting greatest in the world, hear my cry.Blessed Romero, hero of the afflicted by violence and economic injustice, hear my cry.Dorothy Day, defender of radical Catholicism in a culture of increasing secularism, hear my cry.Jesus, Lord, you who converted the heart of St. Paul, convert us all daily, hear my cry.Dios te salve, Reina y Madre de misericordia, vida, dulzura y esperanza nuestra, Dios te salve. A ti clamamos los desterrados hijos de Eva. A ti suspiramos gimiendo y llorando en este valle de lágrimas. Ea, pues, Señora, abogada nuestra: vuelve a nosotros esos tus ojos misericordiosos. Y después de este destierro, muéstranos a Jesús, fruto bendito de tu vientre. Oh clemente, oh piadosa, oh dulce Virgen María. Ruega por nosotros, Santa Madre de Dios, para que seamos dignos de las promesas de Cristo. Amen.- E. Avila is an active young adult Catholic.

Katz, M.D., M.P.H., ContributorFounder, True Health Initiative",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thanks-anyway_us_582f3186e4b08c963e343e35,"We are called upon to gather, reflect, and give thanks mere days from now, as we do every year at this time. And yet, this",2016-11-18,<p>The iconic representation of Thanksgiving by Norman Rockwell</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582f31a31800001b0030edc0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We are called upon to gather, reflect, and give thanks mere days from now, as we do every year at this time. And yet, this year it falls in a season of historic discontent. How are we to manage?Before tackling the problem, let’s be clear that the problem is universal, no matter which way we voted. Yes, it is undoubtedly more acute and poignant for those of us who cast votes for what proved to be the lost cause. But there is nothing to gloat about on the winning side of this tally, either.Why? Well, for one thing, we all have the same vivid evidence that we live in a house ominously divided. The passions on both sides appear to be unusually extreme, highlighting the width of that division. More impressive still is its length. It is now an established fact that our presidential election was lost by a candidate who not only won a decisive majority of the popular vote, but who won it by a greater margin than at least several former presidents had in victory. For every 100 of us who favored this outcome, to whatever degree, there are 101 who went the other way.We are one another’s neighbors. We are one another’s cousins. The human family and the fabric of community are non-partisan bonds we share.For another, the evidence that we were victims ― winners and losers alike ― of willful misinformation is overwhelming. It’s not only a fact, but one being celebrated by the addition of “post-truth” to the Oxford dictionary. We are invited to accept that we live in a “post-truth” world.We should reject the invitation. There is nothing post-modern about post-truth; it is regressive. It is the state of states subject to tyranny, the control of information, and the dominion of propaganda. It serves despots, not democracies, and is among the shackles broken by our revered institutions, a free press salient among them. But even leaving aside any lofty causes, there is simply this: post-truth promises, by their very nature, will not be kept. They are, once the euphemism is stripped away, naked lies. They serve only manipulation, and thus abuse us all, but especially those who rally to their support. We can wrestle with ways to fight together for truth- truth we want to hear, and truth we don’t- another time. I want to get back to the challenge of this year’s thanks.I heard from a neighbor in my relatively quiet hometown of Hamden, CT, that in the days since the election, she has seen swastikas prominently displayed, once on skin, once on clothing. She has lived here for years, and never seen one before.That there is cause for revulsion in this is self-evident; we all know what swastikas have come to symbolize. But if that reprehensible worldview was lurking among us, perhaps we may be thankful that it has been exposed, and that good people, no matter our politics, may confront it. This is a stretch, I admit, but no more than contending with the results of cancer screening. Good news is better than bad news, but bad news is better than not knowing the news. Knowledge is power, in this case the power to confront a social cancer now revealed, but lurking there all along. We don’t really have a new problem; we have new awareness. So, this goes in the “now we know” file.Then, I received a missive from a junior colleague in lifestyle medicine, expressing her justified anxieties as she expects the arrival of her baby daughter in December, wondering where we all go from here. I can’t say why she thought I could help, and don’t presume to think I did; but here, more or less, is what I said.Martin Luther King told us that the arc of the moral universe is long, but bends toward justice. I think the arc of the scientific universe and genuine understanding is equally long, but bends toward truth. I think the best we can do is follow the curve, while resisting the urge to get too far out in front of it. Understanding takes time.Getting there will, at times, mean pushing past those committed to blocking us. Gentle may not always work- but we should be as gentle as possible. Ultimately, whatever we are in, we are in it together. But however we go, we have to keep going somehow.More often than not- and we may be thankful for this- we can progress by taking the hands of those lagging behind, and helping them to catch up. I think there are countless ways to do this. Maybe every act of kindness is one. So is teaching. Building bridges to come together on common ground in defense of fundamental truths can only help.As a fellow parent, I feel the reasons for anxiety deeply. We all aspire to bring our children into a world with no shadows, but that is the fantasy of every generation. You were not born into a world with no shadows; nor was I. But we can be thankful to be here just the same, and have this chance to shine a light. We offer our children nothing more, and nothing less, than a chance to do the same. We cannot promise an absence of shadow; but we can give them the opportunity to add their unique light. It is enough; for them, as for us. It is enough, because it’s all there is, or ever was. But maybe not all that can be. Like every parent before you, you will have to welcome your perfect addition to the human family- into an imperfect world, and hope she makes it better. She will have that chance- as do we all- and we may be thankful for it.Finally, a little modern medicine to help such aspirations go down. Silly as it seems, smiling can induce happiness as reliably as happiness can induce smiling. Hugs are genuinely health promoting. Social connections are on the short list of factors most consistently associated with the addition of years to lives, and life to years. Love defends against chronic disease.In other words, as we gather this year and seek reasons to be thankful, we may find them in the gathering itself. If we can manage to consider that the very same feelings are populating groups across every measure of diversity, so much the better. We are more alike than different in what we feel, and fear; need, and love.The fortunate among us will have the opportunity to reflect accordingly, bellies full and sated, in the company of people we love. There may be tears, but there should certainly be hugs, and smiles. There will be reasons for thanks, in spite of it all.-finDavid L.

Eventually, he found that there were “additional passions and feelings that I needed to express,” so he decided to expand the story while keeping the rhymes. “It became a medium for me to process my experience growing up as a boy who always felt different, but who had, later in his life, learned to accept and embrace his differences,” Clippinger, who is based in Queens, New York, said. “While the story still promotes saving dolphins from poachers, it became a larger story that expresses the pain that individuals can feel when they are left out of a group or are made to feel ashamed of their differences.”The dolphin’s journey toward self-acceptance, he said, was largely based on his own experiences coming to terms with being gay.“I knew I wanted to fit in and have friends, so I made more of a conscious effort to adopt behaviors and mannerisms that conformed to male gender norms,” he said. “Now that I’m older, I wish that I didn’t put myself through that grinding, conforming process. Instead, I wish I had the insight and level of self-compassion to realize that I was fantastic and lovable just as I naturally was.”Ultimately, Clippinger hopes the message of A Different Dolphin resounds beyond young audiences who may identify as LGBTQ, and that all readers “feel empowered to practice more self-compassion” after reading it. “I believe that it’s this practice of self-compassion that will keep us afloat during life’s hardest times,” he said, “and it’s this same practice of self-compassion that will empower us to soar to our greatest heights during the best of times.”You can read more about A Different Dolphin here.

Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless provider, said in July it would buy Yahoo to combine its websites, search, email and messenger assets as well as advertising technology tools with AOL.Technology news site Recode first reported news of the job cuts in an interview with Armstrong.

12,POLITICS,Nancy Pelosi Shrugs Off Leadership Challenge,Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-leadership-challenge_us_582de4e0e4b030997bbdeb77,One does not simply take on Nancy Pelosi.,2016-11-17,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) conducts her weekly news conference in the Capitol Visitor Center on Nov. 17, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582df22a1a00002400cc8798.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― In the face of a potential Democratic coup, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) projected strength on Thursday, dismissing a race for her job as the No. 1 Democrat in the House as an unserious challenge.“Without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me,” Pelosi told reporters. “It’s a funny thing, in a caucus or any place: When somebody challenges you, your supporters turn out.”The challenge Pelosi refers to is a bid from Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who is calling Democratic members and determining if there’s enough support for him or another candidate to take on Pelosi.Ryan hasn’t formally announced if he is running, but he is going through all the motions. He’s appearing on basically every cable news show that will have him, and he’s working members feverishly. What Ryan really appears to doing, however, is laying the groundwork for a bid from Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), the vice chairman of the caucus, who was expected to easily move up to chairman next Congress.Crowley declined to say whether he was considering a challenge to Pelosi when asked on Wednesday, but if he were to run for minority leader, Pelosi’s grip on the position may loosen a bit. Pelosi has sat atop Democratic leadership for 14 years, and she’s gained a loyal following among many Democrats. But some of the less progressive members, like Ryan, contend that she’s a drag in moderate districts and is hurting the chances of Democrats taking back the House.That criticism seems to have annoyed Pelosi more than it’s fazed her.Asked about Ryan’s comment that electing the same leadership team year after year and expecting a different result was akin to Albert Einstein’s (attributed) definition of insanity, Pelosi coldly said, “I don’t want to respond to that.”Instead, she noted that she had orchestrated the Democratic takeover of the House in 2005 and 2006, and said she sees a similar opportunity over the next two years.“I know how to do it,” she said. “I know how to get it done.”It’s been more than a decade since then ― and six years since Democrats had the majority ― but Pelosi’s financial stranglehold over the caucus has indebted many members to her, and her reputation as an astute tactician has some Democrats thinking they’re better off with an experienced hand trying to negotiate with a Republican House, Senate and White House.Pelosi noted that there’s “uneasiness” in the caucus, between continued electoral disappointments and some internal issues. For instance, there’s increasing frustration from younger Democrats that the seniority system in their ranks doesn’t allow members to move up on committees. But Pelosi said she’s told members that if they want to change those rules and add term limits to committee leadership, they have to find the votes to do that.For now, with just Ryan semi-announced, Pelosi isn’t taking the threat seriously. As soon as some in her caucus began talking about a coup, she said, the majority of members came forward to say they supported her.“It almost did me a favor,” she said."
13,POLITICS,Keith Ellison May Have A Radical Challenger For DNC Chair -- Who Backed Hillary Clinton,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ilyse-hogue-dnc_us_582c8863e4b058ce7aa86623,NARAL's Ilyse Hogue is the first woman eyeing Democratic National Committee leadership in the Trump era.,2016-11-17,NARAL president Ilyse Hogue spoke at the Democratic National Convention in July.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582c8f85180000f703504847.jpeg?ops=crop_0_715_4814_2495%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue has emerged as a potential contender for Democratic National Committee chair, the first woman floated to lead the Democratic Party through its post-Donald Trump victory turmoil. While Hogue hasn’t reached a firm decision to run, her candidacy would be the strongest challenge to early front-runner Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a progressive favorite backed by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Former DNC Chair Howard Dean said he’s also running.The DNC contest is being framed in progressive circles as a proxy do-over of the Sanders-Hillary Clinton Democratic primary, with all the acrimony that came with it. After NARAL and Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton early in the campaign, Sanders dismissed them as “the establishment.” Hogue, as the head of NARAL, remains closely associated with Clinton, but said she wants to be thought of as more than that.“I would rather not have my entire life’s work reduced to one position at one point in time, but I’m also not ashamed of it. It’s part of a life of work that I’m proud of,” Hogue said.The rest of that life’s work maps much more closely with Ellison’s politics than with Clinton’s. Hogue, a Dallas native, got her start in the progressive movement at Greenpeace, where she worked as a forest specialist and targeted companies like Home Depot for anti-conservation business practices. She was active in the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, a precursor to the Occupy movement that would spread across the country a decade later. Hogue was arrested and jailed for six days during those protests. (She was later cleared of all charges.)Hogue went on to work for the San Francisco-based radical advocacy group Rainforest Action Network, where she successfully pressured financial giants like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to stop financing deforestation and instead put in place environmentally friendly policies. The group specialized in high-profile public shaming campaigns ― direct actions such as sending protesters to tack up “Wanted” posters near the Greenwich, Connecticut, home of JPMorgan Chase’s then chief, or draping a 50-foot banner over Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. “As is evident from the last week, we’re going into a time of resistance,” Hogue said, referencing massive anti-Trump protests across the country since the election. “That’s sort of how I came up through progressive work ― resistance to the Bush years, resistance to what was happening with globalization.” She later served as the director of political advocacy for MoveOn.org, where she worked against the war in Iraq and for the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and pressured lawmakers to take up financial reform. Hogue and MoveOn specifically targeted Senate centrists during those campaigns, running ads in their home states pummeling them for failing to support progressive policies ― a move then White House chief of staff famously called “fucking retarded.”After a stint helping run the pro-campaign finance reform super PAC Friends of Democracy, Hogue was tapped in 2013 to lead NARAL ― in part because of her organizing expertise, but also because the group wanted to reach out to younger women who grew up in a world where abortion was always legal and accessible. Hogue, born just a few years before Roe v. Wade, is part of that group, and had never been significantly involved in the movement for reproductive freedom.NARAL got one of its highest-profile moments when Hogue took the stage at July’s Democratic National Convention and told the story of her own abortion. “I made the decision that was best for me — to have an abortion — and was able to get compassionate care at a clinic in my own community. Now, years later, my husband and I are parents to two incredible children. My story is not unique,” she said.Now facing an administration that could derail years of progress on reproductive rights, Hogue and other pro-choice groups have vowed to fight Trump’s anti-choice policies. That sense of urgency may ultimately hold Hogue back from seeking the DNC chairmanship.“I have a day job that I love,” she said. “And it’s going to be critically important, immediately.” If Hogue does seek the post, she said she would take it on as a full-time role. (Ellison plans to stay in Congress if elected.) She also said she’s open to the idea of a co-chairmanship as a way of elevating different voices within the party, but rejected the idea that Sanders supporters wouldn’t get behind a DNC chair who had supported Clinton. “This is not a binary,” she said. “There are a lot of different viewpoints, and our diversity is our strength.” Jonathan Soros, the liberal donor who worked with Hogue at Friends of Democracy, echoed the notion that diversity of opinion would be critical for Democrats.“The things we may lose in terms of legislation could take years, decades to rebuild, and there’s an incredibly important tactical role in figuring out the best way to do that,” Soros said. “It’s incredibly important that the Democratic Party think about how it’s going to be open and competitive.” While Soros declined to weigh in on the DNC chairmanship race, he offered strong praise for Hogue and her organizing chops.“She has a clear sense of what she’s after in terms of progressive outcomes,” he said. Hogue said she’ll make a decision on whether to run soon, after considering family concerns and how the rest of the field shapes up. (The election won’t be held until February.) In the meantime, she urged party leaders to harness the anger surrounding Trump’s victory, and to sustain that energy as the party moves forward with its anti-Trumpism offensive. “Where we are united is stopping Trump’s destructive agenda ― that’s the priority,” she said. “We need to make sure that all of our different constituencies find places of unity where we can leverage power immediately against Trump.”"
14,POLITICS,Keith Ellison May Have A Radical Challenger For DNC Chair -- Who Backed Hillary Clinton,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ilyse-hogue-dnc_us_582c8863e4b058ce7aa86623,NARAL's Ilyse Hogue is the first woman eyeing Democratic National Committee leadership in the Trump era.,2016-11-17,"Ilyse Hogue, left, appeared with Hillary Clinton and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) at a NARAL event in January. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582d0281180000ca0330e8b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue has emerged as a potential contender for Democratic National Committee chair, the first woman floated to lead the Democratic Party through its post-Donald Trump victory turmoil. While Hogue hasn’t reached a firm decision to run, her candidacy would be the strongest challenge to early front-runner Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), a progressive favorite backed by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Former DNC Chair Howard Dean said he’s also running.The DNC contest is being framed in progressive circles as a proxy do-over of the Sanders-Hillary Clinton Democratic primary, with all the acrimony that came with it. After NARAL and Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton early in the campaign, Sanders dismissed them as “the establishment.” Hogue, as the head of NARAL, remains closely associated with Clinton, but said she wants to be thought of as more than that.“I would rather not have my entire life’s work reduced to one position at one point in time, but I’m also not ashamed of it. It’s part of a life of work that I’m proud of,” Hogue said.The rest of that life’s work maps much more closely with Ellison’s politics than with Clinton’s. Hogue, a Dallas native, got her start in the progressive movement at Greenpeace, where she worked as a forest specialist and targeted companies like Home Depot for anti-conservation business practices. She was active in the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, a precursor to the Occupy movement that would spread across the country a decade later. Hogue was arrested and jailed for six days during those protests. (She was later cleared of all charges.)Hogue went on to work for the San Francisco-based radical advocacy group Rainforest Action Network, where she successfully pressured financial giants like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to stop financing deforestation and instead put in place environmentally friendly policies. The group specialized in high-profile public shaming campaigns ― direct actions such as sending protesters to tack up “Wanted” posters near the Greenwich, Connecticut, home of JPMorgan Chase’s then chief, or draping a 50-foot banner over Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. “As is evident from the last week, we’re going into a time of resistance,” Hogue said, referencing massive anti-Trump protests across the country since the election. “That’s sort of how I came up through progressive work ― resistance to the Bush years, resistance to what was happening with globalization.” She later served as the director of political advocacy for MoveOn.org, where she worked against the war in Iraq and for the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and pressured lawmakers to take up financial reform.

It also considered how many residents in any given state are customers of a community water system affected by at least one of these violations.Such violations ― which utilities are required to notify their customers of under the Safe Drinking Water Act ― are not particularly common. But some states struggle more with these issues than others, and an interactive map allows users to compare state-to-state data that also includes the total number of water quality violations and how long they lasted. Nine states — Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas — saw violations that impacted more than 10 percent of their residents last year.About one-third of water customers in Maryland were affected by a health-based water violation, many of which were related to disinfection byproducts like bromate and chlorite. Long-term exposure to these byproducts have been linked to a potentially increased risk of cancer and reproductive and developmental disorders, according to the EPA.Disinfection byproducts were also the culprit in the overwhelming majority of the water violations reported in Kentucky, where 26 percent of water customers were served by a utility hit with a violation.On the flip side of that, five states — Colorado, Delaware, Minnesota, North Dakota and Washington — saw less than 1 percent of their population impacted by water violations.The takeaway from the data, FluksAqua Americas President Hubert Colas explained, is that people are right to feel generally confident in their drinking water. But, he noted, some systems — particularly smaller utilities that have fewer resources — are struggling to keep their water up to code.“We see that the facilities are confronted with a lot of issues in terms how they deliver water quality in the quantity that’s necessary to supply our homes and businesses with quality water 24/7, 365 days a year,” Colas told The Huffington Post. “That’s quite a feat and we take that for granted.”It’s a feat that is spread across a large number of public water systems — approximately 155,000 in the U.S., according to the EPA. Those systems are increasingly relying on state and local funding, as federal support for their operations and maintenance has stagnated in recent years. This makes smaller systems particularly vulnerable to problems and previous analyses have shown that these utilities typically represent the bulk of violations.But few Americans seems to have a firm grasp on what goes on behind the scenes to keep our drinking water safe. Only 21 percent of respondents to the HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted this year said they understood “very well” where their tap water came from and how it’s processed. Thirty-six percent of respondents said they understood their water source “somewhat well,” while 40 percent said they understood it “not very well” or “not well at all.”There is also a dearth of user-friendly national data on water quality, which likely contributes to Americans’ lack of understanding about their tap water.And that remains true even at a time when the ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan, and protests over the Dakota Access pipeline’s potential impact on the Missouri River have raised awareness of the issue.Dr. Katherine Alfredo, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Columbia Water Center, said the “inherent mistrust” of tap water is largely unwarranted, even given high-profile crises in Flint and elsewhere.“These utilities take extreme pride in being a top utility or having the best-produced or best-tasting water,” Alfredo told HuffPost.Still, we could all stand to deepen our understanding of what it takes to keep our water safe. If you’re concerned about your community’s water, you can access the EPA’s consumer confidence reports, which offer basic information about community water concerns.

The original post included the message “Free us… prison reform… free my family!” and the hashtags “#ALLlivesMATTER, #GodLovesAll, #ChaingangChallange.”The issue of prison reform in Alabama has received some added attention following riots at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama, in March.Typically, the biggest obstacle to a successful Mannequin Challenge is getting a large group of people to stand still. For the inmates, another test was obtaining a phone.Al.com reports that “it is unknown which Alabama prison the video was filmed inside of and how the inmates were able to get a smartphone to record the video.” The news outlet noted that the Alabama Department of Corrections has confiscated 3,000 illegal cellphones since January.While lots of people have had fun with the Mannequin Challenge, the concept has also been used to take on more serious issues. One take, by writer and director Simone Shepherd, showed scenes of racial profiling and police brutality."

While the exhibit details Ali’s sports journey, it also highlights his community activism, spirituality and politics.“We are extremely grateful to LeBron James,” said Damion Thomas, curator of the museum’s Sports Gallery. “As the most socially active superstar in sports today, LeBron James is a testament to the influence of Muhammad Ali (who) embodied the racial and social tumult of his times, blurring lines between politics and sports, activism and entertainment.”James’ business partner, Maverick Carter, is also contributing to the exhibit, which has been on display since the museum opened on Sept. 24.The funds will also support the museum itself, which is located on the National Mall.The $540 million museum contains 36,000 items that trace the journey of African Americans from slavery in the 1800s to the fight for civil rights in the 20th century and lauds modern icons such as media mogul Oprah Winfrey and tennis champion Serena Williams.Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, who was inspired by Yoruban art from West Africa, designed the museum."
19,POLITICS,Howard Dean: Democrats Shouldn't Just Oppose Everything Donald Trump Proposes,"Althia Raj, Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/howard-dean-donald-trump_us_582dda53e4b030997bbdd637,The former DNC chair wants his job back. And he has a more nuanced plan to help Democrats regain power.,2016-11-17,Howard Dean wants to be the Democratic National Committee chair again.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"OTTAWA — Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chair who wants his old job back, is advising Democrats not to take the path of complete opposition to Donald Trump once the new president takes office.“Donald Trump has proposed some things that make sense,” Dean said, pointing to the president-elect’s massive infrastructure pledge. If Trump drops the corporate tax rate to 18 per cent and finances it by getting rid of corporate loopholes, should also support that, Dean added.“I don’t think we should oppose any idea that comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth just because it’s Donald Trump.”The former Vermont governor’s comments echo what Democratic Party leadership in Congress has also said. But they may rankle some in the party’s base, who have encouraged Democrats not to normalize Trump by giving him legislative wins. Congressional Republicans recaptured power after the 2008 elections by opposing, in lockstep, President Barack Obama’s agenda, they noted.Dean looks back at that first year of the Obama administration as a low point in opposition governance. The Republicans put their political interests ahead of the country’s and it was destructive to both, he said in an interview with The Huffington Post Canada from Ottawa, where he was speaking at the Canadian American Business Council. But Dean isn’t calling for pure capitulation. He argued that the party needs to steadfastly defend its main priorities, and that includes the Iran nuclear deal, which he previously criticized but now calls one of “President Obama’s lasting legacies.”“I think we gave away too much but I think it was about the only thing you could do ... and I think we should try to make it work,” he told HuffPost.One legislative topic where Dean may find himself at odds with his party’s base is trade. He is supportive of the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA, and argues that the benefits had far outweighed the costs. “The rhetoric around these global treaties is exaggerated,” he said, noting they helped lift a billion people out of poverty.“Have they cost us manufacturing jobs? No, they certainly have not,” he continued. “It is true that they have cost us manufacturing jobs in Ohio and Iowa and in places like that, but it has increased the number of manufacturing jobs, in particular agricultural jobs, in North Carolina, up and down the east and the west coast.” Dean said he is open to re-negotiating NAFTA but scrapping the deal completely would be “crazy.” He argued that automation was far more damaging development to sectors like the auto industry. “The idea that we are all going to get these factories back is nonsense. I mean I wish it were true. Politicians who claim it is true, they lie right in the public’s face,” he said. “We’ve got to start over in the new economy, we’re not going to back to the old economy.”Despite his support for trade, Dean argued that the Democratic Party stands to benefit by replicating much of the political success of two ardent NAFTA critics: Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Focusing on both “working class” whites and people of color is the path to bringing the party back to power, he said.“These folks who voted for Trump are by and large people who have lost their job and don’t have college education, and the Internet is moving everything so fast that it is very very hard to get a job in the new economy unless you are digital native or unless you have a pretty high education level,” he said. “Those are the people that we should be looking at and trying to make sure that they can still get a fair break in this country.”“It is not ‘Make America Great Again’,” he said, in reference to Trump’s campaign slogan. “It is ‘Make America Fair Again’ — and that should be our slogan going forward.”Asked how the Democrats had lost sight of working class people, Dean said he didn’t know.“I haven’t been active in the DNC for eight years,” he said. “When we have the White House, the DNC withers because what happens is the DNC becomes the president’s re-elect [committee].”Dean faces a potentially crowded field in his quest to be elected DNC chair once more. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) is an early frontrunner for the post, with the backing of top Democrats in Congress as well as Sanders. Dean said he is better placed for the post because he held it during similarly bleak times (when he took the job in 2005, the Democrats didn’t have the House, the Senate, or the White House). It would also be his sole job and not something he’d have to split with his congressional duties, he added. Dean praised Ellison as a good guy, but said the job of DNC chair requires full time attention. It is the “hardest job I ever had,” he said, before suggesting it is against the bylaws of the Democratic National Committee to have two jobs. (The bylaws of the DNC state that, “The National Chairperson shall serve full time.” They do not explicitly prohibit someone from holding two jobs.)“I think I’m the favourite,” he told HuffPost. “This is not about inside the beltway votes and endorsements, it’s about outside the beltway, and sitting in people’s kitchens in places like Des Moines and Montgomery that is how you get this done.”"

However, due to complications with her last two pregnancies, the reality star is considering using a surrogate.Turns out, she may have the perfect candidate in friend Chrissy Teigen.In a recent interview with Access Hollywood, the Sports Illustrated model happily admitted, “I would be her surrogate in a second.” “I really enjoyed the pregnancy process. I loved it,” she added. “Yes, in a heartbeat.” Talk about friendship goals. Teigen, who gave birth to baby Luna, her first child with husband John Legend, in April, has been open about fertility struggles, pregnancy and motherhood. In a May interview with Entertainment Tonight, the model couldn’t help but gush about her baby girl.“We’re so happy,” Teigen said. “It’s been really exciting and fun, and every day is so different, and seeing all her little changes is so cute.” Meanwhile, Kardashian already has North, 3, and Saint, 11 months, with husband Kanye West. She, too, has been open about her pregnancies, though she didn’t love the process quite as much as Teigen. “I’m gonna keep it real: For me, pregnancy is the worst experience of my life! LOL! I don’t enjoy one moment of it and I don’t understand people who enjoy it. My mom and Kourtney clearly did! More power to them but I just don’t relate,” she wrote on her blog last year. Seems like these two would be the perfect pregnancy match. "

And now, after six years of House Democrats taking a drubbing on Election Day, Ryan is saying it’s time for a change in leadership.“I don’t like Nancy Pelosi; I love Nancy Pelosi,” Ryan told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. “I think she’s terrific. I mean, she’s got more energy than half the caucus put together. She knows how to raise money. She’s great on the floor.”“But,” Ryan continued, because of course there’s a but, “it’s about, ‘Is she the best person to help us get the majority back?’”Ryan argued that Pelosi would have a hard time going into a Republican district and convincing voters that they should support Democrats. “And so we need a leader who can go into all of those areas.”But is Ryan running?“I’m feeling out whether or not there are people who have been here awhile who may have views on this stuff,” Ryan said.If that sounds squirrelly, it probably should.Ryan has been busy making the rounds on cable news and calling Democratic colleagues, determining if this is something that’s feasible.“I am getting calls and I am making calls. But not just for me. I’m kind of feeling where the caucus is, you know?” Ryan said. “Where are we and is there an appetite for change?”There seems to be an appetite for something, at least. Democrats delayed leadership elections Tuesday after Ryan and other Democrats lobbied Pelosi over the weekend to postpone the minority leader race. (Ryan ended up taking his name off of a letter pushing Pelosi to delay the voting for fear that other signers might be seen as supporting his tentative candidacy.)But the question remains: Is Ryan actually running ― he continues to pass on answering that, even as he seems to be campaigning ― or is he is simply a placeholder for another candidate?Ryan, 43, acknowledges that he would step aside if the right person came forward.“Doesn’t have to be me,” he said. “I mean, I got a young family. This has never been an aspiration of mine. I’ve been here 14 years. Never dreamed of running for leadership. But we got to do something. Donald Trump is the president of the United States. That means we really screwed up.”After passing on a previous run for the Ohio governor’s mansion, Ryan also passed on a Senate run in 2016, with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) cruising to victory over former Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland. Ryan may have his eye back on a 2018 governor’s race, now that Hillary Clinton has lost the presidential election and his chances of a Cabinet appointment have disintegrated. For the time being, he seems happy to raise his profile ― which he acknowledged he had done ― by flirting with a run for minority leader and potentially demonstrating to another candidate that there’s hunger for a leadership change.“I’m not sure I’m the best person for this job,” Ryan said. “I’m not sure that I’m the guy that would do it. But I do think someone that comes from an area of the country like mine, somebody that represents a district like mine, that can connect with working-class people in the Great Lake states.”The candidate Ryan seems to be waiting on is the current vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, Joe Crowley, who’s expected to easily become the chairman, if he doesn’t run for something bigger.Crowley (D-N.Y.) has the connections across the caucus to mount a real challenge, even with Pelosi’s near-stranglehold on the position. The Hill reported Wednesday night that Democrats have been trying to recruit Crowley to run.He’s made little indication that he’s open to challenging Pelosi, but he also doesn’t sound entirely against the idea at this point.When The Huffington Post confronted Crowley on Wednesday night on his way to vote, he evaded repeated questions about whether he was running for minority leader. “Going to vote,” Crowley said, as an aide interrupted and tried to end the interview during a casual walk through a tunnel to the Capitol.“I got less than 30 seconds before the vote closes,” Crowley said. His aide insisted that she needed to talk to him and that they needed space. “We’re working here,” Crowley said, wryly.Meanwhile, despite the delay to the election, Pelosi is already claiming she has two-thirds of the caucus lined up behind her, and Democratic aides are insisting that Crowley would have difficulty coalescing lawmakers behind his candidacy ― and that Queens, New York, isn’t exactly the Rust Belt.“The liberal wing of the party would burn down the Capitol if two New Yorkers cozy with Wall Street became the top Democratic leaders,” one House aide told HuffPost. “[Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer has been able to hold off liberal criticism of his Wall Street record, but a Joe Crowley candidacy for leader would break the dam.”The aide continued that Crowley wouldn’t beat Pelosi and that he was better off “becoming unanimously elected caucus chairman than risking it all for something he cannot win.”In the meantime, while Crowley makes his decision, there’s chatter that outgoing Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) has been making calls about a potential leadership run himself, possibly for leader but also possibly for whip, the position occupied by longtime Democratic leadership No. 2 Steny Hoyer (D-Md.).The Pelosi-Hoyer combination has sat atop the House Democratic Caucus for well over a decade, with Pelosi’s name in front ever since she leapfrogged Hoyer in a 2001 race to become minority whip. Hoyer, 77, seems to be waiting for Pelosi to retire so he can take the top job, and Pelosi, 76, seems to be waiting for Hoyer to retire so she can leave. The two have been sort of high-functioning frenemies ever since they interned for former Sen. Daniel Brewster (D-Md.) in the 1960s.So House Democrats, currently in their smallest minority since 1929, keep electing small variations of the same leadership team, despite losing the majority in 2010 and bleeding more and more seats since then. With Trump at the top of the ticket, Democrats expected gains of 20 or more seats. They won six or seven, depending on how some recounts shake out.That’s leading many Democrats to question how they ever got here.“Republicans control everything,” Ryan said. “And I’m scared to death of what they’re going to do. And, you know, I’m half Irish and half Italian, so I want to fight.”Ryan said Trump presents voters with a real contrast between the two parties. “They’re going to kick people off their health care. They’re going to privatize Medicare. And they’re going to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in the country.”“There’s not going to be a clearer contrast,” he said.Ryan acknowledges that he hasn’t been the prolific fundraiser that Pelosi has, but he says the problem for Democrats hasn’t been fundraising.“Like, this isn’t about money,” he said. “If it was about money, Hillary Clinton would be president and we’d be in the majority.”Still, he grants that Democrats may feel more comfortable with someone having more experience leading the caucus, particularly with Trump as president and Republicans controlling both chambers. That may suggest Ryan is just clearing the path for Crowley, perhaps raising his profile for his governor’s bid. He promises, however, that if he does get in, he’d be serious about. “If I would get in, it would be to win it, I’ll tell you that.”He’s just not in right now."

Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) speaks during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) has announced he will challenge Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as House Minority Leader.“While having a position in Democratic Leadership has never been my life’s ambition, after this election I believe we all need to re-evaluate our roles within the Caucus, the Democratic Party, and our country,” Ryan wrote in a letter to his Democratic colleagues announcing the decision. “That is why I am announcing my run for Minority Leader of the Democratic Caucus and humbly request your support.”Although Ryan faces steep odds against his leadership bid, his candidacy speaks to the turmoil in Democratic ranks after Hillary Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump in the presidential race and the party’s failure to retake control of the Senate.On Tuesday, House Democrats, reeling from the election results, decided to delay leadership elections until Nov. 30.Pelosi, a prolific fundraiser who has led House Democrats since 2002, already responded to rumors of a challenge with a letter to colleagues on Wednesday announcing her candidacy and declaring that she had the support of two-thirds of the Democratic caucus. There is also some concern about replacing Congress’ only female party leader with yet another white man.Given the low probability of his election, there is reason to believe that Ryan is trying to raise his profile with an eye toward other political offices, including a possible gubernatorial bid in Ohio. Speaking on Monday about Ryan’s consideration of a run, spokesman Michael Zetts emphasized the congressman’s success with the kinds of white, blue-collar voters in the Great Lakes region among whom Clinton performed so poorly. Ryan, a former high school football quarterback who has served in Congress since 2003, represents a district that includes onetime manufacturing hubs like Youngstown.Ryan has a record of economic populism on issues like trade and a more moderate record on issues like abortion, only declaring himself pro-choice in January 2015 in what many saw as preparation for a possible vice presidential bid. In 2012, Ryan authored A Mindful Nation, a book promoting mindfulness meditation as a remedy for many of contemporary society’s problems.Ryan did not explicitly invoke his background in the letter to colleagues, however, focusing instead on the electoral losses the party has suffered under its current leadership.“Under our current leadership, Democrats have been reduced to our smallest congressional minority since 1929,” he wrote. “This should indicate to all of us that keeping our leadership team completely unchanged will simply lead to more disappointment in future elections.”"

He believed his small Appalachian town had been forgotten by the political class. Recently retired from a corrections job, he had all the time in the world to shake things up. “People aren’t listened to, there are no jobs in this town, and we’re going bankrupt,” he says. His four-word campaign slogan summed it all up: “Had Enough? I Have!”A few weeks later, Donald Trump announced he was running for president. Mash didn’t care for the real estate mogul’s personality ― “I wouldn’t have him over for dinner,” the 54-year-old says ― but much of what the Republican candidate railed against, from NAFTA to illegal immigration to political correctness, resonated. He and Trump practically could have swapped campaign slogans. Mash backed him immediately: “He came right out with the same beliefs I had.”Mash now sits on Nelsonville’s city council, and Donald Trump is headed to the White House. Trump pulled off his stunning upset over Hillary Clinton in large part by flipping the likes of Ed Mash. When he went to cast his ballot for Trump in Ohio’s open Republican primary in March, Mash was actually a registered Democrat. He had voted for President Barack Obama in 2008. And he had spent 10 years as a shop steward for a public-sector union that was among Clinton’s strongest backers.A bunch of Mash’s buddies working in the state prison system flipped to Trump’s column, too. And so did much of Nelsonville, population 5,197. Four years ago, the town fell overwhelmingly in Obama’s column. The president clobbered Romney in all four of the city’s precincts, beating the Republican by a 40-point margin. Four years earlier, Obama had defeated John McCain here by nearly the same commanding spread. But last week, Trump ended up narrowly winning Nelsonville, taking three out of four precincts, and edging Clinton 46 percent to 45 overall. The town ― 94 percent white and much of it impoverished ― is a microcosm for what went wrong for Clinton in the election. She still managed to win Athens County at large, a blue oasis that’s home to Nelsonville and Ohio University, but not at the margin that Obama did. Her vulnerability with working-class voters cost her not just Ohio but Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Despite a lively downtown square with shops and art galleries, Nelsonville is still hurting for jobs. The old coal work is gone. What’s known in town as the Mine is not a mine ― it’s a bar that sells $2 PBR beers. The median household income is below $24,000 per year, or less than half the national average, and more than 40 percent of its residents ― three times the national average ― live below the federal poverty line. Less than half the adult population is in the workforce. The area has been wrestling with a heroin problem for years.  Mash counts himself lucky. He grew up here poor, but eventually landed a good union job, working as a network administrator for the prison ― about as well as one could do without a college degree. It eventually paid him $43 an hour and provided a good pension after three decades of service. He could have worked a few more years, but he says he retired in part to open up a position for someone else. Some of the best jobs are in corrections. He has two grown kids still in the area, a son who’s a maintenance supervisor and a daughter who works at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant. “You got a job now, you better hang onto it,” he says. Nelsonville’s most famous employer is Rocky Brands, a name familiar to any devoted whitetail hunter. A mural of the company’s trademark ram looms over the town’s main artery. Rocky Brands grew out of the old factory downtown where footwear was once made by locals, including some of Mash’s relatives. Like most U.S. apparel jobs, those gradually went overseas; the old factory is now a Rocky outlet store where workers sell marked-down Western boots and hunting gear made in places like the Dominican Republic. The company’s CEO personally endorsed Trump.Chris Barrows, a 55-year-old who voted for Clinton, said Trump’s simple message on trade resonated with people here. “Jobs used to be here. That factory left. I understand what he’s talking about. NAFTA ― that speaks to me,” said Barrows, who argued these points with his ex-girlfriend, a Trump voter. “But just knowing what he does for a living, how he’s got a company that makes money doing just that. I just don’t get it.”Barrows said it didn’t seem to matter that Trump and his family have gotten wealthy making suits, ties and shoes overseas, only that he raised the issue and owned it. Showing just how impervious the campaign was on trade, it even sent Trump’s son, Donald Jr., to the Rocky offices for a visit extolling the brand. A local report on the event doesn’t quote the heir talking about outsourcing, only his love for hunting and how it’s important for the economy. Across the street from the retail store is Rocky’s headquarters. Locals are proud the company still makes its corporate home here. “It’s still a godsend,” Mash says, noting the high pay of the corporate jobs and the boost to the tax base. But many of those positions are out of reach if you don’t have a college degree. Only 7 percent of the city’s residents have a bachelor’s or higher, according to Census data. What happened in a place like Nelsonville last week may have shocked a lot of operatives, journalists and pollsters, but it didn’t surprise locals who knocked on doors ahead of the election. That includes Lori Crook, who volunteered for Clinton. She grew up in the area, spent 20 years in New York City, then returned in 2010 and now lives in a small bungalow not far from the town square. Six days after the election, her front porch was piled high with sad-looking Clinton-Kaine signs.“In a nutshell, her campaign here was saying, ‘You like Obama and his ideas. Then you can have more of the same,’” Crook said. “But that sold her short, and it wasn’t enough. ... They were here to reach the base and get out the vote. But there was no real attempt to have a dialogue.” Clinton did roll out a plan to revitalize parts of Appalachia hurt by the loss of coal jobs, built on infrastructure spending, the reclamation of old mining sites and new tax credits. Like most Clinton plans, it was steeped in policy and detail. The question was whether anyone actually read or heard it. Taylor Sappington, a 25-year-old progressive who ran with Mash for council, recalled Clinton speaking about the plan when she made a campaign stop at a brewery down the road in Athens. Beyond that, he didn’t hear much about it.“It was clear how the Clinton campaign message just wasn’t working here,” said Sappington, who studied at Ohio University and works at the Texas Roadhouse with Mash’s daughter. When Sappington canvassed for Clinton in September, he was taken aback by how many people told him they had settled on voting for Trump. These were registered Democrats.Mash viewed Trump not as a Republican but as an outsider, just like himself when he ran for council and won. In his opinion, Trump’s talk on trade made him sound like a Democrat should. Mash says he would have taken a serious look at Bernie Sanders had he defeated Clinton in the primary. “He was all about change, too,” he says.Trump’s focus on jobs and winning let him overlook everything about Trump that Democrats and the media assumed would doom his run. The “Access Hollywood” tape? Didn’t bother Mash ― what annoyed him was the media’s replaying it. Trump’s smear of Mexican immigrants or his plan to ban all Muslims from entering the country? Blown out of proportion. He resented the charge that voting for Trump made him racist. “Who can tell me there’s any way of fixing this country without jobs?” Mash says. “Black or white, they’ve all got one common goal: They need a job. ... Everyone says the economy is doing great. But I don’t see jobs around here.”Six days after the election, Mash was having coffee with Sappington at a cafe on the Nelsonville square. The two are friends, despite their very different votes last week, and find a lot of common ground in their council dealings. They had some business to go over before that night’s regular meeting. They also sorted through why an erstwhile Democrat like Mash voted the way he did, and how Trump managed to take a town like Nelsonville. Mash said his Trump vote should send a message to Republicans as well as Democrats, that both parties need to pay attention to towns like Nelsonville. Sappington couldn’t disagree more on the candidate ― but he also believed Democrats ignored towns like his for too long.He said the most painful part for him was talking to his mother after the election. They worried about her insurance job, given the odds of an Obamacare repeal, and whether he would still have the right to marry who he wanted to in a couple of years. Above all, as Sappington put it, they worried about “democratic norms and civil society.” “These are all the thoughts she’s spinning out at me,” he said. “And that hurts. ... We’re worried this is a real, detrimental change.”Mash assured Sappington he was a free-agent voter, and that he’d reject Trump in four years if Trump didn’t deliver on his promises. He expected to see the wall built along the southern border, to see Obamacare repealed, to see NAFTA renegotiated, and to see the seeds of new jobs in Appalachia. “We the people, if he’s that bad, can have him removed,” Mash told his friend. “It’ll work out. We’ve had how many presidents over the years, and we’re still here standing.”"

25,POLITICS,No Talk Of Donald Trump For Justice Alito At Big Conservative Lawyers' Convention,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/samuel-alito-donald-trump-federalist-society_us_582dd4d8e4b099512f8134ab,The Federalist Society helped the president-elect compile a list of Supreme Court candidates.,2016-11-17,Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito speaks at the Federalist Society's National Lawyers Convention in Washington on Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Justice Samuel Alito kicked off on Thursday the annual gathering of The Federalist Society, one of the legal groups that helped Donald Trump select names for his lengthy wish list of Supreme Court candidates.Yet neither Alito nor Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the conservative lawyers’ collective, brought up the president-elect by name or the results of last week’s election during the event’s opening ceremony. Instead, the focus of Alito’s remarks ― and the theme of the conference ― was the legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose empty seat Trump will certainly get a chance to fill once he takes office in January. By then, the vacancy will be nearly a year old.“There has been a palpable emptiness in the room,” Alito said, recounting Scalia’s absence from dozens of oral arguments and private conferences the justices have conducted without him.Alito ran through Scalia’s biggest contributions to the law ― including the doctrines of textualism and originalism ― but saved some of his more pointed comments for the “constitutional fault lines” that exist in the country.He name-checked ongoing issues with religious liberty, gun rights, the administrative state and freedom of speech ― particularly the “new orthodoxy” in college campuses to police the words students use.Josh Blackman, a law professor from Texas, live-tweeted Alito’s speech and captured a line that drew laughter from the audience. Alito stopped short of discussing how the vacancy has affected the functioning of the Supreme Court ― something that his more liberal bench mates Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan have been candid about in public appearances.On Wednesday, Leo and Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway confirmed to reporters that Trump was sticking to his 21-name list of hopefuls. Of those, all but Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) are sitting judges. Lee has said he has no interest in the job.For many of the hundreds of lawyers and law students who have descended on Washington to participate in the Federalist Society’s national convention, which runs until Saturday, it will be their first opportunity to catch some of these jurists in action. Nine of them are expected at the gathering, either as panelists or moderators.The Heritage Foundation’s John Malcolm, whose organization also contributed to Trump’s menu of high court candidates, wrote in a hopeful column Tuesday that the president-elect’s choices were “excellent.”“Let’s hope Trump leaves a legacy that strengthens and preserves the Constitution for us all,” Malcolm wrote.Depending on what other vacancies arise in the next four years, Trump could name up to three or four new justices to the Supreme Court."

He still may end up as Donald Trump's chief diplomat.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump’s transition team remains vexed about how to structure key foreign policy positions with just months to go before inauguration. Causing the logjam is a mix of bureaucratic friction, internal staff disputes and a lack of direction from the top of the ticket. Occasionally, the disorder has spilled out publicly, with the floating of a variety of names with no apparent ideological consistency for top posts. On Wednesday, news broke that South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) was under consideration for secretary of state, while several transition sources told The Huffington Post that the previous front-runner, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, was losing favor among transition staff. The Trump transition team attempted to alleviate concerns over the state of operations during a conference call on Wednesday night, announcing that “landing teams” would begin meeting with officials at four separate federal agencies and revealing that Trump would meet with an “unbelievable” group of people on Thursday. The list included Haley in addition to several Republican foreign policy officials, from Henry Kissinger to Gen. Jack Keane. That Trump is still feeling out who to trust for this critical portfolio is, in part, a function of the way that he operated as a candidate. During the campaign, he skewered neoconservatives who have long dominated Republican foreign policy, charging that President George W. Bush lied to get the country into the Iraq War. And Trump cozied up to Russia’s Vladimir Putin, who is regarded by many in the GOP establishment as an arch enemy of the United States. Having run against the Republican foreign policy platform, Trump has found it hard to find Republicans to carry out his foreign policy agenda. “It’s the creepy Russia stuff that really has foreign policy people creeped out,” said one GOP official who was contacted by the transition office about his interest in working in the administration. He declined. “A lot of the foreign policy people saw the intel on what Putin was doing and none of it looked good.” Inside the Trump transition team, there is disagreement over how much they should try to repair bridges to the rest of the GOP foreign policy community. Eliot Cohen, a prominent neoconservative who criticized Trump during the campaign, said he was berated during his meeting with transition staff. He subsequently advised Republican foreign policy officials to stay away.Elsewhere, ideologically dissimilar figures and onetime outsiders appear to be gaining status within Trump world. Several sources told HuffPost that Gen. James Mattis, who was once floated by Republicans as a last-minute alternative to Trump’s candidacy, is under consideration for the job of Defense Secretary ― though one of those sources described it as more of a “wish” among certain staffers than a likelihood. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), whose hawkishness stands in stark contrast to Trump’s calls for limited interventions, has been floated for the Pentagon post too, as has former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent.Meanwhile, insiders say hard-edged former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a prominent Iraq War supporter, continues to remain the leading candidate to end up at Foggy Bottom, creating an incongruous image if there ever was one. Bolton, a relentless Putin foe, is on track to take over the top diplomatic post for a president-elect who spoke to Putin by phone on Monday and pledged warmer relations between the U.S. and Russia. But this is the current state of the Trump transition team: odd fits, mixed messages and undeniable drama that would be more enjoyable to watch if the stakes weren’t so particularly high. As the week has progressed, the leaking of names for key posts had moved from a trickle to a constant stream, giving the impression that Trump is beginning to treat the process as if it were reality TV. He even referred to potential nominees as “finalists” on Twitter. “What’s remarkable about today is the random names suddenly flying around,” said one person who’s been consulting with the transition team.The chaotic nature of the effort has left Obama administration officials worried that talented Republicans will simply decline job offers, wary that there will be no coherence or stability in the next White House. But many Republicans are also turned off by some of the leadership already in place. According to multiple sources, the strong likelihood that Retired Lt. General Michael Flynn will be named National Security Adviser has rankled traditional GOP foreign policy types who view him as difficult to work with and too close to Russia. “He is a hard-headed guy,” said the aforementioned GOP official. “He’s not dumb. But he is very single-track-minded.” Further complicating matters for Trump is that his transition process has so far moved painfully slowly. It took until Tuesday evening for incoming Vice President Mike Pence to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Obama administration to legally allow transition conversations to move forward. It took another day for the transition team to apparently sign the code of conduct forms (which list potential conflicts of interest) and provide a list of all transition team members in order to get direct meetings started. As of Wednesday afternoon, the New York Times reported that both the State Department and the Pentagon had not yet heard from anyone on Trump’s team, though that presumably will change soon.Despite the slow pace, the Trump team insists that, internally, everything is moving along fine. “It depends where you are and where you sit,” said one top Republican involved in transition talks. “It is not chaotic. I just think people who are on the outs are pissed off.”As during the campaign, there is some general indifference within Trump’s ranks to how the press is covering their operations. There is also a sense that the president-elect doesn’t mind the dysfunction and even thrives on it.“Just like in college where everybody’s competing for the three seats that are gonna get them into grad school, that’s the mood. There’s all this jockeying: Who does [Trump’s son-in-law] Jared [Kushner] like? Who does Donald like? Who does Pence like?” said one source in regular contact with the transition. “They don’t think it’s a shambles. He’s been president-elect by surprise for a week now.” Amid all the leaks, though, one omission is becoming increasingly apparent. Trump spent much of his campaign talking about how he will get tough with China, but appears to be paying no attention to it as he puts together his foreign policy structure. “The absence of any China [economic] experience borders on malpractice,” said one GOP source asked for advice by the transition team. He had assumed the consultations were pro forma but, he cautioned, it’s too soon to count Trump out. “Surprisingly, it does sound like they’re seriously asking for good people. I think the last week has been a wake-up call and they’re slightly humbled, believe it or not. They’re growing up,” he said. “Those meetings yesterday were apparently true consultations.” "

In a Facebook post, the company thanked its customers for their help and wrote that Ben will now be “set for life.”PREVIOUSLY: Carter has also started a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to create a documentary about his experience with #CupForBen. He hopes to highlight autism and its impact on families.“As big as the story is, the bigger story is about all the other parents who have a ‘Ben’ and their own Little Blue Cup that is so debilitating to the lives of the whole family,” he wrote.A dad searching for a specific cup for his son with autism has found some help from people he doesn’t even know.On Monday, Marc Carter, who lives in North Devon in England, tweeted that his son Ben needed a replacement for his Tommee Tippee cup. Carter told The Huffington Post that his son will be 14 on Saturday and has used the cup exclusively since he was 2 years old. In the past, Ben had to be treated for dehydration because he won’t drink out of other cups.“He doesn’t drink outside of the house so we can’t go anywhere,” Carter wrote on Twitter.Carter said he was able to replace Ben’s first disintegrating cup a few years ago, but now his son’s current cup, which isn’t made anymore, is also in bad shape. He wrote that it won’t last long and asked for help in finding more cups, including photos so people would know what he is looking for.Twitter users quickly began sending in photos of similar cups they had in various colors and styles and offered to send them to Carter. He clarified though that they had to be almost identical to what Ben currently has. Tommee Tippee, the company behind the cup, even had its team search for it in the same style and color and helped spread the word about Carter’s search on Facebook and Twitter.On Tuesday, Carter gave an update on Twitter and thanked everyone for their help. He told HuffPost he’s received four cups in the mail so far. “The cups are all perfect, look like they haven’t even been used, the right color, just what we need,” he said.Carter also said that Tommee Tippee, who asked its customers if they had cups like Ben’s, is sending about 25 more his way. He described everyone who has spread the word and sent cups as his “heroes.” “It’s so fantastic. I genuinely cried at a few points in the past few days,” he said. “I also love that it’s making people think about autism, even if just for a few minutes.”The appreciative dad noted that because his son will likely need these cups for the rest of his life, he will be seeking more in the future. For now though, he is thankful for strangers who rallied together to help his son.“Genuinely this is better than winning the lottery.”"

By Monday, 7,118 people had signed up.The response was amazing, but that’s too large a number to be able to securely verify people’s identities, Santosuosso said. Plus, the volunteers would need to be trained in bystander intervention tactics to accompany their neighbors.So now she’s planning to leverage the overwhelming interest to get people engaged in their communities. “We want to flip this on its head,” she said. “Instead of waiting around on a list, why don’t we train 7,000 people in bystander intervention and de-escalation and send people out into their day-to-day?”Santuosso wants to get the trainings started within the next two weeks. Once they’re underway, she hopes to “break it down and sort of try to get groups going on a neighborhood level.”“Trump wants to deport millions of immigrants, he wants to register Muslims,” she wrote in an email to people who had signed up. “And in order to truly protect our most vulnerable, it is going to take thousands of us, working to keep our neighborhoods safe. Now is the time, we are the ones who will do it.”Those interested in the trainings can continue to add their names to Santosuosso’s Google sign-up form.The Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.

The late Roman-Byzantine era marble tablet, dating from around A.D. 300-830, weighs 115 pounds and is inscribed with 20 lines of chiseled Samaritan script. It was likely displayed at the entrance of an ancient synagogue destroyed by either the Romans between A.D. 400 to 600 or 11th century Crusaders, according to Heritage Auctions, which hosted the sale.The auction house said the stone’s middle portion was heavily worn, likely due to foot traffic.Experts believe that the stone’s finders did not know its value when they uncovered it during a railway excavation near the city of Yavneh, in what is now Israel, in 1913. They either gave it or sold it to a man who set the tablet, inscription side up, into the threshold of a room. The tablet was eventually sold and evaluated in the early 1940s, and its significance as the world’s earliest-known complete inscription of the Ten Commandments became known. By 2005, the Israel Antiquities Authority granted export approval for the piece to the Living Torah Museum, which put the stone up for auction with the approval of IAA. The new owner, who has not been identified, is under obligation to display the tablet for the benefit of the public. Bidding started at $300,000.This article has been updated to reflect that Israel was not a state in 1913 when the artifact was found."

The residents said they believed up to 200 people were killed in the weeks before Islamic State withdrew from the town.Human Rights Watch said some of the former policemen were separated from a group of about 2,000 people from nearby villages and towns who were forced to march alongside the militants last month as they retreated north to Mosul and the town of Tal Afar.It quoted a laborer who said he saw Islamic State fighters drive four large trucks carrying 100 to 125 men, some of whom he recognized as former policemen, past an agricultural college close to the site which was to become the mass grave.Minutes later, he heard automatic gunfire and cries of distress, he said. The next night, on Oct. 29, a similar scene was repeated, with between 130 to 145 men, he told HRW.Another witness, a resident of Hammam al-Alil, said he heard automatic gunfire in the area for approximately seven minutes, three nights in a row.“This is another piece of evidence of the horrific mass murder by ISIS (Islamic State) of former law enforcement officers in and around Mosul,” said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “ISIS should be held accountable for these crimes against humanity.”"

He has repeatedly urged the U.S. to help Israel bomb Iran or do it alone. Even as Iran was in the final stages of negotiating an international agreement that requires it to dramatically scale back its nuclear infrastructure, Bolton recommended a military attack. Thursday’s remark suggests that he has no plans to tone down his adventurist foreign policy views, which run counter to Trump’s repeated promises to focus resources domestically and to avoid unnecessary entanglements abroad.The Trump campaign has struggled to outline a cohesive foreign policy vision. But to the extent that the president-elect has a worldview, it seems to lean non-interventionist. He has said he would require U.S. allies to shoulder more of the burden for their own security, even suggesting that some non-nuclear nations could obtain nuclear weapons to defend themselves without help from Washington. He speaks aggressively about “destroying” the Islamic State but hasn’t offered a plan to match his rhetoric. Instead, he’s suggested that he might let Russia, which is backing Syrian President Bashar Assad, take charge of outside efforts to help resolve the civil war in Syria.One of Trump’s first calls with a foreign leader after the election was with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia is allied with Iran in the Syrian conflict, making Bolton’s comments about Iran that much more awkward.Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump slammed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for being too quick to intervene militarily. At every opportunity, he brought up her vote for the Iraq War and her push for NATO airstrikes in Libya ― even though he had backed both operations at the time. Bolton said Thursday that he finds the debate between interventionism and non-interventionism “unproductive.” “To me, it’s like saying, ‘Do you prefer a spoon or a knife?” he said. “And the immediate next question is, ‘Well, for what?’ That’s how I view interventionism and non-interventionism. These are the tools in the country’s toolkit and you do what’s appropriate.”Yet Bolton often prefers the knife of intervention, no matter what the occasion. Much like the proponents of the Iraq War who said the 2003 invasion would be a straightforward undertaking welcomed by the Iraqis, Bolton said Thursday that Iranians want regime change. He also hinted that such regime change could involve the U.S. arming opposition groups.“I don’t think the regime is popular, but I think it has the guns. I think ― there are ways of supporting the opposition. It does not involve the use of American military force. It does involve helping the opposition to get a different kind of government,” Bolton said.He did not respond to requests from The Huffington Post for clarification on how regime change in Iran might take place without direct U.S. military intervention. In the Breitbart interview, Bolton criticized President Barack Obama for not doing more to support the Green Movement protests in Iran in 2009. But he has also supported more extreme opponents to the regime. Bolton has attended rallies in support of Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), an exiled Iranian dissident group that the U.S. classified as a terrorist organization until 2012.The obvious disconnect between the worldviews of Trump and Bolton makes it hard to grasp why the president-elect is considering Bolton to be his top diplomat. But lacking any foreign policy experience himself, Trump is easily swayed in this area by the advice of those close to him, multiple sources with knowledge of the transition told The Huffington Post. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, likes Bolton, the sources said, in part because of Bolton’s extreme anti-Iran stance and his related unconditional support for Israel. Billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, Trump’s largest financial backers during the campaign, have been heavy supporters of Bolton as well.Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment.While Trump has called the Iran nuclear agreement a “disaster” and the “worst deal ever negotiated,” he hasn’t urged overthrowing the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as an alternative. At times during the campaign, Trump said he would rip up the nuclear accord, but more frequently, he made vague promises to “renegotiate” the terms of the deal and extract more concessions from Iran. He said he would “enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before.”Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee ― who has also been floated as a possible secretary of state ― said Wednesday that it’s more likely that Trump will seek to build consensus among U.S. allies that Iran is violating the agreement than move to tear up the deal immediately.Ryan Grim contributed reporting.

34,POLITICS,Barack Obama Will Hand Donald Trump A Sweeping Ability To Wage War Without Oversight,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-trump-drones-war-torture_us_582e27a5e4b058ce7aaa2928,The notoriously unpredictable president-elect will soon decide who to target with drone strikes.,2016-11-17,The expansive authority President Barack Obama has claimed to wage war will soon be passed on to President-elect Trump.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582e28a41a00002400cc8868.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama entered office in 2009 with the promise of reining in his predecessor’s freewheeling use of military force abroad. But rather than rolling back the authorities former President George W. Bush exercised, Obama has expanded some of his most controversial national security programs ― such as the drone program and conducting warfare without specific congressional authorization.While there were cases where Obama reversed Bush-era policies, critics say he often did so with minimal transparency and accountability. Obama has set a precedent for the next commander-in-chief to claim even greater unilateral authority on the use of force. In two months, he will hand off an empowered executive branch to Donald Trump, a man he has described as lacking the temperament, experience and values to lead the country. Here are some of the ways he has expanded the presidential prerogative to wage war:DRONESA key part of the Bush administration’s “war on terror” involved using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with Hellfire missiles to quietly kill suspected enemies without formally going to war with the country they inhabited. Obama inherited that ability and greatly expanded its use during his first term. When it appeared that Obama might not win re-election in 2012, the White House scrambled to lay out rules governing the use of drones for targeted killings abroad, the New York Times reported. Administration officials feared Obama’s possible Republican successor might use the sweeping authority to kill suspected terrorists based on classified determinations by the president about who is a legitimate target. That effort lost some of its urgency when Obama was re-elected, but the White House did eventually finalize its classified guidance on the use of lethal drone strikes in May 2013. The administration released a redacted version of the guidance earlier this year, after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. The rules require only “near certainty” that a terrorist target is present at the site of the strike, that the target can’t be captured by other means and that innocents won’t be injured or killed. “Near certainty” is, of course, entirely subjective ― and without meaningful congressional or judicial oversight of the process, it’s up to the executive branch to make that decision behind closed doors.The Obama administration hoped that the 2013 guidance would set a standard going forward, but because it is policy not law, Trump is not obligated to adhere to it. And even if Trump opted to follow the guidance, it is worded vaguely enough that it wouldn’t in any practical way be able to restrain his ability to kill suspected terrorists abroad. Furthermore, the Obama administration has indicated that it is not planning to narrow the rules around targeted killings before leaving office, the Guardian reported Tuesday.That guidance “is riddled with ambiguities and loopholes,” said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, who wrote a book on the Obama administration’s legal justification for the targeted killing program. “Trump is inheriting sweeping power to use lethal force against people he perceives to be threats to the U.S.”Obama also set a low standard for disclosing information about civilians killed in U.S. airstrikes. His administration declined to publicly release the number of innocents killed by strikes in countries where the U.S. is not officially at war until July 2016. The White House says that between 64 and 116 civilians have been killed since 2009, in airstrikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a London-based nonprofit news organization that closely monitors U.S. airstrikes, says the number of civilian casualties in those countries is most likely somewhere in the range of 380 to 801, based on reports from journalists and NGO investigators, as well as leaked government documents and court papers. Some of the blame falls to Congress and the courts, says Jaffer, for failing to exercise meaningful oversight on the drone program. “It’s not the executive branch’s job to police itself,” he said. OUTDATED WAR AUTHORIZATIONObama has overseen bombings in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Iraq and Syria. In each country, the administration relied, in part, on legislation Congress passed in 2001 to authorize the use of force against those who plotted the Sept. 11 attacks. The wording of that authorization was vague ― it didn’t limit the war to a specific country or timeframe ― and the Obama administration’s lawyers have presented a complicated legal justification to defend its ongoing use in countries that Congress never even considered in 2001. That means a future president could continue to rely on the 15-year-old law to wage new wars in additional countries without asking Congress for approval. There is near unanimous agreement that the 2001 AUMF is outdated.

Lawmakers briefly debated a new war authorization, but they were divided on how restrictive or expansive the new law should be, and ultimately dropped the issue. There wasn’t much pressure on lawmakers to take a politically risky vote, since the Obama administration had signaled it would fight ISIS with or without Congressional action. “With regard to using military force abroad, Obama has been more unilateralist than Bush,” said Matthew Waxman, a former Bush administration official.Congress, of course, bears much of the blame ― but regardless of who is at fault, the over-reliance on the 2001 AUMF sets a precedent for the Trump administration to make decisions about where and when to go to war with little input from lawmakers. TORTUREObama signed an executive order outlawing torture immediately after entering the White House, and then worked with Congress to pass anti-torture legislation. But the president also said he wanted to “look forward as opposed to looking backwards,” and none of the Bush-era officials who were responsible for the torture program were punished.

CIA detainees were beaten, anally raped, waterboarded, threatened with a power drill, deprived of sleep and confined in coffin-sized boxes. In one case, an interrogator threatened to sexually assault a detainee’s mother. The ACLU pushed the Obama administration to open a criminal investigation into the CIA program, based on the Senate committee’s findings, but the administration ignored the request. A year later, Trump began making promises on the campaign trail to bring back waterboarding “and a hell of a lot worse.”“Torture works,” he said at a campaign rally in February. Some are skeptical that any president could compel subordinates to reinstate tactics like waterboarding, “The military and intelligence agencies will resist it,” Waxman said. “I’d expect any administration lawyers to be very cautious about future criminal liability for reinstating it.” At the same time, Shamsi said, if there had been accountability for Bush-era use of torture, it would be far less likely that a presidential candidate would promise to bring it back.If Trump does try to reinstate torture, he’ll likely face hefty opposition from inside government and from civil liberties watchdogs.“The fact remains, that torture has always been unlawful and it is still unlawful,” Shamsi said. “No amount of attempted legal shenanigans will change that.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582e2ba81a00002500cc8877.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― President Barack Obama entered office in 2009 with the promise of reining in his predecessor’s freewheeling use of military force abroad. But rather than rolling back the authorities former President George W. Bush exercised, Obama has expanded some of his most controversial national security programs ― such as the drone program and conducting warfare without specific congressional authorization.While there were cases where Obama reversed Bush-era policies, critics say he often did so with minimal transparency and accountability. Obama has set a precedent for the next commander-in-chief to claim even greater unilateral authority on the use of force. In two months, he will hand off an empowered executive branch to Donald Trump, a man he has described as lacking the temperament, experience and values to lead the country. Here are some of the ways he has expanded the presidential prerogative to wage war:DRONESA key part of the Bush administration’s “war on terror” involved using unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with Hellfire missiles to quietly kill suspected enemies without formally going to war with the country they inhabited. Obama inherited that ability and greatly expanded its use during his first term. When it appeared that Obama might not win re-election in 2012, the White House scrambled to lay out rules governing the use of drones for targeted killings abroad, the New York Times reported. Administration officials feared Obama’s possible Republican successor might use the sweeping authority to kill suspected terrorists based on classified determinations by the president about who is a legitimate target. That effort lost some of its urgency when Obama was re-elected, but the White House did eventually finalize its classified guidance on the use of lethal drone strikes in May 2013. The administration released a redacted version of the guidance earlier this year, after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. The rules require only “near certainty” that a terrorist target is present at the site of the strike, that the target can’t be captured by other means and that innocents won’t be injured or killed. “Near certainty” is, of course, entirely subjective ― and without meaningful congressional or judicial oversight of the process, it’s up to the executive branch to make that decision behind closed doors.The Obama administration hoped that the 2013 guidance would set a standard going forward, but because it is policy not law, Trump is not obligated to adhere to it. And even if Trump opted to follow the guidance, it is worded vaguely enough that it wouldn’t in any practical way be able to restrain his ability to kill suspected terrorists abroad. Furthermore, the Obama administration has indicated that it is not planning to narrow the rules around targeted killings before leaving office, the Guardian reported Tuesday.That guidance “is riddled with ambiguities and loopholes,” said Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, who wrote a book on the Obama administration’s legal justification for the targeted killing program. “Trump is inheriting sweeping power to use lethal force against people he perceives to be threats to the U.S.”Obama also set a low standard for disclosing information about civilians killed in U.S. airstrikes. His administration declined to publicly release the number of innocents killed by strikes in countries where the U.S. is not officially at war until July 2016. The White House says that between 64 and 116 civilians have been killed since 2009, in airstrikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a London-based nonprofit news organization that closely monitors U.S. airstrikes, says the number of civilian casualties in those countries is most likely somewhere in the range of 380 to 801, based on reports from journalists and NGO investigators, as well as leaked government documents and court papers. Some of the blame falls to Congress and the courts, says Jaffer, for failing to exercise meaningful oversight on the drone program. “It’s not the executive branch’s job to police itself,” he said. OUTDATED WAR AUTHORIZATIONObama has overseen bombings in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Iraq and Syria. In each country, the administration relied, in part, on legislation Congress passed in 2001 to authorize the use of force against those who plotted the Sept. 11 attacks. The wording of that authorization was vague ― it didn’t limit the war to a specific country or timeframe ― and the Obama administration’s lawyers have presented a complicated legal justification to defend its ongoing use in countries that Congress never even considered in 2001. That means a future president could continue to rely on the 15-year-old law to wage new wars in additional countries without asking Congress for approval. There is near unanimous agreement that the 2001 AUMF is outdated. It’s a “stretch” to use it as legal justification to fight the current war against the so-called Islamic State, multiple national security law experts say. “The ways it was invoked have been stretched to a breaking point,” said Hina Shamsi, head of the ACLU’s national security project.Obama asked Congress to pass a new AUMF in 2015, one tailored to the war against ISIS ― after he had already started bombing the group in Iraq and Syria.

Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, was a fierce critic of Trump during the campaign, going so far as to call him a “phony” who is “playing the American people for suckers.” Romney refused to campaign with him, and did not appear at the party convention in Cleveland.The two men couldn’t have more different temperaments. The former Massachusetts governor is mild-mannered and methodical. Trump is bombastic and unpredictable. After a tape emerged of Trump bragging about sexual assault, Romney sharply denounced him for “vile degradations” that “demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.”Romney and Trump also have pretty irreconcilable views on Russia. Romney called the country America’s “number one geopolitical foe” in 2012 ― a statement that earned him mockery from Democrats at the time. Trump, meanwhile, has heaped praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has advocated for closer relations with Russia, particularly in the campaign to destroy the self-described Islamic State. And he has even questioned U.S. commitment to the NATO alliance ― sparking panic in neighboring Baltic states.Trump’s approach to Russia has raised alarm in Washington. Speaking in Berlin on Thursday, Obama urged his successor to stand up to Russia if it deviates from U.S. “values and international norms.” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, also warned about the prospect of another “reset” with Russia on Wednesday.Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who is reportedly being considered for attorney general, appeared to confirm Trump’s meeting with Romney.“I think it’s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Romney. There are a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with,” Sessions told reporters at Trump Tower. A handful of other names are also reportedly in the mix to take the reins at Foggy Bottom. The list includes: South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), and former CIA Director David Petraeus.This story has been updated with comment from Jeff Sessions."

Judith Vonberg reports on Refugees at Home, a volunteer initiative connecting Britons offering spare rooms with asylum seekers desperately in need of a bed.LONDON – The Zig Zag cafe is nestled between an art shop and a beauty salon on the main street in Epsom, an affluent market town 30 minutes by train from central London. This small and unassuming cafe has become a social hub for the local community of hosts and their refugee or asylum-seeking guests.As the hosts and guests arrive, Mike, who runs the cafe, starts pushing tables together and pulling up extra chairs. He’s well used to the routine. Each newcomer is treated to a beaming smile and a warm “hello.” Some guests stay just for a coffee; others linger over one of Mike’s famous falafel pancakes.Mike is Syrian. He arrived several years ago on a work visa, but recently left his job to open the Zig Zag cafe. It was perfect timing. Nina and Timothy, a local retired couple whose children had recently left home, had decided to offer their spare rooms to asylum seekers. No organization existed to help them so they started one and called it Refugees at Home. While showing one of their early guests – Ahmad, a reserved and hesitant young Syrian man – around Epsom, Nina, who had heard about the new cafe, decided they should take a look.“Mike was so welcoming,” Nina said, “and the atmosphere was just lovely.” Ahmad began to relax, too, and, having insisted he was only staying with Nina and Timothy for a couple of nights, went on to live with them for four months. “I had no idea that anybody cared,” he told her. The cafe quickly became the project’s social hub in Epsom.Since February, over 200 refugees and asylum seekers have been hosted by the project, which recruits hosts locally and across the country and matches them with newcomers in desperate need of a bed. The aim is to get them back on their feet. The organization runs on zero budget and relies entirely on volunteers. Legal support is offered pro bono by London law firm Travers Smith.Some of the guests are referred by charities such as the Refugee Council and the British Red Cross, while others refer themselves. The majority are destitute and have fallen through the cracks in the asylum system. Once asylum seekers are given leave to remain in the U.K., they have just 28 days to find somewhere to live before they are evicted from their accommodation. Many wait far longer than that just to receive their National Insurance (social security) number – without which getting a house, job or bank account is impossible – and find themselves homeless when that four weeks is up.Niloofar, an exuberant and headstrong 23-year-old woman from Iran, was given leave to remain in the U.K. on September 21. As of October 27, she was still waiting for her National Insurance card. She arrived in the U.K. earlier this year with her mother, Soraya, and younger brother, Isaac, after a grueling journey that ended with 15 hours spent in the back of a refrigerated supermarket lorry.After claiming asylum, Niloofar was sent to Newcastle upon Tyne, 560 kilometers (350 miles) away from her mother and brother. Knowing no one, destitute and with no means of getting an apartment or a job, Niloofar, who dreams of becoming a dentist, returned to London and is now living with Nina. “Refugees at Home has been my only positive experience in this country,” she said.David (name changed), a broad-shouldered and soft-spoken man from Syria, also spoke of the kindness of his British hosts. A child refugee from the war in Kuwait in the 1990s, he was forced to flee his new homeland in 2011. “I’ve been through this multiple times,” he said, exhaustion evident in his voice. “It’s hard to start from scratch. There’s all the bombing and shelling and death, then you have to leave your home and be somewhere you have nobody.”“They give you so much more than a house,” he said of his hosts. Twice, war destroyed any chance David had for a family life. “Refugees at Home has given me the ultimate family experience,” he said.The hosts were equally enthusiastic about the experience. “I wouldn’t be able to function without this now,” said Constance, a lively mother of two who has hosted 14 refugees. “Having guests is the normal, human thing to do. It’s not natural to isolate ourselves. And we learn so much from each other.”Despite the positives, Nina and Constance share a deep frustration that the project is needed at all. If the asylum system worked properly, they argued, they wouldn’t have to step in. But it is cheering to discover that so many ordinary people are willing to help, Nina told me. “If 200 child refugees were to arrive,” she said, “we could find hosts for them this week – no, today.”“A little sweet treat on the house,” said Mike, setting down a plate of pancakes drizzled with cinnamon and chocolate. It’s easy to see why the hosts and guests love to come to Zig Zag – and it’s not just the culinary temptations. Mike treats his customers with the same warmth and respect as Nina and Constance show their guests.“When we host, we undo a little of the harm that’s been done to these people,” said Constance.

That has to reflect in not only what he says but how he fills out his administration.”“My hope is that’s something he’s thinking about,” the president added, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel standing by his side. “Because not only is the president of the United States somebody the entire country looks to for direction, but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways.”The president-elect is in the process of selecting his Cabinet, as well as deciding who will fill thousands of lower-level executive positions and take the reins of government once Obama steps down in January. He has been slow to hit the ground running, however, with reports of disarray and lack of communication between Trump’s team and administration officials. Trump’s staffing decisions have also come under intense scrutiny. Scores of congressional Democrats have called on Trump to part ways with Steve Bannon, the newly named White House chief strategist. Bannon is the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a website that traffics in white nationalist sentiment, and hundreds of people in cities across the country have taken to the streets to demonstrate against him.Trump complained on Twitter last week about “unfair” demonstrators, calling them “professional protesters” who were “incited by the media.” He seemed to walk back the statement a day later, tweeting, “Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!”During his press conference on Thursday, Obama elaborated about the responsibilities of the presidency, further urging his successor to take the job seriously in order to help unify the country.“If you’re not serious about the job, you probably won’t be there very long,” the president said. “He will see fairly quickly, the demands and responsibilities of a U.S. president are not ones that you can treat casually. That in a big, complex, diverse country, the only way you can be successful is by listening, reaching out and working with a wide variety of people.”"

Failure to do so “puts American prosperity at risk,” Nike, eBay, The North Face and hundreds of other U.S. companies wrote in an open letter Wednesday addressed to Trump, President Barack Obama, members of Congress and global leaders.“We, the undersigned members in the business and investor community of the United States, re-affirm our deep commitment to addressing climate change through the implementation of the historic Paris Climate Agreement,” the companies wrote. “We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy. Cost-effective and innovative solutions can help us achieve these objectives.”In addition to pledging to do their part to help prevent global temperatures from increasing 2 degrees Celsius ― the “magic number” scientists say the world must stay below to prevent the very worst effects of climate change ― the companies said they will continue to support world leaders as they work to tackle the global crisis.Trump, who prides himself on his business savvy, has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax” and promised to pull the U.S. out of the Paris deal. He has also said he would cut all federal spending on the issue, increase America’s production of coal, oil and natural gas, and do away with Obama administration regulations aimed at cutting emissions.Following through on those promises would certainly satisfy the oil and gas industry’s wish list. However, he could very well stir a hornet’s nest within remaining business sectors.IKEA, Starbucks Coffee, Gap Inc., General Mills, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hilton, Kellogg Co., L’Oreal, Levi Strauss & Co., Virgin and Patagonia were also among the more than 300 companies to sign the letter, which was announced at United Nations climate talks in Morocco. Matt Patsky, CEO of Boston-based Trillium Asset Management, said in a statement that the “enormous momentum” to address climate change cannot be reversed or ignored by Trump. “That train has left the station, and to stand in its way is folly,” he said. “Nevertheless, we know that now is the time to remind the incoming administration that virtually every company in the Fortune 500 and over $100 trillion in investor assets has acknowledged the reality of climate change and the need to address it head on.”“The Paris agreement was a vital step forward, but its power is in our collective action,” Lara Birkes, chief sustainability officer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise added. “Business and government leaders must urgently work together to drive a thriving, low-carbon economy.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this post said Trillium Asset Management is based in California.

Halperin and Heilemann, who joined in May 2014 and served as co-managing editors of Bloomberg Politics, will continue to host the show daily until Dec. 2. Bloomberg will produce four hourlong specials previewing Trump’s presidency and then cover the event on Jan. 20. The two journalists will cease day-to-day roles with the company, but according to the memo are in discussions to “play a role at Bloomberg as contributors and columnists.”The hiring of Halperin and Heilemann, for reportedly $1 million apiece, caused tensions inside the company as some Washington staffers felt marginalized with the shift of political coverage to New York. There’s been speculation inside the company, even fueled by CEO Mike Bloomberg himself, that the pair would depart after the election. Many expect Halperin and Heilemann ― authors of 2008 and 2012 election tell-alls Game Change and Double Down ― to write another book on the 2016 election, but they have not yet announced any plans to do so. In the memo, Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait and Bloomberg Media CEO Justin Smith praised Bloomberg Politics as “one of our most successful consumer media franchises, providing a constant stream of original and influential web, TV, and digital video content.”“Bloomberg Politics has put Bloomberg at the heart of this historic presidential campaign,” they wrote. “That has required extraordinary effort, energy, and creativity by all of you.”Halperin and Heilemann raised Bloomberg’s profile during the 2016 election, and the former, especially, suggested early on that Trump had a path to victory. But the pair also drew criticism for interviews that were especially soft on the Republican candidate-turned-president-elect. In August 2015, Bloomberg published a chummy video of Halperin’s helicopter trip with the candidate ― “Mark Halperin Rides in Style With ‘The Donald’” ― and the pair jumped on a zamboni with Trump a few months later as part of another light interview. As the election neared, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank singled out Halperin’s praise of Trump’s “tactical genius” and defense of some of his outrageous remarks as “particularly soulless.”But despite criticism, Halperin and Heilemann proved successful in expanding their reach throughout the election. MSNBC rebroadcast their 5 p.m. Bloomberg TV show at 6 p.m. and their 2016-themed weekly documentary, “The Circus,” aired on Showtime. Halperin and Heilemann remain commentators at NBC and MSNBC, though the cable channel has not yet announced what will replace “With All Due Respect” at 6 p.m.In February, Bloomberg will launch a new TV show “focused on global politics and the impact of the new administration’s policies on business and finance worldwide, drawing on our unique international journalistic resources,” according to the memo.The Halperin and Heilemann news follows Bloomberg announce earlier Thursday that Washington bureau chief Megan Murphy would become editor of Bloomberg Businessweek as the magazine relaunches next year to increasingly focus on business and finance.

OneWest failed to locate bank branches in minority neighborhoods, loaned money to “very few or no” people of color, and did a better job maintaining and marketing foreclosed homes in mostly white neighborhoods, according to a complaint filed by two housing advocacy groups Wednesday with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The discrimination, called “redlining,” keeps communities of color in poverty by making it harder to buy homes. It was banned in 1968 under the Fair Housing Act. The complaint was filed against CIT Group, the commercial lending giant that owns OneWest. Mnuchin, who led the investor group that bought OneWest in 2009 and served as its chairman, joined the board of CIT after the acquisition was completed in August 2015.“Our analysis of OneWest suggests the bank has no significant branch presence in communities of color,” Kevin Stein, deputy director of California Reinvestment Coalition, one of the two nonprofits that filed the complaint, said in a statement. “[N]ot surprisingly, its home loans to borrowers and communities of color are low in absolute terms, low compared to its peer banks, and low when compared to what one would expect, given the size of the Asian American, African American, and Latino populations in California.”Dune Capital, the hedge fund where Mnuchin works, did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.“CIT is committed to fair-lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve,” a spokesman for CIT said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post on Thursday evening. In the Los Angeles area in which OneWest operates, black borrowers last year received just 1.7 percent of its mortgages ― 2.1 percentage points below the industry average. Asian Americans made up 8.4 percent of the bank’s borrowers ― 3 percentage points below the industry average. Latinos comprised an additional 8.4 percent of borrowers ― 14 percentage points below the industry average. Meanwhile, the bank awarded 82.4 percent of its loans to white people ― 14.6 percentage points above the industry average.One-hundred percent of foreclosed homes ― also known as real estate-owned properties ― in neighborhoods of color had five or more maintenance or marketing failures, including trash strewn in the front yard, overgrown grass and shrubbery, and boarded up or broken doors and windows. By contrast, 33.3 percent of foreclosed properties in white neighborhoods sustained the same blight. The complaints cast an ugly light over the man Trump officials have floated as the leading candidate to lead the Department of Treasury. Mnuchin led the group of investors that bought OneWest, then called IndyMac Bank, from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2009 after the company had collapsed under the weight of bad home loans it made during the housing bubble. As part of the deal, the FDIC agreed to take the hit for the vast majority of loan losses, an arrangement the agency made with buyers of other banks after the crash. OneWest then went to work foreclosing on homeowners, using the fraudulent, corner-cutting technique known as robosigning. In the years that followed, it paid billions of dollars in profits to its investors.The investor group included private equity financial institutions specialist J.C. Flowers; hedge fund billionaire John Paulson, who later became famous for his massive bet against the U.S. housing market; and progressive philanthropist George Soros.OneWest was not the only bank to make bad loans during the housing bubble and push people out of their homes once things soured. However, in an industry we now know was filled with fraud, “OneWest stood out,” wrote David Dayen, the author of a book on the foreclosure crisis published this year. “It routinely jumped to foreclosure rather than pursue options to keep borrowers in their homes; used fabricated and ‘robo-signed’ documents to secure the evictions; and had a particular talent for dispossessing the homes of senior citizens and people of color.” “During Mnuchin’s tenure, OneWest foreclosed on tens of thousands of families, with California’s communities of color shouldering a disproportionate share,” Stein told Dayen at the time.  If you don’t already know how this story ends, you can probably guess: Mnuchin orchestrated a deal to merge OneWest with CIT for $3.4 billion in 2015, more than doubling his group’s initial $1.6 billion investment.In August, Trump made his long-awaited pitch to black voters, insisting Democrats had abandoned them. During his campaign, he dismissed accusations of racism, glossing over a 1973 discrimination lawsuit accusing his real estate company of refusing to rent homes to black people in New York. He initially avoided denouncing former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who enthusiastically endorsed his presidency.“You’re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed,” Trump said in his appeal, citing a number three times higher than the real rate because it counts students as unemployed. (The same stat for white youth clocks in at 49 percent.) “What the hell do you have to lose?”Median black wealth was cut in half by the foreclosure crisis and Great Recession. The real question may be who gains, and by how much, when communities of color lose.This article has been updated to incude a statement from CIT and the names of additional investors led by Mnuchin in the OneWest deal."

Popovich said that he had hoped Trump would come out with a message to try and assuage the fears of the minority groups he pointed to as the sources of America’s problems during his election campaign. Trump has done little to nothing in that regard, however, as Popovich noted. “It’s still a disorienting situation, when you thought you lived in a certain kind of country with certain values that were held in esteem and find out those values aren’t very important to half the country,” Popovich said.

A Donald Trump defeat seemed inevitable, and a scroll through your news feed confirmed this. The disruption was seismic. And the aftershocks and fallout are just taking shape. But for now, on Facebook, there’s no going back. “Reading news about Trump or seeing a photo of him shaking hands with Obama. What is a bigger kick in the face that that?” said former Facebook employee Antonio García Martinez, who’s written a book about the company called Chaos Monkey. “People on Facebook live through stories that confirm their beliefs.”News stories these days do everything but that. “My sister started gloating [about Trump’s win] and tagged my mother and me and it turned into a shitfest,” said Violet Skinner, a disaster recovery consultant in West Palm Beach, Florida. Skinner, didn’t support either of the main candidates for president, but said she was still surprised Trump won. The 33-year-old unfriended her sister. Checking Facebook just isn’t the same any more. Since the Nov. 8 election, many people have changed the way they interact with Facebook, according to interviews with a dozen or so active users who opposed Trump.Some said they disconnected from friends and family, deleted the app from their phones or drastically scaled back use. Others have come out of the political closet, posting aggressively about their views and engaging with those who don’t agree with them. Many are using it to organize anti-Trump meetups, marches and other kinds of activism. “I thought about quitting Facebook,” said Christina Carrell, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mother from Medford, New Jersey. Instead, Carrell, who was an intern for Obama campaign in 2008 but sat out the next two elections, worked with her friend Holly Kline of Marlton, New Jersey, to start a local chapter of Pantsuit Nation, the pro-Clinton Facebook group that sprung up during the end of Clinton’s candidacy.This week, Carrell met up in person with the women from her chapter at a local restaurant.“We spent two hours talking and chatting, almost like a bereavement group,” Carrell said. An older woman in the group had only just joined Facebook days before, Carrell added. “She created a Facebook account this past week so she could get involved after the election.” The group’s next goal is to organize busses for an upcoming march on Washington, D.C., after the inauguration.Facebook is under fire this month for possibly influencing the outcome of the election by allowing fake news to go viral on the site. These users are mad about that, but they’re angry for other key reasons, too.Some say they feel betrayed by the social network. They used it for news, but were fed a story about the election that turned out to be flat-out wrong.Facebook’s algorithm is geared to give you the kinds of stories you want to see. And people want to see stories that confirm their world view. The company’s own research demonstrates this, noted Zeynep Tufekci, one of the leading researchers looking at the social network’s real-world effects, in The New York Times this week.This reporter apparently has many Facebook friends who voted for Trump, but hardly saw their status updates.“I used to use it as a news feed but now I feel cheated, it didn’t actually give me news, it gave me content it thought I wanted to see,” said Refinery29 journalist Liat Kornowski, a former HuffPost editor well-schooled in social networks. Kornowski said she’s unfollowed many of her friends and, for news, she’s now looking at the Times app and Apple News. “I never thought Facebook was unbiased or anything but did not realize how bad it was.” Other Facebook friends have gravitated to Instagram and bathed in the soothing visual photos of puppies and other waffle brunches. Several Facebook users said they would stop using the site altogether ― some of them messaged me their intentions on Facebook’s Messenger service.It’s unclear how long any of this lasts. If soon enough, activist inclinations fade and the desire to argue with your conservative high-school friends burns out.  The site at this point is how 44 percent of Americans get their news, according to Pew. But we’re not going to Facebook for news, really. It’s just there.More importantly, Facebook is where friends and family hang out. And the company, recognizing this earlier in the year, rejiggered its algorithm to allow users to see more news from loved ones, like pics of your sister’s baby or photos from the Guatemalan vacation your former colleague is taking, instead of stories that news outlets post. In the end, it will be hard for most users to stay away. They’ll miss birth announcements and relationship status updates. The thing is, we like staring at our phones, joking around with friends, reading anecdotes about how your friend can’t ever drop off his kid to school on time and feeling smug because you can. People will go back to their little bubbles, eventually. And probably that means Facebook. Snapchat, and a million other social networks, are ready to pounce if not.This story has been updated to note that Carrell co-founded her local Pantsuit Nation chapter."
50,POLITICS,Democrats Seek To Protect Dreamers From Deportation Under Donald Trump,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-donald-trump-daca-deportation_us_582c7deae4b0aa8910bded6d,They want Obama to pardon undocumented youth to whom he previously granted reprieve.,2016-11-17,Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) called for the president to pardon undocumented immigrants to allow them to stay in the country. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582e01e61a00002500cc87ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Democrats are pressuring President Barack Obama to do whatever he can before leaving office to protect the more than 740,000 undocumented young people to whom he granted temporary work permits from the threat of deportation under the new administration.On Thursday, Reps. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) and Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) asked Obama to issue pardons to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, many of whom fear they could soon be under threat of deportation from President-elect Donald Trump.The request is a long shot. Obama created the program for so-called Dreamers using executive authority, and there’s nothing to stop Trump from taking it away using the same powers. DACA recipients who obtained a work permit under the program fear they would be under increased threat from the incoming administration, especially since it would have access to their personal information ― though Trump has said he would focus on deporting convicted criminals.There’s also debate over whether further action would be a good idea or even legally possible ― or if Dreamers and their supporters would be better served by putting pressure on the incoming president rather than one whose days in power are ending.But Democrats feel a responsibility to explore any options available ― after all, they, along with Obama, were the ones who urged the creation of DACA in the first place and told young undocumented immigrants it would be safe to sign up. “Dreamers face uncertainty, fear and stress, leading to psychological issues including depression, anxiety and an increased risk of suicide,” Lofgren, Roybal-Allard and Gutiérrez wrote in a letter to the president arguing pardons would be possible.“Indeed, we have received reports of Dreamers who have taken their own lives as they are now facing the threat posed by the incoming president,” the letter continues. “Using your pardon authority, which is not subject to reversal, to protect these young people who relied on the program you implemented is quite literally a matter of life and death.”There is precedent for using pardons for non-criminal offenses, Lofgren said at a press conference Thursday, and added that it would be possible to do on a large scale. The pardon would not prevent Trump from stripping DACA recipients of their work authorization or function as a green card, but it would protect them from the risk of deportation, she said. “If he’s got a better idea, he can come back to us,” Lofgren said.Gutiérrez noted at the same press conference that Obama once claimed DACA was outside his authority, and then found a way to do it. Lofgren, Roybal-Allard and Gutiérrez asked Obama to act soon, in the “Thanksgiving season,” so DACA recipients can relax like other Americans do. And the timing of their request coincides with an upcoming presidential tradition, Lofgren noted after the press conference.“He’s going to pardon a turkey,” she said. “Why don’t we throw in 750,000 well-meaning kids rather than that kind of foolishness?”Trump has promised to focus deportations on criminals, which would imply that DACA recipients would not be a target. But he also promised to deport 2 to 3 million criminals ― a number that’s far above reputable estimates of the number of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes. Even if Trump’s administration didn’t prioritize Dreamers, plans to strip them of protections and create a larger deportation dragnet could put them at a very real risk.The president thus far has opted to urge Trump not to deport Dreamers instead of taking further steps of his own. A White House official said Thursday that Obama “takes the executive clemency power seriously” and does not generally “comment on the likelihood of whether a specific pardon may be granted, should one be requested.”“We note that the clemency power could not give legal status to any undocumented individual,” the official said. “As we have repeatedly said for years, only Congress can create legal status for undocumented individuals.”Legal experts say there may well be nothing Obama can do to extend protections for Dreamers past his presidency.There are legal questions over whether pardons could be used for being in the country unlawfully, which is a civil offense, said Marshall Fitz, the managing director for immigration at the Emerson Collective and a longtime advocate for protections for undocumented immigrants. He said he and other advocates will continue to look for any options possible to give relief for the undocumented, but that public pressure may be the best option.“We’re in a bind, and I think that people are starting to focus on the fact that this is going to be a campaign that’s waged in front of the cameras and the American public and we’re not going to let these 750,000 Dreamers be taken from us,” Fitz said.Another legal expert agreed.“Unfortunately, it’s really hard to think of ways that are going to provide protection for people other than doing the work of trying to convince enough people that if you’re really focused on going after criminals, these people aren’t criminals, so why don’t you leave them alone,” said the lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss his thinking.In terms of public pressure, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) suggested Obama issue an executive order that forbids future presidents from using information collected for DACA to carry out deportations.It wouldn’t stop Trump from doing so if he wished, but he might face more political pressure if he had to be more transparent about plans to deport Dreamers, she argued.“I still believe that an executive order preventing the use of these names in any deportation process would be an important step in that it would require Trump to announce his intentions to use these names,” Chu said in a statement. “It’s an affirmative step on his part that would at least put him on record.”Dreamers also could be protected by their years spent shaping their collective image into a sympathetic one. Even Republicans who decry DACA, or any legal status for undocumented immigrants, seldom call for young people who came to the U.S. as children to be deported.As of the end of June, about 742,000 Dreamers received DACA status out of about 845,000 who applied, according to the most recent figures released by the government. (Experts attribute the relatively low denial numbers to the fact that lawyers and advocates discouraged people who were likely ineligible from applying in the first place.) Obama said on Monday that he would “urge the president-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering that status of what, for all practical purposes, are American kids.”“By definition, if they’re part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character,” he said at a press conference. “And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again.”This article has been updated to include comment from the White House and additional comment from Reps. Lofgren and Gutiérrez."

One day after LeBron James criticized Knicks President Phil Jackson for using the term “posse” in an interview to describe James’ black friends and business associates, the Detroit Pistons head coach told reporters that there was a time when he also used the word.“Have I ever used that word before with a white player?” Van Gundy asked himself on Wednesday before the Pistons took on the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.“The answer is no,” Van Gundy said. “I think, look, you have to be aware of the language and you have to be aware a little bit of your own biases if you’re going to overcome them. I took that seriously.”Van Gundy added that he understands “why it’s offensive” and stressed the importance of self-reflection.“I’ve never used that word publicly with anybody but I have used it in just talking to people I know and things like that,” he said. “It has never been in conjunction with a white player. So I think at a time where you’re going to call out other people on attitudes you need to be willing to look in the mirror and call yourself out.”Van Gundy also made headlines last week when he expressed his disgust with the election of Donald Trump, telling the Detroit Free Press that “I don’t think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynist.”New York Times contributor Mike Vorkunov shared a transcript of Van Gundy’s most recent statement."

Trump. You lost,” he tells the unidentified employee before asking for his money back. “You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”Starbucks customer Jorge de Cárdenas, who caught the explosive scene on his cell phone, told The Huffington Post that Sanguesa claimed “white discrimination” shortly before he started filming.Sanguesa didn’t deny that claim in an interview with the Miami Herald.“I was racially discriminated against,” he insisted, vowing to sue the coffee company.Sanguesa, speaking to HuffPost, apologized for his actions but accused the barista of holding a grudge against him after he began holding Trump campaign meets at the Coral Gables location that he’s visited for 12 years.“Her face was the face of death yesterday. It was evil,” he said of the barista’s supposed attitude toward him.Asked whether she had said anything that would support his beliefs that she’s anti-Trump, he said: “It’s just from personal experience.

A spokesman for the company said they are working to understand what transpired. “Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.”According to the Miami Herald’s report, Sanguesa is a frequent writer to the paper, and over the years has voiced anger against President Barack Obama, women and Cuban-Americans.“I hate Cubans ... all pieces of s*** ... including Jose Fernandez,” he reportedly said in one email to the paper, responding to a story on the death of the Cuban-born Miami Marlins pitcher.Sanguesa reportedly has also had run-ins with South Miami police, and in 2014 was arrested for a domestic dispute. The case was later dropped, the Herald reported.Though Sanguesa’s opinions appear clear, whether he received his coffee at an unusually slow pace is not.

And many Washington residents ― 94 percent of whom voted for the Democratic nominee ― were ready to open their homes to fellow Clinton supporters. But those plans were among the many things upended on Nov. 8 with Donald Trump’s surprise win.A slew of Democrats have canceled their early reservations, despite stiff cancellation fees. A few Airbnb hosts are even reconsidering their hospitality ― although the lure of inauguration week profit still seems stronger.Karl Scarlett, owner of Great Dwellings, which manages Airbnb rentals for homeowners, said he had 90 cancellations for the roughly 100 properties he manages in D.C. in the 48 hours after the election.A number of the cancellation emails came with explanations, Scarlett said. “Every single one of them had expected a different outcome.”A rental customer told Guesty that the 50 percent cancellation fee was the least of her worries now that Trump will be president, according to Nathan Tobin, director of sales at the company. Guesty provides services to property managers with Airbnb rentals.“It shows how strongly the guest felt about not wanting to attend the inauguration and the price she was willing to bear to do so,” Tobin said. Cancellation fees are often based on the rental rate. And Ian McHenry, CEO of Beyond Pricing, which helps rental owners set prices, said that Airbnb rental rates for Washington have been up to three times the norm for a typical week in January.Airbnb spokesperson Crystal Davis said rates in the greater D.C. metropolitan area are averaging $125 per night for inauguration week. But some of the Airbnb rental management companies in D.C. said they’re seeing rates in the $600 to $800 range.Lara Hawketts, owner of Home Sweet City, said seven of its 50 properties were booked prior to Election Day, and all of those arrangements were canceled after Trump won. The company sets a 50 percent cancellation fee (unless the renters reschedule their stay). Given how high the nightly rates are for that week, Hawketts said the fees have totaled as much as $2,000.Based on her correspondence with them, Hawketts thought many of the cancellations came from Clinton supporters. “Those people were willing to book and put down thousands of dollars and risk 50 percent of that because they were so sure she was going to win,” the business owner said.Home Sweet City has since been booking new reservations, mostly from Trump supporters, Hawketts said. They’ve also had an increasing number of inquiries and reservations from those planning to come to town for the Women’s March on Washington, a protest against Trump’s inauguration.Scarlett of Great Dwellings said they, too, have booked a number of new reservations since Election Day among Trump supporters and Women’s March on Washington participants. He suggested the added demand for housing from protesters is driving up prices.The management firms HuffPost spoke to indicated that most of their property owners don’t seem to be letting politics get in the way of business. Hawketts said only one property owner had expressed some initial unease about renting to Trump supporters.  But some individuals who had planned to post their D.C. area homes on Airbnb said they are feeling conflicted about renting to or sharing their place with people who voted for Trump.“I have a visceral reaction to the thought of having a Trump supporter in my house,” said Lobna, who had planned to rent out a room in the apartment she shares with two roommates. All three of them are Clinton supporters.“No amount of money could make me change my mind,” she said. “It’s about moral principles.”The Airbnb posters whom HuffPost contacted, all of them in their 20s and early 30s, were given the option to use first names only in order to speak freely.Meredith, said she and her roommate had hoped to make some extra money renting out their two-bedroom apartment for inauguration week, while they left town. Trump’s win has given them pause.“We don’t trust Trump supporters to stay in our place,” Meredith said. She’s concerned that the contents of her apartment ― such as the artwork from travel abroad ― will play into the perception that she and her roommate are those “liberal elites” whom Trump has railed against and might encourage unsympathetic renters to damage the place.Meredith said she might reconsider if demand pushes the average rates even higher, because she doesn’t mind “gouging” Trump supporters.One Airbnb user said the election outcome hasn’t changed his plans at all. “I just want to get a good rate for those nights,” said Sean.He has listed a room for almost $800 a night. While Sean considers himself a liberal, he said he is from southern Indiana and is used to interacting with people who don’t agree with him.Ellie said she had planned to rent out her spare room for the week. Now the prospect of housing Trump supporters is making her a little nervous. She said she is “feeling afraid of some of them,” particularly the white men. Ellie is also white.“I remind myself that these people closely resemble the community that I grew up with, and that they are largely good and kind people,” she said. “I would do my best to look past our differences and happily welcome them.”"

He was 82. No cause was given for his death when it was announced three days later on his Facebook page.Cohen has been buried in Montreal in an unadorned pine box next to his mother and father, his son Adam said on Facebook on Sunday.“As I write this I’m thinking of my father’s unique blend of self-deprecation and dignity, his approachable elegance, his charisma without audacity, his old-world gentlemanliness and the hand-forged tower of his work,” Adam Cohen wrote.Born into a Jewish family in 1934 and raised in an affluent English-speaking neighborhood of Quebec, Cohen read Spanish poet Federico García Lorca as a teenager - later naming his daughter Lorca. He learned to play guitar from a flamenco musician and formed a country band called the Buckskin Boys.Cohen moved to New York in 1966 at age 31 to break into the music business. Before long, critics were comparing him with Bob Dylan for the lyrical force of his songwriting.Although he influenced many musicians and won many honors, including induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, Cohen rarely made the pop music charts with his sometimes moody folk-rock.His most ardent admirers compared his works to spiritual prophecy. He sang about religion, with references to Jesus Christ and Jewish traditions, as well as love and sex, political upheaval, regret and what he once called the search for “a kind of balance in the chaos of existence.”Cohen’s most famous song, “Hallelujah,” in which he invoked the biblical King David and drew parallels between physical love and a desire for spiritual connection, has been covered hundreds of times since he released it in 1984.Cohen’s other well-known songs include “Suzanne,” “So Long, Marianne,” “Famous Blue Raincoat” and “The Future,” an apocalyptic 1992 recording in which he darkly intoned: “I’ve seen the future, brother/It is murder.”"

Trump is likely to take that a step further.,2016-11-17,"Matryoshka dolls with the portraits Trump, Obama and Putin. Downtown Kiev, Ukraine, on Nov. 12.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582c8fb1150000db07b0d56a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MOSCOW ― Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has thrown many Americans into a state of stupor. Russia, on the contrary, appears to be in exuberant spirits. This is understandable if one recalls that during the race, the Democrats kept saying that Trump’s victory would be Putin’s victory.But it’s more complicated if one thinks beyond bilateral relations, which have repeatedly been going up and down, to the global context. In fact, Trump’s success signifies the end of an important era in the world and ushers in a new one.The decline of liberal globalization, which was exacerbated by the financial crisis in 2008, was out of tune with the course of global politics. The U.S. and European countries’ increasingly egotistic and protectionist policies have been masked by reinvigorated rhetoric characteristic of the liberal world order, particularly from President Obama. The 44th president of the U.S., who won the election of 2008 amid a severe credit crunch, was much more aware than anyone else in his country that the world was changing dramatically and that America could no longer do things the way it had done before. It was gradually losing its dominance after clear overstretch in the 1990s and 2000s and needed a new tack.Obama steered clear of excessive risks; he understood that America had to focus on domestic issues and that it could not solve all the world’s problems. But he either did not want to say this publicly or could not. To make amends for his restraint, he chose to reinforce rhetoric about America’s global duties, eventually disappointing everyone around him, both his ardent supporters and opponents. But, most importantly, people around the world began to feel that America did not know what exactly it wanted and wondered whether they could rely on it any more. Essentially, Obama started dismantling his country’s global obligations while publicly saying otherwise.Trump did not really invent anything new. Much of what he said about foreign policy during the campaign had been said many times before him, including at the top level. When he said that Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which concerns collective defense, had a price and that only those who paid diligently could count on protection, it was treated as a scandal. And yet, virtually the same, albeit in a somewhat milder form, had been said before — by President Obama earlier this year and by former Defense Secretary Robert Gates five years ago. As Gates put it, “If current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders ― those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me ― may not consider the return on America’s investment in NATO worth the cost.”Trump says openly what Obama never dared to say: the U.S. is going to focus on its own interests and does not want to bear the burden of being the world’s guardian anymore. But this does not mean isolationism, because these interests reach far. Besides, judging from Trump’s statements, strength and respect are very important to him, and so the use of force cannot be ruled out. But the main difference from the previous administration is that the ideological promotion of democracy and a certain model of development, which provided the conceptual and axiological justification for America’s global presence, is being rolled back.For all their antagonism, the Clinton-Bush eras made up one period ― the emergence and triumph of the U.S. as the only global policeman who could intervene in world affairs when necessary. The Obama-Trump era, no matter how long or short it is going to be, will return the country to more moderate positions on what concerns its national interests, and will bring its policy and rhetoric into line with economic trends. Russia’s reaction to Trump’s election is unprecedentedly positive. But there should be no illusion — Trump won’t entertain any affection for Russia. As a pragmatist, he will shift the blame for all problems to his predecessor and try to garner Russia’s support for his new U.S. policy on the world stage. China may be his number one concern, and he may ask Russia to “step away” from Beijing, promising some reward in exchange. This is precisely what Russia must not do, for the non-Western world generally views it as a partner who will eagerly push other countries away from the U.S. embrace. True, this reputation has been replaced by a more respectable image lately, but it can be ruined easily. “The Russian threat” played an unprecedented role in the presidential election campaign in America and was used by the Democrats as a battering ram against Trump. However, it turned out that most voters did not get scared and were barely interested in this topic. All speculation that Trump is pro-Kremlin will most likely die away. There is no doubt that Putin is interested in him as a strong leader, and both strongly reject “political correctness.” And yet, no one can say what policy the Trump administration will pursue toward Russia. Of course Moscow likes the president-elect’s position that America should not intervene everywhere or force its views on others. But Trump’s plan to build up the military and use force to make others respect America raises questions. His anti-Chinese and anti-Iranian stance is clearly at odds with Moscow’s current priorities, even though Trump will most likely try to patch up relations with Russia in order to contain China.Relations may warm up soon enough after Trump’s inauguration, for they really have taken a steep dive during the end of Obama’s term. Yet, in general, Russia-U.S. relations have not seen any major progress since the middle of the 20th century; they have swung back and forth with varying amplitude. Russia also has reason to welcome Trump’s election because the U.S.-centric world, where Moscow has failed to find a fair place, is coming to an end. Russia could not take the niche it was assigned as part of “Greater Europe;” it simply was not fit for it. Russia was not strong enough to make the grade as an opponent of the U.S., nor could it accept a subordinate role. Failure to fit itself into any of the proposed formats and the inability to create its own helped precipitate a deep crisis in the mid-2010s. If Trump tames America’s foreign policy ambitions, Russia will get what it wanted — a more multivariate international system where Russia will not play by rules it didn’t help make.Russia sought to raise its profile in the international system, and now the opportunity to do that seems to be coming its way, primarily in the Middle East and Europe. But how much does Russia really need that?The Middle East fire will keep growing regardless of what external players do. Getting deeply involved there and assuming responsibility will entail big risks. But the greatest temptation comes from Europe — the eternal source of Russia’s inspiration and complexes. The European Union system is decaying, and Russia may want to regain some of its lost positions. The general trend is quite favorable at the moment, as politicians advocating closer relations with Russia won presidential elections in Moldova and Bulgaria last weekend. But Russian history shows that every time Russia got seriously engaged in European affairs in the hope of becoming a master of destinies on the continent, it always ended up fighting wars, overstraining itself and sustaining losses.The events of the last few years prodded Russia into diversifying its policies, turning towards Asia and shedding its two-century-long painful obsession with the West.Russia welcomes the return of pragmatism to international relations and the retreat of liberal ideology. But the realpolitik that Trump is inclined to exercise will mean a fierce and uncompromising struggle; and Russia has more modest resources than heavyweights America and China, primarily economically, where competition has become increasingly tough. The question is whether Russia is overestimating its strength."
58,POLITICS,Whitesplaining The Election,"David R. Morse, ContributorPresident & CEO, New American Dimensions",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whitesplaining-the-election_us_582ce21ee4b08c963e343a95,This nation is a powder keg.,2016-11-17,"Business mogul Donald Trump rides an escalator to a press event to announce his candidacy for the U.S. presidency at Trump Tower on June 16, 2015 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5834aaf0180000270c30f869.jpeg?cache=qPtF6yexY3&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Donald Trump descended his golden escalator in June 2015 to announce his candidacy for president, he made immigration a key plank of his campaign. And by calling undocumented Mexican immigrants rapists and drug dealers – though some, he clarified, were “good people” – he made racism the other plank.During the campaign, Trump’s mostly policy-vague, racist- (and sexist-) specific messages came through dog whistles and foghorns. It was a campaign that allowed his supporters – white supporters – to hear what they wanted to hear. And what many wanted to hear was that there would be a retrograde America, that America of old where whites had more power.Throughout the campaign, and even in the week he’s been president-elect, Trump has wavered on some issues, even on his signature issue, immigration – now he says three million undocumented immigrants who are criminals will be deported. But one campaign fixture has remained, the appeal to white America, whose anger he reputedly shares.And what are they angry about? We know from exit polls that voters most concerned about immigration and/or terrorism went for Trump. We can assume they thought Trump would keep them safer from terrorists and would severely restrict immigration and increase deportations (he said as much, repeatedly).The most common response of Trump voters was the desire for “change.” What that change might look like is not entirely clear.Despite overtly race-baiting messages from Trump and his surrogates, I think it’s fair to say that most Trump voters didn’t gravitate to him solely because of the overt racial overtures. They had other wants, like a ground war against ISIS, or lower taxes, or a conservative Supreme Court. But regardless, they were okay with the racism.I don’t think it could be said that the general election was really about issues. Can you think of any national issues that were thoroughly explored? I can’t. This election was tribal. The electorate voted, whether they knew it or not, tribally. And the change most Trump voters wanted – what they heard from Trump, whether he said it or not – was the restoration of white power.The vast majority of Trump voters are white. Not surprising, because the Republican electorate is now almost entirely white. Their whiteness is not a problem per se. But it’s worrisome that many white voters say they feel oppressed as white people. It’s naïve to say that white racial anxiety had little to do with the election results. This was, as CNN commentator Van Jones said, a “whitelash election against a changing country.” Conservative commentators agreed. Fox’s Brit Hume said that in 2016 whites voted like a minority group.Five years ago CNN published an article that offered several examples of racial anxiety, including:A poll showing nearly half of Americans identifying discrimination against whites being just as big as bigotry against blacks and other minoritiesResults from the election showed that Clinton did best in areas that are highly racially diverse, like coastal California. Trump won the whitest counties in the nation overwhelmingly, with a much higher percentage than Romney did in 2012.It appears quite possible that whether or not Trump voters get the kind of change they want, they will be getting the most overtly racist (and anti-Semitic and homophobic) cabinet in recent history, with proponents of an ugly kind of white power, the kind most voters probably don’t want.On Sunday President-Elect Trump appointed Steve Bannon, former head of Breitbart News, a website – I’m sorry, let me correct that, a sewer – of anti-Semitic, racist garbage and the go-to publication for the alt-right, the new, sanitized term for white nationalists or white supremacists. The chief strategist for the president-elect, who ran in the Republican Party, the party started in 1860 with Abraham Lincoln, is a hero for white supremacists.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted: “There must be no sugarcoating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the Trump administration.” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, on the Senate floor, ripped into Bannon, warning that we must not normalize having such a person as one of the most powerful people in the country. Top GOP leaders appear to be fine with Bannon, however. The KKK and the American Nazi Party are gushing with praise over the choice of Bannon. The former wizard of the KKK, David Duke, loudly proclaimed his admiration for Trump during the campaign and now says that Bannon is “basically creating the ideological aspects of where we’re going.”Is that where we’re going? Did Trump voters want what David Duke thinks is in store for the U.S.? I am convinced that the majority of Trump voters do not share the opinion of David Duke or the American Nazi Party. We should take them at their word that many are concerned about national security, their economic situation, and taxes. And many surely had genuine policy differences with Ms. Clinton.I think in most cases Trump voters think a great America might look like 1955, a time before many of us were even born. It didn’t look like Bannon or David Duke. But Bannon is what we’re getting. It’s safe to say that there are many unknowns about a Trump presidency. But one week into the transition and it doesn’t look good for race relations. If somehow Trump ushers in an era of great prosperity and a lessening of income inequality – even those who didn’t vote for him can hope for this – it might be just enough to assuage white America’s anger at its diminishing status.If greater prosperity does not happen, Trump’s followers are likely to turn on him – we hope they won’t turn on people of color, though that situation already is looking dire – and short of an inexplicable and sudden reversal in the demographic decline of white America, or a greater acceptance of white Americans’ place in a plurality society, this nation is likely to be, for some time to come, a powder keg.

The issue felt very close to home. First, the scene was painfully familiar to anyone who lived through the civil rights movement. And second, the Dakota Access Pipeline—which the protesters were fighting against—will pass through her home state of Illinois.Haley spoke with many of her constituents, including people who worked on the pipeline in Illinois. “I might have my opinion,” said Haley, “but I can’t just step out there without representing what my constituents want. So I had to get out there and find out.” What she heard were varying views of the pipeline—as well as empathy and solidarity with the protesters.From the workers, she heard that the work was steady and the pay was very good. Haley reported that, “In these times when work can be scarce and even the jobs that are available are often low paying, the work on the pipeline was a very welcome opportunity!”However, from the same workers she heard reflections of compassion for the Standing Rock Sioux who were impacted by the building of the Dakota Access Pipeline. “We felt sorry for those people,” said one of the pipeline workers Haley spoke with. “It wasn’t right. They were dumping people’s stuff. Their feathers and traditional clothing that were important to them that they had for generations went missing. It was terrible. And from what we heard, their sacred burial grounds are being uprooted, though we never participated in disturbing any burial grounds.”The Standing Rock Sioux are concerned that the pipeline will rupture or leak, contaminating their water supply. But the pipeline workers defended their work by describing the safety measures that were put in place: “The pipeline is 8 to 10 feet below the water line,” said one. “If the inspectors found anything done incorrectly, the inspectors could and would shut down the operations and have the welders and other workers re-do it.”That being said, Haley says the workers implied that these safety measures were put in place so that the operation would be above reproach by the authorities, rather than out of concern for local people and land. Indeed, the pipeline company treated its workers in the same way it treated the communities whose land and property were being defiled.“We were working long hours; sometimes all day and all night,” said one of the workers. “One of the guys got killed on the pipeline. When we went back to work the next day, there was a moment of silence. That’s all. Then they demanded that we get back to work and nothing else was said. The contractors were all about putting pipes in the ground and making money. They don’t value life. They don’t care.”Haley acknowledges the complexities in this situation. “We must have ample good jobs, with good pay so that people can sustain themselves and their families.” She says. “At the same time, we can and we must do this in a way that upholds workers’ rights, land rights, water rights, and human rights.”On behalf of the NAACP Illinois State Conference, Haley expresses unyielding solidarity with the protesters at Standing Rock. “We are opposed to what’s happening to the Standing Rock Sioux. We can connect to what’s going on in so many ways. We can relate to the struggle. We’ve had our land and our stuff taken. We have been shot with rubber bullets. We’ve been laid low by water hoses. We have been arrested time and time again for just trying to defend our rights as human beings. Our struggles may not be the same, but they are indisputably linked. We are all seeking liberation.”In conclusion, Haley said, “The Illinois NAACP supports the Standing Rock Sioux and we uphold their right to peaceful protest and we want them to stay safe while doing it. The NAACP has a lot of experience with peaceful protest after our own decades of struggle so we should help with that at a minimum.” She adds, “Black folks have been displaced all of our lives. So we understand the struggle.”"

The strategy, at least from a partisan perspective, worked, securing Republicans full control of the federal government. Yet even with one of the most divisive presidential candidates ever readying to take office, Democrats appear intent on taking a different approach. In an attempt to move forward after their devastating election losses, a number of Democrats want to find common ground with President-elect Donald Trump, arguing that obstructing everything would not be wise. A smaller minority, meanwhile, are calling on Democrats to stand on principle and oppose anything Trump puts forward unless he renounces his ties to toxic advisers.What can they work on with a President Trump? The first word out of Democrats’ mouths is infrastructure. But lawmakers are aware that they will be toeing a thin line for the next four years. Already Democrats are doubting whether Trump will take into account the fears of the millions of Americans who didn’t vote for him, and fire Breitbart News executive chairman Steve Bannon. Trump on Sunday named Bannon, whose website traffics in misogyny and white nationalism, as his chief strategist and senior counselor. At a press conference on Tuesday calling on Trump to fire Bannon, Senator-elect Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said Democrats want to work with Trump on modernizing the nation’s infrastructure but that doesn’t mean they will back down on other issues on which they are at odds with Republicans.“[Infrastructure] would be an area we would look to to try to find common ground, but make no mistake, to the extent that there are these other efforts trying to roll back the progress we’ve made toward social justice, as I’ve said, they will get the fight of their lives because we’re not going to turn back the clock in America,” he told reporters. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) sees room to work with Trump against Republican proposals to privatize Medicare and Social Security. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) is eager to look for other areas of compromise, including creating more jobs ― a common theme during Trump’s campaign. Asked if by working with Trump on possible bipartisan issues, Democrats would legitimize the rest of his agenda, Merkley said “not at all.”“That is the attitude that has been taken by the Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell]: To say we are not going to solve America’s problems in order to prevent President Obama from having victories,” Merkley said. “Victories should be solving problems for the American people and that’s what I keep foremost in my mind.”But throw in the possibility that Trump may want to attach measures expanding fossil fuel development to an infrastructure package and that’s a “whole other conversation,” said Merkley. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said Democrats still have time to make the decision. “The reality is we’re going to see his full complement before we have to make those decisions. We’re going to be able to see who he fully surrounds himself with, and that’s going to be very telling,” said Booker, adding that his pick of Bannon was “very, very discouraging.”Democrats, though, wouldn’t have much ability to stop Trump if Republicans eliminate the filibuster. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said Tuesday he thought there may be some “self discipline” that kept Democrats from abusing it. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), meanwhile, said he would oppose any effort to undo it, meaning the filibuster is likely to stay.Requiring Trump to work with Democrats, Graham added, gives him the chance to make the kinds of deals he wants to make. “There are deals to be made in this body ― big, huge deals,” he said.“I don’t think he’s an ideologue,” Graham went on. “He lives in a world where the other side has to get something. He’s not beholden to any one element. He’s truly an outsider and if he will bring us all together and bring us around a table, some of this stuff will fall into place pretty quickly. To those Democrats who are going to hit him at every turn, you do so at your own peril.” All signs from Democratic leadership, though, point toward finding middle ground. In the same speech that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) dedicated to attacking Trump for picking Bannon, the outgoing senator said Democrats want to work with the president-elect “when we can.”“For example, Democrats have been trying for decades to get Republicans to invest in our deteriorated infrastructure,” he said. “If we can finally get Republicans to make the job-creating infrastructure investments we have been seeking for years, that will be a welcome development.”House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Democrats during their first meeting since the election that they have a “responsibility” to find common ground wherever they can, but “not to anoint something that does not represent our values.”Pelosi, who is dealing with a stunned caucus itching to shake up leadership roles, will also have to corral rank-and-file members who aren’t eager to play nice with Trump ― even for the sake of a transportation and infrastructure package. “I think first thing is that something has to be done about this Bannon deal,” Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Texas) said. “I just think that it’s hard to have good open communication and dialogue when you have someone that has been that blatantly racist in writings and associations.”Taking a phrase from Republicans, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told The Huffington Post last week that Democrats need to “make sure [they] have a good check on Donald Trump in 2018 and only make him a one-term president in 2020.”Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) warned that the party can’t normalize the rhetoric that got Trump elected. “If he tries to effectuate his rhetoric, Democrats have to be a point of resistance all the way through,” he said. An infrastructure bill may be the “panacea” right now, Grijalva added, but “the fundamental question nobody’s answered is, how is he going to pay for it?” Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) would love to see a robust infrastructure bill that would help rebuild the country’s bridges and roads, but she isn’t convinced that Trump will abandon his campaign tactics of appealing to racism, nationalism, misogyny and anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim views. “I just don’t think that we really know what he’s going to be as a president, but our initial indications are not good, and I tell you that I will not back down to a fight for the basic human rights of every American,” Clark told HuffPost. “And if he is not willing to demonstrate that that’s the type of president that he’s going to be, I see very little room for compromise over something.”“Not that I’m fired up.”Michael McAuliff contributed reporting.

StoryCorps, a nonprofit organization dedicated to recording the stories and histories of Americans across the country, maintains an app that archives recorded interviews in the Library of Congress. Last year, StoryCorps initiated the first Great Thanksgiving Listen, in which students were encouraged to interview older family members or friends about their lives. With the help of classroom teachers around the country who assigned the project, the organization collected interviews from over 100,000 participants. This year The Great Thanksgiving Listen is switching gears. Instead of asking students to talk to their elders about their personal histories, they will be talking to them about the election. In subsequent years, The Great Thanksgiving Listen will return to its original theme, according to StoryCorps founder Dave Isay, but this year’s historic election provided a rich opportunity.“The focus is trying to get wisdom from grandparent and elders about how to heal the divide in this country,” Isay said. “We’re trying to create a national moment of listening at this time of incredible discord and divide. This is one time only. Then we’ll go back next year to working with teachers to create the history of a generation.”In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, there has been a rash of hate crimes throughout the country, with many incidents targeting schools. And in the week since the result, protesters across the country, including thousands of high school students, have demonstrated against the president-elect, Donald Trump.These trends make it even more important for students to talk to their elders about what’s happening, Isay said. “What we know is that the microphone and formality of these interviews give you the chance to talk about things you don’t normally talk about. I think students who participate get a chance to honor an elder. It tells [the person who’s being listened to] they matter. We live in a country where many people across the divide feel like their lives don’t matter,” Isay said. The organization will be partnering with school districts and educators across the country and with education groups including Teach for America and the nation’s two largest teachers unions for the project. ― ―Rebecca Klein covers the challenges faced in school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

Reports of vandalized property, verbal attacks and physical assaults on Muslim, Jewish, Black, Latino and LGBT communities inundated news outlets, leaving many members of these communities fearful for what the future would bring.In Montana, reports that anti-Semitic leaflets were cropping up in residential neighborhoods led one synagogue to request police protection for the coming weeks.“Any kind of threat, like someone dropping leaflets somewhere in town with anti-Semitic threats is worrisome, and you don’t know who it is and what their capabilities are, or whether they have other plans,” Laurie Franklin, spiritual leader and rabbinic intern at the Har Shalom synagogue in Missoula, told The Huffington Post.The Montana Human Rights Network, which monitors hate crimes around the state, received three reports of an anti-Semitic literature drop at homes in Missoula within just 24 hours after Trump’s victory, said Network co-director Rachel Carroll Rivas.The leaflets referenced the American Nazi Party and contained messages like, “The Jews’ purpose is to destroy us and our families,” and “Free healthcare for the white working class!”“The drop seems to be random and not targeted to Jewish families,” Carroll Rivas told HuffPost. “But the impact is the same ― fear and intimidation of Jewish people, people of color, LGBT people and others whom have been traditionally targets of white supremacists.”Missoula Police Department Sgt. Travis Welsh confirmed to HuffPost that Har Shalom requested extra police patrol, but said the department hadn’t been contacted directly about the leaflet drops that the Montana Human Rights Network and media outlets were reporting. Carroll Rivas said she wasn’t surprised the leaflets weren’t reported to the police, given that such paraphernalia is protected by the First Amendment.The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified just six hate groups operating in Montana ― far fewer than in many other states ― but both Franklin and Carroll Rivas said the state has a long history of white supremacist activity.“Like many communities, Missoula and Montana at large, have experienced formal white supremacist activism in the past,” Carroll Rivas said. “The difference now is that there is the power of the President-elect behind the discriminatory, derogatory and hateful sentiments. That just magnifies the fear.”She noted that since the election, the network has received dozens of reports of personal verbal intimidation, racist and anti-Semitic graffiti, and online hate speech.“Typically we receive this many reports over the course of a few months, not a few days,” she said.Franklin emphasized that although Har Shalom took the precaution of requesting police protection, community members and social justice advocates shouldn’t give in to fear.“We need to be quite firm about what we hold dear and advocate for it effectively in the public place,” she said. “I’m not afraid. What I am is clear-eyed that this is an oscillation in our system. The center will hold.”Carroll Rivas said the task for advocates moving forward will include exposing the antics of the far right, but also finding ways to draw more moderate people into social justice work. “Those reluctant Trump voters have potential, and there are tens of millions of people in the country and hundreds of thousands of people in our state that didn’t even vote and who need to be talked to, heard and activated,” she said. “This is now our task. There isn’t time to wait or to plan, seeking the perfect words. We must start talking. Now.”Have you been a victim of an act of harassment or discrimination? If so, we encourage you to report the incident to local authorities, and to send us an email about it at: trackinghate@huffingtonpost.com."

The company lost $30.5 million in the third quarter of this year.Univision Communications owns the popular Spanish-language television channel Univision as well as Fusion Media Group ― home to a cable channel and group of English-language news sites including Fusion.net, the African American-focused news site The Root, Gizmodo Media Group (the group of sites formerly known as Gawker Media) and Onion Inc., which produces The Onion.“As part of a broader effort to streamline operations, we eliminated a number of positions in various areas of the Company,” Univision Communications said in a statement. “Over the next several months, we will be adding new positions to support strategic growth areas that will allow us to be better poised to serve our diverse audiences across platforms and meet the needs of our partners.”Univision plans to bring The Root and Fusion under the umbrella of Gizmodo, according to a letter from Lee, who is also Fusion Media CEO, to Fusion staff about the changes.The majority of the layoffs will be at Fusion.net, affecting both business and editorial employees, Fusion Media spokesman David Ford confirmed. No Gizmodo Media Group or Onion Inc. employees lost their jobs as a result of the changes, he said.The layoffs and restructuring are intended to avoid duplication after the company acquired several large new sites, according to Ford. Fusion Media acquired 40 percent of Onion Inc. in January for just under $200 million and bought the sites that would become Gizmodo Media in August for $135 million.The shakeup follows a successful union drive at Fusion. Fusion’s editorial staff voted overwhelmingly last week to unionize with the Writers Guild of America, East, after prolonged resistance from management.The Root’s staff members signed cards electing the Writers Guild as their collective bargaining representative in October and have yet to receive a response from management.“We are in the process of addressing the request for representation by the digital editorial employees at The Root,” Lee wrote in the letter to staff.Gizmodo’s employees unionized with the Writers Guild in June 2015 and ratified a collective bargaining contract that remained in effect when Univision bought the company. (The Huffington Post’s management voluntarily recognized its staff’s unionization with the Writers Guild in January.)The layoffs affect 15 Fusion.net workers who recently unionized, including some staff members active in the organizing effort.Ford, the Fusion spokesman, emphasized that the restructuring was made purely for strategic business reasons in the wake of the company’s acquisitions, and firmly denied that the layoffs had anything to do with the unionization.Lee told the Post that he was not opposed to workers choosing to join a union.He also wrote in his letter that laid-off Fusion staff, unionized or not, would receive severance benefits “consistent” with those in Gizmodo employees’ collectively bargained contract, despite the fact that Fusion’s contract negotiations have yet to begin.Fusion management has respected the outcome of its employees’ union election. But prior to that, the company refused to voluntarily recognize the union and executives held mandatory closed-door meetings with employees to dissuade them from unionizing.Regardless of what the future holds, Univision’s layoffs are the latest blow to a digital media industry that has undergone wrenching changes and a string of mass layoffs in the past year alone. HuffPost, Vice and Mashable have all laid off staff since January in efforts to remain competitive in a shifting media landscape.In October, The Wall Street Journal announced it would seek “substantial” buyouts from staff in an attempt to pre-empt layoffs it expects will be necessary."

She doesn’t answer any of my texts,” Gosselin said of his ex-wife, Kate, who reportedly refused to tell him where Collin currently goes to school. She allegedly told Jon “that Collin is in a special school for special-needs kids with behavioral problems.”The Huffington Post has reached out to representatives for Kate and will update this post accordingly. Jon added, “I have an idea where he is but I don’t really know where he is.” In August, Kate revealed to People magazine that she sent Collin, one of the eight children she has with ex-husband Jon, away because he has “special needs.” Though she didn’t assign a label to the preteen’s needs, Kate said she had “a fairly fluid diagnosis of what those needs are, but he needs to learn certain strategies to help him deal with things.”Collin and his sister Alexis were reportedly expelled from their private school in Pennsylvania in 2010 after sources told RadarOnline they verbally abused both teachers and students. “This has been a struggle we’ve had for a very long time, and it’s one I’ve dealt with on my own,” Kate told People magazine, admitting that she missed her son. “I’ve felt very alone in this. By the same token, it’s not something that has only impacted me or him ― our entire family has been impacted.” "

Appearing on “The Jenny McCarthy Show” Tuesday, the New Kids on the Block star, 47, revealed that he and his longtime boyfriend, Harley Rodriguez, had gotten engaged on a trip to Africa earlier this month. “We’ve always considered ourselves a married couple,” Knight told host Jenny McCarthy, who is married to his NKOTB bandmate, Donnie Wahlberg. Noting that he bought rings about three weeks before their trip, the pop star arranged an evening dinner on a raft on the Zambezi River. “I just figured this was the time to pop the question and make it official,” he said. Listen to Knight chat about his engagement below. As it turns out, the proposal was anything but traditional in a number of other ways. For starters, Knight invited both his mother and Rodriguez’s mother to witness the big moment, and he opted not to get down on one knee before popping the question. “We’re two guys ― it’s always hard, like, who proposes? Who asks? I’ve been waiting for him to ask, he’s probably been waiting for me to ask,” Knight said. Still, he described the entire experience as “absolutely beautiful” and “so romantic.”Knight and Rodriguez, 43, have been dating since 2008, the New York Post reports. The pop star, who will return to the concert stage next summer on NKOTB’s “Total Package” tour with Boyz II Men and Paula Abdul, posted a handful of adorable photos of the couple on their African vacation to his Instagram account.

Dan Patrick (R) said proposals to curtail reproductive and LGBTQ rights reflect his state’s commitment to “conservative values.”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Emboldened by the election of Donald Trump, Republican state lawmakers in Texas kicked off the new legislative filing period on Monday with a trio of bills that would roll back abortion and LGBTQ rights. State Rep. Byron Cook (R) proposed legislation that would require women to cremate or bury the remains of a fetus after an abortion or miscarriage. The bill, similar to one signed by Vice President-elect Mike Pence when he was governor of Indiana, threatens to fine health providers and remove their medical licenses if they don’t comply. Reproductive rights advocates said the bill has no medical purpose other than to shame a woman for ending her pregnancy. A second abortion restriction, proposed by State Rep. Matt Schaefer (R), would remove an exception in the state’s 20-week abortion ban for severe fetal anomalies. So if a woman discovers after 20 weeks of pregnancy that her fetus has a life-threatening medical condition, such as a brain malformation, she would be forced to carry the pregnancy to term. Texas legislators also plan to go after LGBTQ rights in the new legislative session, which begins on Jan. 10. State Sen. Bob Hall (R) introduced a bill that would prevent cities and counties in the state from enacting their own anti-discrimination policies based on sexual orientation or gender discrimination, since state law does not protect these groups, and would repeal local anti-discrimination ordinances that are already in effect. Having “uniform laws,” the bill explains, “will benefit the businesses, organizations, and employers seeking to do business in this state and will attract new businesses, organizations, and employers to this state.” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) said the new slate of bills reflects the state’s commitment to “conservative values,” which was reinforced by Trump’s victory.“Starting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas — life, liberty and lean government that promotes prosperity,” Patrick said. “I remain committed to those principles.”Democratic lawmakers criticized the new agenda as “divisive,” and said they’re going to have “continue to be the grownups” in the legislature. “We are going to do whatever we can to insert evidence-based policy making that respects the rights of all Texans,” said State Rep. Donna Howard (D). "

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) joined a growing list of Democrats endorsing Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) for chair of the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday. Warren praised Ellison’s work on the House Financial Services Committee and his leadership within the Congressional Progressive Caucus in a statement announcing her endorsement. “I’ve watched up close as he has pushed hard to try to hold Wall Street accountable through his work on House Financial Services, and he has consistently exercised bold leadership for the Congressional Progressive Caucus,” Warren said. Ellison was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the Democratic primary but threw his support behind Hillary Clinton in the general election. He is the first Muslim elected to Congress and the first black congressman from Minnesota.Sanders was one of the first top Democrats to endorse Ellison since he announced his DNC run on Monday. Clinton has yet to endorse anyone for the position previously held by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).Other top Democrats, including the outgoing Senate minority leader, Harry Reid (Nev.), and his successor, Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), have also endorsed Ellison.Other candidates to lead the Democratic Party include Howard Dean, who served as DNC chair from 2005 to 2009, and Jamie Harrison, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Ilyse Hogue, president of the reproductive rights group NARAL, is the only woman known to be looking at a bid for the position. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley withdrew his name from consideration on Wednesday. "

Nevertheless, this progress could give him and congressional Republicans the room to slow or modify their agenda in the coming weeks and months. For instance, Trump’s vow to build a massive wall along the border with Mexico and his promise of big tax cuts could take a back seat, should Republicans choose to delay either of them.Trump could have a much tougher time, though, with two other major promises: bringing back coal mining in Appalachia and returning millions of manufacturing jobs “stolen” by China, Mexico and other countries in recent years.Some economists believe Trump could and should change trade policy to punish countries that manipulate their currencies to make it easier for them to export goods. Robert Scott, of the left-leaning Economic Policy Center, said cracking down on countries like China or adjusting the value of the U.S. dollar downward would make U.S. exports more competitive. “I think we can create more manufacturing jobs,” Scott said Tuesday.But other economists say that Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on foreign products would backfire by igniting a trade war that would bring on a recession.Mark Perry, an economics professor at the Flint campus of the University of Michigan, called Trump’s views on trade “naïve, immature and somewhat childish.” The majority of lost manufacturing jobs over the past quarter century, he said, have been lost to machines, not lower-wage workers in other countries. “This has nothing to do with foreign trade. We’re producing more with fewer workers. The idea that Trump would somehow bring some of those jobs here, I don’t see that as realistic or even possible.”Bringing back coal mining jobs, meanwhile, seems even less doable.While Republican politicians, including Trump, have for years blamed Democrats’ “war on coal” for the loss of mining jobs, industry analysts agree that the bigger problem for coal is the abundance of cheap natural gas, thanks to fracking.A McKinsey & Co. report a year ago did not mince words: “The United States has plenty of coal, but the world does not need it,” it stated, attributing the lack of demand to the availability of natural gas combined with higher costs ― including from environmental restrictions ― for using it in electricity generation here and abroad.A February study from Goldman Sachs concluded that with power companies turning to natural-gas plants, the end of coal was inevitable: “Investment in new coal-fired generation is becoming less common and the implied decline in long-term demand appears to be irreversible.”"

Ted Cruz had gone out of his way to bring into his inner circle a new foreign policy adviser who’d basically distinguished himself as one of the few people in American politics more overtly anti-Muslim than Donald Trump. Well, time sure flies! That adviser, Frank Gaffney, has now joined up with the Trump transition team, in some late-breaking news on a long day of clown-show crackups from Trump’s squad of irregulars.UPDATE: Nov. 16 ― Benjy Sarlin of MSNBC tweeted Wednesday morning that Gaffney is not on Trump’s transition team. During an appearance on the network, Trump spokesman Jason Miller confirmed that Gaffney is not a member of, or advising, the team. Gaffney, once described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as “one of America’s most notorious Islamophobes,” heads the Center for Security Policy. It’s a think tank of sorts, well known for promoting conspiratorial theories about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating the U.S. government at high levels and the Sharia system replacing American democracy. (As we reported yesterday, Clare Lopez, who is a similar anti-Muslim paranoiac, is under consideration to be a deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration.)Gaffney has long been on Trump’s radar. In fact, it was a bogus survey, created by Gaffney, which claimed to reveal that many U.S. Muslims were willing to use violence against other Americans and that even more wanted the option to be governed by Sharia, that Trump cited when he famously called for “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.”Here are some of the more outrageous claims Gaffney has made:In the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq, Gaffney suggested that then-President Saddam Hussein had been involved in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, committed by Timothy McVeigh.In 2009, Gaffney questioned whether Obama was America’s first Muslim president or simply playing one. “The man now happy to have his Islamic-rooted middle name featured prominently has engaged in the most consequential bait-and-switch since Adolf Hitler duped Neville Chamberlain over Czechoslovakia at Munich,” Gaffney wrote.Gaffney suggested that Gen. David Petraeus, commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan at the time, was submitting to Sharia when Petraeus condemned the burning of a Quran by a Florida pastor.A few years ago, it looked as though the Republican Party was ready to sever ties with Gaffney and his inflammatory claims. He was banned from the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011 after accusing Norquist and Khan of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.But since then, Gaffney has staged a comeback. GOP presidential hopefuls Cruz, Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee all appeared at his group’s events last year. Months ago, Cruz offered the following praise for the zealot: “Frank is a patriot, he loves this country, and he’s clear-eyed about radical Islamic terrorism.”News that Gaffney could play a role on Trump’s transition team as a national security adviser is very, very bad news for Muslim Americans, to say the least.Clarification: Language in this article has been amended to comport with the original headline that Gaffney was being considered for, but had not officially joined, Trump’s transition team.~~~~~Jessica Schulberg is a reporter covering foreign policy and national security for The Huffington Post.

Bobby Kaufmann (R) sees this as disturbing evidence of colleges and universities coddling their students instead of making them face disappointment head-on. Kaufmann wants to punish this behavior with a bill that would slash funding to state institutions that use taxpayer money on election-related grief counseling or activities that go beyond the resources normally offered to students. He plans to introduce the measure when the state legislature reconvenes in January.The legislation ― which Kaufmann deemed the “suck it up, buttercup” bill ― would cut funding for twice the amount that a public university spent on such election-specific resources. It would also create criminal penalties for protesters who shut down highways.“In life, when your car breaks down, your kids get sick or you have to take a second job up to pay your mortgage, you don’t get to go to a ‘cry zone,’ you don’t get to pet a pony,” Kaufmann said in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday. “You have to deal with it.”But there may be a problem with Kaufmann’s premise: Iowa’s state universities don’t plan to spend more money on election-related counseling and events, according to the Des Moines Register.The University of Northern Iowa held discussion sessions for students and faculty to talk about the election results and their concerns. Iowa State University students and faculty organized a march to the university president’s office. All of these events were paid for using state funds that had already been allocated to the schools. “I think universities are the perfect place to have these types of conversations,” Scott Ketelsen, director of university relations at the University of Northern Iowa, told the Register. “It’s where people learn. It’s where they share ideas. I don’t consider it coddling.”As a presidential candidate, Trump repeatedly came under criticism for racist, sexist and violent comments. Reports of hate crimes have increased in the wake of Trump’s win, which has left many people worried ― and while Kauffman may not be sympathetic to it, experts say the grief many are experiencing is very real.The outcome was very unexpected, which didn’t make it any easier for Trump’s critics to swallow. He defied the expectations of pollsters and pundits, who nearly unanimously predicted that Democrat Hillary Clinton would win the election. Millennial voters overwhelmingly favored Clinton, according to a survey Harvard University’s Institute of Politics released late last month."

They represent 30 countries and ethnic groups that speak more than 100 languages.The model minority myth, which suggests all Asians are bound for academic and occupational success, has prevented some AAPI communities from benefiting from federal funding and resources, U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King said in May. The challenges, he said, are as “diverse as their communities.”Although current data show AAPI students as a whole tend to be among the highest achieving in the U.S., some subgroups face academic and occupational challenges that are often overlooked under that broad AAPI banner. Indian-Americans, for example, tend to have higher educational success than Samoan-Americans, and there is higher unemployment among Filipino-Americans than there is among Japanese-Americans.The initiative will allow state educational agencies to learn more about these subpopulations, beyond the seven racial and ethnic categories recognized in schools.Christopher Kang, national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, applauded the White House for the grants, describing the funding as “incredibly significant in addressing barriers to achievement.”“The needs of AAPI students are far too often unknown and unfulfilled,” Kang said in a statement.The grants are part of a program the White House announced in May, the AAPI Data Disaggregation Initiative, under which states can receive up to $1 million per year for five years to keep better track of the diversity in cultures, languages and educational challenges in the AAPI community.It was unclear how much each state would receive with this grant.

The funds will help support different AAPI communities.,2016-11-16,The word cloud illustrates the diversity of the AAPI communities.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582bc11f180000f503504683.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The stereotype that all Asians are A-plus students may sound like a compliment, but that rosy generalization puts a lot of Asian-American Pacific Islander subgroups at risk of being overlooked when it comes to federal funding and resources.In an effort to address that, three states with large Asian-American Pacific Islander populations ― Minnesota, Hawaii and Washington ― will receive a combined $836,000 to study AAPI students and try to close achievement and opportunity gaps between the various AAPI subgroups, the White House announced Monday.The federal grants, which President Barack Obama’s administration worked to establish, will help the states’ educational agencies break down data on AAPI communities and clarify disparities between the subgroups to help dispel that overarching Asian myth.AAPIs “have too often been subjected to the model minority myth, the notion that they are all successful, educated, and self-sufficient, which has masked unique needs of AAPI subgroups,” Doua Thor, executive director of the White House Initiative on AAPIs, said in a news release.The funding is projected to address perceptions, negative and positive, that affect 1 million students in the three states, according to the White House.AAPIs are the fastest growing racial group in the U.S. and make up the largest share of recent immigrants. They represent 30 countries and ethnic groups that speak more than 100 languages.The model minority myth, which suggests all Asians are bound for academic and occupational success, has prevented some AAPI communities from benefiting from federal funding and resources, U.S. Secretary of Education John B. King said in May. The challenges, he said, are as “diverse as their communities.”Although current data show AAPI students as a whole tend to be among the highest achieving in the U.S., some subgroups face academic and occupational challenges that are often overlooked under that broad AAPI banner. Indian-Americans, for example, tend to have higher educational success than Samoan-Americans, and there is higher unemployment among Filipino-Americans than there is among Japanese-Americans.The initiative will allow state educational agencies to learn more about these subpopulations, beyond the seven racial and ethnic categories recognized in schools.Christopher Kang, national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, applauded the White House for the grants, describing the funding as “incredibly significant in addressing barriers to achievement.”“The needs of AAPI students are far too often unknown and unfulfilled,” Kang said in a statement.The grants are part of a program the White House announced in May, the AAPI Data Disaggregation Initiative, under which states can receive up to $1 million per year for five years to keep better track of the diversity in cultures, languages and educational challenges in the AAPI community.It was unclear how much each state would receive with this grant.

74,MEDIA,Journalist Groups Urge Donald Trump To Commit To Traditional Access As President-Elect,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-protective-pool_us_582c8615e4b058ce7aa863cf,The press isn’t angling for a seat at Trump’s dinner table. They just want basic information to cover his travels.,2016-11-16,"Journalists want to know when the president-elect leaves Trump Tower, as they're informed when the president leaves the White House. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― More than a dozen press advocacy organizations urged President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to allow a “protective pool” of reporters to follow him outside Trump Tower and report on his whereabouts for the broader press corps ― and, most importantly, the public. “We respectfully ask you to instill a spirit of openness and transparency in your administration in many ways but first and foremost via the press pool,” read the letter signed by heads of 15 groups, including the National Press Club, Committee to Protect Journalists and Society of Professional Journalists.Trump’s restrictions and repeated attacks on the press during the 2016 campaign have heightened fears that his White House won’t provide levels of access reporters are accustomed to and which they feel are necessary to do their jobs.Last week, Trump broke precedent by not allowing a small rotating group of journalists, known as a protective pool, to travel with him on his first post-election trip to Washington. On Tuesday, the president-elect and his family went to Manhattan’s 21 Club for dinner after the press had been informed he would not be leaving Trump Tower that night. Some might shrug off journalists’ concerns as whining, but as several pointed out on Twitter, the issue is not just about the press’ right to know, but the public’s.The protective pool has served a vital function for decades in bearing witness to mundane events ― like the president or president-elect heading to dinner ― and historically consequential moments. Pool reporters were in the motorcade during President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, were nearby during the attempt on President Ronald Regan’s life and aboard Air Force One following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Journalism advocacy groups push for such access, regardless of party, so that an independent press can cover events rather than the public relying solely on the government’s account.“The idea of a press pool that covers all of the president’s movements is one that dates back to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration,” the letter read. “Every president of both parties has treated this important tradition with respect. The role of the press pool is critically important to our country, whose citizens depend on and deserve to know what the president is doing. This isn’t about access for the press itself, it’s about access for Americans in diverse communities across the country. Your constituents receive information from a variety of platforms to learn about what our president is doing.”There’s often a misconception that journalists in a protective pool would disrupt the president or president-elect’s visit and a legitimate belief that everyone ― even the soon-to-be most powerful person in the world ― is entitled to a private meal with his family without being badgered by reporters. But reporters aren’t seeking access to loom over Trump’s shoulder to see how he likes his steak cooked. They’re not angling for an invite to sit at the table. They just want to be aware of when the president-elect is traveling.If the pool had been informed Trump was heading to the 21 Club, a small group of reporters would travel with the motorcade and file a dispatch to notify the press corps where he’d gone. They would likely sit in a van outside or nearby restaurant until Trump left and then file another dispatch on his departure. They may get additional details from the transition team, such as who attended the dinner, and report that back to the press corps. They may get to ask a question or two as the president-elect departs or be on hand if he wants to make a statement. It’s not a glamorous assignment, but one most journalists consider necessary to comprehensively cover the presidency. Jeff Mason, a Reuters correspondent and president of the White House Correspondents’ Association, said in a separate statement Wednesday that it was “unacceptable” for the next president “to travel without a regular pool to record his movements and inform the public about his whereabouts.”Mason said he was encouraged that the Trump team has said it would allow for a protective pool after moving into the White House, but similarly urged the president-elect to do so now. During the 2016 campaign, journalists showed little appetite for collective action against the Trump campaign’s unprecedented restrictions, from enforcing a “press pen” at events to operating a media blacklist. So it’s not surprising the Trump transition team wouldn’t abide by the norms of press access. Thomas Burr, the president of the National Press Club, said in an email that it’s necessary for the press to band together now. “Journalists have to stand up for each other now more than ever,” Burr said. “This isn’t about the press but about access for the American people, for history and our democracy.” The full letter is below:"

President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to defund Planned Parenthood and tear up an uncertain portion of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which requires free access to contraception. Meanwhile, Vice President–elect Mike Pence  once predicted that Roe v. Wade, the landmark case allowing abortion, would be “consigned to the ash heap of history where it belongs” during Trump’s presidency. Now that the election is decided, women across the country are rushing to their doctors for long-lasting contraception and worrying over the future of abortion access. Which makes it all the more significant that The CW and FX have shown women electing for safe, legal alternatives to pregnancy, getting drama-free abortions not once but three times over the past month.The CW’s “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and “Jane the Virgin” and FX’s “You’re the Worst” have all shown its stars making levelheaded decisions to end pregnancies. No guilt. No shame. No over-the-top crying. No veiled references to abortion as the-thing-that-shall-not-be-named on a short list of options.Paula (Donna Lynne Champlin) chooses to pursue her dream of becoming a lawyer instead of having another child with her husband on “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” Xiomara (Andrea Navedo) has a medical abortion off screen between episodes after taking a hard look at her relationship with her partner on “Jane the Virgin.” Lindsay (Kether Donohue) gets an “abobo” after becoming pregnant by a DIY artificial insemination process involving a frozen condom, a microwave and a turkey baster on “You’re the Worst.”For these characters, ending a pregnancy was the best choice, and their TV universes didn’t come crashing down around them when they went for it. They join a small number of other shows (HBO’s “Girls,” for example) that have included abortion as a normal choice that sometimes comes up in a woman’s life. But that’s TV. For now, real-life reproductive rights align with television’s fictional sphere. In 2017, however, President Trump and Vice President Pence might start making changes."
76,WOMEN,I’m A Jewish Queer Woman And I Already See The Impact Of Bannon’s Hate,Alex Berg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/im-a-jewish-queer-woman-and-i-already-see-the-impact-of-bannons-hate_us_5829eab5e4b060adb56f5c6c,We've seen this before.,2016-11-16,"Spray painted graffiti in Denver, Colorado. Denver Police are looking for two suspects who went on a vandalism spree overnight spray painting racial slurs, hateful speech and swastikas on cars and homes.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582ce5ef1a00002500cc852e.jpeg?cache=3xRcxv8aSd&ops=crop_159_392_5409_3320%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"On Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump named Breitbart News Network executive chairman Steve Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon, who served as CEO of the Trump campaign, oversaw the publication of anti-semitic, racist, sexist, homophobic and Islamophobic content in his role as chairman of Breitbart, has been accused of domestic abuse and made overtly anti-semitic remarks himself, according to a court document from his 2007 divorce.I’m a queer Jewish woman who’s spent the past year covering the race, and spent election night at Trump’s victory party. I’ve been given the finger at Trump events, navigated rallies where protesters and supporters all but physically fought each other and made a concerted effort to be fair as I’ve interviewed those who take no issue with his comments about grabbing women, his racist business practices or promises to walk back LGBTQ rights. Yet, it wasn’t until I saw the president-elect standing on stage with Bannon that I understood the magnitude of the platform given to anti-semitism.A white nationalist who allegedly said he didn’t want his daughters “going to school with Jews” is headed to the White House. Many Jewish journalists have already been experiencing the groundswell of anti-semitism throughout the campaign. Now with swastikas appearing around the country and the KKK celebrating Trump’s win, we are coming to grips with the notion that the very hate many of our families escaped in Eastern Europe has come home to roost on American soil and worse, in the White House. Over the course of the past year covering the election, I’ve experienced a trickle of anti-semitic hate on Twitter that — I hope — peaked last week with a gif of Ralph Fiennes as a Nazi officer in the film “Schindler’s List” pointing a gun in my direction. More often, I receive comments on Twitter that I’m “oven worthy” or “inbred” or the like, but this tweet was a reaction to a piece I wrote about how to be an ally to LGBTQ people post-election. As a queer woman, these insults are sometimes coupled with homophobic language. After all, the ideology of white supremacy often goes hand-in-hand with condemning queer people.The day after the election, the Twitter hate hit closer. On what happened to be the 78th anniversary of Kristallnacht, vandals painted swastikas on a business front in South Philadelphia. The swastikas were just 15 minutes away from the row house synagogue my family first joined when they immigrated to America from Romania and Ukraine in the early 1900s to escape the anti-Jewish pogroms — massacres — happening all over eastern Europe. On election night, I spent 10 hours at Trump’s victory party for The Huffington Post. Over those hours, I thought of my ancestors who came to America — and that South Philly neighborhood — to work on pushcarts and in factories. I thought of the hardships they faced and the privilege they had as white immigrants. Sometime late in the night, Trump’s supporters began singing “God Bless America,” as it became clear that Secretary Hillary Clinton’s path to victory was virtually nonexistent.“God Bless America” was written by Irving Berlin, a Jewish immigrant whose family left Russia in the early 1900s to escape the same pogroms as my family. In the 1940s, the KKK protested the song because of Berlin’s background. I grew up watching my Romanian great-grandfather sing the song at the dinner table because it signified freedom from fear for my Jewish immigrant family. In that moment at Trump headquarters, it was a hymn for a campaign that’s central immigration policy is to “build a wall.” While many white liberals woke up shocked the day after the election, many minorities felt that the results confirmed the America that they already knew. For those of us who are Jews, we are now faced with a tide of anti-semitism that our families recognize all too well. We are also faced with Islamphobia that feels familiar, with Trump’s calls to create a Muslim registry and, at least, limit Muslim immigration to the U.S. It seems that the memory of the SS St. Louis, a ship carrying 900 Jewish refugees escaping Nazi Germany, is a distant one. The ship was turned away when it tried to dock in the U.S. in 1939 and sent back to Europe where hundreds of the passengers were killed. In the wake of the election I have wondered if, as a woman, I should stockpile birth control before the inauguration. I have wondered if, as a queer person, I should marry my partner before Mike Pence takes office. And, I have wondered if, as a Jew, my safety will be at stake when Bannon begins working in the White House. I have wondered the same for people of color, Muslims and other marginalized groups.Since November 8, white voters who elected Trump have said they are not racist or xenophobic or sexist. Looking back at anti-semitism throughout history — from Kristallnacht to the SS St. Louis to the Holocaust — it’s striking how many “good” people stood by as these atrocities occurred. In six weeks, Bannon, along with the rest of the Trump administration, will take office. We don’t have to wait to find out how their views will play out. With the uptick of swastikas, Internet harassment and hate crimes, we already know. "

However, he stressed he was not planning to fight Trump through the courts.Instead, he would focus on “trying to present an opposite point of view and trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.”Steyer’s pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major global threat and those who doubt its existence.Other U.S. environmental groups are also preparing to resist Trump’s agenda, with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped draft some of President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations preparing to defend them in court.“We have always been willing to do whatever is necessary,” Steyer said, when asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose Trump’s agenda.Trump campaigned on a promise to drastically reduce environmental regulation and ease permitting for infrastructure, moves he said would breathe life into an oil and gas industry ailing from low prices, without harming U.S. air and water quality.He has also called climate change a hoax and has promised to “cancel” the Paris Climate Accord between nearly 200 nations to slow global warming, a deal he said would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage.While the approach has cheered the industry, it has sent shockwaves through the environmental movement, which is confronting the prospect of losing all progress it made during the Obama administration.Steyer, who had endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, called Trump’s policies dangerous.“Every single one of these things, whether it was getting rid of Paris or cutting back the EPA, we think are extremely dangerous to the security of every American,” Steyer said. “We think it is based on willful ignorance of the facts and flies in the face of the realities facing the world.”ARCTIC DRILLINGSteyer’s main political vehicle, NextGen Climate, on Tuesday called on the Obama administration to defy Trump’s pro-drilling agenda by issuing an order permanently blocking all new drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump has also promised to ask Canadian oil pipeline company, TransCanada Corp, to resubmit its application to build a pipeline into the United States that would link Alberta’s vast oil sands to American refineries and ports on the Gulf Coast. The project, Keystone XL, had been rejected by the Obama administration after years of mass protests and lobbying by environmental organizations.Steyer said the project may no longer make sense since a slump in oil prices has reduced the profitability of oil sands production.Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said young voter turnout in areas where NextGen focused its mobilization efforts during the 2016 campaign was up more than 20 percent from the last presidential election in 2012.“Did we get the president we want, absolutely not. Did we get a majority of clean energy supporters in the senate, no,” Steyer said. “But in terms of what we did, and the strategy we took, we wouldn’t do anything differently.”NextGen poured nearly $69 million into its elections related programs during the presidential campaign, according to federal records compiled by OpenSecrets.org, slightly lower than the $74 million it spent during the mid-term congressional elections in 2014, when only two of the six candidates it supported won.(Reporting by Richard Valdmanis, editing by Ross Colvin)"

And so for me, this is a challenge ― Sonia, continue doing what I think is the right thing. And it’s a challenge we all have to face and maintain.”These reflections drew applause from the audience and a reaction from Press: “You answered it the right way.”The first Latina justice to ever sit on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor was President Barack Obama’s first high court appointee, in 2009, following the retirement of Justice David Souter.For the past nine months, she and her colleagues have had to live with the reality of an eight-member court, since Republicans in Congress have refused to grant a hearing to Merrick Garland, Obama’s choice to fill the seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February. Trump is now poised to fill the seat.Sotomayor’s remarks on Tuesday were not her first dealing with the election or the vacancy.Last month, she treaded carefully when asked whether the nasty presidential campaign ever got to her and her fellow bench mates. Picking her words carefully, Sotomayor found a way to stress that her institution is a little different from others in Washington. “The reason that we can continue to interact and actually like each other is because we respect each other,” she told a Minnesota crowd. “We respect one fundamental truth: We know that each other has an equal amount of passion and love for the Constitution, for our system of government and doing what’s right under the law.”"

Last month, the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, blamed Twitter for not cracking down on abusive accounts. According to SPLC spokeswoman Heidi Beirich, the group asked Twitter to remove more than 100 accounts belonging to members of the alt-right, which SPLC identifies as a group or individuals who embrace “white ethno-nationalism as a fundamental value.” On Twitter, many self-described members of the alt-right used the social network to threaten Jewish people, women, people of color and other groups.Richard Spencer of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, was among those who lost his account this week.

Spencer also made the list.Spencer responded to the account suspensions in a YouTube video on Tuesday, stating, “I and a number of other people who just got banned were not even trolling.” He accused Twitter of conducting “a great purge” of its users “on the basis on their views.”Spencer also reaffirmed his support for Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who was permanently banned from Twitter in July. That decision followed Yiannopoulos’ vicious and racist attack on African-American comedian Leslie Jones.At the time, Twitter acknowledged it hadn’t “done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter,” but vowed to step up its game. “We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it’s happening and prevent repeat offenders,” the company stated at the time.In light of those statements, it’s not clear why Twitter waited until now to take action against these individual accounts. The company did not return The Huffington Post’s request for comment on Wednesday."

Spencer also made the list.Spencer responded to the account suspensions in a YouTube video on Tuesday, stating, “I and a number of other people who just got banned were not even trolling.” He accused Twitter of conducting “a great purge” of its users “on the basis on their views.”Spencer also reaffirmed his support for Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who was permanently banned from Twitter in July. That decision followed Yiannopoulos’ vicious and racist attack on African-American comedian Leslie Jones.At the time, Twitter acknowledged it hadn’t “done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter,” but vowed to step up its game. “We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it’s happening and prevent repeat offenders,” the company stated at the time.In light of those statements, it’s not clear why Twitter waited until now to take action against these individual accounts. The company did not return The Huffington Post’s request for comment on Wednesday."

Not ever.,2016-11-16,"For many black people, the emotional labor it takes for us to be gracious to people who support Trump is exhausting.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582cd3d3180000ca0330e813.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, Donald Trump was elected to be the next president of the United States. Some Americans are ecstatic. Some are utterly horrified, shocked, and afraid.For many white progressives, the election of Trump was a wake-up call, a distressing reminder that this country is far more sexist and racist than they realized. But for many black people, Trump’s election was just a cruel confirmation of the America we’ve always known: a glittering paradise built on the foundation of slavery and white supremacy. In the wake of Trump’s election, we’ve been trying to figure out how to move forward. We live in a deeply divided country, one in which both liberals and conservatives alike fortify themselves in rhetorical echo chambers that make no space for different perspectives and experiences. By all means, we need to figure out a way to bridge the gap. But, please: stop asking black people and other marginalized people (who are genuinely terrified about the next four years) to “empathize” with Trump supporters. Articles about how to “heal” America and bring us all together have cropped up all over the internet. The New York Times ran an op-ed explaining why we should “stop shaming” the working-class whites who voted for Trump. The Washington Post ran a pre-election piece about the lack of empathy for Trump voters. The schism we’re witnessing has been chalked up mainly to the dissatisfaction of the white working class, who feel bullied, misunderstood, and unnoticed in the current political climate. First, the economic and social anxieties of the white working class does not absolve them of buying into and supporting a racist campaign. Second, yes, there are poor white people who are hurting and deserve to be listened to, but it’s a false narrative to keep implying that they alone elected Trump. It wasn’t just poor white people who voted for Trump, but also the economically privileged, including 45 percent of white, college-educated women. These appeals towards uniting with the other half of America who voted for Trump seem to conveniently side-step the reality that they voted for a man who ran a campaign based on racism, sexism and xenophobia, who was endorsed by the KKK, who emboldened self-professed white supremacists, who has appointed a white nationalist (Steve Bannon) as his chief advisor. Donald Trump tapped into a subset of white America’s latent distrust of the other, and until we reckon with that, the idea of asking black people to empathize and understand the people who voted for a man who has continuously dismissed the Black Lives Matter movement, downplayed the reality of police brutality, and conflated the black community with the “inner city” is ridiculous. People have real fear, and that fear should not be dismissed in the name of unifying a broken country.During a segment on Anderson Cooper 360 following Trump’s win, Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany accused fellow commentator Van Jones of “stoking the fears” of people because he shared an anecdote about a Muslim woman who said she was afraid to stay in the country. Jones shut that sentiment down, though. “You need to have a little bit of empathy and understanding for the people who are afraid because your candidate has been one of the most explosively provocative candidates in the history of our country, and there is a price to be paid for that,” he said. Watch a clip of their exchange below. In Trump’s America, who and who isn’t worthy of empathy? Who has access to empathy, and who doesn’t? How are black people expected to empathize with people who have never returned that empathy? Empathy that only works one way, that only humanizes those already in positions of power and privilege, does not heal. It merely silences. As Alex Quan-Pham wrote for Rookie last year:We can’t talk about empathy without talking about how systems of oppression influence who gets empathy and who doesn’t. And we can’t demand that empathy be given to all people while ignoring the fact that some people are still denied their basic humanity.It is not the responsibility of the disenfranchised and the oppressed to assuage the fears of white people, to soothe white anxiety, to extend an olive branch to people who either voted because of or in spite of the racist rhetoric that defined Trump’s campaign and will likely define his presidency. We are constantly catering to white feelings and white fragility. Some have argued that Trump’s win is a backlash against liberal bias and liberal rhetoric, an obsession with “political correctness” and the alienation of white people who feel uncomfortable every time the dreaded R-word (racism) comes up. But the truth is: actually being the victim of racism is far more painful and harmful than being called a racist.It is a luxury for someone to be able to easily accept Trump’s America even if they didn’t vote for it. Black people don’t have that luxury. At the end of the day, white people are less likely to be directly impacted by the racist and xenophobic policies Trump proudly boasted about during his campaign. The emotional labor it takes for us to be gracious to people who support Trump, who do not understand why we are upset and afraid and unwilling to remain silent, to empathize with them, is exhausting. It is soul-crushing. Now is not the time for empathy, for normalcy, for “moving on.” Complacency is not an option for all of us, and therefore, it shouldn’t be considered an option for any of us ― especially for those who consider themselves “allies.” Now, more than ever, we need to start doing real work towards actually engaging with the racial division in this country, rather than sweeping it under the rug. The dismissal of the fears of people of color from Trump supporters is expected. But, white liberals: when you ask us to “see it from their side,” when you suggest that it was our fault for not ""listening,"" when you say it might not be ""that bad,"" you are complicit in the racism that resulted in Trump’s election. You are complicit in the dehumanization of black people and the indifference to black lives and experiences. You are complicit in the silencing and the normalizing of what’s to come. "

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) are worried about President-elect Donald Trump's desire to ""reset"" U.S.-Russia relations.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582bb42e180000f703504662.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Tuesday said he wants Senate hearings to investigate whether Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the U.S. election, casting doubts on President-elect Donald Trump’s desire to improve relations with Russia. “Assuming for a moment that we do believe that the Russian government was controlling outside organizations that hacked into our election, they should be punished,” Graham told reporters on Capitol Hill. “Putin should be punished.”U.S. officials have said the Kremlin was responsible for hacking into Democratic National Committee computers over the summer and releasing information that damaged Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign.Graham, who was defeated by Trump during the primary, urged fellow Republicans to not “let allegations against a foreign government interfering in our election process go unanswered because it may have been beneficial to our cause.”He said congressional hearings would include “Russia’s misadventure throughout the world,” including its military aggression in Eastern Europe and whether it committed war crimes in Syria.Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to cozy up to Russia. During the campaign, he called for closer relations with Russia in fighting the Islamic State and praised Putin for being a “stronger leader” than President Barack Obama.Last week, Putin was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on his election, and Trump’s transition team has said that the president-elect is “very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia.”Graham on Tuesday pledged to work with Trump, despite their disagreements, but urged fellow senators to check Trump’s power.“Clearly me and the Donald have issues, and I will do everything I can to help him because he will be commander in chief in dangerous times,” Graham said. “I worry about Russia.”“I can imagine, given Donald Trump’s view of Iran, that the Iranians may want to be up to no good one day, so this is a defining moment, I think, for the country,” Graham added. “I want a good relationship with Russia, but things have to substantially change. He is the president of the United States, and he is the leading diplomat for the country, but Congress has a role.”Graham’s friend, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), also cautioned against Trump’s steps toward Russia.“With the U.S. presidential transition underway, Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States,” McCain said in a statement on Tuesday. “We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America’s allies, and attempted to undermine America’s elections.”"

They were carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes, it said.The Observatory said districts struck included al-Shaar, al-Sukkari, al-Sakhour and Karam al-Beik.Air raids also continued in the countryside west of Aleppo from which rebels have launched assaults on government-held areas. An attack on the village of Batbo killed at least 19 people including three children, the Observatory said.Moscow has denied reports that its jets have hit Aleppo in the renewed wave of bombardment, and said it was sticking to a moratorium on air strikes in the city.Tuesday’s bombing run on eastern Aleppo appeared to mark the end of a pause inside the city declared by Russia on Oct. 18 which Syria’s military had also largely observed.The Observatory and residents said the city’s east was hit by rocket fired from jets, barrel bombs dropped from helicopters and artillery from government forces.“The helicopters won’t stop for a single moment,” Bebars Mishal, a civil defense worker in rebel-held Aleppo, told Reuters. “Right now, the bombing won’t let up.”The Civil Defence is a volunteer rescue service that operates in rebel-controlled areas of Syria, including Aleppo, the country’s largest city and commercial hub before the war.NEIGHBORHOODS BOMBEDWednesday’s bombing struck next to a children’s hospital and blood bank in the Shaar district, and near a school in the Salah al-Din district, residents and the Observatory said.Two ambulances were also destroyed, said an advocacy officer at the Syrian American Medical Society aid group, citing reports from colleagues in Aleppo.“We woke up to the bombing and until now, the warplanes and helicopters are running,” said Modar Shekho, a nurse in eastern Aleppo. “The Shaar neighborhood was burned down between yesterday and today.”A video posted by Shekho on a social networking site, which he said was taken on Wednesday, showed a building with large holes and burn marks next to a large heap of rubble and twisted metal which he said was all that remained of another structure.Ibrahim Abu al-Laith, a Civil Defence official, said there were more than 40 air strikes on the Shaar area. “Today the bombardment is very, very fierce,” he said.On Monday and early Tuesday, there were air strikes on hospitals in three rebel-held towns to the west of Aleppo, knocking them all out of service. Damascus and Moscow both deny targeting hospitals.The World Health Organization said there had been heavy attacks on five hospitals in Aleppo and Idlib provinces since Sunday, severely reducing access to health services for people in northern Syria.Syrian state television said on Tuesday the Damascus government’s air force took part in strikes against what it called terrorist strongholds in Aleppo’s Old City.Russia said it had struck Islamic State and former Nusra Front militant sites elsewhere in Syria, without mentioning Aleppo.On Tuesday evening, state-owned Ikhabariyah television reported large troop deployments along several main fronts in the Aleppo theater in preparation for a major ground offensive that it said was imminent and awaiting “zero hour” to begin.Aleppo has become the pivotal front in Syria’s 5-1/2-year war pitting President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russia, Iran and Shi’ite Muslim militias, against mostly Sunni Muslim rebels including groups backed by Turkey, the United States and Gulf monarchies.Aleppo has for years been divided between the government-held western sector and rebel-held east, which the Syrian army and its allies besieged during the summer. Its allied forces include Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iraqi Shi’ite militias."

Last week, Merkel said she could not rule out Russia interfering in Germany’s 2017 election through Internet attacks and misinformation campaigns.Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the domestic BfV intelligence agency, cited the high-profile case last year of a German-Russian girl who Russian media said was kidnapped and raped by migrants in Berlin, a claim later refuted by German authorities.“This could happen again next year and we are alarmed,” Maassen told Reuters in an interview late on Tuesday. “We have the impression that this is part of a hybrid threat that seeks to influence public opinion and decision-making processes.”He said it was important to publicly expose such campaigns. “When people realize that the information that they are getting is not true..., then the toxic lies lose their effectiveness.”There was no immediate response from the Kremlin to a written request for comment on Maassen’s remarks.France’s intelligence service has also warned of possible Russian intervention in its spring 2017 election campaign.Russian officials have denied all accusations of manipulation and interference intended to weaken the EU.U.S. intelligence officials warned in the run-up to the Nov. 8 presidential election of efforts to undermine the credibility of the vote that they believed were backed by the Russian government. Kremlin officials denied any such effort.German and other European security officials have accused Russian media in the past of launching what they call an “information war” against Germany, the EU’s pre-eminent political and economic power.Merkel’s government has maintained dialogue with Moscow but tensions have mounted over Russian actions in Ukraine and Syria, and over its alleged attempts to sway German media.Earlier this year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov irked his German counterpart by raising the case of the German-Russian girl and accused Berlin of “sweeping problems under the rug”. The Berlin public prosecutor’s office said a medical examination determined that the girl had not been raped.The case underscored the mutual suspicion that officials from both countries say extends to the highest levels of government, fueled by opposing visions for Europe and the Middle East. Those differences have led to clashes at diplomatic negotiating tables, in cyberspace and in the media.(Additional reporting by Andrew Osborn in Moscow; editing by Mark Heinrich)"

The government dismisses that allegation.“The government has accepted the request to extend the deadline for the completion of repatriation of Somali refugees, and this is essential to the closure of the Dadaab refugee complex, by six months,” Interior Minister Joseph Ole Nkaissery said.“However, the ongoing voluntary repatriation will continue uninterrupted,” he told a news conference.This week, a ministry official had told Reuters that the November deadline would be missed, although he did not give a new timetable. He also dismissed accusations from Amnesty International and others about forcible repatriations.The official said the camp was now home to about 250,000 people, while U.N. officials had put the figure at about 350,000 at the start of the year.More than half a million people lived there a few years ago.“Kenya should end its threats to close the Dadaab camps,” Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher for New York-based Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.“The U.N. refugee agency and donors should press Kenya to publicly reassure Somalia refugees they are welcome in Kenya until it safe for them to return,” he added.Somalia’s Western-backed government is battling an Islamist insurgency as it oversees a fragile reconstruction effort after decades of conflict.

88,ENTERTAINMENT,The 'Arthur' Generation Will Need To Save America,Todd Van Luling,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arthur-marc-brown_us_57e44096e4b0e28b2b5302d6,An interview with Marc Brown about the 20th anniversary of the most influential show of our time.,2016-11-16,"First Lady Laura Bush speaking at a Russian book festival in Moscow on Oct. 1, 2001.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The first lady of the United States gave Marc Brown a call after the publication of his popular 1991 children’s book, Arthur Meets the President.Barbara Bush, wife of President George H.W. Bush and creator of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, wanted to include the democracy-themed story ― which features an aardvark family going to Washington D.C. ― in the National Archives. Brown, still half-a-decade away from premiering the first episode of his animated “Arthur” television series, was happy to help. And over the next few years, the author joined Bush’s literary initiatives by attending various events and meeting families across the country.When “Arthur” the TV show, which launched in 1996, became a success during the Bill Clinton administration, the original President book became an animated segment where Arthur Read’s family met an amiable Clinton in the White House. They all shared a pizza.As the second Bush administration took power and Laura Bush revived Barbara’s literary initiative in the White House, Brown again joined the effort.Part of this experience involved taking shots of vodka in Russia with Vladimir Putin.“Laura Bush invited me to go to Russia with her and represent the country at the first children’s book festival that then Mrs. Putin was trying to replicate what Laura was doing in Washington,” Brown told The Huffington Post in a rare interview about the creation of his beloved aardvark character.“And so that was very interesting to go over there and actually have dinner with President Putin ... He made a big entrance. As I remember it, we were in the Kremlin and the entire room was covered in gold leaf. There were first ladies from all over the world and each one would give a toast. We all had to drink vodka shots after each toast and so things were getting a little fuzzy.”A representative for Laura Bush relayed the details to her for HuffPost and the former first lady apparently recalled the incident with fondness and laughter.The second Bush administration eventually ended, and the Obamas entered the White House. The animated “Arthur” series remained on PBS and continued to be as popular as ever. The show introduced a lovable Obama character, of course. “Arthur” has always been a bipartisan story for kids all over and across America ― teaching morals of love, friendship and acceptance any parent could get behind. And so the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency of the United States has created a conundrum for the show, which celebrates 20 years on the air this year.“I am terrified that this maniac could actually become a leader of this country,” Brown told HuffPost before Election Day.Over the course of 2016, Brown spent his free time drawing cartoons depicting Trump as the emperor with no clothes. In one cartoon Brown sent to HuffPost, a naked Donald wears a crown while sitting atop a gold throne.He’s on a cellphone talking to Putin and says, “Vladdy, it’s me, Donny. Got a little cash flow problem over here ...” Another depicts a traditional Christian church where the steeple’s cross has been changed to a golden “T.”“With all the work that I have done and invested with children being successful ...” said Brown, “I worry about what would happen with children.”It remains unclear whether this will be the first presidential administration during the history of “Arthur” that has no involvement with the program. HuffPost tried following up with Brown after the election, but did not get a response.Unlike the popular children’s show “Sesame Street,” which teaches basic fundamentals such as the ABCs and counting, “Arthur” is geared toward a demographic that is just starting to form opinions about the world and is searching for a way to live. Similarly, “Arthur” sets itself apart from the Disney and Nickelodeon shows that tend to favor pure (typically slapstick) comedy over substantial ideas about morality and how to be.The first lines of the now iconic theme song told young viewers, “Everyday when you’re walking down the street / Everybody that you meet / Has an original point of view.” A song from the show that became almost equally as recognizable touted the joys of having a library card. “Arthur” constantly pushed its audience to go explore and then report the cool things they found out to strangers who could soon become friends.Brown’s creation was, and still is, overtly pro-education and pro-inclusivity.Arthur and his friends are animals of all shapes and colors because Brown cared deeply about the ills of stereotyping people. “I wanted all kids to be able to relate to any of the characters,” said Brown. Just recently, while guest-teaching a class of college students at the University of Wisconsin, a student asked Brown if the character Francine is gay. “You know, I thought about it, I said, ‘Well, she could be, of course she could be,’” explained Brown. “And so they kind of liked the idea that Francine could be gay.”Despite these super-sized doses of positivity and teaching moments, “Arthur” has still found a way to resonate with restless kids. Amid the lessons, the series has referenced shows such as “South Park” and “Beavis and Butt-Head,” as well as a notable episode-long cameo from the Backstreet Boys at the height of their fame. “It was fun,” A.J. McLean of the boy band told HuffPost. “It was weird to see yourself as an aardvark.”The show knew exactly what it had to do to both win at the ratings game and achieve its goal of truly affecting children. “Collectively, what we wanted to do with the show was to use animation and television ― two very seductive mediums ― to engage kids and make them want to read,” said Brown.“That was this underlying agenda, but also, we were hoping that we could get parents and caregivers wanting to watch the show with kids so there might be conversations that we could start between them ... you [as a parent] can share your values, it’s such an opportunity.”This cross-generational appeal of the show has led some viewers to return to “Arthur” as grown-ups.Earlier this year, countless memes based on stills from the animated show notably propagated online. Fans would take a screenshot from “Arthur” and write their own dialogue and jokes for the characters.A parody of this “Arthur” meme phenomenon even found its way on the new and critically-acclaimed FX show “Atlanta.” Brown is well aware of these memes, which had fans sharing a certain image of Arthur’s fist and jokingly questioning why the animal characters would wear headphones on the sides of their heads rather than their actual ears.Arthur’s glasses also notably just float on his head without any support.“I’m really having such a good time watching Arthur and all his friends pop up on BuzzFeed all the time,” said Brown. “It’s very interesting that I’ve been able to sustain these characters through an entire generation, a little longer actually ... 40 years?” Despite its longevity, Brown actually struggled for years before his true breakthrough came with the publication of the first book in the Arthur series, Arthur’s Nose, in 1976. He briefly held a job at a television news station in Erie, Pennsylvania, where his creative ideas weren’t exactly respected. Trying to pitch something nobody had ever done before, Brown came up with an idea to turn the weather person into a weather fairy. In his vision, the weather fairy would descend into the scene via a swing and Brown himself would hide in a wishing well to help talk about the weather. “So, there was no reaction from my boss,” Brown recalled. “I was explaining how perhaps it could have a little mechanical squirrel [give the weather fairy] a magic marker to do the weather maps ... I finished and left his office and then the next day there was a little pink slip of paper in my mailbox informing me that I was no longer needed,” Brown laughed.“I think I learned early on that perhaps I needed a career where I was more self-directed.”The genesis of Arthur came right after Brown lost a teaching job and his son, Tolon, asked for a bedtime story. “I don’t know why, I sometimes think maybe I was thinking alphabetically, and aardvark popped into my head,” said Brown.This idea that just popped into his head went on to dominate Brown’s life for over four decades and continues to do so today. The prevalence of “Arthur” in his life has come at great reward, but also existential cost.“I have been frustrated by having such good fortune, to have this wonderful adventure with ‘Arthur,’” explained Brown. “I never ever expected the television show to last as long as it has and PBS shows no sign of it ending anytime soon. But as an artist, personally, I have had to put a lot of things I wanted to do on the back burner ― styles I’ve wanted to experiment with and other kinds of books I’ve wanted to write.”Brown is clearly proud that he’s gotten to call the shots for so many years and had such success doing so, but it’s also been a sacrifice. Creating a property geared toward educating children doesn’t necessarily earn critical attention from peers and adults, except as a parenting tool.But our world, now perhaps more than ever, needs more people like Brown. Luckily, he helped raise a generation that continues to share his beliefs of acceptance, curiosity and the will to do what’s right.We can all dream of becoming president, but if you can even influence the person that eventually does take over that job ― and for the better ― well that’s a pretty amazing place to start. As Brown put it ...“Kids are my boss and, you know, I really like my job.”Listen below to Chance the Rapper’s cover of the “Arthur” theme song. “Ohhhh, I love his version,” Brown said of the musician’s song. “I was just blown away, it was so powerful and beautiful and dreamy.” "

The president-elect has not committed to following any specific recommendations from advisory groups.Trump, who scored an upset victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton, made building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border a central issue of his campaign and has pledged to step up immigration enforcement against the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. He has also said he supports “extreme vetting” of Muslims entering the United States as a national security measure.Kobach told Reuters last Friday that the immigration group had discussed drafting executive orders for the president-elect’s review “so that Trump and the Department of Homeland Security hit the ground running.”To implement Trump’s call for “extreme vetting” of some Muslim immigrants, Kobach said the immigration policy group could recommend the reinstatement of a national registry of immigrants and visitors who enter the United States on visas from countries where extremist organizations are active.Kobach helped design the program, known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, while serving in Republican President George W. Bush’s Department of Justice after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda militants.Under NSEERS, people from countries deemed “higher risk” were required to undergo interrogations and fingerprinting on entering the United States. Some non-citizen male U.S. residents over the age of 16 from countries with active militant threats were required to register in person at government offices and periodically check in.NSEERS was abandoned in 2011 after it was deemed redundant by the Department of Homeland Security and criticized by civil rights groups for unfairly targeting immigrants from Muslim- majority nations.Kobach said the immigration advisers were also looking at how the Homeland Security Department could move rapidly on border wall construction without approval from Congress by reappropriating existing funds in the current budget. He acknowledged “that future fiscal years will require additional appropriations.”Congress, which is controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, could object to redirecting DHS funds designated for other purposes.HELPED DRAFT TOUGH ARIZONA LAWKobach has worked with allies across the United States on drafting laws and pursuing legal actions to crack down on illegal immigration.In 2010, he helped draft an Arizona law that required state and local officials to check the immigration status of individuals stopped by police. Parts of the law, which was fiercely opposed by Hispanic and civil rights groups, were struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011.Kobach was also the architect of a 2013 Kansas law requiring voters to provide proof-of-citizenship documents, such as birth certificates or U.S. passports, when registering for the first time. A U.S. appeals court blocked that law after challenges from civil rights groups.Kobach said in the interview he believed that illegal immigrants in some cases should be deported before a conviction if they have been charged with a violent crime. Trump said in an interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” that aired on Sunday that once he took office, he would remove immigrants with criminal records who are in the country illegally.Kobach said the immigration group had also discussed ways of overturning President Barack Obama’s 2012 executive action that has granted temporary deportation relief and work permits to more than 700,000 undocumented people or “dreamers” who came to the United States as children of illegal immigrants."

91,ENTERTAINMENT,Brett Gelman Opens Up About Cutting Ties With Adult Swim,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brett-gelman-adult-swim_us_582c8e2de4b058ce7aa86d55,"“I don’t think that down deep anybody there is a bigoted person, but I do think that there’s some major mindlessness going on.""",2016-11-16,"Brett Gelman decided to no longer work with Adult Swim after executive vice president Mike Lazzo said on Reddit that “women don’t tend to like conflict.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/582c8f93180000f503504848.jpeg?cache=xslR6IWkcn&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this week, actor Brett Gelman made news when he announced that he would no longer work with the late-night network Adult Swim.The decision, he said, came about not only as a result of the network’s overall “misogyny,” but also because of one show in particular: “Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace,” which has drawn increasingly loud criticism because of its far-right leanings and following. In a conversation with The Huffington Post, Gelman, who starred in Adult Swim programs like “Eagleheart” and “Brett Gelman’s Dinner in America,” said that his hope isn’t to “sink” Adult Swim ― which he noted has given men of color a platform and all of its creators almost complete creative freedom ― but rather to help the network come to terms with what have become glaring problems. “I don’t think that down deep anybody there is a bigoted person, but I do think that there’s some major mindlessness going on,” Gelman said. In May, when the network revealed its new lineup, many noted that 47 of the series creators were men, and zero were women. That degree of the disparity surprised Gelman, but also fell in line with murmurs he had heard beforehand.“I had heard a lot of female friends of mine, who have sensibilities that match Adult Swim, [complain] that they couldn’t even really get in the door,” he said.Much of the criticism for the lack of gender equality has fallen on the network’s executive vice president, Mike Lazzo, after BuzzFeed reported earlier this year that Lazzo had said at a 2011 meeting that women lead to conflict, not comedy.Lazzo, an influential decision-maker within the power structure of Adult Swim, did little to quell the controversy when he later clarified on Reddit that he had said “women don’t tend to like conflict, [and] comedy often comes from conflict.”It was that reaction, Gelman said, that caused the actor to sever ties with the network. “I was heartbroken over how he dealt with it,” Gelman said. “Mike’s reaction to it is what mobilized me to say, ‘I can’t. I need to take myself elsewhere.’”There is also the issue of “Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace,” the Sam Hyde–led show that has drawn criticism for both its content ― for example, Hyde wore blackface in an episode ― and its far-right audience. Of the show, Gelman said, “I’m all for free speech, and I don’t need my viewpoint to be the only viewpoint. [But] I am not for something that mobilizes propaganda.”Lazzo and other Adult Swim executives can be uncommunicative. Creatively, that can be a benefit, Gelman said: It allows creators the autonomy that has made the network beloved by so many. But with criticism growing louder, Gelman hopes that Lazzo alters his approach. “He really needs to engage with the people of his network in a much realer way, and I hope that he’s doing that,” Gelman said.Gelman said he doesn’t believe Lazzo “at his core is a bad person.” He also made clear that there are “a lot of good people working over there who really feel the same way as I do.” But that’s exactly the issue in his mind. Sometimes, being a good person isn’t enough. You have to stand up and admit something is wrong, a message that extends beyond the issues at Adult Swim.“I’ve been getting a lot of ‘I’m very proud of you.’ And that feels really good,” Gelman said. “But don’t be proud of me. Do something to make yourself proud of yourself.” Have you worked at Adult Swim? Email me at maxwell@huffingtonpost.com."
