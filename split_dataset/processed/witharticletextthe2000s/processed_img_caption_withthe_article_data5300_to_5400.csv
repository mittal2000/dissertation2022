Crews is expected to reprise his role as Hale Caesar in the fourth installment of the “Expendables” franchise.The “Sly” in the tweet is an apparent reference to Sylvester Stallone, who starred in the first three “Expendables” films and has reportedly clashed with Lerner on the creative direction of the upcoming sequel. As Jezebel noted, Crews’ tweet may allude to this clash, which sparked rumors last year that Stallone, who is represented by Venit, was considering withdrawing from the franchise and refusing to participate in “Expendables 4.” The veteran action star, however, has apparently changed his mind about the withdrawal. In December, Stallone shared a photograph on Instagram promoting the sequel.Representatives of Stallone, Lerner and Crews have not responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.Crews first accused Venit of sexual assault last year, naming the agent during an interview with “Good Morning America.” Crews alleged that he was at a Hollywood party with his wife in 2016 when Venit suddenly grabbed his crotch.“I stick my hand out,” Crews said, “and he literally takes his hand and puts it, squeezes my genitals. And I jump back like, ‘Hey, hey!’ … I go, ‘Dude, what are you doing?’”“I have never felt more emasculated. More objectified. I was horrified,” he added.WME suspended Venit without pay for a month following Crews’ allegation. The agent has since returned to his job.Reacting to the news of Venit’s reinstatement, Crews tweeted in late November that “someone got a pass.” About a week later, Crews filed a lawsuit against Venit and WME for assault, battery and gender violence."
1,POLITICS,The Fed Took On Wells Fargo. What About Everyone Else?,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/janet-yellen-banks-trust_us_5a78c467e4b00f94fe9408a1,Janet Yellen's parting shot won't kill the greed.,2018-02-06,Departing Fed Chair Janet Yellen has ordered Wells Fargo to replace four of its board members.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a78c79d1d00003b6b6addd0.jpeg?cache=TKKtnTnxJU&ops=crop_34_149_2966_1457%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In the decade or so since the onset of the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase has racked up 52 fines and settlements with various agencies of the federal government, totaling $28.8 billion.It’s an impressive array of infractions: bribing Chinese government officials; violating economic sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan; being complicit in the Bernie Madoff investment scandal; rigging interest rates; manipulating energy markets; alternately ripping off and bribing local governments; retaliating against a whistleblower; deceiving regulators about trading data; and creating a litany of mortgage abuses and related scams involving the sale of bad mortgages to investors. The complete list, compiled by the Good Jobs First nonprofit, includes employment discrimination, accounting violations and unpaid wages, among other abuses large and small.JPMorgan, which declined to comment for this article, is hardly unique. For many years now, the United States government has treated corporate fraud and abuse as a line-item cost on a balance sheet, not a matter of public trust and accountability. Which is why Janet Yellen’s final action as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve was so surprising. Late Friday, the Fed ordered Wells Fargo to replace four members of its board and barred the bank from further growth “until it sufficiently improves its governance and controls.” The decision is rightly being interpreted as a milestone in the central bank’s regulatory oversight of the financial system, a belated government censure for a scandal in which Wells Fargo created millions of bogus accounts for customers over the course of several years.The Fed could, of course, go further. It has the power to ban individuals from the banking industry for life ― a penalty routinely deployed against tellers who pocket $20 bills from the register. It didn’t invoke that authority or name any specific directors in its order. And if the central bank wants to be consistent about its oversight of big bank abuse, there is no reason to exempt other serial offenders from the crackdown. Wells Fargo’s account scandal is unique, but JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America each have a long, long list of federal fines and settlements to their names in the years since the crash.But Yellen’s parting shot against Wells Fargo is a significant departure for an institution that simply has not taken serious action against the leaders of rogue banks in the past. As a regulatory agency, the Fed has been just as likely to help big banks wriggle out of rules policing excessive risk as it has been to write them. Yellen was planting a flag. If you can’t police your bank, you shouldn’t be on its board.Over the past year, the parade of outrages has obscured deeper uncomfortable truths about the pervasiveness of corruption ― legal or otherwise ― in American government. President Donald Trump and his family appear to be openly profiting from his presidency. But this is a cartoon version of recent political history, not a radical break with it. Throughout the financial crisis and its aftermath, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner repeatedly railed against what he called “Old Testament justice” as a response to the breakdown on Wall Street (he used variants of the phrase no less than 18 times in his memoir). People who wanted to see bankers held personally accountable for their role in the 2008 collapse ― a calamity fueled by stupidity, carelessness and criminal behavior ― were no more than bloodthirsty rubes, he argued. Clawing back bonuses, firing directors or jailing executives for fraud was no different than putting heads on pikes in response to a bad harvest. It wouldn’t fix a broken system or help people get back to work. Geithner’s perspective was shared by Attorney General Eric Holder, who told Congress that prosecuting top bankers for crimes ― however blatant ― would harm the financial system. Geithner managed to revive bank liquidity and get a lot of regulations written. But he didn’t actually fix anything. By allowing big banks to function as ongoing engines of fraud amid high unemployment, stagnant wages and the annihilation of middle-class housing wealth (which had profound implications for black families), he and the Obama administration fed twin political and economic problems. Big banks have continued to behave badly. Yellen wouldn’t have had to punish Wells Fargo if it hadn’t been creating so many fake accounts post-crisis. More important, the anger at Geithner’s governing philosophy fueled enthusiasm for outsider political candidates, many who held hateful ideologies and authoritarian impulses. When democracy doesn’t seem to work, people embrace alternatives. Trump has made a mockery out of corporate accountability during his time in office. He named a foreclosure fraud kingpin as his treasury secretary and picked Goldman Sachs’ bailout attorney to head the Securities and Exchange Commission. He killed a rule requiring retirement account managers to act in the best interests of their clients, and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, freshly installed at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has scuttled an investigation into the massive consumer data breach at Equifax.But while corruption may be bipartisan, it is neither popular nor ― as Yellen’s kiss-off to Wells Fargo shows ― inevitable. Prosperity and accountability go hand in hand. Building trust in democratic institutions isn’t all that complicated. It just takes political will."

4,ENTERTAINMENT,Jason Isbell Is One Nashville-Based Singer Unafraid To Talk Politics,Lauren Moraski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jason-isbell-not-afraid-to-get-political_us_5a78bcf6e4b018ad894edc71,Alienating his audience isn't a concern for the Grammy winner.,2018-02-06,Jason Isbell poses with his two Grammy Awards last month.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a79cbbb2d00004900943e45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You might call Jason Isbell a bit of an outlier in Nashville.The Americana roots-rocker and former Drive-By Truckers guitarist isn’t afraid to get political, a move that comes at a time when some critics have questioned Nashville-based music artists for staying quiet on politics ― whether avoiding presidential election talk or keeping mum on gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas last fall.After the Route 91 Harvest Festival shooting in October, in which a gunmen killed 58 people, Isbell tweeted, “What a truly awful thing. It simply shouldn’t be that easy to hurt that many people.”The Alabama native, who now calls Nashville home, has also spoken out against President Donald Trump on more than one occasion. “The president is ruled by fear of alienating his base. He’s ‘sticking to the music’ to try and keep racists on his side. It’s horrifying,” he tweeted after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that left one counter-protester dead last August.And during a visit to “The Daily Show” last June, Isbell opened up about the thought of having to explain Trump’s election win to his infant daughter. “If she was a couple of years older I would have to be like, ‘OK, honey, here’s what happened today, and this is why your father doesn’t really know anything about human people in this country anymore,’” he told host Trevor Noah. “Because a couple of days ago, I thought I knew them: They’re not gonna let this guy in there, because they know he’s not a good guy.”Voicing opinions on political and social issues hasn’t seemed to hurt Isbell’s career so far, even though he’s been warned otherwise.“A lot of people told me when I started getting quote-unquote ‘political’ — as if I hadn’t always been that way — that I was going to alienate some of my audience. But it really just proved to me that there are so many more people out there who are similar to me than I used to believe,” Isbell told HuffPost on the red carpet at the Grammy Awards last month. “So, that was a nice life-affirming thing. Plus, it’s helped the career. People seem to appreciate it when you’re honest with them and when you don’t pander to them.” Later that day, Isbell went on to win two Grammy Awards: best Americana album for “The Nashville Sound,” and best American roots song for “If We Were Vampires.”While accepting the honors during the Grammy Awards’ non-televised segment, Isbell took the time to address gender equality ― an area where some have criticized the Grammys for falling short.“If everyone was given an equal chance, I think the quality of the art would be better. I think the quality of our leadership would be better,” he told HuffPost ahead of his win. “I think the quality of our lives would be better if everybody got an equal chance to speak and be heard … I think all of us would be happier people if we listened to everyone’s ideas.”“People don’t get treated the same way,” Isbell added. “It’s not just the music business.”With that in mind, Isbell, who now has four Grammys to his name, is grateful for what he’s been able to achieve in his career thus far.“There’s definitely a lot of luck involved,” Isbell told HuffPost. “I know a lot of people who make really great music and other kinds of art that don’t get what they deserve. That’s for sure. We ended up at the right place at the right time.”During a sold-out show on Saturday at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, Isbell stood beside his band, The 400 Unit, looked around the room and thanked fans for their support. While he didn’t make any political statements that night, by playing a song like “White Man’s World” ― in which he confronts his own privilege ― he let the music do the talking."

Camil did not mince words, pointing to how award shows like the Screen Actors Guild Awards overlook Latino actors and actresses. “I think this ‘minority,’ quote-unquote, is the economic engine of this country, basically,” Camil told Slate. “It’s ridiculous right now … Gina Rodriguez and everybody at the show, we were outraged about the fact that SAG-AFTRA and other award shows didn’t nominate one single Latino in their shows. It is not that we want to get an award for free, like, ‘Oh, the poor Latinos, throw them a little bone. Throw them a little award just for them not to feel ignored.’ No, no, no. Fuck you. It’s not about that.”Camil pointed out that Rodriguez won a Golden Globe for her role on “Jane the Virgin” in 2015 but was not nominated by other award shows. “Do you think [Gina] should not be nominated for a SAG-AFTRA award or for a Critics’ Choice or whatever? It’s ridiculous … I mean, ‘Modern Family,’ again, for the 12th year, same nominations? Really? Can’t we move on? Can we look to the other amazing shows that are being created, like ‘One Day at a Time’ with Justina Machado?”The star also called out Hollywood and the Oscars for being righteous about inclusiveness and diversity while failing to recognize actors and actresses of color. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Oscar nominees failed to include any Latinos or Asians in all four acting categories this year.Latino actors and actresses have been nominated just 16 times in 90 years of Oscar history, and only six have won. It’s been six years since a Latino actor has even been nominated for an Oscar. Rodriguez, too, was a vocal critic of the absence of Latino actors and actresses among Oscar nominees. The titular star of “Jane the Virgin” also called out the industry on the red carpet at this year’s SAG Awards for not casting Latinos as leads.“I mean, we do make [up] 55 million plus in the country — no big deal — you should throw us in a movie or two, it would make sense,” Rodriguez said during an interview with E! News. “We do buy 1 in every 4 tickets every single weekend and make sure that your movies do well. So it would do you a service. And not only service, it would be — I don’t know — integrity.” "

That’s not quite the same thing. ... He had sex with a minor, all right. That’s not rape. To me, when you use the word rape, you’re talking about violent, throwing them down.”Tarantino added: “Throwing the word ‘rape’ around is like throwing the word ‘racist’ around. It doesn’t apply to everything that people use it for.”When radio co-host Robin Quivers said the girl didn’t want to have sex, Tarantino countered: “She wanted to have it.”Quivers pointed out that the girl had been given drugs and alcohol, but Tarantino didn’t waver.Polanski, director of “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Chinatown,” was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. He pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, but fled the country before sentencing.Quivers noted that Polanski could have avoided trouble in the first place by staying away from the 13-year-old, who really didn’t have legal standing to say yes or no. “He likes girls,” Tarantino said.Tarantino conceded that if the victim were his daughter in a similar situation, “I’d beat the hell out of him.” But the victim in the case of Polanski, he said, “was down to party with Roman.”In an unrelated development Monday, Tarantino told Deadline that having Thurman drive in a “Kill Bill” stunt that resulted in a crash that injured her neck and knees was “the biggest regret of my life.”In an earlier New York Times piece, Thurman discussed an alleged assault by Harvey Weinstein and the car incident.Reps for Tarantino didn’t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment."

Publix Super Markets Inc. tweeted the announcement early Tuesday. The Lakeland, Florida-based company, which operates 1,169 stores in seven Southern states, announced plans for the policy change one day after meeting with state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D).In a lengthy post to his Facebook and Twitter accounts, Smith said he met with Publix officials Monday to discuss reports that they were denying insurance coverage for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, to their employees. Smith, who is openly gay, said company officials confirmed they were “absolutely denying” insurance coverage for PrEP, in part because medication used “to treat a medical condition that someone might get in the future” was not covered in their existing plan.Smith said Publix agreed to “actively re-evaluate their decision” at the meeting’s conclusion. Smith’s meeting came days after The Body, a news and resource site dedicated to HIV and AIDS issues, published a Jan. 29 report claiming that a Georgia doctor had unsuccessfully tried to obtain PrEP coverage for a patient who works at a Publix supermarket. “We’ve started over 400 people on PrEP at our clinic alone, and this is the only person that we weren’t able to get PrEP for,” Dr. David Holland, who is the director of the Fulton County PrEP clinic in Atlanta, told The Body. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daily use of PrEP can reduce the risk of contracting HIV from sex by more than 90 percent. The out-of-pocket cost of the drug without insurance can reportedly be as high as $13,000 per year. "

We will not allow North Korea’s propaganda to hijack the messaging of the Olympics.”North and South Korea have begun a rare rapprochement in the lead-up to the games.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) wants to know why the U.S. Olympic Committee didn’t do more to stop disgraced former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar from years of sexually abusing athletes. In a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Gillibrand called for the Department of Justice to probe whether the U.S. Olympic Committee could have done more to stop Nassar from preying on girls and young women under the guise of medical treatment. “As of this writing, more than 150 young women and teenagers have publicly testified to the abuses they suffered at the hands of Dr. Larry Nassar,” Gillibrand wrote in the letter, dated Saturday. “These young women have demonstrated great courage by speaking out about the cruelties they have endured.”Gillibrand’s letter comes after 265 young girls and women have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them. Nassar, as USA Gymnastics team doctor, abused many top-tier and Olympic athletes, including Simone Biles and Aly Raisman. He also abused dozens of athletes as the Michigan State University team doctor. “These young women and children were failed time and again,” Gillibrand wrote. “I call upon the Department of Justice to investigate the depth of those failures and whether they violated the law.”A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Nassar on Monday was sentenced to 40 to 125 years imprisonment on three counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Last month, he was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on additional counts. He also has been sentenced to 60 years on federal child pornography charges. Many survivors have called for heads to roll at institutions that enabled Nassar to continue abusing athletes for so long. The U.S. Olympic Committee knew of Nassar’s abuse since 2015 and did little to stop it.While several U.S. Olympic Committee officials have resigned in the face of criticism, Gillibrand wrote that “resignations are not enough.” “Punishing Dr. Nassar is not enough. His crimes were facilitated by a culture of silencing victims and valuing a doctor over the vulnerable children he was supposed to heal,” Gillibrand wrote. She added: “The U.S. Olympic Committee had a moral duty to act when informed of a possible crime. Their inaction resulted in the abuse of even more young women and girls.” Nassar’s crimes also have forced resignations at USA Gymnastics and Michigan State. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon stepped down in January. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned, and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA also has begun an investigation into MSU’s handling of the Nassar case. Last week, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes from sexual abuse and regulate governing bodies of amateur sports. "

With his backup quarterback. Let that sink in.There will be many enduring moments from the Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 win in Super Bowl LII, but nothing will top Pederson going for it on fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line and having the fortitude to call a trick play with a tight end passing to his quarterback.“You really want to know what we call it?” Pederson said when asked about the trick play. “‘Philly Special.’”“Philly Special” was actually borrowed from elsewhere. It seems to have its roots at Clemson, who ran it for a two-point conversion from DeAndre Hopkins to Tajh Boyd in 2012. Quarterback Nick Foles approached the line like he was going to call an audible. There was a direct snap to running back Corey Clement, who started right and pitched to tight end Trey Burton. Burton threw to Foles for a touchdown.“We’re all sitting there on fourth down, wondering what’s going to come in, if we’re going to kick a field goal,” center Jason Kelce said. “Then we get the play in, and I can’t tell you how excited everybody in the huddle was to run that. We all felt like it was perfect.”It’s one thing to run that on a random Saturday afternoon against Georgia Tech. It’s another thing to call it on fourth down with more than 100 million people watching.“I’ll tell you what, for a coach to call that play in that situation — are you kidding me?” offensive coordinator Frank Reich said.“That’s been Doug Pederson all year. He’s stayed confident in this group of guys,” Kelce said.Pederson said he thought his team needed touchdowns, and not short field goals, to beat the Patriots. And that should be obvious to everyone. But you don’t see that line of thinking often in a league overrun by risk-averse coaches who would rather kick 19-yard field goals and avoid criticism if going for it doesn’t work out.Pederson’s devil-may-care ways at the Super Bowl didn’t surprise any of the Eagles. Pederson put his foot on the gas when the season started and never let up. The Eagles led the NFL in fourth-down conversions. After Carson Wentz went down with an injury the Eagles didn’t go in a shell; they devised aggressive game plans specifically catered for Foles. When Pederson met with the team before the Super Bowl, he had a simple message: He wasn’t going to change anything about his approach just because of the magnitude of the game or who they were facing.“He said he was going to be aggressive, that was his message pregame,” Ertz said. “He said if we were up, he was still going to be aggressive.”Pederson stayed true to that. Some analysts figured there might be a run-heavy game plan to hide Foles. Foles threw 43 times for 373 yards, and consistently threw downfield. There are only a few coaches in the NFL bold enough to go for it on fourth-and-1 at their own 45 with less than six minutes left in a regular-season game, much less a Super Bowl. Pederson went for it, Zach Ertz caught a 2-yard pass. The Eagles scored the game-winning touchdown later in the drive.“We knew coach was going to go for it,” receiver Alshon Jeffery said. “That’s what he’s been doing all year.”Pederson will get credit for going for it on the fourth downs, and coaching up Foles to throw for more than 700 yards in the NFC championship game and Super Bowl. His mastery Sunday was also in the little things that weren’t as obvious. As Ertz explained his game-winning touchdown, he said the Patriots double-teamed him on similar plays earlier in the game. This time, the Eagles sent the running back in motion away from Ertz. Once a Patriots defender went with the back in motion, Foles and Ertz knew it was man coverage and Ertz was one-on-one. Foles hit his tight end on a slant route for the score. That’s not as splashy as “Philly Special,” but it’s another example of how Pederson and his staff out-coached the Patriots.“They kept us off balance,” Belichick said.And on the other sideline, cornerback Malcolm Butler stayed on the bench for vague reasons while Butler’s backup Eric Rowe got picked on. It wasn’t Belichick’s best night, while Pederson pushed every correct button.“Our coach, Doug Pederson, should have won coach of the year,” Ertz said to a question that had nothing to do with Pederson. “He’s the best play-caller I’ve ever played with, the best coach I’ve ever played for.”After Sunday, Pederson will be mentioned alongside the NFL’s best coaches. The Super Bowl win was a long way from his four seasons at Calvary Baptist Academy from 2005-08, when he was figuring out if he really wanted to coach. It’s even a long way from the beginning of this season, when he was still a mystery and one well-known analyst opined that Pederson was “less qualified to coach a team than anyone I’ve ever seen.” On Sunday, at the end of just his second season as a head coach, his creative and aggressive game plan got the best of Belichick, who will probably go down as the greatest coach ever. Pederson brought a Super Bowl title to Philadelphia, and it seems like he’s just getting started.“I just come to work, the same person, and I don’t want to change,” Pederson said. “Hopefully we can win a couple more of these.”– – – – – – –Frank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

(John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7859921600004500139cb6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MINNEAPOLIS – Surrounded by cameras and a sudden bandwagon of well-wishers, Nick Foles tried to bulldoze his way up the U.S. Bank tunnel. He clutched the hand of his wife Tori, who herself held their daughter Lily. The world suddenly wanted a word with Nick Foles, the discarded, unheralded, former backup Eagles quarterback who had just outdueled Tom Brady to lead Philadelphia to a 41-33 Super Bowl win.It was all coming fast now, after always coming slow for the Foles family. For so long, it was just them, scraping and questioning and, in the end, believing. Believing in Nick. Believing in themselves and in their faith and in the idea that, sure, this outlandish, outrageous night out of their wildest dreams was possible.An NFL employee tried to help them through the throng by promising there’d be plenty of time to talk with the Philadelphia quarterback.“Nick Foles,” it was shouted, “is going to the MVP room.”With that, Nick and Tori shot each other a look and a smile. It’s reasonable to assume Nick Foles didn’t know there was such a thing as a Super Bowl MVP interview room, let alone that such a sentence would ever be declared. Yet there were the Foles, Nick and Tori, a mostly anonymous couple out of the University of Arizona, marching right onto turf more familiar with Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen.Two years ago Foles was ready to retire from football at age 26, frustrated with his situation, lacking in his motivation, uncertain either would ever improve.Sunday, he outdueled Brady in one of the wildest Super Bowls ever. He threw for 373 yards and three touchdowns. He added a 1-yard touchdown reception on an all-timer of a trick play. Mostly though, he played with the poise and focus that belied the fact that until franchise quarterback Carson Wentz was injured in December, Foles was nothing but a backup, a journeyman, another name in the NFL’s parade of mediocre QBs.When Wentz got hurt though, in came Foles. When the Eagles got here and found themselves in a shootout with Brady, who would chuck it for a record 505 yards and three touchdowns of his own, Foles never blinked.“The stage is never too big for him,” said tight end Zach Ertz, who caught the game-deciding touchdown pass.“I didn’t have to be Superman,” Foles said. “I have amazing teammates.”He was Superman though. And that was the thing. The Eagles didn’t win because of a superior defense and a mistake-free day by a game manager of a quarterback. Brady was slashing the defense apart. They needed someone to do the same. They needed someone to be better than Brady.So there was Foles, moving the Eagles up and down the field to the tune of 538 total yards. There was Foles, throwing brilliant passes – a 34-yard touchdown to Alshon Jeffrey, a 22-yard bullet to Corey Clement.There was Foles, leading an offense that went 10-of-16 on third down, and 2-of-2 on fourth, including a conversion on the game-winning drive. There was Foles, running a fake-audible-turned-Wildcat-reverse pass back to Foles for a touchdown.There was Foles, providing the battered and gasping defense with enough hope to know it needed to make just one play, one stop and the Super Bowl could be Philly’s. It came with 2:16 remaining, a strip sack of Brady after the Patriots hadn’t punted or turned it over all night.It wasn’t much. With Nick Foles at the helm, it was enough.And so there was Nick Foles, in the “MVP room”, waiting for a chance to speak to the media.First he took a seat next to Tori and held Lily on his lap. The baby wore a green Eagles scarf across her head and pink, noise-cancelling head phones over her ears. He pulled a silver chain out from underneath his jersey and she began played with the cross at the end of it.He was still wearing his uniform and his baseball cap said the Eagles had won the Super Bowl. Other than that, he looked as calm as ever, just a dad and his family.Which was, he said, how this all worked in the first place.“That’s what life’s about right there,” Foles said. “We’re Super Bowl champs, but time does stop when you look in your daughter’s eyes and you get to celebrate this moment. I got to look in my wife’s eyes. I get to celebrate this with her. They’ve been there. My wife’s been there through everything. My family has been through everything.“I’m just grateful.”Foles grew up in Texas and originally attended Michigan State before transferring to Arizona, in part to find playing time. There he met Tori, a volleyball player for the Wildcats. He was a third-round pick, and despite a Pro Bowl season in 2013 in Philadelphia, he was never anyone’s idea of a sure-fire star. Injuries held him to just eight games in 2014. He wound up on a bad St. Louis Rams team in 2015.That’s when he was ready to quit. Football had been fun. It was never going to be like he dreamt it though.Instead he went fishing, prayed a lot and leaned on his family. He decided to give it another shot. A year in Kansas City restored his enthusiasm, but did little for his career. Returning to Philly this year, he was second-string, an insurance policy that few thought could cash in like this.All along though, he continued to believe and make others around him believe.“He’s just the real deal,” said Dan Moore, his father-in-law. “He’s just a great person and even when he was ready to retire, I always believed he had the talent to be a star in this league, physically and mentally.”He just needed his chance. Foles credits his faith for offering calm and perspective. Maybe he wasn’t having a career like Brady. He was still in the NFL, still chasing something, still surrounded by that family of his.This game was a microcosm of his career. Little expected, except by him. Overlooked when compared to the other guy. Nothing to lean on but himself, his faith and those around him.When you’re blessed with that, Foles said, a fourth-quarter drive when trailing the vaunted Patriots is nothing.“I was really staying in the moment,” Foles said. “Just staying in the moment.”Off to the side Tori smiled and Lily sat quietly. It all seemed so normal, a pack of media asking about this pass or that play, about besting Tom Brady, about winning the Super Bowl. If the rest of the world was surprised, they didn’t appear to be.Nick Foles was in the MVP room. Of course, he was.More Super Bowl coverage from Yahoo Sports:• Eagles beat Patriots in epic Super Bowl LII• Foles’ improbable journey ends with Super Bowl MVP• Gronk on retirement: ‘I’m going to look at my future’• Black screen leaves Super Bowl viewers baffled• NFL’s catch rule factors into Eagles’ game-winning TDThis story was originally published on Yahoo Sports."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote his fellow Senators that the opioid crisis ""did not happen in a vacuum.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a78e60b2d00001f00943d0d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called Monday for the Senate to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for any role they’ve played in fueling the opioid epidemic that has spread despair in his state and across the U.S. In a letter to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), the chairman of the committee on health, education, labor and pensions, Sanders encouraged him to hold hearings on the matter just as the Senate had once compelled Big Tobacco executives to testify about the deadly hazards of smoking.“That committee had the courage to demand that the leading executives of the tobacco industry tell the American people what they knew and when they knew that tobacco was addictive … and had killed millions of people,” Sanders wrote. “Though all denied under oath believing tobacco was addictive, we now know they were lying. But the hearing eventually led to real change,” with the Food and Drug Administration regulating tobacco and the rate of smoking in the U.S. at a record low.Sanders pointed out that the hearing helped states reach massive settlements with the tobacco industry. Several local jurisdictions have already filed lawsuits against painkiller manufacturers. Some have already received settlements. The opioid crisis, Sanders, wrote, “did not happen in a vacuum.” He praised investigative journalists for exposing Big Pharma’s lies about opioid painkillers not being addictive and how small-town pharmacies were flooded with opioids.“Yet, while some of these companies have made billions each year in profits, not one of them has been held fully accountable for its role in this crisis,” Sanders wrote. “Individual states have received small settlements from companies after taking legal action, but not nearly enough to pay for the costs associated with the opioid epidemic. The states cannot do it alone.”Sanders sees an economic cost as well as a human cost to the epidemic. And he wants the industry to be liable for the economic costs. Sanders noted in his letter that he plans to introduce legislation that would in part require companies to reimburse communities for the devastating economic consequences that their painkillers have caused. In a recent hearing, Alexander focused on state efforts to combat the epidemic. And at a hearing last month, Alexander called just one witness: a reporter who had written a book on the heroin trade and its effect in Ohio. The reporter acknowledged that he had no expertise in making any policy recommendations.Alexander’s office said it plans to hold more hearings on the opioid epidemic, including one later this week. The office is in the process of considering Sanders’ letter. “More and more has come to light about pharmaceutical companies’ knowledge of the addictive properties of opioids,” says Josh Miller-Lewis, a Sanders spokesman. “With that new information, Sen. Sanders believes we must finally hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic.”"

In particular, Chen wrote that she’s been dealing with a “chronic, and at times debilitating, back condition.” But she said she turned her pain into a lesson about life. “Initially, my back pain was scary and I dealt with a lot of fear. But my only choice was to figure out a way to overcome the fear. I tried avoiding it — which didn’t work,” the teen wrote. “It was only after I embraced it that I found a breakthrough. My back condition forced me to strengthen other areas of my body, which made me more powerful overall.

Writer Nicole Chung penned a piece for The New York Times in 2016 talking about just how much Yamaguchi meant to her and to a generation of children of color. “I’m far from the only kid who fell hard for Kristi Yamaguchi, world and Olympic champion, in the early 1990s. But if you’re an Asian-American woman of a certain age, chances are Yamaguchi might also have been one of the first Asian-American women you saw being publicly celebrated,” Chung wrote. “What many Asian-American kids felt when we watched her and, later, Michelle Kwan in the limelight was more than appreciation, more than fandom.

Crooks, a 35-year-old director of international student recruitment at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, told Cosmopolitan magazine that she was inspired to run for office in part because she wants to be a voice for women who have suffered sexual harassment and because Trump has never been held accountable for allegedly kissing her without her consent in 2005.When Crooks was 22 and working in Trump Tower in New York, she said she met the real estate mogul for the first time outside an elevator in his office building. He allegedly kissed her on both cheeks and then moved to her mouth. The New York Times reported her story in October 2016 along with that of another accuser, but Trump was nevertheless elected president the following month. “I think my voice should have been heard then, and I’ll still fight for it to be heard now,” Crooks told Cosmo. “Americans are really upset with politics as usual, and I want to be a voice for them.”Trump has denied Crooks’ allegations, as well as those of the 18 other women who have accused him of sexual assault and harassment. Ohio’s Democratic Party is backing Crooks, who wants to expand access to affordable health care and to reform the state’s education system by moving money from charter schools to public schools. If she wins the Democratic primary in May, she will challenge incumbent state Rep. Bill Reineke (R) in the fall. Ohio’s 88th District swung for Trump in 2016, but favored Barack Obama in the two previous presidential elections, so Crooks is hopeful she can flip it back after a year of Trump’s “erratic and ineffective” leadership. Crooks, who said she never considered running for office before Trump’s election, told Cosmo that she has been inspired herself by the groundswell of women leading the resistance against Trump. An unprecedented number of women are running for office in 2018, motivated to challenge the president and the political system that has kept men like him in power for centuries. “Women are uniting,” Crooks said. “The momentum is now. I want to be part of it.”"

The “Good Place” star recently launched a new web series, “Momsplaining,” about her adventures in parenthood, and on the most recent episode she regaled “Scandal” actress Katie Lowes with a story about breastfeeding. “I was in Atlanta. We couldn’t call a doctor, and this was right after the baby stopped nursing,” Bell explained. “So I said to my husband, ’I really need you to suck this out. We could talk about it, we could be weird about it, or you could just go ahead and nurse.”Bell revealed that on three occasions she has suffered from mastitis, an often painful inflammation of the breast caused by a build-up of milk in the ducts that can lead to serious infection. The mother of two has taken antibiotics to treat the issue, but that was not an immediate option in Atlanta. “So what do you do … Kristen?” Lowes responded. “Oh. My. God.”“He pulled it out,” Bell continued, referring to Shepard. “He had a cup next to him. He was pulling out and spitting into this cup, and I’ve never been more in love. In my life.”Bell and Lowes also discussed the often burdensome expectations placed on new mothers, as well as the difficulties of getting babies to latch on during breastfeeding. “It is a little bit strange to go from an autonomous woman to all of a sudden being a food truck, ’cause that’s essentially what you are,” Bell said.Watch the episode of “Momsplaining” below.

But even in the #TimesUp era, the film has yet to be picked up by a distributor.",2018-02-05,"""Half the Picture"" director Amy Adrion at the Sundance Film Festival on Jan. 23. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a6a0c0b1d000027006acd0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARK CITY, UTAH ― The new documentary “Half the Picture” opens with a stirring speech from actress Jessica Chastain, in which she addresses the lack of female representation on screen at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. “This is the first time I’ve watched 20 films in 10 days,” Chastain tells a room of festival jurors and members of the press. “The one thing I really took away from this experience is how the world views women from the female characters that I saw represented. It was quite disturbing to me... I do hope that when we include more female storytellers, we will have more of the women that I recognize in my day-to-day life. Ones who are proactive, have their own agency, don’t just react to the men around them.”Chastain’s statement sets the tone for first-time feature director Amy Adrion’s film about gender bias in the entertainment industry and how it’s wreaked havoc on the careers of female directors. The doc, which has yet to secure a distribution deal following its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival last month, features interviews with some of the most successful directors and showrunners working today: Ava DuVernay, Catherine Hardwicke, Jill Soloway, Sam Taylor-Johnson, Lena Dunham, Mary Harron, Patricia Riggen and Gina Prince-Bythewood. Adrion and her mostly female production team began meeting with these women over two years ago, but they’ve watched in awe as the recent #MeToo and Time’s Up movements have brought the omnipresent power imbalance at the heart of “Half the Picture” to the fore of popular conversations. For Adrion, that imbalance has always been stark, long before reports of producer Harvey Weinstein’s egregious sexual misconduct hit headlines and prompted a flood of allegations about other powerful men.In short: Compared to their ever-flourishing (white) male counterparts, women moviemakers often face a shortage of career opportunities from the get-go, and steeper battles when it comes to producing the work that does get the green light. In 2016, only 7 percent of the directors behind 250 of the year’s highest-grossing domestic releases were women. (In television, things are a bit better: Thirty-two percent of first-time episodic directors during the 2016-17 television season were women.) From there, women directors get lower budgets on average, and their projects are played on only one-third as many movie screens as male-directed films, according to a study cited in 2016 in The Hollywood Reporter.Thankfully, people are starting to take notice of these damning statistics ― and the workplace environment that makes them possible ― courtesy of women like Adrion.“We’re lucky that the awareness about women directors and representation behind the camera has really grown,” Adrion told HuffPost during a sit-down interview in Park City, Utah. “I’m a female director and I was having trouble getting my own projects going, and I was vicariously reading all of the studies, reports and articles about the number of women directors. The statistics and information are totally discouraging.”“I knew a bunch of women directors who were successful and who I worked with,” she went on. “And I just thought, ‘Let me see if I can sit down with them and ask them how they got their first film made. How did they break through?’ So that’s where it started.”Throughout the course of her interviews, Adrion spoke with women directors who relayed painfully similar stories of “overcoming no” in their industry. For many, success in the mostly “pale and male” world, as “Thirteen” and “Twilight” director Catherine Hardwicke puts it, involves persistently seeking means of control over their own work.Jill Soloway, for example, says that prior to acquiring total control of her Amazon show “Transparent,” she was always “complaining about how the stuff I was writing was turning out.” After watching predominantly male directors bring her scripts to life on “Six Feet Under” and “United States of Tara,” Soloway concluded that the best and possibly only way to truly helm a project was to write, develop and produce it herself.Getting to that point, however, often takes time. The great Ava DuVernay was only given the rare chance to helm a $100 million studio film, the upcoming “A Wrinkle in Time,” after she fought tooth and nail to make smaller projects like “Middle of Nowhere,” “Selma” and “13th.”“I went into all of it with a[n attitude of] ‘I’m going to do it myself,’” DuVernay tells Adrion. “‘I will do it alone. I don’t need you. If you want to join in, great, but I don’t need you because this is going to happen regardless,’ was my armor in that time.”Yet even when they’re in charge, many women reported that male crew members continue to challenge their authority. In “Half the Picture,” Lena Dunham recalls how a male colleague attempted to steer control of a Bleachers music video she was directing. Today, Dunham is “doggedly committed to defending my work,” she says.And then there are the additional hurdles faced by mothers and caregivers at every point of their careers. “Me and You and Everyone We Know” director Miranda July tears up when describing to Adrion how much easier it is for her husband, fellow director Mike Mills, to go off to work.“I was a little apologetic about [asking the motherhood question] because nobody asks James Cameron what he does with his four kids when he’s making ‘Avatar 2,’” Adrion told HuffPost. “But I have two little boys and manage the whole family and career thing, and I was grateful for the time the women gave us, and their very candid answers.”Even when men and women find themselves in similar positions in the film industry, with full control of their work, the issue of pay disparity rears its ugly head. Someone like Zack Snyder can expect to make around $10 million for a big-budget superhero movie, but fellow DC/Warner Bros. director Patty Jenkins made $1 million for “Wonder Woman” ― and was only recently given a significant raise to lead the next installment.In Adrion’s film, Hardwicke talks about how she took a 57 percent pay cut to direct Warner Bros.’ “Red Riding Hood” following the immense success of “Twilight,” which earned $393 million worldwide. The studio asked her to accept a lower salary after they shrunk the production budget on the Amanda Seyfried-fronted film to $40 million from $75 million.This is why “Wayne’s World” and “Black Sheep” director Penelope Spheeris (the comedic relief of “Half the Picture”) decided to trade in her life as a director for a more stable existence as a home renovator. Spheeris said she grew tired of “taking a lot of shit when you take a lot of money” and being made to feel less-than in an industry dominated by the opposite sex.“The sexism that many women directors face is just not having their work valued,” Adrion said.For filmmakers, value is often expressed through awards. Earlier this year, Natalie Portman introduced the 2018 Golden Globe nominees for best director with a short yet powerful ad-lib that summarized how award shows under-celebrate women. Standing alongside Ron Howard to present the award, the actress confidently uttered: “And here are the all-male nominees.”“I’m definitely sensing a rising tide of courage, and we’re all feeding off each other in that way,” Adrion said. “Like the whole Natalie Portman thing about her introducing the all-male director category at the Golden Globes ― that was a very gutsy move. And a lot of the women in the audience and at home look at that and go, ‘OK, if Natalie Portman is going to put herself out in that way, what can I do in my life to be braver and stronger?’”Portman is far from the only woman putting herself on the line. Actresses from Uma Thurman to Eva Longoria have come forward to speak about sexism, sexual harassment and assault, and unequal pay in their field. This time of reckoning signals hope for the women of Hollywood, and beyond. But why, then, is a documentary so perfectly timed to this movement having trouble finding a buyer? “At this time the film is still looking for distribution,” a rep for “Half the Picture” confirmed to HuffPost Monday. Adrion’s doc not only delves into the sexist world of directing; it addresses the unfortunate culture surrounding the industry as a whole, including the male-heavy circles of film critics, sales and distribution representatives, and studio executives. Are they not interested in a film about empowering women behind the camera? Let’s hope that’s not the case. “I’m very appreciative that this conversation about women’s stories is escalating, as it should be,” Adrion said. “[I hope] our film can contribute to that conversation and make the emotional argument, as you meet all these women, for why it is important to hear and value their stories.”"

Undercover,” which helped solidify her as one of the all-time Disney Channel greats. While there’s no doubt the 21-year-old is moving on to bigger and better things, she has every intention of creating space for those coming up behind her.“I definitely want to maybe produce another show with Disney Channel, maybe develop something or create more stories that I think are powerful roles — especially for women and women of color,” Zendaya told Entertainment Weekly. “So, I think it’s important that young people see themselves on the screen and are able to relate to that.” As a producer on “K.C. Undercover,” Zendaya actually retooled her character in the development stages to have a more empowering bent.After nixing the show’s “whack” original title, “Super Awesome Katy,” she also demanded that the show feature a family of color and that her character’s talent not be singing or dancing, like the characters of past Disney starlets. “The No. 1 thing for this show all along was empowerment — especially female empowerment,” she told Entertainment Weekly. “I wanted to make sure that there was a strong female character, and I think it’s cool that young women and young men can both look up and say, ‘Wow, I want to be like this girl.’ If you love something and you’re excited, there should be nothing holding you back from doing that.”Zendaya essentially live-streamed her reactions to the last episode of the series, uploading videos of herself watching the finale on social media. She also shared a heartfelt post on Instagram thanking her followers for “continuing to grow with me.”Zendaya is set to return as Michelle “MJ” Jones in the new “Spider-Man” sequel, as well as produce and star in “A White Lie” about the true story of the first black woman to attend Vassar College."

According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Arthur Jones, a Holocaust denier who has repeatedly tried ― and failed ― to attain office, is the only candidate seeking the GOP nod for the seat in the heavily Democratic 3rd Congressional District.Images on Jones’ campaign website showed him speaking at KKK and neo-Nazi events, giving the Nazi salute and shredding the flag of Israel. He called the Confederate flag the symbol of “white pride,” “white resistance” and “white counterrevolution.” Jones also told the Sun-Times that the Holocaust was “an international extortion racket.”Party leaders have disowned Jones. “The Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones,” Tim Schneider, chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, told the Sun-Times. “We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District.”Jones mocked the party’s attempts to stop him. “Well, it’s absolutely the best opportunity in my entire political career,” he told the Chicago Tribune. “Every time I’ve run it’s been against a Republican who follows this politically correct nonsense. This time they screwed up.”The primary is March 20. Jones is the second candidate that the state GOP has tried to distance itself from in recent days. State Rep. Jeanne Ives, who is running in the primary for governor, was blasted by the party for a campaign ad that mocked transgender people and feminists, among others. Schneider called on her to “pull down the ad and immediately apologize.” Clarification: Language in this story and headline has been amended to clarify that the Republican Party has not endorsed Jones’ bid."

Tom Carper (D-Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement late Saturday. “I often say that when you think you’re right, when you know you’re right, you should never give up,” he added. “When it comes to insulating our towns and cities from climate change, or protecting our children from toxic pollutants and chemicals, there should be no compromise.”No Republican publicly opposed Hartnett-White. But it’s not surprising that her history of taking extreme stances to defend polluters gave lawmakers some pause.She previously railed against her own party for failing to campaign on the idea that the United States has “almost no real environmental problems.” “What you never hear and regrettably not even from our side is there is no environmental crisis,” she said in 2011 at an Americans for Prosperity conference titled, “The EPA’s Job Crushing Regulatory Assault.”She has made the claim that “people do not die from particulate matter levels,” despite World Health Organization estimates that some 3 million people worldwide die per year from particles in the air.Harnett-White also credited coal with abolishing slavery, claiming “fossil fuels dissolved the economic justification for slavery,” and attacked the EPA’s rules to limit mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants.For GOP lawmakers like Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who have fought to clean up mercury contamination, that could raise concerns.“Kathleen Hartnett-White is a conspiracy theorist and anti-science extremist who would threaten public health as the White House’s top environmental advisor,” Sara Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. “This is a victory for science, and Trump would do well to listen to our voices and nominate someone who will put communities, not polluters, first.” The failure of her nomination marks a small upset for the Trump administration’s environmental agenda. The president has already moved to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate accord, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has shredded rules to curb industrial pollution, and the White House has proposed a new offshore drilling plan that would open up huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans to oil exploration."
30,SPORTS,"After An NFL Season Defined By Black Protest, The Super Bowl Sticks To Sports",Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nfl-super-bowl-protests_us_5a762325e4b0905433b4b1be,"Agitation is taking a knee, and the league couldn't be happier.",2018-02-04,Totally apolitical sheriff's deputies stick to sports Tuesday on Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7627d72d00004900943a77.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is a virtual certainty that when players from the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots line up on opposite sides of the field ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, Minnesota, none of them will kneel, raise a fist or protest in any other fashion.This is, in part, a product of circumstance: No Patriots player protested all season, and none of the teams that still had protesting players at the end of the NFL’s regular season managed to make the playoffs. It is, in another version of events, a sign of a victory won by the players on behalf of the issues of racial justice and oppression their protests had sought to highlight: The Eagles’ Malcolm Jenkins, who for much of the 2017 season raised his fist during the playing of the national anthem, agreed to halt his protests after striking a controversial deal with the NFL whereby the league will pour millions of dollars into various social and racial justice-oriented campaigns.And yet, the protests that started with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 will be notably missing from football’s main event, another entry in the history of black athletes’ protest and the freighted absences it creates.This was, as HuffPost columnist Jamil Smith wrote this week, the “blackest year in NFL history” ― a season defined by Kaepernick’s lack of a contract and claims that he had been blackballed. A season defined by the continuation of the protests he began and by President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on the “son of a bitch” players who spoke out against America’s racism and his own. A season defined by the NFL’s doddering responses that, at every turn, were geared more toward stopping the protests by any means necessary to appease the anxious white members of its audience than understanding the protests’ purpose or their significance.This was the season the underlying dynamic of the sport, and of professional sports in general, was laid bare: Black men make up some three-quarters of the participants in a league that exploits their labor for the entertainment of largely white fans and the enrichment of mostly white owners. Which is why, when a black athlete removes himself from the normal proceedings of American sports, or when he is removed by force or by silent decree, a charged space forms. Kaepernick, Craig Hodges, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the Wyoming Black 14 — the story of black agitation in sports is the story of profound absences.And so, at Super Bowl LII, notwithstanding Monday night’s Black Lives Matter protest in St. Paul, the NFL’s blackest year will end with the absence of agitation itself.The last time Minneapolis hosted a Super Bowl, in 1992, a series of protests against the Washington Redskins, who won that game, touched off the modern version of the movement against the team’s racist name. A lawsuit against the team’s trademark protections followed later that year; only this past fall did a second version of that suit fall at the hands of the Supreme Court. The NFL and Washington’s owner have remained intransigent in the face of continued opposition to that name. The league has argued for more than two decades now that “Redskins” is not a “dictionary-defined racial slur,” as Native American groups say, but a symbol of “honor” and “respect” — waving away any suggestion that the stereotyping of Native Americans might exacerbate the inequalities and disparities they face in a country that for centuries has tried to eradicate them. Perhaps, as Jenkins argued after his splintered Players Coalition reached its deal with the NFL, the league will be more forthcoming and less cynical in its efforts to help its black players address the problems they and their communities still face.But there are reasons to share in the skepticism felt by players like 49ers safety Eric Reid, one of the first to join Kaepernick’s protest. Reid split with Jenkins and the Players Coalition over what he saw as a deal meant only to put a stop to the protests.The NFL’s brass has long seen its league as separate from America’s problems, a bastion of unity that stands above the political and social issues that divide and define us. Last year, ahead of Super Bowl LI in Houston ― home to millions of Latino immigrants and more refugees than any other city in our country ― reporters peppered NFL commissioner Roger Goodell with questions about Trump’s attempts to ban refugees from certain majority-Muslim countries. They asked about his plans to build a wall along the Mexican border. Goodell demurred, pointing back to the ideals of unity, pretending that the NFL is an inherently apolitical institution.This is a lie, of course. The NFL owes its existence as a multibillion-dollar corporation to politics and political activism, and it is plenty willing to engage in the sort of politics that boost its bottom line: It stymies concussion research; it zealously pursues taxpayer funding for stadium construction; it lobbies for beneficial tax and antitrust treatment in Congress. And it continuously wraps itself in Americana, patriotism and militarism to pander to the white folks it sees as its primary fan base. But these are the politics of self-preservation and self-enrichment, and they work best when paired with a furious backlash against any effort to change the status quo. The messages of the protesting players are distorted as somehow offensive to the military, or as a form of “reverse racism.” Athletes and sports commentators are ordered to “stick to sports.” Trump has harnessed the white backlash to the protests. Now others are, too: This week, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) issued a proclamation calling on the state’s residents to stand during the anthem before the Super Bowl. NFL owners ― many of whom financially supported Trump ― were eager adopters of the argument that the protests from Kaepernick, Jenkins and dozens of other players had turned off white fans. And so under the guise of Goodell’s oft-stated mantra of protecting “the shield” — a metonym alluding to the league’s heraldic symbol — they sought to end the protests in an effort to keep the show going and the dollars flowing. So even if the league is genuine in its efforts to partner with the Players Coalition, it is surely thrilled that the demonstrations won’t continue Sunday night, that nothing will distract fans, or sponsors, or media, or anyone else from the spectacle at hand."
31,POLITICS,Paul Ryan: Secretary Getting $1.50 More A Week Shows Effect Of GOP Tax Cuts,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-tax-cut-weekly-pay-bump_us_5a76151de4b06ee97af318e8,Not exactly a winning sales pitch.,2018-02-03,House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) touted the extra $1.50 a week that a secretary would be getting thanks to the tax cut.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7616791600004500139aea.jpeg?cache=BUZInc2XGh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) really wants you to know how great the Republican tax cuts are. Worried that the partisan Nunes memo released Friday will undermine the FBI’s ability to do its job? Ryan is happy to remind you, ”The tax cuts are working.”On Saturday, Ryan outdid himself again with a tweet bragging about the extra $1.50 a week that a Pennsylvania secretary is making thanks to the GOP legislation.“A secretary at a public high school in Lancaster, PA, said she was pleasantly surprised her pay went up $1.50 a week ... she said [that] will more than cover her Costco membership for the year,” Ryan tweeted on Saturday. The tweet refers to an anecdote about the secretary, Julia Ketchum, in an Associated Press article.A dollar and 50 cents a week amounts to $78 a year. Although every little bit counts for Americans living paycheck to paycheck, an extra $78 a year is a very small amount of money by any standard.The tweet predictably drew mockery, and Ryan deleted it Saturday afternoon.To be fair, the $1.50 figure likely reflects Ketchum’s reduced tax withholding in her paycheck due to lower tax rates. As a result of increases in deductions, including a doubling of the standard deduction, she may also get more money back after filing her 2018 taxes next spring.Ketchum’s experience nonetheless exemplifies a fundamental truth about the tax bill: The gains it provides ordinary people pale in comparison to the boost it gives the super-wealthy. Middle-class households will, on average, see a $930 increase ― or 1.6 percent boost ― in after-tax income thanks to the GOP tax cut, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.By contrast, the top 1 percent of earners ― households making more than $730,000 ― stand to get a 3.4 percent bump, or about $51,000, the Tax Policy Center estimates.And the TPC projects that the top 0.1 percent of earners, who make $3.4 million a year or more, are due for an extra 2.7 percent, or $193,000.Notably, other policies more targeted at lower- and middle-income Americans have been shown to provide significant increases in Americans’ hourly take-home pay, as opposed to the boost Ketchum is seeing in her weekly check.Raising the federal minimum wage from its current level of $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour by 2024 would raise pay for almost one-third of American workers, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank. The average full-time worker affected by the increase would get a $3,500 raise once the $15 minimum is phased in, the EPI estimates.Another key avenue for workers seeking higher wages that grow in tandem with their employers’ profits are labor unions. In 2017, the median pay of a unionized worker was 25.6 percent higher than the median pay of a non-union worker, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Yet Ryan and his Republican allies are deeply opposed to increasing the minimum wage or making it easier for labor unions to organize. For example, Ryan supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s (R) successful 2011 bid to strip Wisconsin’s public sector workers of their collective bargaining rights."
32,ENTERTAINMENT,Uma Thurman Says Harvey Weinstein Assaulted Her,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uma-thurman-harvey-weinstein-assault_us_5a75dc34e4b06ee97af30672,The actress detailed the alleged abuse in an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.,2018-02-03,Uma Thurman is speaking out about sexual assault she has experienced in the film industry.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a75e0301d000027006adaf0.jpeg?cache=vT4qRg6ZAp&ops=crop_0_241_2848_2204%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Uma Thurman is speaking out about Harvey Weinstein.In an article by New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd, the actress describes a series of abuses at the hands of Hollywood men, including the now-notorious film producer.In the piece, Thurman expresses her complex feelings about what happened and wrestles with feeling guilty over other women who were assaulted after her.“I am one of the reasons that a young girl would walk into his room alone, the way I did,” she said. “Quentin used Harvey as the executive producer of ‘Kill Bill,’ a movie that symbolizes female empowerment. And all these lambs walked into slaughter because they were convinced nobody rises to such a position who would do something illegal to you, but they do.”Thurman described an incident after the release of “Pulp Fiction,” when she said Weinstein donned a bathrobe during a meeting in a Paris hotel room and got her to follow him into a steam room, at which point she left. At the time, she wrote it off as him being “kooky.”But on another occasion shortly thereafter, she said, Weinstein physically assaulted her, pushing her down, attempting to expose himself and doing “all kinds of unpleasant things.”When Thurman later tried to confront Weinstein, he allegedly threatened to ruin her career as an actress, her friend, Ilona Herman, told the Times.In a statement sent to HuffPost, a Weinstein spokeswoman characterized what happened in the Paris hotel room as “an awkward pass” made by Weinstein after “misreading [Thurman’s] signals.” Weinstein apologized for the incident and “deeply regrets” it, according to the spokeswoman.The statement also maintains that Weinstein never assaulted Thurman.“Her claims about being physically assaulted are untrue,” the statement reads “And this is the first time we have heard those details.”The statement included several photos of Thurman and Weinstein at events, which the spokeswoman purports demonstrate the pair had a “strong relationship.” Through the spokeswoman, Weinstein also denied that he had ever threatened Thurman’s career.“Throughout the years, Ms. Thurman was a close friend and one of Mr. Weinstein’s favorite actresses to work with,” the spokeswoman said.In the Times article, Thurman also discussed being coerced into sex at age 16 by an unnamed actor, as well as an abuse of power by director Quentin Tarantino.Thurman told Dowd that on the set of “Kill Bill,” Tarantino pressured her into doing her own stunt driving in a situation where she felt unsafe. The incident ended in a crash, which left her with a “permanently damaged neck” and “screwed-up knees.”Despite all that had happened previously with Weinstein, it was the crash that truly left her feeling powerless in the industry.“I had been through so many rings of fire by that point,” she said. “I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to me and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?”Tarantino’s representatives did not immediately reply to a request for comment from HuffPost.Thurman first spoke about Weinstein, and the Me Too movement in general, back in November.“I don’t have a tidy soundbite for you,” she told Access Hollywood when asked about Weinstein, in a video that can be seen above. She added, “I’ve been waiting to feel less angry. And when I’m ready, I’ll say what I have to say.”The clip, in which Thurman’s slow, ultra-controlled demeanor made her sound like she was fighting to rein in her rage, went viral.Weeks later, she posted a foreboding message on Instagram, writing, “I feel it’s important to take your time, be fair, be exact, so... Happy Thanksgiving Everyone! (Except you Harvey, and all your wicked conspirators ― I’m glad it’s going slowly ― you don’t deserve a bullet) ― stay tuned.”This post has been updated with comment from a Weinstein spokeswoman."

The documents lend weight to what female lawmakers have decried as a “pervasive” culture of misogyny and sexual impropriety in the state Capitol.The cases listed in the heavily redacted records describe incidents where disciplinary action was taken or warnings were delivered to elected officials or their employees on the basis of well-founded allegations.The 2013 allegation against Allen, a state assemblyman from Huntington Beach, involved one female staff member who said he seemed to “make a practice of being unnecessarily close to her.” She said that during a briefing, as they were sitting next to each other, he “slid his foot over so that it was touching hers.” Another woman in Allen’s office allegedly told the staff member that he held onto and “petted” her hand after shaking it.According to the records, Jon Waldie, then-chief administrator of the State Assembly, told Allen that two women had filed complaints against him and reminded him “to be very conscious of his conduct.” Allen reportedly responded that he “could not recall a time when he might have been too familiar with staff,” but suggested that two women had been “overly friendly” with him during an event.Allen’s office did not respond to requests for comment.The records detail sexual harassment complaints against three other current lawmakers ― Assemblywoman Autumn Burke (D-Marina Del Rey), Sen. Tony Mendoza (D-Calif.) and Sen. Bob Hertzberg (D-Calif.).They also note investigations into misconduct by several now-former assembly members, chiefs of staff and other high-ranking legislative employees. Former Assemblyman Raul Bocanegra (D-Pacoima), who resigned last year amid allegations of harassment by multiple women, was among those named.Mendoza is currently on paid leave-of-absence amid an investigation into accusations that he sexually harassed young women working in his office. But the documents do not appear to show that any of the current lawmakers were formally disciplined.The release comes months after media outlets first requested access to the records, according to The Associated Press, and in the wake of a public letter from nearly 150 female legislators and political consultants on abuses in the Capitol.“Men have groped and touched us without our consent, made inappropriate comments about our bodies and our abilities. Men have made promises, or threats, about our jobs in exchange for our compliance, or our silence. They have leveraged their power and positions to treat us however they would like,” the letter said.“Why didn’t we speak up?” it added. “Sometimes out of fear. Sometimes out of shame. Often these men held our professional fates in their hands. We’re done with this.”"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a60ddc61e00003d005adb70.jpeg?cache=aNgmCWnMqQ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“This is a movie about a woman who’s driven mad by the culture she finds herself in, who isn’t heard, who is starving and who wakes up to it. What could be more current?”Maggie Gyllenhaal is talking about “The Kindergarten Teacher,” in which she plays ― wouldn’t you know it ― a kindergarten teacher who floats through her days numbed by a lack of artistic fulfillment and her quotidian family routines. The film premiered at Sundance last week, part of a particularly female-driven lineup that was underscored by the Time’s Up movement’s presence throughout the festival. Conversations concern #MeToo and women’s rights reverberated across Park City, Utah, on screen and off.Though “The Kindergarten Teacher,” directed and written by Sara Colangelo, does not deal with sexual misconduct, Gyllenhaal was quick to fasten the movie to the broader reckoning that women, in Hollywood and beyond, have launched following studio mogul Harvey Weinstein’s fall from grace. Like her character in the film, these women refuse to glide by, silencing themselves to placate the world at large. And yet Gyllenhaal was just as quick to express hesitancy about becoming a mouthpiece asked to produce topical sound bites that the internet can pick apart. As more men are accused of harassment and assault, and as the cultural conversation becomes louder and more intricate, Gyllenhaal seems to have turned a cautious eye toward the pithy discourse demanded of famous women probed about sensitive subjects. “I have come to feel, over the past week — well, over the past few months — I’ve come to be really clear about the fact that this is the very beginning of something, and I am really in the process of processing it, of thinking about it,” she told HuffPost.“I’ve had incredibly interesting, private conversations with my friends and with my colleagues. Obviously this is an issue that is very important to me. But my thinking about it and my thoughts about it are very complicated and nuanced, and I don’t think that, in this moment, a 20-minute interview, and maybe in particular a red carpet, for me, is the place to have the conversation.”Even if she’s a politically minded celebrity whose Twitter presence largely espouses liberal stances on health care, immigration and gun control, Gyllenhaal thinks veering into discussions about sexual misconduct during an interview, ostensibly meant to promote her latest artistic endeavor, can be a “detour.”And it’s not hard to buy what she’s saying when quotes are so frequently decontextualized to fit a headline or misappropriated to stoke social media outrage.Reflecting on her platform at Hollywood’s current crossroads, Gyllenhaal pointed to a theme that connects her work: characters “driven crazy by the insanity of the culture,” who awaken with a jolt prompted by some external force touching their lives. She cited “Secretary,” “Sherrybaby,” “Crazy Heart,” “The Honorable Woman” and “The Deuce” as examples of the archetype. In “The Kindergarten Teacher,” that external force is one of her 5-year-old students. She believes him to be a poetry prodigy, and her desire to help him realize his talents borders on the obsessive, perhaps even the predatory. She turns him into an art project.“Here, in this post-Trump world, you meet a woman like that, and she has all that need and all of that hunger, but the things she grabs on to — the roads she takes to wake up — are really confused and really wrong,” Gyllenhaal said. The night before I met Gyllenhaal, she’d declined to answer Marie Claire’s questions about James Franco, her costar from “The Deuce,” whom five women have accused of harassment. Celebrities being asked to comment on their costars’ alleged transgressions is a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t scenario, especially as #MeToo becomes more of a national talking point.“Now, the nuances, the gray areas, the complications are things that I am literally thinking about and talking about all the time,” she told me. “It’s on all of my most interesting friends’ minds all the time. I’m sure it’s the same for you. But it’s going to take more time for me, more thinking for me, more reading, more considering. I don’t know that a short interview is ever going to be the place to have the conversation, for me.”Instead, Gyllenhaal sees this moment as an opportunity to commend advocates of the Time’s Up legal defense fund. She wasn’t one of the organization’s founding members, but having been at the Golden Globes when most attendees dressed in black to express solidarity, Gyllenhaal applauded the power of a female-driven union. “Actresses who are often in contact only when they’re being pitted against each other [are] coming together,” she said. “There are other things I can say, like a woman should decide whether or not she wants to have a child,” Gyllenhaal continued. “That’s really easy for me. I can say, ‘I support Planned Parenthood.’ I can say many, many things like that — it’s not that I don’t want to mix politics with myself as a public figure or myself as an artist. But I also really do feel like this movie that I made is a poetic expression of some of my politics about [this movement]. It speaks better for me than I can speak right now in an interview with you. And that’s a gift. To be able to say that about the work you have, what a gift.”Bonus: Here’s a snippet of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Martha Wainright performing The Magnetic Fields’ “Papa Was a Rodeo” at a Sundance party."

Conversations concern #MeToo and women’s rights reverberated across Park City, Utah, on screen and off.Though “The Kindergarten Teacher,” directed and written by Sara Colangelo, does not deal with sexual misconduct, Gyllenhaal was quick to fasten the movie to the broader reckoning that women, in Hollywood and beyond, have launched following studio mogul Harvey Weinstein’s fall from grace. Like her character in the film, these women refuse to glide by, silencing themselves to placate the world at large. And yet Gyllenhaal was just as quick to express hesitancy about becoming a mouthpiece asked to produce topical sound bites that the internet can pick apart. As more men are accused of harassment and assault, and as the cultural conversation becomes louder and more intricate, Gyllenhaal seems to have turned a cautious eye toward the pithy discourse demanded of famous women probed about sensitive subjects. “I have come to feel, over the past week — well, over the past few months — I’ve come to be really clear about the fact that this is the very beginning of something, and I am really in the process of processing it, of thinking about it,” she told HuffPost.“I’ve had incredibly interesting, private conversations with my friends and with my colleagues. Obviously this is an issue that is very important to me. But my thinking about it and my thoughts about it are very complicated and nuanced, and I don’t think that, in this moment, a 20-minute interview, and maybe in particular a red carpet, for me, is the place to have the conversation.”Even if she’s a politically minded celebrity whose Twitter presence largely espouses liberal stances on health care, immigration and gun control, Gyllenhaal thinks veering into discussions about sexual misconduct during an interview, ostensibly meant to promote her latest artistic endeavor, can be a “detour.”And it’s not hard to buy what she’s saying when quotes are so frequently decontextualized to fit a headline or misappropriated to stoke social media outrage.Reflecting on her platform at Hollywood’s current crossroads, Gyllenhaal pointed to a theme that connects her work: characters “driven crazy by the insanity of the culture,” who awaken with a jolt prompted by some external force touching their lives. She cited “Secretary,” “Sherrybaby,” “Crazy Heart,” “The Honorable Woman” and “The Deuce” as examples of the archetype. In “The Kindergarten Teacher,” that external force is one of her 5-year-old students. She believes him to be a poetry prodigy, and her desire to help him realize his talents borders on the obsessive, perhaps even the predatory. She turns him into an art project.“Here, in this post-Trump world, you meet a woman like that, and she has all that need and all of that hunger, but the things she grabs on to — the roads she takes to wake up — are really confused and really wrong,” Gyllenhaal said. The night before I met Gyllenhaal, she’d declined to answer Marie Claire’s questions about James Franco, her costar from “The Deuce,” whom five women have accused of harassment. Celebrities being asked to comment on their costars’ alleged transgressions is a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don’t scenario, especially as #MeToo becomes more of a national talking point.“Now, the nuances, the gray areas, the complications are things that I am literally thinking about and talking about all the time,” she told me. “It’s on all of my most interesting friends’ minds all the time. I’m sure it’s the same for you. But it’s going to take more time for me, more thinking for me, more reading, more considering. I don’t know that a short interview is ever going to be the place to have the conversation, for me.”Instead, Gyllenhaal sees this moment as an opportunity to commend advocates of the Time’s Up legal defense fund. She wasn’t one of the organization’s founding members, but having been at the Golden Globes when most attendees dressed in black to express solidarity, Gyllenhaal applauded the power of a female-driven union. “Actresses who are often in contact only when they’re being pitted against each other [are] coming together,” she said. “There are other things I can say, like a woman should decide whether or not she wants to have a child,” Gyllenhaal continued. “That’s really easy for me. I can say, ‘I support Planned Parenthood.’ I can say many, many things like that — it’s not that I don’t want to mix politics with myself as a public figure or myself as an artist. But I also really do feel like this movie that I made is a poetic expression of some of my politics about [this movement]. It speaks better for me than I can speak right now in an interview with you. And that’s a gift. To be able to say that about the work you have, what a gift.”Bonus: Here’s a snippet of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Martha Wainright performing The Magnetic Fields’ “Papa Was a Rodeo” at a Sundance party."

The proposal, though unattainable in this political moment, outlined a clear vision for the party and offered voters a sweeping sense of what is possible. If you think the partisan divide over health care is intense, it’s even worse when it comes to climate change. Republicans are the only major political party in the developed world to question the scientific realities of manmade global warming as a platform issue. Yet Democrats, at least on a national level, remain scattered, without a strategy to deal with what they regularly call the most pressing issue of a lifetime.At no point was this more clear than on Tuesday. In the first of two back-to-back snubs, Democrats on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works spent comparatively little time grilling Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt on climate change during his first appearance before the panel since his confirmation nearly a year ago. They chose instead to focus on local pollution issues. Later that night, the official response to President Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address ignored climate change. Two others made passing mentions of it, yet only aghast Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) inveighed: “How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention climate change?”Democrats’ kids-gloves approach to climate change is baffling in 2018. Last year was the second-hottest on record. Hurricanes and wildfires devastated densely populated coastal areas and huge swaths of the West, causing a record $306 billion in damages. And a historically unpopular president spearheaded an all-out assault on climate science, instigating witch hunts and censorship in agency ranks, showering polluters with taxpayer money and vowing to withdraw from a global emissions deal signed by every other nation on Earth, even Syria and North Korea.Voters are overwhelmingly in favor of climate action. Fifty-eight percent of voters agreed that the federal government should regulate business to protect the environment and believed that efforts to do so would create jobs, according to 2016 results from American National Election Studies. Twenty percent were neutral on the question, and just 22 percent said they believed regulation would not do much to help the environment and would cost jobs. Democratic voters polled by Kaiser Family Foundation last week ranked climate change sixth among their priorities in this year’s midterm elections.The majority of Americans understand the basic science behind climate change. Sixty-nine percent know global warming is happening, and 52 percent understand humans are the main cause, according to 2016 survey data from Yale University’s Program on Climate Change Communication.Yet, on a federal level, Democrats have largely shied away from moonshot legislation that would push the climate policy debate more to the center after it has been dragged to the right over the past decade by intransigent Republicans who turned the discussion to whether to accept objective scientific findings in the first place. There have been some exceptions. In April, Sanders and Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) rolled out a bill to completely wean the United States off fossil fuels by 2050. In September, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) introduced the Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act, which proposed eliminating oil, gas and coal use by 2035, cutting all subsidies to drilling, mining and refining companies, and providing funding to workers to transition into new industries. But other legislative proposals were rife with concessions to conservatives who dismiss the severity of the crisis the bills are meant to address. In July, Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced a carbon tax bill alongside companion legislation by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and David Cicilline (D-R.I.). The bill, announced at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, proposed using part of the $2.1 trillion it projected generating in the first decade to lower corporate taxes by 6 percent. On Monday, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) reintroduced a nearly decade-old cap-and-dividend bill that would put a price on carbon, institute auctions for pollution rights and return the proceeds to Americans in the form of a rebate. Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) introduced a companion bill in the House. But the legislation excludes emissions from meat production, which makes up a growing portion of the 9 percent of U.S. greenhouse gases that come from agriculture, according to the EPA. “It’s not surprising to us that the party is making proposals that rely on market mechanisms to solve a problem that is created by the market,” said Maria Svart, national director at the Democratic Socialists for America. “We’re not thrilling with that kind of solution, but we also recognize why that’s all that’s on offer right now. Our political system is entirely corrupted by big money.” The party’s weak-kneed stance on climate change attracted scrutiny in November, when The Atlantic’s Robinson Meyer called out how “shockingly unprepared” Democrats seemed to be on the issue. The piece concluded that the party was haunted by the specter of its last grand attempt to regulate carbon pollution. In 2009, Reps. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced the American Clean Energy and Security Act. The cap-and-trade bill, widely known as Waxman-Markey, passed in the House but died in the Senate amid intense fossil fuel lobbying and a wave of right-wing Republican victories funded by the Koch brothers. In response, Vox’s David Roberts concluded that Democrats reached their “once and future consensus” with that bill. “The Waxman-Markey bill was good,” Roberts wrote. “Furthermore, if there is ever again to be consensus about a federal approach to climate change, it’s probably going to look something roughly like the Waxman-Markey bill.”Yet the dearth of audacious climate proposals could also be a symptom of the think tank industry that lawmakers have relied on since congressional research budgets shrank over the last several decades. As a result, centrist groups like Third Way and the Brookings Institution have dominated Democratic policymaking with ardent pushes for technology to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and free-market solutions. That centrist culture, preaching a strategy of cleaving off moderate Republican voters rather than exciting the left-leaning Democratic base, has generally sanitized the party’s public policy stances. “There’s a desire among Democrats to describe their positions in a way that gets 80 percent approval, unobjectionable and something people won’t criticize,” said Jeff Hauser, a veteran progressive Democratic operative. “But you’d be better off with 60-40 percent, where your 60 percent is more passionate and you’re tricking the other side into arguing it.”“That is part of the argument for why you discuss climate and the environment in a more provocative and detailed way,” he added. “That forces the conversation onto terms that get the other side to engage in an issue you ultimately win and create an actual mandate to act upon your findings.” It has limited the number of policy proposals and model bills crafted to envision generous government spending on renewable energy infrastructure. “There hasn’t been that sort of ideological work to put that on the table. Instead you end up with the carbon tax,” said Sean McElwee, a New York-based activist and political researcher. “It definitely does seem like the whole project is on hold.” In his own response to The Atlantic article, Grist’s Eric Holthaus dismissed concerns over Democrats’ lack of a national climate strategy, noting that progressive policies were starting to blossom at the state and local level. That has proved true. In July, mayors representing 148 million people and 41.8 percent of electricity use across the U.S. signed a pledge to go 100 percent renewable by 2035. Last month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to divest a $5 billion stake in fossil fuels from the city’s five pension funds and sue oil companies for damages from sea-level rise. That same week, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) proposed a $20-per-ton fee on carbon dioxide that, with a Democratic-controlled legislature, could well become the nation’s first carbon tax. State- and city-level leaders have also provided a groundswell of progressive climate policy ideas. Last summer, the New York State Legislature considered the Climate and Community Protection Act, hailed as one of the most progressive climate bills in the country because it set fair-labor standards for clean energy projects and mandated directing at least 40 percent of state energy funding to low-income communities. The bill, however, died after state Sen. Tony Avella, a Queens Democrat, declined to push Senate leaders to bring the bill to a vote. In an interview with HuffPost in October, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called for an “American Marshall Plan” for clean energy across the country, comparing the need for increased government spending to the United States’ $132 billion initiative to rebuild Western Europe after World War II. Lee Carter, the Democratic Socialist who won a surprise victory in November to the Virginia House of Delegates, made climate a key part of his platform, proposing expanding the state’s commuter rail lines and increasing public spending on renewable energy projects. “The focus of the climate movement is shifting very much to things happening on state and local levels,” said Bill McKibben, the environmentalist and 350.org founder. “There, there are very positive signs.”McKibben dismissed concerns about Democrats’ climate strategy. “We have one political party that’s wholly owned by the fossil fuel industry ― it might as well be a subsidiary,” he said. “The other one is scared at times, whatever, but I don’t think that’s the thing that’s getting in the way as much now.” One obstacle could be Democrats’ acceptance of fossil fuel donations. Exxon Mobil Corp. doled out less than 9 percent of its $2.1 million 2016 election spending to Democrats. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s main lobby, spent $748,100 on Democrats in 2016 ― at least 15 times more than any previous election year ― yet the contributions still paled before the $3.1 million Republicans received. But those donations helped secure dependable allies in Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). On Wednesday, 350.org hosted a Climate State of the Union, where Sanders became the first senator to sign the group’s new pledge to reject all fossil fuel donations. “When Democratic politicians stop taking oil money and they start realizing the oil money is just poisonous, that will be a big help,” said RL Miller, president of Climate Hawks Vote, a super PAC. “As long as they are taking money from the oil industry, it’s very hard for them to get out in front of bills that may have a negative impact on the oil industry’s bottom line.”There are some who see Democrats’ lack of a national strategy as an opportunity to embrace Republicans who have inched toward accepting climate science. He pointed to the 33 Republicans now on the House Climate Caucus, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who last year proposed a bill to “completely abolish” the EPA. “This is the first step for them. They’re grabbing the first rung on the ladder of climate leadership, and what needs to happen now is for their constituents to give them the support they need to grab the next rung,” said Steve Valk, a spokesman for the Citizens’ Climate Lobby. “It’s not as easy for Republicans to step up on climate change.”For Democrats still reeling from electoral devastation, aggressive climate action could hold the key to attracting new voters. During the 2016 election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer infamously said: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.” The quote came to symbolize the failures of the party’s strategy after Trump won nearly all those states. Yet, despite ranking low on surveys of voter priorities, climate and environmental issues poll exceptionally high among many registered voters who don’t regularly show up at the polls, especially Latinos and young people whom the Democrats could easily target. To Nathaniel Stinnett, a campaign operative who now runs the Environmental Voter Project, a group seeking to increase turnout among “environmental super voters,” this offers the possibility of a new, winning bloc. “These are the people who need a little extra nudge to get off the sidelines,” Stinnett said. “Having a candidate clearly differentiate herself or himself from the crowd and talk about an issue not a lot of people are talking about, they could drag new voters into the electorate. That’s going to be enormously important in 2018.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of rebuttals that ignored climate change. "

Haig told federal officials that he first met Paddock at a gun show in Las Vegas in August 2017, and that they met at another gun show in Phoenix in early September. Haig didn’t have the quantity of ammunition that Paddock wanted to buy, so they later met at Haig’s home. Paddock paid in cash. From a Justice Department release:According to the criminal complaint, Haig met with Paddock on more than one occasion. Paddock met Haig at his home in September of 2017 to purchase ammunition. Haig previously operated “Specialized Military Ammunition,” an Internet business selling high explosive armor piercing incendiary ammunition, armor piercing incendiary ammunition, and armor piercing ammunition.

An additional 200 such candidates are running for school boards. “The sheer number is really astonishing,” 314 Action founder Shaughnessy Naughton told HuffPost. “We’ve never seen anything like this.” This is the largest number of scientists to run for public office in modern history. If any of them win, it could dramatically multiply the number of scientists in Congress beyond Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.), the lone Ph.D. scientist, a physicist. The surge in congressional bids comes as scientists are experiencing a fierce political backlash. A year into his first term, President Donald Trump has yet to name a science adviser and has proposed dramatically slashing research budgets across federal agencies. He openly mocks the widely accepted science behind global warming and has nominated ardent climate deniers to key environmental positions. Under Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, the White House has reversed regulations to reduce greenhouse gases and put new rules in place to give control of the agency’s science advisory boards to researchers paid by industries.The so-called war on science is being waged in Congress, too. Under the leadership of Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), a virulent climate change denier and fossil fuel ally, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology has mounted repeated “witch hunts” to tarnish the credibility of scientists, leading some to call it the “House (anti)science panel.”“The attacks on science, of course, didn’t start with the Trump administration, but it has been a catalyst to getting scientists out of the lab and into running for federal office,” Naughton said. “That is one bright spot.” This weekend, 314 Action plans to announce its support for two new candidates running for the House of Representatives, bringing its total endorsements to 16. The group is backing Brian Forde, a former senior technology adviser in the Obama administration, in his bid to unseat Rep. Mimi Walters. The Orange County Republican, who has served two terms from California’s 45th Congressional District, so routinely votes against climate change legislation that she has a paltry 4 percent lifetime score on the League of Conservation Voters’ ranking. “She’s voting for herself to rise up in leadership, she’s not voting for her constituents,” Forde, who led a climate data initiative under President Barack Obama, told HuffPost by phone Friday.“I grew up in this district. This is where I won the local science fair in fifth grade. This is where I learned how to code and build a computer,” he added. “This is one of the most highly educated districts in the country.”314 Action is also endorsing Suneel Gupta, a systems architect and former executive at Mozilla and Groupon, who is running for Michigan’s 11th District seat. His campaign bills him as the “first tech candidate in the industrial Midwest.” He’s running to replace Rep. David Trott, a Republican attorney nicknamed the “foreclosure king” because he used to own one of the state’s largest “foreclosure mill” law firms. Trott, who said he would not run for reelection this year, has a 4 percent lifetime League of Conservation Voters score, and the crop of Republicans running to succeed him don’t seem poised to improve on that. At a Republican debate held last month, all six candidates answered no when asked 59 minutes in if they believed “in manmade climate change.”“This is what we’re up against,” Gupta told HuffPost, adding that he wants to bring “evidence-based policy solutions into Congress.” “We don’t have enough of that now, and we need it now more than ever.” 314 Action is working with roughly 20 other federal campaigns and plans to endorse up to 10 more candidates before the election cycle is over. The group raised $207,157 and spent $223,159 in 2016, according to data collated by the Center for Responsive Politics. But the group said it raised $2 million in 2017, and is on track to bring in $5 million to $7 million throughout this election cycle. “These are not people that envision themselves as politicians and build a résumé around that,” Naughton said. “These are people that are genuinely outraged and concerned by the direction the country is going in, especially in this administration and this Congress.” “It seems that time has really come,” she added. “I find that really encouraging.”This story was updated with 314 Action’s latest fundraising numbers.

45,ENTERTAINMENT,Inside Michael Stuhlbarg's Heartbreaking Monologue From 'Call Me By Your Name',Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-stuhlbarg-monologue-call-me-by-your-name_us_5a73799fe4b06ee97af0cc4f,"Cry with us, won't you? As Professor Perlman says, ""Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot.""",2018-02-03,"Michael Stuhlbarg, Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer in ""Call Me by Your Name.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a74c7c61d000027006ada4c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’ve heard rumblings about any particular “Call Me by Your Name” scene, it’s either Timothée Chalamet fucking a peach or The Monologue.Those familiar with the movie, or the celebrated André Aciman book on which it’s based, will understand these references. 2017 was, after all, the year fruit sex went mainstream. As much as I’d love to spend the next 1,200 words dishing about that juicy peach, we’re going to talk about The Monologue. Oh, that sweet, picture-perfect monologue. It’s the moment that clinches the film, delivered by Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg), the father of 17-year-old Elio (Chalamet), who falls for a graduate student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) during one blissful, bittersweet summer at his family’s Italian villa. Elio has just bid Oliver adieu, and Perlman consoles him with delicately chosen words that are the envy of every queer kid who ever longed to hear a parent say, “It gets better.”Director Luca Guadagnino and screenwriter James Ivory lifted the monologue almost word for word from Aciman’s text, excising only a few sentences. Even some of Aciman’s scene-setting prose finds its way into the script’s parenthetical directions, guiding the conversation as it unfolds on a couch in Perlman’s dim study. “His tone says: We don’t have to speak about it, but let’s not pretend we don’t know what I’m saying,” for example, appears in the novel and the screenplay, ensuring they mirror each other’s dulcet timbre.Stuhlbarg’s speech is best underscored by these words (punctuation and capitalization are the script’s):When you least expect it, Nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot. Just remember: I am here. Right now you may not want to feel anything. Perhaps you never wished to feel anything. And perhaps it’s not to me that you’ll want to speak about these things. But feel something you obviously did.Two sentences nixed from Aciman’s rendering: “Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we’d want to be forgotten is no better,” and “Most of us can’t help but live as though we’ve got two lives to live, one is the mockup, the other the finished version, and then there are all those versions in between.”During an interview ahead of the movie’s limited release in November ― it opened in wide release on Jan. 19, a few days before netting four Oscar nominations, including for best picture ― Stuhlbarg told me he delivered the monologue two different ways. His first take was more emotional, more impassioned; the second version, which Guadagnino “rightly” opted to use, was “a little more direct.” On paper, the speech sounds very literary ― appropriate for an academic like Perlman who studies Greek antiquities, but still difficult for any actor to deliver with an organic cadence. “You never know how a piece of text is going to live in you when you try to absorb it for all of its weight,” Stuhlbarg said. “I don’t think there was a conscious choice on my part for it to be any more or less professorial. I think the text does a lot of that for me, so maybe I was just concerned with it coming from a true place, and that he was choosing his words carefully. In another actor’s mouth, it would be different. ... I think the language speaks for itself. I tried to let it live in me over the course of the five or so weeks that we had, because we shot the movie in chronological order. [I wanted] to let it resonate with me that way I thought it could be said.”Throughout the scene, the camera remains mostly trained on Stuhlbarg. He taps a cigarette on an ashtray perched on his lap and picks up a tumbler of whiskey to cut the silence between sentences. Sometimes he peers down, as if to reflect on his own youthful memories, but he largely holds Elio’s teary-eyed gaze. “Elio is dumbstruck as he tries to take all this in,” the screenplay notes, much like the novel’s first-person narration of the same sentiment: “I couldn’t begin to take all this in. I was dumbstruck,” Elio says. “How you live your life is your business,” Perlman continues as the film’s gentle piano score kicks in. “Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now there’s sorrow. Pain. Don’t kill it and with it the joy you’ve felt.”A pause, Elio nodding as he absorbs the advice.“We may never speak about this again,” his old man concludes. “But I hope you’ll never hold it against me that we did. I will have been a terrible father if, one day, you’d want to speak to me and felt that the door was shut, or not sufficiently open.”In Stuhlbarg’s mouth, Perlman’s words are poetry ― vestiges of a weathered existence and guidance for a life not yet touched by the wisdom of adulthood. The scene reflects Guadagnino’s intentions for the film. Before the shoot began, “we all sat around his dining room table and read the screenplay together,” Stuhlbarg said. “That was all the rehearsal that some of us had. [Guadagnino] said, ‘I want this to be a story of love and light and buoyancy and fun, to be reminiscent of those idyllic summers that, if we’re lucky, we have when we’re young. Our eyes are opened, and perhaps we fall in love for the first time in a deeper way.’ That idea infected the way we told the story, and it made it such a joyous experience in a way that I never would have expected it to be.”Stuhlbarg, who appears in two other best picture contenders (“The Shape of Water” and “The Post”), didn’t receive the Oscar nomination he deserves, and “Call Me by Your Name” produced middling box-office returns in wide release despite the fawning praise it received.Regardless, his closing scene is a master class in acting and writing. It’s what sets this apart from most gay stories, where characters are judged or punished (by parents, peers, spouses, mentors, bullies) for their sexuality. Indeed, every graceful pause in The Monologue is calibrated to capture the movie’s optimism. It’s both heartbreaking and uplifting. “I love the story and was so grateful to be asked to participate in it,” Stuhlbarg said. “It does seem to be having a lot of resonance and relevance and to be moving people, which is all you can hope for, really, because you never know what’s going to happen when you make something. And in different hands it would be a different telling ― it would be a different story. I think Luca’s a master and has masterfully articulated the story he wanted to tell.”"
46,POLITICS,Minnesota Republicans Under Fire For Saying Muslims Are Infiltrating The Party,Rowaida Abdelaziz and Sam Levine,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/minnesota-republicans-muslims-caucuses_us_5a7217b9e4b05253b2752e90,"That kind of hysteria just feeds off “this anti-Muslim, white supremacist type of narrative,” CAIR said.",2018-02-02,Minnesota lawmakers Cindy Pugh (left) and Kathy Lohmer (right) shared an anti-Muslim post written by GOP official Dave Sina.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a73823b1d000027006ad81e.jpeg?cache=OLyqh8kMED&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two Minnesota Republican state lawmakers and a local GOP official are facing scrutiny after they reportedly shared a Facebook post accusing Muslims of preparing to “infiltrate” the party’s caucuses this month.State Reps. Kathy Lohmer and Cindy Pugh, shared the post created by Dave Sina, chairman of the Fourth Congressional District GOP, this week, according to the Star Tribune. Sina has since taken it down, but not before the Star Tribune captured a screenshot. In the post, Sina said a friend of his had attended a caucus training session held at a mosque by the Muslim American Society. MAS is a nonpartisan organization that promotes civic engagement among American Muslims with local chapters across the U.S. Sina claimed that Muslims are trying to “infiltrate our republican caucuses on Feb. 6” and that “they didn’t talk about the general election but I am sure they are ahead of us in that as well.”The local party chair played to a sense of hysteria that American Muslims are, and will always be, foreigners who want political influence only to harm the country.In reality, the workshop was led by Laura Johnson, the lead organizer at Isaiah, a Christian faith-based coalition in Minnesota that brings together Muslim and Christian congregants to educate their religious communities on civic engagement. HuffPost watched the hour-and-a-half long Facebook Live video of the meeting, which amounted to a tutorial on participating in the political system.Johnson focused on the nuts and bolts of caucusing and how to get chosen to be a delegate at the parties’ state conventions in June. She broke down how caucuses work and why it’s important the Muslim community get involved ― so that Minnesota politicians can hear and understand the community’s concerns.The meeting was nothing like what Sina described in his post.Lohmer and Pugh did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Sina, when reached for comment, said he may have been referring to a different video, but declined to identify it. His post has traveled widely across Facebook, including being shared by the Houston chapter of ACT for America, which has been identified as an anti-Muslim hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The comments section offers a litany of Islamophobic responses.“Please share this! If you do not want your grand children wearing a burka in 20 years you need to show up,” wrote one internet user who included the Facebook Live link.“NO MUSLIMS SHOULD EVER HOLD ANY CITY/STATE GOVERNMENT SEAT...PERIOD! Their Islamic ideology does not mesh with our American constitution & goes against American laws & western culture,” commented another.A leading Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Jeff Johnson, defended the GOP lawmakers in a conservative podcast published Wednesday. “There are some here who are trying to change what America is. And we can’t allow that,” he claimed.“The idea that American Muslims are a danger to America and are disingenuous about their role or their existence in the United States ― this is feeding off this anti-Muslim, white supremacist type of narrative,” Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the local chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told HuffPost. CAIR-Minnesota called Sina’s Facebook post “a bigoted, conspiratorial and un-American reaction” and urged the local GOP to remove him as one of its officials.Pugh has since told the Star Tribune that she doesn’t support what was in the Facebook post she shared. “I hoped to inspire Minnesotans to participate in the caucus process, in no way did I endorse what was written,” she told the paper. And Jennifer Carnahan, the chairwoman of the Minnesota GOP, has declared that Muslims are welcome to participate in the Republican caucuses.The training session that looked so fearful to Sina was nothing new. An Isaiah spokeswoman noted that her organization did over 50 trainings last month in churches and mosques. JaNaé Bates said that caucusing can be confusing and that her group tries to break the process down so that more people will feel empowered to participate. In collaboration with Isaiah, the MAS Minnesota chapter has been hosting these kinds of sessions for over 14 years. Despite being held in a mosque, the workshop at issue was open to everyone.“We want to help all citizens engage with the political process. To make a democracy vibrant, people need to engage,” Asad Zaman, an imam and executive director of MAS-Minnesota, told HuffPost.The organization said it has trained over 300 Muslim leaders to be part of the political process.“And we intend to do more,” Zaman said. “There is a particular base of Islamophobes that are particularly agitated by the idea that Muslims might acquire political influence. It is obvious from their statements that many of them would prefer [Muslims] not to have any level of political engagement in the American political process.” There are approximately 150,000 Muslims in Minnesota, including many in the Twin Cities metro area. The community’s history in the state goes back at least to the early 1900s. This year alone, a record number of Muslim Americans are running for office nationwide, from school boards to Congress. Reprimanding Sina is not enough, according to Zaman.“I want all political parties, Democrats and Republicans, to come out clearly and unequivocally, to condemn this action,” he said. “Also, I would like both political parties to institute Islamophobia training to make sure that their caucus members do not behave in this nasty way.”America does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what’s going on. Tell us your story."

Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress.Support from EMILY’s List, a fundraising powerhouse closely aligned with Democratic Party leadership, gives Newman a major boost in her effort to unseat Lipinski in the March 20 primary.“Throughout her career, Marie has worked to improve her community and advocate on behalf of children and families. Her record is unimpeachable,” Stephanie Schriock, EMILY’s List president, said in a statement that also criticized Lipinski.“He has put women’s reproductive health care in jeopardy and sought to end protections against discrimination,” Schriock said. “This is not an acceptable way to govern ― and it’s certainly not what the people of Illinois’ 3rd District deserve.”Primary challenges to incumbent Democratic members of Congress are exceedingly rare. Perhaps rarer, however, is a Democratic congressman with a history of voting for abortion restrictions. Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) is likely the only other Democratic member of Congress who flat-out opposes abortion rights.Newman already had the backing of NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Human Rights Campaign, a host of progressive groups, and Illinois Reps. Luis Gutiérrez and Jan Schakowsky (D). But EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood Action Fund had yet to jump in the race. Planned Parenthood Action Fund told HuffPost on Friday that the group hasn’t yet announced its 2018 endorsements.In addition to his abortion opposition, Lipinski has voted against a law banning discrimination against LGBT Americans in the workplace, and taken several conservative stances on immigration, including by voting against a 2010 version of the Dream Act. (Last summer, Lipinski co-sponsored a bill extending legal protection for undocumented immigrants who benefitted from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.)Illinois’ 3rd District remains favorable territory for Lipinski. It encompasses southwestern suburbs of Chicago that skew more conservative than other parts of the metropolitan area.But that may be changing. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won Lipinski’s district by 9 percentage points in the 2016 primary, and Hillary Clinton carried it by nearly double that margin in the general election. ( Lipinski backed Sanders in the primary, giving him some credibility with anti-establishment voters.)A key advantage for Lipinski thus far has been support he retains from the district’s influential labor unions. AFSCME Council 31, which represents Illinois public employees, endorses Lipinski, with spokesman Anders Lindall noting the incumbent’s 100-percent rating on the union’s 2017 congressional scorecard and 95-percent lifetime rating.But Lipinski’s union support may be weakening. The Intercept reported on Friday that SEIU plans to endorse Newman.Lipinski opposes raising the minimum wage to $15, a key priority for organized labor. Newman backs a federal $15 minimum wage."

He was found guilty on Thursday of murder and attempted murder after the jury took less than an hour to reach their verdict.“This was a terrorist attack - over the space of a month or so your mind-set became one of malevolent hatred,” said judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb, sentencing him at London’s Woolwich Crown Court. She said he would pose a risk to the public “perhaps for the rest of your life”.On June 18 last year, Osborne drove up from the Welsh capital Cardiff to central London in a hired van with the intent of attacking a pro-Palestinian march. He told the jury he had wanted to kill socialist opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London’s Muslim mayor Sadiq Khan.Thwarted by road closures, he sought out other targets, eventually arriving hours later in FinsburyPark where he came across a group of Muslims tending to Ali who had collapsed in the street near his home after attending Ramadan prayers.Shortly after midnight, he drove at them, killing Ali. He later told the court he had tried to kill as many as possible.“Our father, like the victims of most terrorism, was entirely innocent which makes his death in this violent way all the more hurtful and we cannot imagine the trauma he felt in the last few minutes,” said Ruzina Akhtar, one of Bangladeshi-born Ali’s six children.Authorities said it was the fourth deadly terrorism incident in Britain last year, following three Islamist attacks which killed 35 people.Those attacks had helped fuel the anger of Osborne, an unemployed father-of-four who had 102 criminal convictions and a history of violence, depression, drug and alcohol abuse. He had no fixed home and spent the night before the attack in a tent in his ex-partner’s back garden.After watching the BBC drama, he had sought out information on the internet, exposing him to extreme right-wing figures and racist material from Britain and the United States, the judge said. “You allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claim to be leaders,” Cheema-Grubb said."

52,POLITICS,"New York State Senate's New Sex Harassment Policy Intimidates Victims, Some Senators Say",Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-state-senate-sexual-harassment-policy_us_5a7210e4e4b03699143edf04,"The policy was drafted through a ""secretive process,"" Sen. Liz Krueger said.",2018-02-02,A new sexual harassment policy for the New York state Senate was delivered at the State Capitol on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a73866a160000200013981d.jpeg?cache=nOHJu2jqYo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a member of the New York State Senate wrestles with sexual misconduct allegations, new policy guidelines for reporting sexual harassment have some senators worried that they will discourage victims from coming forward.A four-page policy letter was given to members of the Senate staff Monday by the Republican-controlled chamber, outlining updates to its 2007 sexual harassment policy. The letter lists types of inappropriate behavior to report and promises no retaliation for those who come forward. But it also comes with a warning: Those who report a false statement against the accused will face punishment.If “the investigator determines that any employee has knowingly made false accusations or provided false statements during the investigation, he or she may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination,” the policy reads.It’s unclear how the investigator would determine if an alleged victim was lying.Senate Democratic Conference leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins is the only female leader in either chamber of the Legislature. She said she was never consulted about the updated policy.“To emphasize the punishment for filing a false report while not emphasizing the seriousness of sexual harassment is exactly the type of intimidation that has silenced so many through the years and encourages perpetrators to attack accusers,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement provided to HuffPost. “I am disappointed I was not included in the development of this policy, which is proof the Senate Leadership is not serious about combating sexual harassment.” What’s more, the new policy never states that an investigation will be handled independently. Instead, it is the Senate personnel officer who will ultimately determine the outcome. Democratic Sen. Liz Krueger said the investigations must be conducted outside the influence of the majority counsel.“How can a victim be confident that he or she received a fair investigation when the result is decided by political appointees who are inherently biased, and have already demonstrated their inability to address these issues?” Krueger said in a statement provided to HuffPost.The new policy comes just weeks after Erica Vladimer, a former staffer, accused Independent Democratic Conference leader Sen. Jeff Klein of forcibly kissing her outside a bar in 2015.During the incident, Vladimer said Klein put “a hand on the back of my head and he shoved his tongue down my throat.” Klein has denied the allegation, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo has requested an investigation into the senator’s alleged misconduct following HuffPost’s report. Klein has also requested an independent investigation take place.Vladimer said the updated sexual harassment policy doesn’t do enough to support victims.“There is no process that’s laid out,” Vladimer told HuffPost. “And the little process that is laid out is internal. There is no independent investigator, and the only power they give the investigator is to decide if the victim is lying. If you want to talk about scaring men and women who have experienced sexual harassment and assault into staying quiet, that’s how it’s going to happen.”The new policy gives the alleged victim and the accused just 15 days to appeal to Senate lawyers after a conclusion has been made, a time frame Vladimer said is “arbitrary.” By comparison, the State Assembly’s policy on sexual harassment allows appeals to be made for up to 30 days following the completion of an investigation. It’s unclear what specific Senate members drafted the new policy within the Republican majority counsel. Also unclear is why the new policy lists a date of Jan. 2 at the bottom of every page even though the policy was not officially released to Senate members until Jan. 29, 20 days after HuffPost published its article on Klein. Calls to Personnel Officer Dawn Harrington and Secretary of the Senate Frank Patience ― who are named as being involved in the policy construction ― went unreturned. But Senate Republican Leader John Flanagan’s office told NBC New York that he ordered a review of the policy months ago and sought input from female Republican lawmakers.“Given the secretive process through which this policy was amended, I can only assume that the valuable input necessary to ensure effective investigations and protect victims was not sought from critical stakeholders,” Krueger said in her statement. “I have to wonder if any victims, women’s groups, or any women at all were consulted.” "

Pacelle was the focus of a damning report compiled last month by a law firm hired by the Humane Society detailing three women’s complaints that the CEO sexually harassed them, including a former employee who said Pacelle asked to masturbate in front of her in 2006.The charity offered settlements to three additional women who were “demoted or dismissed” after speaking up about Pacelle’s behavior, the Post reported, citing a summary of the law firm’s findings. Senior women in the organization reportedly warned Pacelle that sexual relationships with subordinates, as well as with donors and volunteers, jeopardized the charity.Pacelle denied the allegations, telling the Post they were a “coordinated attempt to attack me and the organization.” No board members commented on the meeting’s outcome, according to the newspaper. One of the women whose complaint was part of the investigation expressed disappointment.“To have at our helm an individual that has abused his power is a tragedy,” said Reasa Haggard Currier. “I don’t care if I get fired for saying that.” Several donors had called for Pacelle’s ouster, and one, Greenbaum Foundation’s Jim Greenbaum, said he wouldn’t be renewing his Humane Society donation.Pacelle, meanwhile, said no donors told him they would withdraw their funding.“I’ve gotten hundreds that have said the opposite,” he said."

Their fate is unknown, but they’re close to the age when kittens typically leave their mother to strike out on their own, said a statement by the National Park Service.The death this week is the latest sign of the difficult battle for survival the big cats face in the Santa Monica and Santa Ana mountains of the Los Angeles area as housing and highways increasingly encroach on their habitat and inhibit their searches for prey and mates. Los Angeles is one of only two major cities in the world, along with Mumbai, that have big cats living within the city limits.“Mountain lions are incredible animals that have adapted to live in California’s mountains, canyons and deserts. But these big cats are no match for the network of roads, highways, and sprawl that we’ve built with little regard for their impacts on lions or wildlife connectivity,” J.P. Rose, lawyer for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Huffpost.The National Park Service has studied about 60 mountain lions in and around the Santa Monica Mountains. About 20 adult cougars are believed to live in the Santa Ana Mountains.P-23 is the 18th mountain lion to be killed in a road collision in the region since 2002. Wildlife and environmental activists have been advocating for the construction of a wildlife crossing over U.S. 101, which would allow for safe, freer access throughout the area by the big cats. The Liberty Canyon Wildlife Crossing would create a 200-foot-long, 165-foot-wide overpass bridging U.S. 101 west of Liberty Canyon Road in the city of Agoura Hills, but the mission has lagged due to a lack of funds. The California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, released an environmental assessment in September and is reviewing public comments on the project.The Center for Biological Diversity and other groups support use of state funds for the project. “The crossing is necessary to preserve wildlife connectivity in Southern California that has been disrupted by poor land use and transportation planning,” said Rose.The center last month joined with the Sierra Club and the Mountain Lion Foundation in a lawsuit against the Altair housing development approved by the city of Temecula in the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California. The suit argues that the 200-acre development and a multi-lane highway would impede the only passage left in the area for wildlife to move between coastal and inland mountains.P-23 had been a favorite of mountain lion watchers ever since she was spotted by a cyclist in 2013 astride a dead deer on Mulholland Highway in Los Angeles.P-23′s first two litters were preyed upon by mountain lions or other wildlife. Two kittens from her first litter, P-36 and P-37, were photographed in 2015 being attacked and eaten by P-27, a dominant male in the Santa Monica Mountains. The other dominant male at the time was the kittens’ father, P-12.Two kittens from P-23′s second litter were also killed by a mountain lion or other wildlife. But a third, surprise, survivor (P-53) was later discovered by researchers.Here’s a 2015 video of P-53, making the characteristic “chirping” sounds of a mountain lion kitten.P-23 was a prime example of what’s known as “first-order” inbreeding among the cougars of the area, another problem caused by territory constraints from housing developments and highways. Such inbreeding threatens the survival of the species. P-23 was the result of a mating of P-12 and his daughter. P-23 later also mated with P-12, who was both her father and grandfather, to produce P-36 and P-37. P-23′s half sibling is suspected of being the father of her latest litter.The California Department of Fish and Wildlife will conduct a necropsy of P-23."

That evening, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) brought NAKASEC’s Jung Bin Cho, who is a DACA recipient, to the event as a guest. Yu noted that Trump’s plan disproportionately targets communities of color. The plan includes steep border-security increases and an end to the diversity visa lottery program. It also calls for the end of what Trump calls “chain migration,” a term immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing immigrants to sponsor their family members to join them in the U.S. Immigration activists have long rejected the term, using “family reunification” instead. The diversity lottery primarily affects immigrants from Eastern Europe and Africa, including those from some of the areas the president reportedly called “shithole countries” in a meeting last month. And the vast majority of Asian immigrants come to the U.S. through the family-based immigration system, reports show.“This pillar in Trump’s plan makes it clear that he is trying to make America White Again by excluding non-European folks from the country,” Yu said. However, Yu believes it’s important to continue pushing for a proper solution for Dreamers. “I am absolutely confident that our communities will continue to stand strong in the face of these constant anti-immigrant, racist attacks.

That evening, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.) brought NAKASEC’s Jung Bin Cho, who is a DACA recipient, to the event as a guest. Yu noted that Trump’s plan disproportionately targets communities of color. The plan includes steep border-security increases and an end to the diversity visa lottery program. It also calls for the end of what Trump calls “chain migration,” a term immigration restrictionists use to describe allowing immigrants to sponsor their family members to join them in the U.S. Immigration activists have long rejected the term, using “family reunification” instead. The diversity lottery primarily affects immigrants from Eastern Europe and Africa, including those from some of the areas the president reportedly called “shithole countries” in a meeting last month. And the vast majority of Asian immigrants come to the U.S. through the family-based immigration system, reports show.“This pillar in Trump’s plan makes it clear that he is trying to make America White Again by excluding non-European folks from the country,” Yu said. However, Yu believes it’s important to continue pushing for a proper solution for Dreamers. “I am absolutely confident that our communities will continue to stand strong in the face of these constant anti-immigrant, racist attacks. But, it is difficult to say whether or not immigration policy will change because that is up to the lawmakers,” he told HuffPost. “I propose that lawmakers should not only listen, but also internalize the stories that undocumented youth are sharing, have already shared, and will continue sharing until a permanent solution for all their communities is reached.” "

Nine women of color told the Post that Vincent Cirrincione has made unwanted sexual advances toward women over a span of two decades. Cirrincione, who is white, represented Halle Berry as she rose to stardom and now counts Taraji P. Henson as a client.Although Berry and Cirrincione worked together for more than two decades, the actress said in a statement that her opinion of him changed after she heard a woman describe his reputation.“Over three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry’s manager was her worst casting couch experience ever. That news literally stopped me in my tracks,” she said. “I immediately confronted Vince about it, and he denied it completely. But even with his denial, something didn’t feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship.” Berry and Henson both told the Post that they had not personally experienced any sexual harassment from the manager. Henson said she hadn’t even heard negative rumors.Year after year, studies show that the entertainment industry, already extremely competitive, affords even fewer opportunities to black women than white women. Berry remains the only black winner of a lead actress Oscar. According to the Post, all nine of the women wanted Cirrincione to represent them specifically because of his skill in advancing the careers of women of color.Three of the women said Cirrincione would not represent them if they declined to sleep with him. Another said he would help her career if she had sex with him monthly, and another said he frequently masturbated in front of her during their meetings. While the manager said he pursued affairs, in a statement he specifically denied ever exchanging representation for sexual favors. “I take responsibility for my part in the situation and I am not here to diminish anyone’s feelings or experiences,” he said, referring to what he said were consensual encounters. “I apologize to these women, my past and present partner, my clients and employees for the pain this is bringing them. I was under the impression I was living my life as a supportive man to women. It is with a heavy heart that I see now I was wrong.”"

President Donald Trump on Friday approved the declassification of the memo, a three-and-a-half-page document that Trump supporters claimed shows FBI bias against the president in the probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.The memo suggests law enforcers abused their surveillance authority to spy on Trump campaign official Carter Page based on intelligence funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Much of memo’s contents were already public information.But that didn’t stop Republicans from a fresh round of hyperbole before the memo’s release. They called it “explosive” and “alarming,” and said it could shake the government to its core.“I think that this will not end just with firings. I believe there are people who will go to jail,” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) told Fox News host Sean Hannity.In a tweet, Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) called the memo “deeply troubling” and said it raised “serious questions” about the legitimacy of the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) called the memo “troubling and shocking” in an interview with Fox News. “Part of me wishes that I didn’t read it because I don’t want to believe that those kinds of things could be happening in this country that I call home and love so much,” he said.“It is so alarming the American people have to see this,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told Fox.Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said the contents of the memo sounded like something out of the old Soviet Union. “You think about, ‘Is this happening in America or is this the KGB?’ That’s how alarming it is,” he said.Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) called the disclosures “very concerning” in a tweet and said “every American has a right to see this memo immediately.”In perhaps the most dramatic statement of all, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) tweeted that the memo was “worse than Watergate.”“I have read the memo,” King wrote on Jan. 20. “The sickening reality has set in. I no longer hold out hope there is an innocent explanation for the information the public has seen. I have long said it is worse than Watergate. It was #neverTrump & #alwaysHillary. #releasethememo”"
60,POLITICS,The RNC Should Just Call Itself The Trump National Committee Now,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-national-committee_us_5a749826e4b0905433b3ce32,The party of morality and law has become the party of defending accused sexual predators and attacking law enforcement.,2018-02-02,President Donald Trump speaks at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting at his hotel on Feb. 1.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7498f02d00001f00943934.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Once the party of morality and national security, Republican leaders this week found themselves defending a casino magnate accused of coercing sexual favors and a White House attacking the FBI.Then they capped it off by putting more of their donors’ money into the president’s pocket when they held a dinner at his Washington hotel Thursday night.Welcome to the Trump National Committee’s winter agenda, say the party’s estranged members.“It’s not the Republican Party anymore. It’s the Trump Party,” said Colorado activist Kendal Unruh, who led an effort to dump then-nominee Donald Trump at the party convention in 2016. “It’s not the party that I knew, but it’s the party they have become.”Because returning cash collected under their former finance chairman Steve Wynn, the casino magnate, would spur more questions about the sexual misconduct allegations against the president himself, the money’s not going back, some Republican National Committee members acknowledged privately. Because Trump is under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, they added, the party must support the president’s attacks on the FBI and the Department of Justice.“I can’t be part of all this garbage,” said a former RNC member who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wants to remain involved in Republican politics at the state level. “The hardest thing to do in life is admit when you were wrong. That has sort of taken over. They don’t want to admit that they were totally hoodwinked by this guy.”Wynn resigned his party position a week ago. In her public statement on the matter, RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel noted that she accepted his resignation, but made no mention of the Wall Street Journal report last week detailing accusations that he had coerced sexual favors from women in his employ.The party and its candidates have not returned the $1.5 million Wynn himself donated to them in recent years, let alone the tens of millions he helped raise in his role as finance chairman. Just months earlier, however, Republicans aggressively demanded that Democrats return money donated by disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was similarly accused of sexual misconduct.Ron Kaufman, an RNC member from Massachusetts and a former top adviser to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, denied there was a double standard. “One person says I’m guilty. The other person says I’m not,” Kaufman said.Unlike Weinstein, who has vaguely acknowledged that he “caused a lot of pain,” Wynn has said he never did anything wrong. That flat-out denial mirrors Trump’s own defense against the nearly two dozen women who have accused him of everything from walking into the dressing room of a teen beauty pageant to reaching under the skirt of a woman at a bar and touching her genitals. The denial strategy was also used by GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama last year. It was cited by Trump as the reason for his continued support of Moore even after many other Republicans abandoned him following an accusation that Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s.None of that, though, has any bearing on the Wynn situation, said Vermont RNC member Deb Billado, who also chairs the state party.“I don’t think we should be passing judgment until all the facts come out. Let the accusers present their case. Returning the money is an acknowledgement of guilt,” she said, denying that the issue reflects poorly on the RNC. “I don’t think that it puts us in an awkward position at all.”“There’s a thing called due process,” added Kentucky RNC member Mike Duncan. “Steve resigning was the right thing to do. It cleared the decks for us.”RNC members were less eager to defend Trump’s attacks on the FBI and the Justice Department, which he ramped up Friday morning in a pair of statements on Twitter. Many declined to comment at all, saying they were unfamiliar with the contents of a disputed memo, written by Trump ally Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and his staff, that supporters contend discredits the criminal investigation into the Trump campaign over its contacts with Russian agents.“Everybody is entitled to their point of view,” Kaufman said, declining to offer his thoughts about the FBI but arguing that Trump’s attacks do not diminish the party. “We’re still the party of national security, and the Democrats aren’t.”California RNC member Shawn Steel was among those willing to defend Trump’s war against the FBI because he found it alarming that the nation’s intelligence community would start investigating a presidential candidate. “If that is true, it creates a constitutional crisis,” he said. “Trump is the great victim of all of this.”Steel also defended the party’s decision to hold its Thursday night dinner, which the president attended, at the Trump International Hotel blocks from the White House ― the kind of business that Trump continues to profit from despite promises during the campaign that he would not.“I happen to like going to the Trump hotel. It has beautiful furnishings. It has great big American flags,” Steel said.“We have to go somewhere,” added Kaufman. “Besides, people wanted to go there.”To Florida GOP consultant Rick Wilson, the party’s ongoing defense of Trump is proof that it cannot be salvaged.“They are literally burning down the FBI to save this guy. They are literally burning down the Justice Department to save this guy. This is a remarkable moment,” said Wilson, an early and fierce critic of Trump. “If Barack Obama had done anything remotely like this, Republicans would be rioting in the street with pitchforks and torches.”He added that if Obama or either Bill or Hillary Clinton had steered party money into their own pockets, the RNC would have been attacking that day in and day out for weeks, if not months.“The double standard is ridiculous,” Wilson said. “If Bill Clinton had been using the DNC for funding his legal defense in the Monica Lewinsky scandal? The world would have exploded.”“They will violate their own moral consciences to unequivocally support him,” said Unruh, who attended eight GOP conventions as a delegate before being forced out of the local Colorado party after Trump’s election. “They have lost the high road. They had it, and they lost it. I hope it was worth selling their souls.”"
61,POLITICS,The Real Purpose Of The Nunes Memo,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/devin-nunes-memo-plot_us_5a74a311e4b01ce33eb27fde,"Despite the distraction, the memo shows no ""deep state"" plot to elect Hillary Clinton.",2018-02-02,"Rep Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) rushes away from the media on Capitol Hill on March 28, 2017. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a74a4701d000027006ad9d7.jpeg?cache=KIwMDk6PlH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― For weeks, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee and their allies have been promising that they have a memo with damning evidence undermining special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling and Russian ties to President Donald Trump’s inner circle. “This is far worse than Watergate. This is an abuse of surveillance and intelligence to win an election,” Fox News host and loyal Trump defender Sean Hannity said Monday, adding that Mueller’s “witch hunt” would be over. That memo, written by GOP committee staffers, was finally released on Friday. And it has no smoking gun to discredit Mueller or any other top Justice Department officials that Trump wants to get rid of. Its purpose is to muddy the waters, raise questions in people’s minds and provide a distraction from the fact that at the end of the day, there is still zero evidence that there was a “deep state” plot to elect Hillary Clinton president. The crux of the memo, pushed out by committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is that law enforcement officials abused their surveillance authority by relying on a controversial “dossier” with unproven claims to spy on Trump campaign official Carter Page.It says then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified they would not have “sought” a surveillance warrant for Page without that dossier. But the memo never answers the question of whether the dossier was the basis of the FISA court’s decision to grant the warrant. It doesn’t reveal what else was included in the application for a warrant. And at the end of the day, there’s far more to the Russia investigation than the Page surveillance. Russian operatives tried to recruit Page as a spy in 2013, even before he joined the Trump team. Former FBI Director James Comey has testified that officials began looking into Trump-Russia connections in July 2016, long before the Page warrant in October 2016. The memo actually confirms a New York Times report that what started the investigation was a slip-up by Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, who admitted to a diplomat that he knew Russia had dirt on Clinton. In other words, the House GOP memo undercuts conspiracy theories that the probe started because of the dossier. The memo also does nothing to dispute any of the potential collusion between Trump and the Russian government: It does not dispute the Papadopoulos contacts.All of those omissions only serve to highlight the central fact that makes the Republicans’ attack on Mueller, and the law enforcement establishment more broadly, so absurd: The information leaked and released by the FBI and the rest of the so-called “deep state” during the election didn’t undermine Trump — it helped get him elected. The FBI was investigating both the Trump and Clinton campaigns during the election. But it only revealed its investigation into Clinton. Just 11 days before the election, Comey revealed that he was reopening the investigation into Clinton’s emails, even though she had been already cleared. The announcement cast enough suspicion and changed the conversation in the final stretch that Clinton and the site FiveThirtyEight say it cost her the presidency.If the “deep state” wanted to hurt Trump, someone could easily have leaked information about the FBI’s investigation into his campaign. No one did.Republicans tried to argue that they are releasing the memo because they believe in transparency. But it’s been clear all along that the document is a particularly effective bit of partisan gamesmanship. Republican staffers wrote the thing, after all. The GOP-controlled committee voted against allowing Democrats to release their response memo at the same time. And conveniently, the findings of the memo found their way into the hands of Byron York, a conservative columnist who published a piece about the document just minutes after Trump declassified it ― and before nearly everyone else had seen it. Some Republicans were urging members of their party to slow down on the memo release, recognizing that it likely didn’t have the smoking gun some lawmakers claimed it did. They didn’t want to cross the FBI, and they worried that by overhyping something so insignificant, they’d look silly or worse. That handful of Republicans might be missing the bullshit factory for the cow pies. It’s true that the memo shows almost nothing. But Trump supporters can still use it to question Mueller’s investigation ― and cite it when they continue standing behind the president no matter what he does. And that’s the whole point."

In what has been described as the largest public-private national park donation in history, Kristine McDivitt Tompkins, the former head of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia, donated a million of the acres.“Chile is still a developing country, with a large history of development and resource exploitation — in most cases overexploitation,” said Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in a statement. “If Chile can take this gigantic environmental measure, there are few reasons why developed nations cannot act as well.”Conservationists view protected areas as a vital tool to protect species from extinction, safeguard ecosystems, provide environmental resilience in a rapidly warming world, and in some cases protect indigenous people. While the new parks in Chile will certainly benefit ecosystems and wildlife ­– such as pumas and llama-like guanacos – could it hurt the developing country’s economy?On the face of it, large protected areas would seem to decrease economic output as they essentially lock away natural resources from exploitation. However, recent research has shown that not only can protected areas be good for national economies, they can also boost local economies and mitigate poverty – if managed well.“These parks are really putting Chile on the map, in the broader eco-tourism sense,” William Laurance, an ecologist with James Cook University who has studied protected areas, said. “They’re all fully open to the broader public, and they’re being integrated with rewilding programs — to bring back or reintroduce charismatic species such as pumas.” International tourism to Chile has been steadily increasing over the last decade. In 2016, the country saw 5.6 million tourists – a 400 percent rise since 2002 – and many of these travelers were likely drawn to the country’s renowned wilderness areas, including snow-capped mountains, unruly rivers, vast plains and magnificent wildlife.“For every dollar you invest in national parks, you get 10 back; it’s more profitable than copper,” Hernán Mladinic, the executive director of Chile’s Fundación Pumalín, told The Guardian last year.But protected areas can also have a less obvious effect on the local economy in developing countries: They can spur poverty alleviation.“Research from around the globe suggests that parks can successfully balance conservation and development and are one of the most important mechanisms for permanent protection of natural resources,” said Katharine Sims, an economics and environmental professor at Amherst College.Sims’ research has compared local communities living next to protected areas in both Thailand and Costa Rica with similar communities living far from parks. What she found surprised even her and bucked conventional wisdom: Poverty levels were lower for the people living near parks. Her research shows that economic benefits from the park – tourism, increased infrastructure and the overspill of ecosystem services – outweighed the restriction placed on exploiting natural resources.Her findings have since been boosted by similar studies in Uganda, Indonesia, Bolivia and Nepal.Still, Sims stresses that management matters. Parks with multiple zoning are the best for local economies in developing countries, she said.“We found that Biosphere Reserves [protected areas nominated and controlled by national governments] were most successful. These parks included a mix of strictly protected core areas to protect wildlife and buffer areas to support multiple uses including tourism, recreation and sustainable resource extraction,” Sims said of recent research in Mexico.Another subtle but still enormous economic benefit to protected areas concerns ecosystem services, the catch-all term for the multiple benefits nature provides such as pollination, carbon sequestration, clean water, erosion mitigation, fish nurseries and more. For example, the Czech Republic’s 25 large protected areas provided €51 billion ($63 billion) every year ― more than a quarter of the country’s GDP ― as a result of ecosystem services, according to a recent paper put out by the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.“These estimates can emphasize the social importance of protected areas and nature in general, in other language than basic conservation goals,” said Jan Daněk, lead author of the study.Such values are not incorporated into the traditional economy, but nonetheless underpin economic processes.And some benefits of nature are “impossible” to put a dollar sign on, said Daněk, who pointed to the spiritual benefits provided by parks.Buoyed by the evidence that parks not only protect nature, but also provide multiple economic benefits, conservationists have called for more protected areas worldwide. Currently, the Aichi Biodiversity Goals – international targets to halt the destruction of species’ habitats – have set a goal of protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of the oceans by 2020.But preeminent biologist E.O. Wilson has a far more radical idea: the Half Earth Project. Wilson argues that half the planet – on land and in sea – such be set aside as protected areas to save life on Earth – including humanity.Around the world, many countries have increased their protected area coverage. China, which has long had a system of cultural and small nature parks, has announced it will open its first formal national park in 2020. Papua New Guinea, which has few parks, recently established a conservation area that’s nearly the size of Rhode Island. And nations like Costa Rica and Bhutan have become renowned for their efforts to protect ecosystems – and been rewarded by tourism and relatively intact ecosystems.But other parts of the world have seen movements to reduce protected areas, particularly to allow mining, logging and other extractive industries.In the United States, which invented the concept of a national park, the Trump administration is taking a hatchet to many of the country’s newest protected areas, including controversial shrinkages of Bears Ears Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, enraging environmentalists and Native American activists who consider portions of these parks sacred. Even where protections stand, the administration is pursuing new rules that would allow protected areas to be opened up to drilling and logging.To achieve anything close to the protection envisioned by Wilson’s Half Earth Project, or even less ambitious goals of the Aichi Biodiversity Goals, creative partnerships and funding – such as what happened in Chile – would need to become more commonplace.“[It’s] a very good example of how to use philanthropic assistance to good effect – to have broad national benefits,” Laurance said, referring to the partnership between the Chilean government and Kristine McDivitt Tompkins. “This requires a level of self-confidence and open-mindedness that isn’t evident in some nations.”For decades, Tompkins and her late husband Doug faced criticism from many in Chile about the intentions they had for their vast land holdings. But this week’s agreement shows that many in the country have come to embrace their vision of marking off land for national protection.And Tompkins says she’s not done yet.“While we will continue to help promote and safeguard these parks, we are beginning to turn our attention to more new conservation and rewilding projects in Chile and Argentina as we work to save and restore big, wild and connected ecosystems.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

Her research shows that economic benefits from the park – tourism, increased infrastructure and the overspill of ecosystem services – outweighed the restriction placed on exploiting natural resources.Her findings have since been boosted by similar studies in Uganda, Indonesia, Bolivia and Nepal.Still, Sims stresses that management matters. Parks with multiple zoning are the best for local economies in developing countries, she said.“We found that Biosphere Reserves [protected areas nominated and controlled by national governments] were most successful. These parks included a mix of strictly protected core areas to protect wildlife and buffer areas to support multiple uses including tourism, recreation and sustainable resource extraction,” Sims said of recent research in Mexico.Another subtle but still enormous economic benefit to protected areas concerns ecosystem services, the catch-all term for the multiple benefits nature provides such as pollination, carbon sequestration, clean water, erosion mitigation, fish nurseries and more. For example, the Czech Republic’s 25 large protected areas provided €51 billion ($63 billion) every year ― more than a quarter of the country’s GDP ― as a result of ecosystem services, according to a recent paper put out by the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.“These estimates can emphasize the social importance of protected areas and nature in general, in other language than basic conservation goals,” said Jan Daněk, lead author of the study.Such values are not incorporated into the traditional economy, but nonetheless underpin economic processes.And some benefits of nature are “impossible” to put a dollar sign on, said Daněk, who pointed to the spiritual benefits provided by parks.Buoyed by the evidence that parks not only protect nature, but also provide multiple economic benefits, conservationists have called for more protected areas worldwide. Currently, the Aichi Biodiversity Goals – international targets to halt the destruction of species’ habitats – have set a goal of protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of the oceans by 2020.But preeminent biologist E.O. Wilson has a far more radical idea: the Half Earth Project. Wilson argues that half the planet – on land and in sea – such be set aside as protected areas to save life on Earth – including humanity.Around the world, many countries have increased their protected area coverage. China, which has long had a system of cultural and small nature parks, has announced it will open its first formal national park in 2020. Papua New Guinea, which has few parks, recently established a conservation area that’s nearly the size of Rhode Island. And nations like Costa Rica and Bhutan have become renowned for their efforts to protect ecosystems – and been rewarded by tourism and relatively intact ecosystems.But other parts of the world have seen movements to reduce protected areas, particularly to allow mining, logging and other extractive industries.In the United States, which invented the concept of a national park, the Trump administration is taking a hatchet to many of the country’s newest protected areas, including controversial shrinkages of Bears Ears Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, enraging environmentalists and Native American activists who consider portions of these parks sacred. Even where protections stand, the administration is pursuing new rules that would allow protected areas to be opened up to drilling and logging.To achieve anything close to the protection envisioned by Wilson’s Half Earth Project, or even less ambitious goals of the Aichi Biodiversity Goals, creative partnerships and funding – such as what happened in Chile – would need to become more commonplace.“[It’s] a very good example of how to use philanthropic assistance to good effect – to have broad national benefits,” Laurance said, referring to the partnership between the Chilean government and Kristine McDivitt Tompkins. “This requires a level of self-confidence and open-mindedness that isn’t evident in some nations.”For decades, Tompkins and her late husband Doug faced criticism from many in Chile about the intentions they had for their vast land holdings. But this week’s agreement shows that many in the country have come to embrace their vision of marking off land for national protection.And Tompkins says she’s not done yet.“While we will continue to help promote and safeguard these parks, we are beginning to turn our attention to more new conservation and rewilding projects in Chile and Argentina as we work to save and restore big, wild and connected ecosystems.”For more content and to be part of the ‘This New World’ community, join our Facebook Group.HuffPost’s ‘This New World’ series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

65,ENTERTAINMENT,'Alt-Right' Group Takes Aim At 'Black Panther.' Ryan Coogler Responds.,Bill Bradley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panther-movie-targeted-facebook-group_us_5a7354b9e4b06ee97af09216,The director doesn't seem fazed.,2018-02-02,"Director Ryan Coogler talks about ""Black Panther"" in Beverly Hills on Tuesday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a73562c16000020001397d8.jpeg?cache=wRUxvssG6D&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: Feb. 2— The Down with Disney page is no longer available on Facebook. The page was the main hub for the group that threatened to attack the “Black Panther” Rotten Tomatoes score. Representatives for Facebook did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.PREVIOUSLY:Although early reactions to the new Marvel movie “Black Panther” have been almost universally stellar, there are some critics who not only disliked the film ― they’re looking to sabotage it.And now the rightful king of Wakanda, director Ryan Coogler, is responding.A Facebook group called Down With Disney’s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys, whose moderator describes himself as “alt-right,” recently announced its plans to intentionally tank “Black Panther’s” Rotten Tomatoes score once the movie starts showings on Feb. 15.Last year, the same group claimed to use bots to take down the score for “The Last Jedi,” which is now around 48 percent despite a critics’ score above 90.On Thursday, we asked Coogler for his thoughts on the group’s threat against “Black Panther.” The director hadn’t heard about Down With Disney, but he didn’t seem fazed when we explained it.“For me, I’m looking forward to everybody seeing the film,” Coogler said. “I’m really looking forward to sharing the film with audiences regardless of what their political views are … that’s kind of where I [stand on that].”Asked about his thoughts on Rotten Tomatoes ratings in general, Coogler said, “It ... can be an oversimplification of what critics are saying about a movie. It’s quicker to look at the consensus than it is to read the articles. But I’m a person who definitely respects film criticism and draws on it in the filmmaking process.”HuffPost previously messaged the self-identified alt-right moderator of Down With Disney, who told us his chief complaints with “The Last Jedi” revolved around its “feminist agenda.” He claimed Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is a “victim of the anti-mansplaining movement” and that Poe and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) are in danger of being “turn[ed]” gay. Following its proclaimed “success” in its campaign against “The Last Jedi” ― and “the sudden rise in those disgruntled with Disney business practices” ― Down With Disney created a Facebook event explaining its qualms with “Black Panther.” They include “corporate manipulations which created falsified bad press for the DCEU (DC Extended Universe)” among its reasons. “It’s time to strike back at all those under Disney and bring down the house of mouse’s actions for paying off the critics that hurt DC Comics on film and for other parties affected by them,” states the description of the event.The moderator also said that he will be making similar events for “Infinity War” and unspecified Netflix shows to “rally together to truly make a difference.”“If you want to spread spoilers to Marvel fanboys, use this event as a platform to inform us of targets!”At the time of this post, 3,700 people were attending the Down With Disney “Black Panther” event and 1,900 more were interested. However, the group appears to have run into some problems, because a link to the event now goes to an error page.Representatives of Rotten Tomatoes previously denounced the page’s claims that bots attacked “The Last Jedi” score, telling us, “There’s nothing unusual in the behavior” of reviewers. “The only thing that we’re seeing is people are really passionate and they’re taking time to actually post reviews.”Down With Disney maintains that the negative reviews are a result of bots it deployed.Rotten Tomatoes also recently gave a statement to The Wrap condemning hate speech and promising to block those participating in it:We at Rotten Tomatoes are proud to have become a platform for passionate fans to debate and discuss entertainment and we take that responsibility seriously. While we respect our fans’ diverse opinions, we do not condone hate speech. Our team of security, network and social experts continue to closely monitor our platforms and any users who engage in such activities will be blocked from our site and their comments removed as quickly as possible.It remains to be seen what effect, if any, there will be on the “Black Panther” audience score. Regardless, if early reviews are to be believed, audiences are still going to leave saying, “Wakanda forever!”"

Can you see it?,2018-02-02,"In “The Kitchen,” a woman appears to have died under mysterious circumstances while making dinner. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a73761216000045001397fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"In Frances Glessner Lee’s miniature replicas of real-life crime scenes, dolls are stabbed, shot and asphyxiated. A woman lies facedown on the stairs in a nightgown, her body oddly stiff. Another woman is crumpled in her closet, next to a bloody knife and a suitcase. One woman is found tucked in bed, a red lipstick stain on the underside of a pillow the only clue to her demise. The dollhouses, known as ‘‘The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,’’ were put together in minute detail as tools for teaching homicide detectives the nuances of examining a crime scene, the better to “convict the guilty, clear the innocent, and find the truth in a nutshell,” in a mantra adopted by Lee. Before she created her striking dioramas in the 1940s and ’50s, crime scenes were routinely contaminated by officers who trampled through them without care; evidence was mishandled; murders were thought to be accidents and accidents, murders. Today, even as forensic science has advanced by quantum leaps, her models are still used to teach police how to observe scenes, collect evidence and, critically, to question their initial assumptions about what took place. The 19 existing nutshells were recently on display at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Lee’s pedagogical models having aged into a ghoulish sort of art. I saw them on a freakishly warm day in Washington, D.C., amateur sleuths crowded around me. Each model was accompanied by a card explaining basic facts about the case — the solutions are kept secret — and by a flashlight so that viewers could investigate the various clues more closely. But something else was going on in the exhibit. Look closely at the nutshells: What unites them are the scenes of domestic horror that Lee, considered the “mother of forensic science,” portrays in such unsettling detail. Most of the victims are women, found dead inside the comfort of their homes. Dioramas that appear to show domestic bliss are slyly subverted to reveal the dark underside of family life. Unwittingly or not — her private life offers only scattered hints as to her motivation — Lee, with each nutshell, was leaving clues that pointed to the culprit in the larger story of American crime. Many of these scenes of murder are in fact scenes of misogyny in bloody apotheosis. Peering inside “The Kitchen,” I felt as though I’d interrupted a profoundly intimate moment of pain. Lee handmade her dioramas at a scale of 1 inch to 1 foot ― classic for dollhouses ― and they are accurately and overwhelmingly detailed. In “The Kitchen,” there’s fresh-baked bread cooling in the open oven, potatoes half-peeled in the sink. Outside the window, female undergarments are seen drying on the line. But on the floor, flat on her back, is a deceased woman in an apron, her cheeks blazing red. On further scan of the room, viewers will notice that newspaper has been stuffed under the doors, blocking air passage, leading to the conclusion that she died from carbon monoxide poisoning. At first glance, it looks like a suicide. But why would this housewife kill herself in the middle of cooking dinner? Maybe, one exhibition viewer theorized on a Post-it note, “she died of sheer misery over her dull repetitive unfulfilled life.” But then why is the table near the window askew? Could someone have staged the suicide and escaped out the window? The only narrative available to investigators (and to viewers of the exhibition) comes from the woman’s husband, who reported that he went on an errand for his wife, and when he returned she was dead. Huh. It was this type of case that Lee wanted investigators to examine more closely, instead of accepting the obvious answer and moving right on. “She was about championing the cases of people who were overlooked. And as a woman, she felt overlooked by the system,” said Nora Atkinson, the show’s curator. When Lee was building her models, the field of law enforcement was almost entirely male, she explained. “When they came across a scene, they didn’t take the cases against women that seriously, just like they didn’t take the cases against a drunk or a prostitute that seriously. She focused on people who were on the fringes of society, and women fell into that.” The most gruesome of the nutshells is “Three-Room Dwelling,” in which a husband, wife and baby are all shot to death. As the diorama doesn’t have a roof, viewers have an aerial view into the house. Even though the victims are dolls, it’s a disturbing crime scene. In the kitchen, a gun lies on the floor near a bloody puddle. In another room, a baby is shot in her crib, the pink wallpaper behind her head stained with a constellation of blood spatters. The wife is shot in bed, turned on her side. Her husband is facedown on the floor, his striped blue pajamas soaked with blood. Atkinson said when she observes crowds discussing “Three-Room Dwelling,” men and women have very different theories on the perpetrator. “The women believe that it was the husband who did it, and the men believe that it must have been an intruder,” she said. “It’s really sort of a psychological experiment watching the conclusions your audience comes to.”For the record, I too am confident the husband did it. Maybe that’s because I’ve covered so many similar cases, and they’re sadly predictable. But I wasn’t surprised to hear that others were reluctant to reach the same verdict. As someone who writes almost exclusively about male violence against women, I’ve noticed a deep unwillingness among the public to recognize domestic abuse at the heart of violent American crime.Most people would be startled to learn that over half of all murders of American women involve domestic violence. New York City’s first murder of 2018 was a woman stabbed to death by her husband. And despite how mass shootings are often portrayed in the media, most of them closely resemble “Three-Room Dwelling.” They are committed by husbands and boyfriends, take place within the perceived safety of the home and are anything but random.Private violence also begets more violence: Our prisons are filled with men and women who were exposed to domestic violence and child abuse. “In looking for the genesis of crime in America, all trails lead back to violence in the home,” said Casey Gwinn, who runs a camp for kids who grew up with domestic abuse (where, full disclosure, I have volunteered in the past).That inability to see domestic violence as crucially interwoven with violent crime in the U.S. leads to massive indifference. Funding for services is bleak, “desperately inadequate,” in the words of Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Among the media, there’s an impulse to categorize crimes involving intimate partners as trivial, and to compartmentalize them as private matters that exist wholly separate from Real Crime. I often wonder if it’s the word “domestic” that positions it so squarely within the realm of milk and cookies, instead of as part of a continuum, with murder and mass death terrifyingly adjacent. In one hyperlocal example this week, no reporters showed up to a news conference on domestic violence homicides held by the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women. Why? Well, the Super Bowl is about to take place in the state, and all eyes are focused on that instead. So from where did these dark creations emerge? What inspired Lee to spend so much time replicating trauma? She was born into a wealthy family in the 1870s and was intrigued by murder mysteries from a young age, the stories of Sherlock Holmes in particular. While she was studious and bright, she never had the opportunity to attend college. She married at 19 and had three children, but eventually divorced. Later in life, after her father’s and brother’s deaths, she began to pursue her true interests: crime and medicine. In the 1930s, she used her fortune to help establish the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard, the first of its kind in North America. And she started working with her local New Hampshire police department, becoming the first woman in the country to achieve the rank of police captain. At the age of 65, she began making her dollhouses, which would be her longest-lasting legacy. The teaching tools were “intended to be an exercise in observing, interpreting, evaluating and reporting,” she wrote in an article for the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. “One of the essentials in the study of these Nutshells is that the student should approach them with an open mind — far too often the investigator ‘has a hunch,’ and looks for and finds only the evidence to support it, disregarding any other evidence that may be present.”Little is known about why Lee chose the particular scenes she did, and why she narrowed her lens on the domain of domestic life. The nutshells are all based on real crimes, with some adjustments. “When she was traveling around with police officers and investigators in the New England area, these were in part a reflection of the scenes that she had access to, and the crimes that were taking place,” said Corinne Botz, an artist and author who published a book exploring the nutshells through a feminist lens.Perhaps Lee felt those cases were not getting the attention they deserved, she said, noting that many of the nutshells are overt stereotypes: the housewife in the kitchen, the old woman in the attic. “​Lee picked the cases that interested her​,” Botz said. “She is trying to make investigators take a second look, and not make assumptions based on what a neighbor reported or what first meets the eye.” Atkinson thought it was possible Lee was subconsciously exploring her own complicated feelings about family life through the models. “A lot of these domestic environments reflect her own frustration that the home was supposed to be this place of solace and safety,” she said. “The home wasn’t necessarily a place where she felt safe and warm. It was a little bit of a prison for her.” Lee hinted at her difficulties in a letter penned in her 70s. “This has been a lonely and rather terrifying life I have lived,” she wrote. “Chief amongst the difficulties I have had to meet have been the facts that I never went to school, that I had no letters after my name, and that I was placed in the category of ‘rich woman who didn’t have enough to do.’”But her nutshells, and their portrayal of violence against women, have ultimately transformed the way investigators approach crime, said Jeanie Foley, who creates full-size, realistic simulated crime scenes based on true cases to teach students at Boston College School of Nursing. The scenes she builds are similar to Lee’s nutshells, but on a much larger scale and with far less detail. Decades after Lee built her nutshells, the field of forensic science is now dominated by women. “Today, in the 21st century, the science of forensics plays a crucial part in the solution of crimes,” she said. “Lee’s models gave women a better opportunity to have a fair investigation. A more open-minded investigation.”Deliberately or not, Lee’s nutshells urge us to acknowledge that American crime is born in the home ― and we ignore it at our own peril.Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated that Lee’s father prevented her from attending college. While Lee said her father “believed that ‘a lady didn’t go to school,’” according to Botz’s book, Botz and other experts on Lee’s life have not definitively concluded why she did not attend. This story has also been updated to include more detailed information about the comments provided by Gwinn."

Today, even as forensic science has advanced by quantum leaps, her models are still used to teach police how to observe scenes, collect evidence and, critically, to question their initial assumptions about what took place. The 19 existing nutshells were recently on display at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Lee’s pedagogical models having aged into a ghoulish sort of art. I saw them on a freakishly warm day in Washington, D.C., amateur sleuths crowded around me. Each model was accompanied by a card explaining basic facts about the case — the solutions are kept secret — and by a flashlight so that viewers could investigate the various clues more closely. But something else was going on in the exhibit. Look closely at the nutshells: What unites them are the scenes of domestic horror that Lee, considered the “mother of forensic science,” portrays in such unsettling detail. Most of the victims are women, found dead inside the comfort of their homes. Dioramas that appear to show domestic bliss are slyly subverted to reveal the dark underside of family life. Unwittingly or not — her private life offers only scattered hints as to her motivation — Lee, with each nutshell, was leaving clues that pointed to the culprit in the larger story of American crime. Many of these scenes of murder are in fact scenes of misogyny in bloody apotheosis. Peering inside “The Kitchen,” I felt as though I’d interrupted a profoundly intimate moment of pain. Lee handmade her dioramas at a scale of 1 inch to 1 foot ― classic for dollhouses ― and they are accurately and overwhelmingly detailed. In “The Kitchen,” there’s fresh-baked bread cooling in the open oven, potatoes half-peeled in the sink. Outside the window, female undergarments are seen drying on the line. But on the floor, flat on her back, is a deceased woman in an apron, her cheeks blazing red. On further scan of the room, viewers will notice that newspaper has been stuffed under the doors, blocking air passage, leading to the conclusion that she died from carbon monoxide poisoning. At first glance, it looks like a suicide. But why would this housewife kill herself in the middle of cooking dinner? Maybe, one exhibition viewer theorized on a Post-it note, “she died of sheer misery over her dull repetitive unfulfilled life.” But then why is the table near the window askew? Could someone have staged the suicide and escaped out the window? The only narrative available to investigators (and to viewers of the exhibition) comes from the woman’s husband, who reported that he went on an errand for his wife, and when he returned she was dead. Huh. It was this type of case that Lee wanted investigators to examine more closely, instead of accepting the obvious answer and moving right on. “She was about championing the cases of people who were overlooked. And as a woman, she felt overlooked by the system,” said Nora Atkinson, the show’s curator. When Lee was building her models, the field of law enforcement was almost entirely male, she explained. “When they came across a scene, they didn’t take the cases against women that seriously, just like they didn’t take the cases against a drunk or a prostitute that seriously. She focused on people who were on the fringes of society, and women fell into that.” The most gruesome of the nutshells is “Three-Room Dwelling,” in which a husband, wife and baby are all shot to death. As the diorama doesn’t have a roof, viewers have an aerial view into the house. Even though the victims are dolls, it’s a disturbing crime scene. In the kitchen, a gun lies on the floor near a bloody puddle. In another room, a baby is shot in her crib, the pink wallpaper behind her head stained with a constellation of blood spatters. The wife is shot in bed, turned on her side. Her husband is facedown on the floor, his striped blue pajamas soaked with blood. Atkinson said when she observes crowds discussing “Three-Room Dwelling,” men and women have very different theories on the perpetrator. “The women believe that it was the husband who did it, and the men believe that it must have been an intruder,” she said. “It’s really sort of a psychological experiment watching the conclusions your audience comes to.”For the record, I too am confident the husband did it. Maybe that’s because I’ve covered so many similar cases, and they’re sadly predictable. But I wasn’t surprised to hear that others were reluctant to reach the same verdict. As someone who writes almost exclusively about male violence against women, I’ve noticed a deep unwillingness among the public to recognize domestic abuse at the heart of violent American crime.Most people would be startled to learn that over half of all murders of American women involve domestic violence. New York City’s first murder of 2018 was a woman stabbed to death by her husband. And despite how mass shootings are often portrayed in the media, most of them closely resemble “Three-Room Dwelling.” They are committed by husbands and boyfriends, take place within the perceived safety of the home and are anything but random.Private violence also begets more violence: Our prisons are filled with men and women who were exposed to domestic violence and child abuse. “In looking for the genesis of crime in America, all trails lead back to violence in the home,” said Casey Gwinn, who runs a camp for kids who grew up with domestic abuse (where, full disclosure, I have volunteered in the past).That inability to see domestic violence as crucially interwoven with violent crime in the U.S. leads to massive indifference. Funding for services is bleak, “desperately inadequate,” in the words of Kim Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Among the media, there’s an impulse to categorize crimes involving intimate partners as trivial, and to compartmentalize them as private matters that exist wholly separate from Real Crime. I often wonder if it’s the word “domestic” that positions it so squarely within the realm of milk and cookies, instead of as part of a continuum, with murder and mass death terrifyingly adjacent. In one hyperlocal example this week, no reporters showed up to a news conference on domestic violence homicides held by the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women. Why? Well, the Super Bowl is about to take place in the state, and all eyes are focused on that instead. So from where did these dark creations emerge? What inspired Lee to spend so much time replicating trauma? She was born into a wealthy family in the 1870s and was intrigued by murder mysteries from a young age, the stories of Sherlock Holmes in particular. While she was studious and bright, she never had the opportunity to attend college. She married at 19 and had three children, but eventually divorced. Later in life, after her father’s and brother’s deaths, she began to pursue her true interests: crime and medicine. In the 1930s, she used her fortune to help establish the Department of Legal Medicine at Harvard, the first of its kind in North America. And she started working with her local New Hampshire police department, becoming the first woman in the country to achieve the rank of police captain. At the age of 65, she began making her dollhouses, which would be her longest-lasting legacy. The teaching tools were “intended to be an exercise in observing, interpreting, evaluating and reporting,” she wrote in an article for the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology. “One of the essentials in the study of these Nutshells is that the student should approach them with an open mind — far too often the investigator ‘has a hunch,’ and looks for and finds only the evidence to support it, disregarding any other evidence that may be present.”Little is known about why Lee chose the particular scenes she did, and why she narrowed her lens on the domain of domestic life. The nutshells are all based on real crimes, with some adjustments. “When she was traveling around with police officers and investigators in the New England area, these were in part a reflection of the scenes that she had access to, and the crimes that were taking place,” said Corinne Botz, an artist and author who published a book exploring the nutshells through a feminist lens.Perhaps Lee felt those cases were not getting the attention they deserved, she said, noting that many of the nutshells are overt stereotypes: the housewife in the kitchen, the old woman in the attic. “​Lee picked the cases that interested her​,” Botz said. “She is trying to make investigators take a second look, and not make assumptions based on what a neighbor reported or what first meets the eye.” Atkinson thought it was possible Lee was subconsciously exploring her own complicated feelings about family life through the models. “A lot of these domestic environments reflect her own frustration that the home was supposed to be this place of solace and safety,” she said. “The home wasn’t necessarily a place where she felt safe and warm. It was a little bit of a prison for her.” Lee hinted at her difficulties in a letter penned in her 70s. “This has been a lonely and rather terrifying life I have lived,” she wrote. “Chief amongst the difficulties I have had to meet have been the facts that I never went to school, that I had no letters after my name, and that I was placed in the category of ‘rich woman who didn’t have enough to do.’”But her nutshells, and their portrayal of violence against women, have ultimately transformed the way investigators approach crime, said Jeanie Foley, who creates full-size, realistic simulated crime scenes based on true cases to teach students at Boston College School of Nursing. The scenes she builds are similar to Lee’s nutshells, but on a much larger scale and with far less detail. Decades after Lee built her nutshells, the field of forensic science is now dominated by women. “Today, in the 21st century, the science of forensics plays a crucial part in the solution of crimes,” she said. “Lee’s models gave women a better opportunity to have a fair investigation. A more open-minded investigation.”Deliberately or not, Lee’s nutshells urge us to acknowledge that American crime is born in the home ― and we ignore it at our own peril.Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated that Lee’s father prevented her from attending college. While Lee said her father “believed that ‘a lady didn’t go to school,’” according to Botz’s book, Botz and other experts on Lee’s life have not definitively concluded why she did not attend. This story has also been updated to include more detailed information about the comments provided by Gwinn."

We prefer ‘man band.’""",2018-02-02,"Jonah Marais, Daniel Seavey, and Jack Avery perform on Dec. 15, 2017 in Atlanta.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a747bfd1d000027006ad976.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The members of Why Don’t We have a secret handshake they do right before hitting the stage. They call it their “confidence solidifier.” “I can’t go onstage if I don’t shake everyone’s hand,” Why Don’t We’s Daniel Seavey told HuffPost. “There was one time the show started and we hadn’t done the handshake. We were supposed to run onstage, but we finished the handshake first.” The five-piece group, featuring Seavey (who competed on Season 14 of “American Idol”), Zach Herron, Corbyn Besson, Jonah Marais and Jack Avery, started that handshake after forming their band in the summer of 2016. The guys knew one other from touring as solo acts and decided to meet up in Los Angeles just to see what would happen. “There was this magic sauce in the air,” Besson recalled. Seavey noted how everything came together very organically.“Coming into the group, it never was really us like, ‘Oh, let’s just join this boy band,’” Seavey said. “It was more so, ‘We are all friends. We all like the same type of music, so why don’t we just make a band and make good music?’”Why Don’t We is made up of five guys ranging in age from 16-19, so it would be easy to dub the group a “boy band.” While Besson says they “embrace the boy band term,” they wouldn’t mind being called something else.“If people want to call us a boy band, that’s cool. I don’t think we necessarily call us ourselves a boy band. We prefer ‘man band.’ Like if possible, in your article if you can convince everybody to call us ‘man band’ from now on, that would be so incredible,” Besson joked. “No, but we embrace it,” he continued. “Our sound is definitely a little bit different than what you’d expect from a traditional boy band or what’s been termed as a boy band in the past. We’re kind of just doing our thing. We’re doing the music we love — doing it the Why Don’t We way.”Whatever they’re doing, it appears to be working. The group has garnered 2.4 million followers on Instagram, amassed more than 120 million audio streams globally and racked up 38 million YouTube views for their “These Girls” video. “It’s so cool. When my mom gets excited about things now, she texts me with six exclamation points instead of just one,” Besson said about their newfound success. Performing at New York’s Madison Square Garden for Z100’s Jingle Ball in December marked one of the highlights of the past year ― not only because of the concert itself, but because of the other artists in attendance.“When we originally got to Madison Square Garden that day and got to our dressing room, there was a note left on our table … It was from Taylor Swift and she was congratulating us on all of our success … It was a super sweet letter,” Besson said. “She invited us to her dressing room after our set. We walked in and it smelled like the most beautiful botanical garden ... Taylor Swift was standing right there, and Ed Sheeran was just there hanging. We were like, ‘Whoa, this is like real life right now.’”Why Don’t We met Sheeran prior to Jingle Ball at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2017. “We were on the red carpet, and he stopped by and was like, ‘Hey, Why Don’t We’! And we were like, ‘Uuuuhhhh, hi Ed Sheeran!’ It was a crazy moment. He said he loved our music, loved our sound and that he couldn’t wait to see where our success takes us,” Seavey said.Then, just a few months later, Why Don’t We’s manager and label, Atlantic Records, called with a nice surprise. “They said, ’Hey, this guy thinks he may have the perfect song for you guys. And we were like, ‘Who is it?’ And they were like, ‘Ed Sheeran.’ And we were like, ‘Oh, well, let’s hear the song.’ We heard the song and we loved the direction he was going with it,” Seavey said about “Trust Fund Baby.” “We got our voices on it as soon as we could, and it came out amazing.”The group has already released five EPs filled with plenty of tracks, but the new single, released this week, is by far the favorite. “This feels like the best way to represent how we want the rest of the year to go,” Seavey said.More music is on the way as the band currently works on a full-length album, expected out later this year. “If you thought 2017 was a good year for us, then I’m really excited to see how 2018 does because we got a lot more things up to our sleeve,” Seavey said. One of those things is an upcoming headlining tour, set to kick off in February. Their live set will feature a mixture of everything. The guys are working on dance routines, incorporating live instruments and planning a high-production show.And you can bet they’ll do that secret handshake each and every night. “I think the best part of being in a band is having four guys there to be a support onstage and to back you up. If you make a little mistake, you have four other guys to back you up right there,” Marais said before adding with a laugh, “But we don’t make mistakes.”"
72,IMPACT,"Amazon's Health Care Plans Are Driven By Its Bottom Line, Not Its People","Benjamin Y. Fong, Guest Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amazon-health-care-nonprofit_us_5a739702e4b01ce33eb132e0,"As long as health care is subservient to corporate interests, any cost-cutting will be to the benefit of the rich, not the sick.",2018-02-02,Amazon and other companies announced they would form an independent health company for their U.S. employees. The move will likely benefit the companies more than the employees.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a743ae81d000026006ad8f3.jpeg?cache=oaP8zHlk9u&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway announced on Tuesday that they would be teaming up to form an independent health company ― one that is “free from profit-making incentives and constraints” ― for their U.S. employees, with a long-term aim of creating health care solutions that benefit, “potentially, all Americans.” Although no details for this proposal were offered in the announcement, stock prices for insurance giants like UnitedHealth and Anthem fell steeply in its wake, an indication of the perceived power of the combined effort of these three corporations.It’s impossible to assess the viability of their plans when there really aren’t any, but it makes perfect sense that three large companies, recognizing that they are contributing to the record profits of other large companies ― i.e., insurance companies ― would want to take a stab at decreasing their own expenditures.And indeed, in spite of the seemingly progressive rhetoric (“improving employee satisfaction,” “free from profit-making incentives,” etc.), every commentator on this proposal saw it quite clearly as a business decision. The New York Times even compared it to “classic disruption,” where a company enters “a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost.” That a proposed nonprofit health care company would be immediately and so easily compared to “classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers,” is a good indication that most people doubt that health is really the goal here.And with good reason. Amazon is conducting an experiment in ”purposeful Darwinism,” according to a New York Times profile of life inside the business, to see just how far it can push its workers, and with little concern for their health. The same piece found 80- to 85-hour workweeks with no work-life separation to be the norm for some workers, and there were accounts of people who fell ill being threatened with dismissal for their “personal difficulties.”For blue-collar workers, the brutality is even more straightforward: In 2011, Amazon stationed paramedics and ambulances outside its factory in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to cart off workers as they collapsed in the 102-degree heat. This is all to say that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is interested not in people’s health but rather in his bottom line. It’s very possible that he and his partners will find a way to cut down on the obscene administrative costs of most health insurance companies, including the $20 million per year on average that most insurance CEOs make. But even with the combined 1 million employees between the three companies, ”the idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.”The basic idea being toyed with here is, however, a good one: By having significant buying power through the representation of a large number of people, it is indeed possible to negotiate medical costs. The Department of Veterans Affairs, for instance, gets a 40 percent discount on drugs, and pharmaceutical costs in countries with single-payer health care are much lower than in the U.S.Amazon and its allies are thus right to think that the exorbitant cost of health care can be reined in by eliminating the profit motive and consolidating buying power, but in both cases a single-payer Medicare for All system is a far better proposal than their own. Medicare for All would allow for real negotiation over medical costs and would ensure that profit doesn’t endanger care. As long as health care is subservient to corporate interests, any cost-cutting will be to the benefit of the rich, not the sick.As Mark Dudzic of the Labor Campaign For Single Payer points out, there’s a good reason corporate America won’t get behind a proposal that both saves them money and has the support of the majority of Americans: It’s all about power.Companies like employment-based health care, despite its costs, because it keeps the workforce captive. They also fear slippery slopes and know that the socialization of one industry could mean that theirs is next. Bezos and company thus want to take on the enormous project of starting a health care nonprofit because they want to stave off any threats to their own power.Progressives are not the only group in the political spectrum that has “awoken” in recent years. Capitalists too are very aware of popular discontent, the kind that could actually endanger their position rather than just feed the Democratic Party machine and will no doubt continue to trot out proposed “solutions” to political crises in health care, education, housing, transportation and so forth.

She was committed to a state mental health facility and has been receiving treatment. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren sentenced Geyser to the maximum penalty sought by prosecutors after a day of testimony from doctors who had evaluated the teen. Bohren explained his decision as a matter of “community protection.” “What we can’t forget is this was an attempted murder,” Bohren said, according to The Guardian.Geyser also addressed the court. “I just want to let [the victim] and her family know that I’m sorry,” she said. “And I hope she’s doing well.”The trial stemmed back to a 2014 attack in which Geyser and another girl, Anissa Weier, were accused of luring a classmate into a wooded area and stabbing her 19 times to appease Slender Man, a character that appears in crowd-sourced fiction. All three girls were 12 years old at the time of the incident.The victim survived the attack and managed to crawl to the roadside, where a bicyclist found her. Authorities tracked down Weier and Geyser later that day. The girls reportedly told police that they were heading to the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, where they’d live with the fictional creature and his servants in his mansion.Both girls were tried as adults and were found to have mental health issues. Geyser was diagnosed with schizophrenia and oppositional defiant disorder after her arrest. Weier was diagnosed with a delusional disorder and a condition known as schizotypy."

As she worked to find justice for herself and the doctor’s other victims, Denhollander began to turn a critical eye on a community that she depended on dearly for support ― her church.Denhollander, an evangelical Christian, saw that Biblical teachings about grace and repentance were being weaponized against victims, pressuring them into offering an easy forgiveness to their abusers. At the same time, churches lacked accountability structures that treated victims with compassion and respect.It soon became clear to her that when it comes to properly caring for survivors of sexual abuse, the church has a long way to go ― and experts HuffPost spoke to agree.Denhollander opened up about her disappointment with the American evangelical church in an interview Wednesday with Christianity Today’s Morgan Lee.“Church is one of the least safe places to acknowledge abuse because the way it is counseled is, more often than not, damaging to the victim,” said Denhollander, who now works as a lawyer in Kentucky. “There is an abhorrent lack of knowledge for the damage and devastation that sexual assault brings. It is with deep regret that I say the church is one of the worst places to go for help.”Nassar pleaded guilty in November to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual contact for abusing young athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He was sentenced last week to up to 175 years in jail.Denhollander was one of more than 150 survivors who shared statements in court during Nassar’s sentencing hearing. In her statement, Denhollander spoke about how her advocacy for sexual assault victims “cost me my church and our closest friends.” Denhollander said one of the biggest struggles she faced was trying to come to terms with what happened to her from a spiritual perspective. She told Christianity Today that she initially wondered why God didn’t prevent the abuse, and if she was “stained” by it. Over the years, she came to realize that church teachings sometimes can be used to “mitigate and to minimize” victims’ suffering. ″[Christians] can tend to gloss over the devastation of any kind of suffering but especially sexual assault, with Christian platitudes like God works all things together for good or God is sovereign,” she told Christianity Today. “Those are very good and glorious biblical truths, but when they are misapplied in a way to dampen the horror of evil, they ultimately dampen the goodness of God.”Ashley Easter, an advocate for abuse victims, told HuffPost she agrees the church is not always a safe place for victims to disclose abuse. “Many churches hold poor interpretations of Scripture that imply the victim is somehow at fault for dressing or acting a certain way ‘immodestly,’ that speaking up about abuse is ‘gossip’ or ‘slander,’ and that forgiveness is moving on without demanding justice for the victims,” Easter told HuffPost. “These stances are a stark contrast from Jesus’ ministry to the marginalized.”Many of these views about women are steeped in patriarchal biases. Christa Brown, an expert on church abuse scandals, told HuffPost that in evangelical communities, patriarchy is often seen as part of God’s plan. Some churches emphasize female submissiveness and male “headship,” the idea that men have final authority over women in the church, community and home.These teachings aren’t always inherently destructive. But they can create an unequal power dynamic ― such as when a female survivor of assault brings her case to the male elders of a local church. Meanwhile, other aspects of evangelical Christian theology, such as the emphasis on forgiveness of sin, can enable covering up sexual abuse. And often, Brown said, evangelical churches lack adequate accountability structures that would keep all of these problematic forces in check. “The toxicity of this combination ― a lack of accountability structures and a patriarchal theology ― taints evangelical culture at its very core,” Brown told HuffPost. Denhollander first went public with her accusations in The Indianapolis Star in September 2016. At the time, she and her husband were attending a church in Louisville, Kentucky. She claimed the church was “directly” involved in supporting a local pastor who had been accused of covering up child sex abuse. When Denhollander spoke up on behalf of survivors, it caused a rift between her and the leaders of her church. She said some elders even used her personal story of sexual abuse as a weapon against her, claiming that the assault had clouded her judgment as an advocate. In the interview with Christianity Today, Denhollander made it clear that she feels the problem is bigger than one individual congregation. She believes the American evangelical church as a whole has to work much harder to appropriately respond to abuse allegations from survivors. “The only reason I am able to have the support of these leaders now is because I am speaking out against an organization not within their community,” Denhollander said. “Had I been so unfortunate so as to have been victimized by someone in their community ... I would be massively shunned. That’s the reality.”Easter told HuffPost she’s seen this pattern before in evangelical churches. Church leaders are more likely to support specific victims if the abuser has no ties to their own ministry. But when victims come forward about abuse by one of the church’s pastors or a popular ministry leader, the church’s first response is often to fully support the abuser and reject the victim, she said. “This duplicitous double standard is an exercise in image management and not reflective of the heart of Jesus,” Easter told HuffPost in an email.In January, an evangelical church in Tennessee was criticized after it appeared to stand by a pastor accused of sexual abuse. Highpoint Church in Memphis initially indicated it had “total confidence in the redemptive process” that accused pastor Andy Savage had gone through after he allegedly assaulted a young woman years ago. After the pastor read out an apology during a church service, some members gave Savage a standing ovation. It wasn’t until the church received backlash in the national media that leaders decided to put Savage on leave, and take other steps to re-evaluate the church’s policies on child safety. Brown agrees that church leaders tend to respond poorly to abuse in their own communities.“Having communicated with hundreds of clergy sex abuse survivors over the past decade, and based on my personal experience as well, I can say that Rachael’s statement is absolutely true in its assessment of how abysmally evangelical leaders would react if she had been victimized by someone within their own community,” Brown told HuffPost. “Rachael’s statement should serve as a challenge to evangelical faith groups to at least come up to speed with the basic norms of accountability structures.”For Brown, this includes setting up centralized safe spaces within denominational bodies where survivors can take their complaints. “What most evangelical groups now have is a system that tells abuse survivors to take their complaint to the local church ― i.e., the church of the accused pastor,” Brown said. “This is akin to telling bloody sheep that they should go to the den of the wolf who savaged them.”Easter said that when victims come forward, churches need to open their doors and get outside professionals involved ― law enforcement, licensed counselors, justice attorneys for victims, and unbiased investigators. “For the church to become a safe place for abuse survivors, it must repent of its sin of shielding perpetrators in their ranks,” she said. “The church needs to reevaluate its patriarchal shaming and silencing of victims and create an environment where abuse disclosure is encouraged and met with belief and compassion.”"

Randall Margraves was standing alongside two of his daughters, Madison and Lauren, in a Charlotte, Michigan, courtroom as they read their impact statements. When they finished, Margraves asked Judge Janice Cunningham if he could say something to Nassar. “You son of a bitch,” Margraves said to Nassar, adding a request to Cunningham: “I would ask you to as part of the sentencing to grant me five minutes in a locked room with this demon. Would you do that? Would you give me one minute?”When Cunningham told Margraves that she could not grant that, the father of three lunged at Nassar, who was sitting only a few feet away with his defense attorneys. Law enforcement officers tackled Margraves to the floor before he could reach Nassar.Several officers escorted Margraves out of the courtroom in handcuffs. As he was being led out, the father looked at the police and asked: “What if this happened to you guys?” His two daughters and wife were sobbing as Margraves was taken out of court. “You cannot behave like this. This is letting him have the power over us,” Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis said to survivors and family members as Margraves was escorted out. ”Use your words and your experiences to get him to change. Do not use physical violence.” Watch a clip of the incident above. Nassar has been accused by over 265 young girls and women of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. His victims include Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles, along with dozens of former Michigan State University athletes. His youngest victim was 6 at the time of the abuse.When court was back in session, Cunningham addressed the courtroom and called the attack a “quick eruption of violence.” “What just occurred in the courtroom was scary and caused a level of discomfort. I’m sorry that happened,” she said. Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree in November 2017 and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison last week on seven of those charges. A sentencing hearing for the remaining three counts began Wednesday. A minimum of 25 to 40 years is expected to be added to Nassar’s sentence. Nassar is already serving 60 years for child pornography charges. Lauren’s and Madison’s third sister gave her victim impact statement during Nassar’s first sentencing hearing in Ingham County Court, which concluded on Jan. 24.Lauren was the first of the two sisters to deliver her impact statement in court on Friday. “I trusted you, my parents trusted you, my two sisters who also had unfortunate experiences with you trusted you,” she said. ”My parents are heartbroken. All three of their children are victims of you. … The guilt they have will never go away.”Madison was much more emotional as she read her statement to the courtroom. “Like many other survivors, I was assaulted by Nassar and didn’t even know it,” she said.  Fast-forward to minute 26:30 to hear Lauren’s and Madison’s impact statements before their father lunged at Nassar.

Conservation officers put up 80 decoys years ago in an attempt to bring gannets back to the island after a four-decade absence.It worked for Nigel, who showed up on the island in 2013, the first gannet to land there in 40 years.He inexplicably became attracted to a particular concrete bird, for whom he constructed a nest and spent hours grooming her concrete feathers, according to the Guardian.Nigel died this past week next to the concrete object of his avian affection, never having his feelings returned. The Washington Post dubbed Nigel the “world’s loneliest bird.”The ranger who found Nigel’s corpse, Chris Bell, said the experience was “incredibly sad,” reported the BBC.“This just feels like the wrong ending to the story,” the ranger for New Zealand’s Department of Conservation added. Ironically, Nigel’s death happened just weeks after three real gannets made themselves at home on the opposite end of the colony.Nigel had little interest in the real birds, instead spending time with his non-responsive decoy, according to the BBC.Strange as Nigel’s sad love affair may seem, Bell believes the gannet is a hero in his own bizarre way.“His legacy was that he was the first colonizer and, if this turns into a real colony, he will always have been the first,” Bell told Stuff.co.nz. “It’s because of Nigel that the other gannets know about Mana ... maybe in six months’ time there will be a happy story to tell.”Nigel’s body will be sent to Massey University so experts can determine how he died.A Facebook group called Friends of Mana Island posted this tribute to Nigel on Thursday.

Macy’s has partnered with Verona Collection, an Islamic boutique, and plans to exclusively carry Verona products for both Muslim and non-Muslim women across the U.S. The modest fashion line, expected to launch on the Macy’s website on Feb. 15, includes a variety of hijabs or headscarves, as well as modest tops, pants, dresses and abayas, a loose garment worn by some Muslim women. “Verona Collection is more than a clothing brand,” founder Lisa Vogl said Thursday in a press release. “It’s a platform for a community of women to express their personal identity and embrace fashion that makes them feel confident on the inside and outside.”Vogl, a single mother, converted to Islam in 2011. Not long after, she had a stark realization: Modest and fashionable clothing was both hard to find and hard to afford. She also realized that women of all backgrounds, not just Muslim women, were looking for loose and conservative clothing that was still hip and stylish. Vogl’s experience in fashion photography ― her work has appeared in The Daily Beast, Marie Claire and other publications ― gave her the advantage she needed to launch Verona Collection in February 2015.Her company was a huge success, with orders coming in from around the globe. In May 2016, Vogl opened one of the first Muslim women’s clothing stores in a mainstream American mall in Orlando, Florida.Vogl’s company was able to tap into the mainstream fashion industry when Verona Collection was selected to be a part of The Workshop at Macy’s, a business development program intended to “give select high potential minority- and women-owned businesses the tools to better succeed and sustain growth in the retail industry,” the company says.“Through The Workshop at Macy’s, we want to nurture and support minority- and women-owned businesses to build their capabilities and become the next generation of retail partners,” Shawn Outler, an executive vice president at Macy’s, said in a statement.Vogl and her team were given the chance to showcase and sell their products last year outside Macy’s flagship location in New York City’s Herald Square, one of the world’s largest department stores.Major corporations have been attempting to reach out to Muslim consumers. The efforts have not been without complications. L’Oreal recently hired Amena Khan, a Muslim beauty blogger, as its first model to wear a hijab ― only for Khan to step down days later amid backlash over a series of tweets she’d posted in 2014 that were critical of Israel.Muslim consumers are estimated to spend $464 billion on fashion and $73 billion on cosmetics globally by 2019.

80,ENTERTAINMENT,Here's What Really Happened To The Puppies Handed Out At The Grammys,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/puppies-grammys-consolation_us_5a70a0e2e4b0a6aa4873ca6a,"No, celebrities didn't actually take them home.",2018-02-01,Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld hold a puppy during the Grammy Awards at Madison Square Garden.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7330512d00001f009436d0.jpeg?cache=IDBXS8Hcbp&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A CBS representative has clarified that the so-called “consolation puppies” seen at Sunday night’s Grammy Awards were not actually permanent gifts for attendees, and the dogs are now back with a training agency.“These adorable pups came from a licensed and experienced animal handling & training agency, which is also their home,” Tiffany Smith-Anoa’i told HuffPost in an email. “While at [Madison Square] Garden, they received a lot of Grammy love and were treated with the utmost care, all under the watchful supervision of these handlers. After their short segment, they returned to their home.”She declined to provide the name of the training agency, so it’s unclear what the puppies’ day-to-day lives are like or what their futures hold.The puppies made their cameo while “Late Late Show” host James Corden presented the award for Best Comedy Album, which went to Dave Chapelle. The nominees who didn’t win the category — Jim Gaffigan, Jerry Seinfeld and Sarah Silverman — all wound up with squirming puppies in their arms instead.“I don’t want anyone to be upset tonight, so the good news is nobody goes home empty-handed, because all night we will be handing out consolation puppies,” Corden said.Social media accounts for the stars were inundated with commenters asking if they’d really brought the pups home with them. And while many people simply thought it was a cute moment, not everyone was delighted.Some observers noted that the busy, loud environment of an award ceremony could have been unnecessarily stressful for puppies. But most criticism focused on the fact that handing out animals as party favors would be a pretty irresponsible move.“Dog ownership is a life-changing commitment, not something that should simply be done on a whim,” British Veterinary Association President John Fishwick told Sky News.Representatives for Silverman and Gaffigan both confirmed to HuffPost that the comedians did not bring puppies home. And Seinfeld’s wife, author Jessica Seinfeld, wrote on Instagram after the ceremony that the couple went home puppy-less.That said, some critics, like author and animal advocate Marc Bekoff, have made the case that even if the stunt was just a joke, it nevertheless sent a harmful message that living beings are merely props to be passed around for fun.It probably wouldn’t have hurt if Corden had been a little more clear from the get-go about what was really going on."

The former Olympian and transgender icon will be presented the award by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach at the Champions of Jewish Values International Awards Gala. “Israel is a bastion of global human rights and a great light to the nations,” Boteach said in a Jan. 24 press release. “But the Middle East is sadly a cesspit of human rights abuses, especially toward LGBTQ citizens who are routinely murdered, beheaded, and even hung from cranes.” Jenner, he said, “is uniquely suited to highlight Israel’s incredible record on human rights and LGBTQ rights and protection to the LGBTQ citizens, which is utterly unique and unprecedented in the Middle East.”A number of LGBTQ media outlets pointed out the conservative nature of the group and its event, at which former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer will be an “honored guest.” The World Values Network is funded by Sheldon Adelson, a longtime supporter of President Donald Trump who reportedly played a critical role in his controversial decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in December. Boteach is also an established conservative, having once praised former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon as a “stalwart friend of the Jewish State.”Jenner, meanwhile, has been an outspoken Republican for years.Known globally as as an LGBTQ-friendly destination, Israel has in recent years been accused of “pinkwashing” ― using the queer community to deflect from larger issues like the nation’s ongoing conflict with the Palestine territories.On social media, some people cast the news of Jenner’s award as an example of pinkwashing by U.S. supporters of Israel.Last year’s Tel Aviv Gay Pride was marked by protests centered focused on the pinkwashing allegations, with some demonstrators holding signs that read “There’s no pride in occupation.”A representative for Jenner told HuffPost that the former Olympian would not be making a statement about the award until the gala.

Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) materially changed ― Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has a theory as to why Democratic leaders are calling on him to remove the Intelligence Committee chairman: They want a distraction.“I think they’re just playing politics and I think they’re looking for a political distraction, is what I get out of that,” Ryan said Thursday, speaking from congressional Republicans’ annual policy retreat at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia. “Look, the tax cuts are working. Tax reform is working.”Ryan continued that the economy is going well, America has ISIS on the run, and Democrats want to “sidetrack us for some political gain.”“I think they would love nothing more than to play politics and change the subject,” he said.Ryan showed little awareness that he himself was sidestepping a question about a Republican effort to play politics: The Nunes memo is, after all, being used by Republicans to try to undermine and distract from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s alleged connections to the Trump presidential campaign.The speaker did later address the reports that Nunes changed the memo, saying those changes had occurred before the Intelligence Committee voted to release the document, not after as the ranking Democrat on the House panel, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), had alleged. Ryan also said those changes were an important step before releasing the memo, so that sources and methods of intelligence collection would be protected.The speaker continues to insist that the Nunes document is not intended to discredit the FBI, the Department of Justice or the Mueller investigation ― even as President Donald Trump and other Republicans acknowledge that’s how the memo will be perceived.When Ryan was asked if he really believed this memo wouldn’t be used to undermine the Mueller investigation, he said he was suggesting that “people should not draw lines, people should not implicate—”“People are drawing lines,” NBC reporter Kasie Hunt interjected.“Well, that’s what I’m suggesting. People should not be drawing lines. People should not be implicating independent issues. This does not implicate the Mueller investigation,” Ryan said, apparently happy to believe people weren’t already using the memo to do just that."

A combination of domestic instability and foreign pressures are fueling the onslaught of violence pummeling Kabul, experts told HuffPost.Taliban assailants in army uniforms slaughtered dozens of people in an hours-long raid at Kabul’s Inter-Continental Hotel on Jan. 20. One week later, as the city mourned the civilian deaths, the Taliban struck again: Suicide bombers drove a vehicle disguised as an ambulance down a crowded street. The vehicle exploded, killing more than 100 men, women and children. On Monday, gunmen launched an assault on Afghan troops near a military academy in Kabul. The self-described Islamic State group claimed the attack, which killed at least 11 soldiers, but Afghan officials suspect the Taliban was responsible yet again.The uptick in violence follows President Donald Trump’s recent decision to freeze the flow of U.S. security aid to Pakistan, a nation he has repeatedly accused of harboring Taliban terrorists who wreak havoc in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan has denied it provides a safe haven for the group. “There is a lot of speculation in Afghanistan ― and with good justification ― that the increase in violence can be linked to the U.S. confrontational attitude toward Pakistan,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told HuffPost. After the aid suspension was announced on Jan. 4, Felbab-Brown warned of Pakistan’s potential retaliation against heightened U.S. pressure, such as increasing support for the Haqqani network, a Taliban affiliate based in the country.But the short time frame between the U.S. administration’s decision and the string of Taliban attacks suggests a lack of correlation, she told HuffPost this week. “If you think of the Inter-Continental Hotel attack, that came quite close to the announcement ― an attack like this takes a lot of planning,” she said. “And so I think that many of these attacks were probably in preparation for considerably longer than [would be possible for them to be] generated in response, with Pakistan instructing the Haqqanis or the Taliban to conduct such attacks.” Felbab-Brown added that she believes Pakistan does not have full control over either organization. Islamabad did condemn the suicide bombing attack, and called for “concerted efforts and effective cooperation ... to eradicate the scourge of terrorism.” Trump also decried the “murderous attack,” and said it renewed “our resolve and that of our Afghan partners.”According to Felbab-Brown, there are several reasons for the Taliban to ramp up attacks in Afghanistan that are “completely separate and long preceding the U.S.-Pakistan confrontation.”The main motivation, she said, would be to demonstrate its power and to discredit the Afghan government in the eyes of its citizens: “These three attacks have generated tremendous payoff for the Taliban, [such as] the public disquiet and opposition to the government.”Residents have grown frustrated with state security failures as death tolls mount from one terrorist attack to the next. The country’s leaders have been distracted by untimely political infighting and chaos, including President Ashraf Ghani, who is currently ensnared in a bitter dispute with a longtime provincial governor he recently fired. Experts believe the Taliban has strategically capitalized on this enduring state of vulnerability.“To a large extent, the Taliban’s ability to [execute attacks] is hugely assisted by the fact that the current [Afghan] government is not effective in maintaining the rule of law,” according to Afzal Ashraf, a visiting fellow at Nottingham University’s Centre for Conflict, Security and Terrorism. “[The government] is ineffective at economic policy and in making political changes, and it’s still tainted with allegations of corruption and inefficiency.”Ashraf said attacks are becoming more frequent and severe in Kabul because groups like the Taliban and ISIS “want to bring their agenda to the fore” by attracting as much international news coverage as possible.“In order to do that, they have to go beyond a certain threshold of violence,” he told HuffPost. “The primary message that the Taliban is trying to send to the international community is that they’re still around, and that the international community’s efforts are failing in Afghanistan.”In the wake of one massacre after another, tension in the capital remains palpable, according to Kabul-based researcher Abdullah Fahimi.“One short trip around the city can tell us how fragile and sensitive the situation is,” he said, noting he expects the carnage to continue in the coming weeks.Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that the Haqqani network is allied with the Taliban but has separate origins."

Now voters with disabilities are losing access.",2018-02-01,"<p>A South Carolina voter, prevented from entering a polling place by her physical disability, receives assistance from a poll worker on the day of the state’s 2016 Democratic presidential primary. More people with disabilities are encountering barriers to voting, a problem that is being exacerbated by the widespread return to paper ballots.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a73281f160000230013976c.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Matt VasilogambrosFor decades, Kathy Hoell has struggled to vote. Poll workers have told the 62-year-old Nebraskan, who uses a powered wheelchair and has a brain injury that causes her to speak in a strained and raspy voice, that she isn’t smart enough to cast a ballot. They have led her to stairs she couldn’t climb and prevented her from using an accessible voting machine because they hadn’t powered it on.“Basically,” Hoell said, “I’m a second-class citizen.”The barriers Hoell has faced are not unusual for the more than 35 million voting-age Americans with disabilities. As many jurisdictions return to paper ballots to address cybersecurity concerns — nearly half of Americans now vote on paper ballots, counted digitally or by optical scanners — such obstacles are likely to get worse.Many people with disabilities cannot mark paper ballots without assistance, so they rely on special voting machines that are equipped with earphones and other modifications. But the return to paper ballots has made poll workers less comfortable with operating machine-based systems, said Michelle Bishop, a voting rights advocate for the National Disability Rights Network. Under increasing pressure to oversee a smooth, secure election, untrained poll workers have discouraged the use of accessible voting machines, leaving voters with disabilities behind.It’s a constant complaint from voters with disabilities nationwide, Bishop said. In the last election, for example, a voter called her to report that a machine was placed in the corner, turned off, with a flower wreath hung on it.“The message is: You’re not wanted here,” Bishop said. “We get reports of poll workers discouraging their use. They say, ‘I haven’t been well trained,’ ‘It’s intimidating to me,’ ‘We’ll set it to the side and get through Election Day.’ ”Indeed, according to an October study by the Government Accountability Office, nearly two-thirds of the 137 polling places inspected on Election Day 2016 had at least one impediment to people with disabilities. In the 2008 presidential election, it was fewer than half. The GAO also reported that state inspections of voting accessibility had fallen nationally over the same time.Among the infractions: The accessible voting machine wasn’t set up and powered on, the earphones weren’t functioning, the voting system wasn’t wheelchair-accessible, or the voting system didn’t provide the same privacy as standard voting stations.Lack of access to proper voting machines, among several other issues, has led to a decline in participation, according to a survey of voters in the 2016 election by Rutgers University. Voter participation among people with disabilities has gone down over the past two presidential elections — from 57.3 percent in 2008 to 56.8 percent in 2012 and 55.9 percent in 2016.Among non-disabled Americans, voter participation also dropped between 2008 and 2012 — from 64.5 to 62.5 percent, according to the Rutgers survey. But that percentage changed little from 2012 to 2016.The Rutgers study also notes that many polling places have physical barriers, such as steep ramps and poor path surfaces, which block people with disabilities from voting. Political parties don’t target “get out the vote” efforts to people with disabilities and many of them struggle to find transportation to polling places.Other factors that contribute to the problem — such as a lack of training for poll workers, limited access to registration materials, and insufficient resources for election officials — were laid out in a September 2016 white paper from the Ruderman Family Foundation, a disability rights advocacy organization.The proliferation of voter ID laws may compound the problem, since people with disabilities are less likely to drive and to carry a photo ID.“We’re segregating in the way we vote,” Bishop said. “Separate is not equal. That’s a lesson this country should have already learned by now.”Barriers to VotingIn few places is this gap more visible than in West Virginia — a state with the highest percentage of people with disabilities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and one of the worst voter participation rates for people with disabilities.Just 46 percent of West Virginians with disabilities who were eligible to vote participated in the 2016 election, worse than any other state but Kentucky, at 42.5 percent, according to the Rutgers researchers. Gina Desmond, an advocate for Disability Rights of West Virginia, said the lack of access has led many people with disabilities to question their role in the democratic process.“It’s surprising how many people don’t think they have the right to vote,” Desmond said.In a predominantly rural and mountainous state, transportation options are limited, said Susan Given, the executive director of Disability Rights of West Virginia. Polling places in the state’s 55 counties are spread out and often located in outdated buildings that aren’t accessible to people with disabilities.People with disabilities who can’t get into polling places often have to vote curbside with assistance from a poll worker, Given said, robbing the voter of a private and independent ballot.The organization also gets complaints that machines for voters with disabilities often don’t work or are turned off, following a similar national pattern.Recently, Disability Rights of West Virginia hired an advocate who will visit polling places this year to see whether they are accessible. The organization also holds outreach events at high schools, psychiatric hospitals, homeless shelters and service providers to explain the voting rights of people with disabilities.Voter participation among West Virginians with disabilities did go up by 3 percentage points since the 2012 election. But, Desmond said, the state has a long way to go.Success in ColoradoIn Colorado, where 69 percent of registered voters with disabilities voted in 2016 — among the highest rates in the country — advocates and state officials have taken numerous steps to make voting accessible, according to Jennifer Levin, a senior attorney at Disability Law Colorado.In the decade following the passage of the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA), Disability Law Colorado went to all 64 counties in the state, met with clerks, checked for accessibility barriers, and used state funding to help polling places meet federal HAVA and Americans with Disabilities Act standards. (Nationwide, physical barriers to voting places have steadily dropped since 2000, according to the GAO.)Now after every election, the secretary of state releases a county-by-county audit on whether localities are meeting standards for accessible polling places. After the 2016 election, for example, Denver satisfied a majority of disability access criteria, while El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, met every one. Because of this enforcement, Levin said, accessibility shortcomings in the state are rare.In 2015, her organization again partnered with the secretary of state’s office to test five new voting machines. After collecting data, officials settled on one machine that every county will use for voters with disabilities. Now, voters can choose to use a paper ballot or an accessible machine ballot.The state’s adoption of vote-by-mail and automatic voter registration for all voters also has made it easier for people with disabilities to cast their ballots.Other states have taken similar measures. Before the 2016 election, New Hampshire adopted a new tablet-based voting system for the blind, while Rhode Island recently became the ninth state to enact automatic voter registration — which eliminates the need for people with disabilities to submit paper forms that are not accessible to them.Levin finds poll workers are still afraid of new technology. “We get complaints where a person walks in and asks to use the machine, and a worker says, ‘It doesn’t look like you need it,’ ” Levin said. “They were discouraged and intimidated by it.”City officials in Washington, D.C., said they had poll workers ask every voter whether they want to use a paper ballot or a machine, taking away any excuse for unplugged machines or untrained workers. But several polling places still fall short, according to a 2016 survey by Disability Rights DC at University Legal Services, a nonprofit advocacy organization.Some states are trying to bridge the access gap through legislation. In New York state, where the voter participation rate among people with disabilities is 48.8 percent, Senate Democrats in January introduced 13 voter-focused pieces of legislation. One bill would redesign paper ballots to be more readable. Another, written by state Sen. Michael Gianaris, would allow the distribution of voter registration forms at offices that provide services to people with disabilities, while also allowing voters to change their precinct to one whose voting systems are more accessible.“We’re looking for ways to make voting easier at a time when people are trying to make voting harder,” said Gianaris, a Queens Democrat. “Our record for voter participation is abysmal. The fight we’re having right now is to open up the process.”Hoell, now the executive director of Nebraska’s independent living council, which advocates for independent living among people with disabilities, said she was tired of facing obstacles.“Part of my way of dealing with these things is I just go to the top and start yelling,” Hoell said. After HAVA was enacted, Hoell went to John Gale, Nebraska’s secretary of state, to persuade him to invest in accessible voting machines, better train poll workers, and make polling stations compliant with federal disabilities regulations.In the years since, she said, his office has found ways to include people with disabilities in the voting process.As a result, according to the Rutgers study, Nebraska has the highest voter participation rate among persons with disabilities in the country, at more than 70 percent.
