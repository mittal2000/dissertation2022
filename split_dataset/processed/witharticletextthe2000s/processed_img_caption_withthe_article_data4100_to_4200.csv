0,BLACK VOICES,Morehouse College President Says Visit With Trump Was 'Troubling',Taryn Finley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/morehouse-college-president-says-visit-with-trump-was-troubling_us_58b98807e4b05cf0f3ffe7a8,"John Wilson, Jr. didn't hold back in a statement to his college.",2017-03-03,"Morehouse president John Wilson, Jr. called the White House and Capitol Hill meetings ""a troubling beginning to what must be a productive relationship.”",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9a8011900003600bd69bb.jpeg?ops=crop_765_589_2262_1320%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump met on Monday with more than 60 presidents from historically black colleges and universities to discuss his February 28 executive order and the overall needs of black schools. Given Trump’s controversial relationship with black people, many social media users suspected the meeting was a fruitless photo-op. It seems they were correct.Morehouse College President John Wilson, Jr. alluded to this in a statement to the university on Thursday. Wilson said he initially had “high hopes,” mainly regarding funding, about meeting with the White House, especially since Trump vowed to do more for HBCUs than previous presidents during Monday’s meeting. The executive order Trump signed on Tuesday moved the HBCU initiative from under the Department of Education to the White House, which HBCUs have advocated for in expectation of having a more direct line to the president. The executive order did not, however, ensure the funding that many HBCUs desperately need; several of them are in danger of closing.Wilson, who says he was expecting at least $500 million to be allocated to the schools, said it’s impossible to know if and when the order will have an impact.(Former President Barack Obama provided more than $4 billion for black schools in his time in office.)Wilson also noted his disappointment with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos calling HBCUs an example of “school choice.”“HBCUs were not created because the 4 million newly freed blacks were unhappy with the choices they had. They were created because they had no choices at all,” he said. “[I]f one does not understand the crippling and extended horrors of slavery, then how can one really understand the subsequent history and struggle of African Americans, or the current necessities and imperatives that grow out of that history and struggle?”Wilson said despite DeVos’ comments, he believes she does want to help black colleges. But overall, Wilson said his two days of meetings at the White House weren’t promising.“In general, the meetings were a troubling beginning to what must be a productive relationship,” he said. “Trust that the HBCU community will continue to press for the kind of funding that educational excellence and national competitiveness require!”Wilson’s sentiments echo those of Dillard University’s president, Walter M. Kimbrough. In a blog posted Monday, Kimbrough said that many of the college presidents went unheard after the group made an impromptu visit to meet Trump in the Oval Office. “But needless to say that threw the day off and there was very little listening to HBCU presidents today- we were only given about 2 minutes each, and that was cut to one minute, so only about 7 of maybe 15 or so speakers were given an opportunity today,” Kimbrough explained. Because he didn’t get the opportunity to address his points while at the White House, he posted them on Medium. H/T The Root"

Zinke also signed an order to expand hunting, fishing and recreation access on federal lands.“Outdoor recreation is about both our heritage and our economy,” Zinke said in a statement. “This package of secretarial orders will expand access for outdoor enthusiasts and also make sure the community’s voice is heard.”The former Montana congressman said his new orders will allow people outside of the “land-owning elite” to participate in outdoor recreation on public lands. Pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association claim lead-free bullets are more expensive and harder to obtain than their toxic counterparts.But the Obama administration’s ban on lead ammunition was meant to protect wildlife from lead poisoning. As many as 20 million birds and other animals die of lead poisoning each year as a result of the nearly 100,000 tons of lead that hunters, fishers and other sportsmen use, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. “There’s no good reason to be using toxic ammunition lead,” Jonathan Evans, CBD’s environmental health legal director, told The Huffington Post. “There are a range of substitutes on the market today.”A 2012 study from the University of Guelph found the retail price for most calibers of lead bullets was comparable to their non-toxic counterparts.The NRA, which pumped $30 million into Trump’s presidential campaign, strongly supported Zinke’s repeal of the lead ammunition ban. Despite mounting scientific evidence, the NRA claims there’s no proof that lead ammunition causes great harm to wildlife and humans.“The fact is that traditional ammunition does not pose a significant population-level risk for wildlife,” Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Thursday. “On behalf of the five million members of the NRA and tens of millions of American sportsmen, we thank Secretary Zinke for eliminating this arbitrary attack on our hunting heritage.” “This is just another attempt by the extreme pro-gun lobby to limit common-sense controls that protect the environment and the public health from the dangers of guns,” Evans said. “There is really no good reason besides the NRA’s death grip on any kind of regulation associated with guns.”National Wildlife Federation President and CEO Collin O’Mara, whose organization has supported non-toxic alternatives to lead fishing weights, stood alongside Cox and other representatives of sportsman groups as Zinke signed the orders.“Having less lead in the water and soil is better for wildlife,” O’Mara told HuffPost. “But the best way to do this is not through a policy in the last few days of an administration but to have a science-based collaborative process with sportsmen and states that comes to a solution.”O’Mara said examples for striking a balance between healthy wildlife and outdoor recreation could be found at the state level, citing some who have tried to “phase out” lead in favor of substitutes.“I think most sportsmen want the same outcome, which is healthier wildlife, but the question is the best way to get there to make sure that the outdoor experience isn’t harmed in the short term,” O’Mara said.Lead poisoning from ammo is one of the biggest reasons California condors remain on the endangered species list, according to the conservation group The Peregrine Fund. In a move to protect its wildlife and environment, California has passed a bill to phase out all lead hunting ammunition by 2019. Bald eagles and other scavengers are also frequent victims of lead poisoning from ammunition, ingesting bullet fragments as they pick at carcasses.Humans who consume animals killed with lead bullets are also at risk. A 2009 study from researchers at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine documented a health risk from lead exposure to humans who eat venison. The report found 59 of 100 randomly selected packages of ground venison donated to the Community Action Food Pantry in North Dakota in the fall of 2007 were contaminated with lead fragments.Environmental advocates worry Zinke may target other measures meant to protect endangered animals. During his confirmation hearing, Zinke said he would consider rolling back Obama-era plans to halt oil and gas drilling in the Arctic, which environmental advocates say would threaten polar bears and other wildlife. Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States, said in a statement that the ban on lead ammo had the potential to be “one of the most effective policy decisions to protect wildlife.”“The revoked order would have stopped the needless, incidental poisoning of wild animals by toxic lead ammunition and fishing tackle on more than 150 million acres managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,” Pacelle said.CORRECTION: In a previous version of this article, the National Wildlife Federation was misidentified.How will Trump’s first 100 days affect you?

4,POLITICS,"Volkswagen Emissions Scandal Could Cause 1,200 More Premature Deaths",Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/volkswagen-deaths_us_58b99ff0e4b0b99894173edd,"""Dieselgate"" was already expected to end 60 lives early in the U.S. alone.",2017-03-03,"Pinocchio figures are lined up during a protest of environmental watchdog Greenpeace in front of the headquarters of German car maker Volkswagen in Wolfsburg, central Germany, on Sept. 25, 2015, during the company's supervisory board meeting.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9cca71500002100abd13c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In September 2015, Volkswagen Group admitted to fitting 11 million vehicles worldwide with software to cheat on government tests for diesel pollution. A month later, a team of scientists estimated that excess emissions from 482,000 of those cars sold in the United States would cause about 60 premature deaths across the country. Now, those same researchers project the death toll from 2.6 million affected cars sold in Germany between 2008 and 2015 to be 20 times higher, with at least 1,200 lives cut up to a decade short, according to a study published Friday in Environmental Research Letters. That number would have ballooned to 2,700 if German authorities hadn’t ordered the world’s biggest automaker to recall and repair every automobile. The affected vehicles ― sold under the Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen Group brands Audi, Skoda and Seat, as well as VW ― drove roughly 220 billion miles between 2008 and 2015, spewing 240,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, the source of smog and acid rain, into the air. Most of the people killed early won’t be Germans, according to the researchers. Emissions swept over the border by winds could cause 700 early deaths, the study estimated, including 160 in Poland, 84 in France and 72 in the Czech Republic. Even the United Kingdom could suffer 30 casualties.“It’s entirely because of transboundary air pollution,” Steven Barrett, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics who co-authored the study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told The Huffington Post by phone. “We didn’t even account for German vehicles driving outside Germany.”The team, composed of researchers from MIT and Harvard University, buttressed data used to study public health effects of the Volkswagen scandal with new information collected by Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority. The scientists determined their findings by applying widely accepted epidemiological techniques, gleaned from decades-long studies tracking the effects of exposure to pollution on large populations over time. The original data set came from the West Virginia University study that first uncovered Volkswagen cheating on U.S. tests, with emissions 20 times above the legal limit. In Germany, the vehicles exceeded the legal limit by a factor of five. The new research widens the fallout of an affair so widely condemned it became known as “Dieselgate.” Unlike other incidents of corporate malfeasance in the auto industry, at least one former employee blamed for designing the so-called “defeat devices” to cheat on emissions tests faces jail time. In January, Volkswagen agreed to pay $4.3 billion to U.S. regulators, a settlement negotiated down from $17.5 billion. The company set aside an additional $19.2 billion to deal with the issue.Volkswagen said it has completed repairs on more than 3 million vehicles in Europe, including 1.5 million in Germany, at a weekly rate of 250,000 automobiles.“We do not have a comment on this study,” Jeannine Ginivan, a Volkswagen spokeswoman, wrote in an email to HuffPost. “Volkswagen is committed to resolving the diesel matter as quickly as possible.”The problem isn’t Volkswagen’s alone. In the wake of the scandal, the Environmental Protection Agency vowed to step up its compliance testing. In January, the agency said it nailed a violator when it accused Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of using software to manipulate diesel emissions tests in about 104,000 vehicles. Barrett said he expects more companies to be implicated in the future.“Volkswagen were found out, but many diesel vehicles will be emitting above what people thought they’d emit, so it’s going to be a much wider-spread problem,” he said. “There may not be other ‘defeat devices’ in the same way, but very likely other manufacturers emit much higher on the road than when being certified.” In Germany, lawmakers began pushing for higher standards on emissions tests soon after the scandal broke. In the U.S., where tests are already more stringent, preventing future incidents may require stricter enforcement, Barrett said. That could be an issue. President Donald Trump proposed slashing one-quarter off the EPA’s budget and laying off 1 in 5 employees, virtually crippling the already hamstrung agency’s enforcement. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who has deep ties to the fossil fuel industry, has said he wants to overhaul the agency to focus on strict interpretation of regulations, vowing to rein in what he saw as federal overreach by his predecessor. As the costs of getting caught add up for Volkswagen, that could be welcome news to rivals.This article was updated with Volkswagen’s comment. "

Spanish Socialist MEP Iratxe Garcia-Perez was visibly appalled by Janusz Korwin-Mikke’s comments, in which he said women “must earn less than men.” “Of course women must earn less than men because they are weaker,” he said. “They are smaller, they are less intelligent, and they must earn less. That’s all.”Garcia-Perez was quick to respond, admonishing Korwin-Mikke for his outdated stance: According to your theory, I should not have the right be here, as a member of this parliament...I know it hurts and worries you that today women can sit in this house and represent European citizens with the same rights as you. I am here to defend all European women from men like you.(Watch their heated argument below.) The president of European Parliament is investigating whether or not Korwin-Mikke’s comments are in violation of the Parliament’s rules. According to the BBC, the rules state that the conduct of MEP’s “shall be characterized by mutual respect” and that MEP’s “shall not resort to defamatory, racist or xenophobic language or behavior in parliamentary debates.”If punished, this will not be Korwin-Mikke’s first time violating European Parliament standards. In 2015, he was sanctioned for making a Nazi salute, and in 2016 he was suspended for referring to refugees as “excrement.”"

8,ARTS & CULTURE,The Sartorial Genius Of Georgia O'Keeffe,Katherine Brooks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/georgia-okeeffe-living-modern-exhibition_us_58b8c345e4b05cf0f3ff548e,A new show at the Brooklyn Museum celebrates how the artist used fashion and photography to craft her persona.,2017-03-03,"Alfred Stieglitz, photo of Georgia O’Keeffe, circa 1920–22, gelatin silver print, 4½ by 3½ inches (11.4 by 9 centimeters).",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b8d18f1900003600bd6810.jpeg?cache=oin4uug7LW&ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"The great American painter Georgia O’Keeffe flooded canvases with color, conjuring plants and sunsets and lakes with a generous relationship to her palette. At the mere mention of her name, images of flowers surely come to mind, their petals spread open in front of the viewer, each stamen and stigma brushed with heavy doses of gold or pink or green.Yet images of the artist herself, who was born in 1887 in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, are mostly devoid of color. She preferred to memorialize herself in black and white, as evidenced by the astounding number of portraits for which she posed. In front of the camera ― whether it was held by her husband Alfred Stieglitz or a slew of other famous photographers including Ansel Adams, Philippe Halsman, Bruce Weber, Annie Leibowitz and Andy Warhol ― she frequently appeared in monochrome. She was more likely to brandish a cape and bowler hat, accessories coded male at the time, than a floral dress or broach.“Everyone wanted to redress her to make her appear more feminine,” Wanda Corn, a Professor Emerita in art history at Stanford, and the guest curator behind the Brooklyn Museum’s latest show, “Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern,” explained in a tour on Wednesday. But O’Keeffe was steadfast in her style: minimalist, modern, androgynous, deliberate.“She was black-and-white before she met Stieglitz,” Corn added, echoing the overall tone of her show. O’Keeffe was no one’s muse. Aware of her place in history before it was even set, she sat in front of cameras to take hold of her public persona. She dressed in monochrome, capes and all, to cleverly feed her growing status not just as an artist, but a pioneer of every aesthetic she touched.”Living Modern” bills itself as the first exhibition to examine O’Keeffe’s “self-crafted persona.” With a cascade of artworks paired with personal objects from O’Keeffe’s wardrobe, the show tells a story of how she evolved beyond the easel. The paintings and photographs and pieces of her closet ― handmade dresses, denim, hats, shoes, jewelry ― reveal how she owned her identity, and her eventual celebrity.The exhibition, separated into four parts, follows her early rise in the New York art world, where she had her first solo show at the Brooklyn Museum in 1927, to the years she spent traveling to the American Southwest, a region that would steal her heart, to the career she nurtured after Stieglitz died. The black-and-white custom suits she’d wear to meetings or openings in New York contrast with the chambray button-down shirts and cowboy hats that marked her New Mexico existence. She was rarely photographed in the latter; more often she was seen in the wrap dresses that constituted her signature outfit later in life, with little or no embellishments.“Nothing is less real than realism ― details are confusing,” she famously said. “It is only by selection, by elimination, by emphasis, that we get the real meaning of things.” “Living Modern” is part of the Brooklyn Museum’s “Year of Yes,” a series of programs that celebrate the 10th anniversary of the institution’s Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The decision to spotlight O’Keeffe’s clothes, in conjunction with an anniversary aimed at “reimagining feminism,” was made with careful thought.Corn has been planning the O’Keeffe tribute since at least 2011, Cody Hartley, senior director of collections and interpretation at the O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, told The Huffington Post. Much of the clothing on view comes from the two homes, once owned by the artist, that are now managed by the O’Keeffe.Would Corn have organized a similar exhibition for a male artist who’d lived his life so strategically through clothing? “Yes, I think she would have,” Hartley explained. Of course, the appeal of such an exhibition centered on O’Keeffe, rather than any male artist, is that her clothing ― whether she made pieces herself, commissioned them, or voraciously collected them ― was an extension of her agency in a male-dominated realm. She understood the power of putting on a cape, more often worn by male artists, and staring into a camera. She understood how her personal style, not just her art, could reflect her sincere commitment to modernism. She earned her title, Mother of American Modernism, by being in charge of her identity.The last room of the Brooklyn Museum show appropriately focuses on O’Keeffe’s life after Stieglitz, the artist who helped catapult her to fame. Before she died at the age of 98, O’Keeffe had become a beacon for a new wave of feminism, a celebrity reincarnated, at least for the 1960s generation who knew her only as a single artist.At the end of her life, O’Keeffe was the woman, independent in her career and style, who’d left New York City behind for the freedom and solitude of New Mexico. Living a life close to the land, she dabbled in organic gardening and cooking. She was “prescient” to a new audience of housewives, students and young feminists, Corn said, who weren’t so familiar with her early career alongside Stieglitz. They’d later read her interview with Andy Warhol in 1983, or read her 1974 New Yorker profile, or visited her major exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American art in 1970, which later traveled to Chicago and San Fransisco. Today, over 30 years after her death, O’Keeffe is still a celebrity. While she never fully embraced the feminism that adopted her as an icon during her life ― “Write about women. Or write about artists.

At the mere mention of her name, images of flowers surely come to mind, their petals spread open in front of the viewer, each stamen and stigma brushed with heavy doses of gold or pink or green.Yet images of the artist herself, who was born in 1887 in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, are mostly devoid of color. She preferred to memorialize herself in black and white, as evidenced by the astounding number of portraits for which she posed. In front of the camera ― whether it was held by her husband Alfred Stieglitz or a slew of other famous photographers including Ansel Adams, Philippe Halsman, Bruce Weber, Annie Leibowitz and Andy Warhol ― she frequently appeared in monochrome. She was more likely to brandish a cape and bowler hat, accessories coded male at the time, than a floral dress or broach.“Everyone wanted to redress her to make her appear more feminine,” Wanda Corn, a Professor Emerita in art history at Stanford, and the guest curator behind the Brooklyn Museum’s latest show, “Georgia O’Keeffe: Living Modern,” explained in a tour on Wednesday. But O’Keeffe was steadfast in her style: minimalist, modern, androgynous, deliberate.“She was black-and-white before she met Stieglitz,” Corn added, echoing the overall tone of her show. O’Keeffe was no one’s muse. Aware of her place in history before it was even set, she sat in front of cameras to take hold of her public persona. She dressed in monochrome, capes and all, to cleverly feed her growing status not just as an artist, but a pioneer of every aesthetic she touched.”Living Modern” bills itself as the first exhibition to examine O’Keeffe’s “self-crafted persona.” With a cascade of artworks paired with personal objects from O’Keeffe’s wardrobe, the show tells a story of how she evolved beyond the easel. The paintings and photographs and pieces of her closet ― handmade dresses, denim, hats, shoes, jewelry ― reveal how she owned her identity, and her eventual celebrity.The exhibition, separated into four parts, follows her early rise in the New York art world, where she had her first solo show at the Brooklyn Museum in 1927, to the years she spent traveling to the American Southwest, a region that would steal her heart, to the career she nurtured after Stieglitz died. The black-and-white custom suits she’d wear to meetings or openings in New York contrast with the chambray button-down shirts and cowboy hats that marked her New Mexico existence. She was rarely photographed in the latter; more often she was seen in the wrap dresses that constituted her signature outfit later in life, with little or no embellishments.“Nothing is less real than realism ― details are confusing,” she famously said. “It is only by selection, by elimination, by emphasis, that we get the real meaning of things.” “Living Modern” is part of the Brooklyn Museum’s “Year of Yes,” a series of programs that celebrate the 10th anniversary of the institution’s Sackler Center for Feminist Art. The decision to spotlight O’Keeffe’s clothes, in conjunction with an anniversary aimed at “reimagining feminism,” was made with careful thought.Corn has been planning the O’Keeffe tribute since at least 2011, Cody Hartley, senior director of collections and interpretation at the O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, told The Huffington Post. Much of the clothing on view comes from the two homes, once owned by the artist, that are now managed by the O’Keeffe.Would Corn have organized a similar exhibition for a male artist who’d lived his life so strategically through clothing? “Yes, I think she would have,” Hartley explained. Of course, the appeal of such an exhibition centered on O’Keeffe, rather than any male artist, is that her clothing ― whether she made pieces herself, commissioned them, or voraciously collected them ― was an extension of her agency in a male-dominated realm. She understood the power of putting on a cape, more often worn by male artists, and staring into a camera. She understood how her personal style, not just her art, could reflect her sincere commitment to modernism. She earned her title, Mother of American Modernism, by being in charge of her identity.The last room of the Brooklyn Museum show appropriately focuses on O’Keeffe’s life after Stieglitz, the artist who helped catapult her to fame. Before she died at the age of 98, O’Keeffe had become a beacon for a new wave of feminism, a celebrity reincarnated, at least for the 1960s generation who knew her only as a single artist.At the end of her life, O’Keeffe was the woman, independent in her career and style, who’d left New York City behind for the freedom and solitude of New Mexico. Living a life close to the land, she dabbled in organic gardening and cooking. She was “prescient” to a new audience of housewives, students and young feminists, Corn said, who weren’t so familiar with her early career alongside Stieglitz. They’d later read her interview with Andy Warhol in 1983, or read her 1974 New Yorker profile, or visited her major exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American art in 1970, which later traveled to Chicago and San Fransisco. Today, over 30 years after her death, O’Keeffe is still a celebrity. While she never fully embraced the feminism that adopted her as an icon during her life ― “Write about women.

Instead of characterizing the new money as contributions for the next election, Trump labeled the donations “debt retirement” funds for the last campaign — even though it had no debt, the groups allege. The campaign actually had a $7 million surplus, the complaint says, yet it continued to solicit donations to pay off debt.A false report could illegally increase the amount Trump could accept from contributors because it would allow donors to contribute both phony “debt retirement” funds for the last campaign on top of legal donations for the 2020 campaign, according to the complaint.Dozens of individual donors have already given $2,700, the maximum allowed by law, the complaint states. Calling that money debt retirement for 2016 would mean they could donate the maximum again as a campaign contribution. The Trump campaign reported nearly $760,000 in debt in its first post-election FEC filing — but it had more than enough cash on hand to cover it, according to the complaint. By its next filing period, the campaign reported no debt, but continued to raise “debt retirement” money, the complaint states.The complaint alleges that the campaign “violated [the Federal Election Campaign Act] and its implementing regulations by knowingly and willfully filing reports with the Commission that falsely attributed contributions for the 2020 primary election to the Committee’s debt retirement for the 2016 election.”Trump declared his candidacy for the next presidential election shortly after his inauguration.By law, Trump officially became a candidate as soon as he raised $5,000 after the election, the complaint alleges, and money raised once debt is cleared should immediately be treated as campaign funds.“In the rush to cash in on an unexpected election victory, the Trump campaign began raising and misreporting millions of dollars in campaign contributions more than two months before Trump was even sworn into office,” Common Cause vice president Paul Ryan said in a statement.There was no immediate response from the Trump campaign."

Brendan is in the fourth grade at the Condon K-8 School in South Boston. For Black History Month in February, all of the students in his class had to do a research project on an influential black figure, past or present. Each child created a presentation and dressed up as their icon of choice for a “wax museum,” in which they would recite a speech about their person’s history.When Brendan learned of the assignment, he immediately knew who he wanted to be: Tony winner Audra McDonald.The 9-year-old chose a 1920s-inspired dress, fishnets, heels and a wig inspired by McDonald’s recent role in Broadway’s “Shuffle Along.”On Feb. 28, the kids put on their “wax museum” exhibit, which featured historical figures like Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr., sports stars like Jackie Robinson and Michael Jordan, political icons like the Obamas, STEM heroes like Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson, and of course, a tiny Audra McDonald. “Brendan loved that he was able to share with his friends something he is passionate about,” his mom, Nicole, told The Huffington Post. “He told us no one knew who Audra McDonald was. Just as important as her awards and Tony records, Brendan has been inspired by the work she does on behalf of marriage equality and NOH8.

Nicole tweeted a photo of him in his costume, which she retweeted. “I am honored!!!!!” the Broadway star wrote. Brendan fell in love with theater when he saw his first show at Boston Children’s Theatre at the age of 4. “He told us that day that he wanted to be on stage,” Nicole said. The little boy attends the summer camp at BCT, has appeared in some of its productions throughout the year and performed with other theater programs as well. Last year, Brendan’s friends were able to see him perform in a show and do what he loves, which was an exciting experience for everyone.“His dream is to perform on Broadway,” Nicole said. “He spends hours learning about shows, actors and actresses and performing at home.”Brendan “screamed with excitement” when he sawMcDonald’s tweet about his project. “For him that kindness and acknowledgment meant the world,” said Nicole.

Hawaiian Airlines’ move is part of a worldwide research initiative to outfit commercial planes with tools that collect atmospheric data. Other airlines like Lufthansa and Air France are already collecting data with their planes abroad. Scientists say the data from Hawaiian’s plane will be especially helpful because of its many routes across the Pacific Ocean.As a travel option in itself, flying is far from sustainable.

15,POLITICS,This Virginia Democrat Is Crafting A Populist Anti-Trump Strategy,Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perriello-virginia-governor-trump-democrats_us_58b88befe4b0d2821b4cba3f,Tom Perriello hopes the #Resistance can put him in the Virginia governor's mansion.,2017-03-03,"President Barack Obama shakes hands with Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Va.) at a rally in Charlottesville on Oct. 29, 2010, days before midterm elections in which Democrats got shellacked and lost their majority in the House.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b891a21500002100abce69.jpeg?ops=crop_0_102_4200_2478%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Champagne corks popped in Charlottesville, Virginia, as hundreds of overjoyed Democrats crowded onto the brick-paved pedestrian thoroughfare to cheer the election results and toast the future. Not only had Barack Obama been elected the next president of the United States, but liberal voters had ousted arch-conservative Rep. Virgil Goode from Congress, replacing him with a young Democrat named Tom Perriello.Perriello’s victory on Nov. 8, 2008, seemed to symbolize a sea change in Virginia politics. One of the most reliably conservative states in the country for more than four decades, Virginia was starting to look like the edge of a new Democratic wedge into the South. But the good times didn’t last. Within two years, Perriello had been voted out in the tea party wave that swept half of Virginia’s U.S. House Democrats from office. Today, Republicans control both chambers of the state Legislature, and the governor’s mansion is up for grabs this fall in what will be one of the most closely watched political contests of the year. Perriello is back, campaigning for the gubernatorial post as an unapologetic progressive, hoping to win both his party’s nomination and the November election by positioning himself as an ultra-liberal antidote to President Donald Trump.“What people want to see right now is that willingness to stand up to Trump and limit those really unconscionable and unconstitutional moves and also have a positive vision,” Perriello said in an interview with the HuffPost politics podcast “So That Happened.” “A lot of the pundits around Virginia said Trump is not a local issue, it’s not a Virginia issue, and I told some of them that is a really elite perspective.” Listen to the full interview, embedded below. The discussion begins at the 15:40 mark: Perriello jumped into the race in January, roiling a primary field that Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe had cleared for the state’s lieutenant governor, Ralph Northam. Perriello insists he’s focused on defeating a Republican in the fall, but he isn’t above barbing his primary opponent.“I don’t really think of Ralph Northam as my opponent … I’ll let others talk about Ralph Northam,” Perriello told HuffPost before launching a brief attack: “This week we did find out that he voted for George W. Bush twice back at a time when we were trying to fight against the very massive tax cuts for the rich that got us into this economic trouble.”Northam told The New York Times in February that he had been apolitical during the Bush years and now considered the votes to be “wrong.” Perriello has blemishes of his own with the mainstream of the Democratic Party. In 2009 he voted to prohibit insurance companies from covering abortion under the Affordable Care Act, a vote he says he regrets. But Perriello’s pitch is mostly focused on a wonky brand of economic populism that he thinks Democrats can muster to counter Trump’s thunderous demagoguery. Perriello sees corporate monopoly power elbowing out small businesses and undermining rural economies, and he is worried about the potential for automation to swiftly replace large numbers of workers with robots. He’s prone to riffs about issues like excessive concentration in the beer market, where two conglomerates control over 90 percent of production.“We need to get away from some of the monopoly approaches on energy and food production,” Perriello says. “Look at the impact of those small breweries around Virginia! It’s been enormous, and that’s a tiny part of the market!” Monopoly is a hot topic in D.C. intellectual circles, one that often competes with the rise of the robots as an explanation for the country’s economic troubles. Perriello picks both. “I have a foot in both camps of the nerd conversation going on up here,” he says, which has to be part of what he calls a “vision of inclusive economic growth.” “I’m going out and spending time in Trump country and with Trump voters,” Perriello says. “Democrats cannot run on a status quo message. And we have to understand how much pain and disruption there’s been in the economy and have a better set of ideas.”Trump pushes a fiery brand of hyper-nationalist populism in which he, the leader of the movement, yells at things that are bad for working people ― like a company closing a factory and moving production to Mexico. Before he’d even taken office, Trump scored a populist political win when he got a heating-and-cooling company to keep its furnace plant in Indiana. Trump’s success with the Carrier Corp. stunned a political establishment that has long told blue-collar workers they were doomed to lose their jobs to robots or foreigners. But Perriello said forcing old factories to stay in the U.S. won’t work as a populist strategy. He called Trump’s deal “the Carrier con job” because it ignores the economics working against workers ― and because Carrier’s remaining workers will probably be phased out in favor of robots anyway. “What they did was use taxpayers to subsidize the death of additional manufacturing jobs in America,” Perriello said. During the campaign, both Trump and Democratic primary candidate Bernie Sanders repeatedly bashed Carrier’s plan to close the plant and fire 1,400 workers. After he won, Trump used the levers of power to make Carrier’s parent company, a federal contractor called United Technologies, reconsider. Part of the deal gave United Technologies $7 million in state tax credits over 10 years. In exchange, 800 Carrier workers would stay on the job ― but it’s not clear for how long. “We’re going to make a $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive,” United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes said in a CNBC interview after the deal. “What that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.”Vice President Mike Pence, then governor of Indiana, had directed the state’s economic development office to see what it could do for Carrier. It’s typical for any governor to try to entice big companies with tax breaks, but Perriello said he’d try to help the state’s economy with a more populist, bottom-up economic strategy. “If we focused as much attention on helping people start a business or helping small businesses add someone on the payroll, we’d be going in a better direction than what we tend to do, whether it’s stadiums or other things,” he said.

Trump Is No Exception.,Ariel Edwards-Levy and Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-speech-polls_us_58b96b8de4b0b9989416b73b,The first round of surveys on Tuesday's speech find reactions were largely positive.,2017-03-03,Most Americans say it would be too risky to give presidents more power,http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/03/02115022/Democracy_2.png,"Donald Trump’s address found a favorable reception from its audience. Most Americans don’t want to give the presidency more power. And Democrats are now more likely than Republicans to be scared about the world. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 3, 2017.DONALD TRUMP’S SPEECH TO CONGRESS GETS LARGELY POSITIVE MARKS FROM VIEWERS - The president’s speech on Tuesday was positively received by much of its audience, according to two “snap” polls from CNN and CBS, and a subsequent survey from Gallup. In Gallup’s survey, 57 percent of Americans who watched the speech or followed news coverage of it, rated it as excellent or good. CNN/ORC and CBS/YouGov surveys found that 57 percent and 76 percent, respectively, of viewers who agreed to be polled after the speech gave it positive marks.A few important caveats - HuffPollster, last year: “State of the Union speeches have a celebrated history of not making much of an impact. A 2010 Gallup analysis found that the speeches delivered since the beginning of the Carter administration resulted, on average, in a ‘less than a 1 percentage-point decline’ in presidential approval….Most Americans simply aren’t watching the addresses, let alone paying close attention to the content. In a 2015 HuffPost/YouGov poll, about one-quarter said they’d watched the previous State of the Union, and only 4 percent reported remembering it very well. (Given people’s predilection to pretend they’re paying more attention to civic events than they are, those numbers are likely a little high.) The people most likely to tune in to watch any president are also those least likely to need any convincing. Democrats [were] consistently more likely than Republicans or independents to say they’re interested in watching [Barack] Obama’s speeches — just as Republicans were more likely to watch George W. Bush.” [HuffPost, more on the pitfalls of “instant” polls]The same pattern holds true for Trump’s speech, which attracted somewhat lower ratings than Obama’s first speech to Congress, and saw a Republican-heavy viewership compared to the makeup of the American public as a whole. Given the advantage of a friendly audience, it’s not all that surprising that Trump ― like past presidents ― received a generally warm reception. In fact, CNN, which has tracked reactions to such speeches through several presidencies, notes that Trump’s two immediate predecessors both received ratings about 10 points higher for their initial addresses. More from the surveys:CNN/ORC snap poll: “President Donald Trump’s first address to Congress received largely positive reviews from viewers, with 57% who tuned in saying they had a very positive reaction to the speech, according to a new CNN/ORC poll of speech-watchers….In this case, the pool of speech-watchers was about eight points more Republican than the population as a whole….While the 57% who said they had a very positive reaction to Trump’s speech outpaces the marks received by his predecessor for any of his recent State of the Union addresses, they fell below the reviews either Barack Obama or George W. Bush received for either of their initial addresses to Congress.” [CNN]CBS/YouGov snap poll: “Viewers nationwide strongly approved of President Trump’s speech Tuesday night, with many Democrats joining Republicans in calling it ‘presidential’ and positive in tone. Republicans and Independents found it ‘unifying,’ though Democrats were slower to come around on that measure….Republicans did tune in to watch it in much greater numbers than Democrats (as a president’s party typically does) which bolstered those approval numbers. Forty percent of Democrats at least somewhat approved; 18 percent strongly approved.” [CBS]Gallup: “President Donald Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday night had a positive effect on many of those who watched it or read news coverage about it later. Almost six in 10 of this group rated the address as excellent or good, and more than one in three said it made them more confident in Trump’s abilities to carry out his duties as president….Those who watched the speech seem to be in general agreement. Speech watchers skewed Republican, so to some degree this positive reaction reflects the friendly nature of Trump’s audience. Democrats who watched were not necessarily hostile in their reactions, but rather were most likely to say that the speech was just OK and that it made no difference in their views of Trump as president ― views that of course were strongly negative to begin with. It’s unusual for a single speech to make a major difference in how the public views a president.” [Gallup]OPEN ELECTIONS, CHECKS AND BALANCES SEEN AS ESSENTIAL TO DEMOCRACY - Pew Research: “Large majorities of the public, Republicans and Democrats alike, say open and fair elections and a system of governmental checks and balances are essential to maintaining a strong democracy in the United States. However, there is less consensus about the importance of other aspects of a strong democracy – notably, the freedom of news organizations to criticize political leaders….Just 17% of Americans say that ‘many of the country’s problems could be dealt with more effectively if U.S. presidents didn’t have to worry so much about Congress or the courts,’ while 77% take the view that ‘it would be too risky to give U.S. presidents more power to deal directly with many of the country’s problems’ – including sizable majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (87%) and Republicans and Republican leaners (65%).” [Pew] Divides by partisanship, less by age - More from Pew: “Republicans (68%) are less likely than Democrats (88%) to view the right to nonviolent protest as very important. Similarly, while majorities in both parties say it is very important that the rights of people with unpopular views are protected, fewer Republicans (66%) than Democrats (80%) say this.The sharpest partisan disagreement is over the importance of the freedom of news organizations to criticize political leaders….There is little difference across age groups in the importance given to checks and balances, open and fair elections, and press freedom to maintaining a strong American democracy.” MOST AMERICANS AREN’T ‘VERY SCARED’ ABOUT THE WORLD - HuffPollster: “Only about a quarter of Americans say they’re ‘very scared’ by current world events, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds, and fewer than 1 in 10 harbor significant worries that they will be personally affected by an act of terrorism. Overall, 23 percent of the public say they’re very scared about the way things are going in the world today. Another 41 percent say they’re somewhat scared, and 27 percent say they’re not very or not at all scared…. Democrats are now 26 points likelier than they were last fall to say they’re ‘very scared’ about the way things are going in the world. Republicans, by contrast, are 18 points less likely than they were last year to describe themselves as ‘very scared.’” [HuffPost] HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

17,POLITICS,Here's The Cheap And Easy Way To Get Credit For A Presidential ‘Pivot’,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/media-trump-presidential-pivot_us_58b89f9ae4b0d2821b4cd157,The pathologies of the pundit class ride again!,2017-03-03,"Apparently, Donald Trump got all presidential Tuesday night.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b8bc6a1900003300bd67cd.jpeg?cache=oaoYiFK2xY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Well, so much for that “pivot.” On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump slowly read some complete English sentences from a teleprompter, and the pundit class went wild, declaring to everyone who would listen that the great transformation of a reality television boor into a real-live human of presidential-like substance had finally transpired. Some hours later came the next few turns of the screw: a slew of U.S. officials disputing Trump’s claim that his botched SEAL raid had yielded actionable intelligence, and a new Washington Post bombshell intimating that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak ― in direct contradiction to testimony Sessions had offered at his Senate confirmation hearings.And with that, the White House was once again plunged into chaos, the media narrative had been sent to Media Narrative Heaven, and all those who’d boldly proclaimed the at-long-last-coming of the presidential pivot deservedly found themselves wearing the dunce cap. On this week’s edition of the “So That Happened” podcast, we examine the extraordinary turn of events.It’s anybody’s guess why the commentariat would get so invested in the hope of a Trump transformation. The search for life on Mars is closer to being realized than the quest to discover the “better” Donald Trump. And it’s not like there hasn’t been sufficient warning. For the past month-and-a-half, the Trump White House has been a chaotic farce, each day hitting a new vein of flop sweat ― which then floods the newshole to bursting.It’s not just the constant leaks, astonishing revelations and confused policies that underscore the disorder. This White House fails at the mundane mechanics of the office, like briefing relevant agencies on executive orders, learning the ethics guidance that would forestall easily preventable errors, and remembering not to conduct important national security discussions in full view of the Mar-a-Lago membership.At this point, imagining that Trump is going to “pivot” is akin to Charlie Brown believing that this time he’s going to kick the football Lucy is holding straight through the uprights. Stay tuned for the new Peanuts special, “Well, It’s A Hard Lesson, Charlie Brown.”The news that arrived the day after Trump’s speech to Congress dealt a similar lesson. But why was that speech in particular seen as the force that would arrest the Trump White House’s continued, certain trajectory? It offered no real shift in policy or governing philosophy. The big announcement was Trump’s intention to create some special office to demonize immigrants under the guise of supporting victims of crime. It shouldn’t be lost on anyone that victims of crime already get a lot of state support and that the immigrant community is much less likely to commit criminal acts than the rest of us.There was, of course, a lengthy applause break for the widow of fallen Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens ― which Trump used to perform his “appreciate the congrats” routine, stealing another man’s adulation for himself. Which came, by the way, not long after Trump denied any personal responsibility for Owen’s death. One wonders what might have happened if President Barack Obama had pulled a similar self-congratulatory stunt on the back of a dead soldier. Or, at least, I thought it was right to wonder what might have happened. Apparently, this is OK now.So what was it that sold Pundit World so completely on a presidential pivot? How did they come to extract this idea and so assuredly herald it to their audiences?It goes without saying that the media have had a fraught relationship with Donald Trump. But beyond our tendency to shovel him onto our screens willy-nilly and our failure to come to grips with his appeal, there are deeper pathologies at work. Over at Deadspin, Alex Pareene deftly identified one of them:Here’s what you have to understand about the sort of people who become anchors, nonpartisan pundits, centrist columnists, and cable news political correspondents: They didn’t sign up to be the resistance. They don’t want Donald Trump to fail. They want him to “pivot” and “act presidential.”This is true. There are an astounding number of people in this industry who don’t really live in America in any meaningful way. They make no claim to being civic participants. They are merely audience members at the Great Drama of Politics, offering up their Statlerisms and Waldorfitude from the balconies above the fray, seeing the citizens who get ground up in the gears of our politics ― the victims of travel bans and financial calamities ― as mere background actors in a bad movie about Great Men (mostly men, anyway), the power they wield and their electoral fortunes. To this crowd, the demonization of immigrants or the misery of foreclosure victims is just an interesting part of the scenery. Politics is merely a game to them, and they’re the sports reporters. “Team Red really surmounted the challenge of the opioid crisis on their way to a touchdown, but we’ll see if Team Blue can capitalize on North Carolina’s transgender bathroom ban!” Work long enough in this industry, and you’ll discover that one of the ways you can really limit your career opportunities is to insist on maintaining some sort of kinship with ordinary people. More often than not, the rewards accrue to those who can most effectively confuse objectivity with viewlessness.This all goes along, day by day, and it helps to instill the notion that the media don’t really have a duty to anybody. But that isn’t entirely true. Back in September, the New Republic’s Brian Beutler found where the media’s duty truly lies while picking through some “basic anthropological facts about the press itself”:The press is not a pro-democracy trade, it is a pro-media trade. By and large, it doesn’t act as a guardian of civic norms and liberal institutions ― except when press freedoms and access itself are at stake. Much like an advocacy group or lobbying firm will reserve value judgments for issues that directly touch upon the things they’re invested in, reporters and media organizations are far more concerned with things like transparency, the treatment of reporters, and first-in-line access to information of public interest, than they are with other forms of democratic accountability.Emphasis mine, because that last sentence holds the key to this whole mystery. What part of Trumpism always seems to animate the media to action and skepticism? Attacks on the media. And what one feature of Trump’s typical orations was noticeably missing from his address to Congress? An attack on the media. If Trump sneaks away from the press pool to have a steak dinner, you will have every J-School mope with a Twitter account lecturing him about what a terrible contravention of norms that is. If he keeps calling the press the “enemy of the people,” well, I don’t know, media executives might have to rethink the White House Correspondents Dinner, harrumph harrumph! Meanwhile, anyone with any relevant political interests beyond this one part of the First Amendment is standing around wondering where all that passion goes when they’re the ones under the hammer. In an amazing turn of events, it turns out that the White House was completely shocked that they’d won the fervent praise of the pundit class so cheaply:Don’t be shocked yourself. This is the pattern you will see time and again: As soon as Trump gives the media a moment’s peace, he becomes “presidential.” Nothing else ― the lies, the divisive policy proposals, the gratuitous ego-stroking ― matters. Flatter the press, earn a pivot. This is how that works.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here. "
18,HEALTHY LIVING,More Than 80 Percent Of Patient Advocacy Groups Accept Industry Money,"Gene Emery, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/more-than-80-percent-of-patient-advocacy-groups-accept-industry-money_us_58b99838e4b0b99894172adc,And those organizations don't always disclose their industry ties.,2017-03-03,"Eight out of 10 patient advocacy groups accept money from pharmaceutical and medical device companies, creating potential conflicts of interest, according to new research.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9a4c31a00003400f41738.jpeg?cache=CEs3MDnbpK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - An examination of more than a hundred of the largest U.S. nonprofit organizations created to improve health and fight disease has found that more than 8 in 10 get financial support from companies involved in the drug, biotechnology and medical device industry.In addition, over a third have at least one industry official on their governing board and, in 12 percent of the 104 organizations analyzed, an industry official was listed as leading the governing board.The tally raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest among groups that claim to be looking out for the best interest of patients but whose advocacy may be influenced by industries that have a financial interest in certain treatments.“Concerns have been raised that industry-supported patient-advocacy organizations have spoken out for access to drugs with questionable therapeutic benefit and remained silent on policy proposals, such as drug-pricing reforms, that might benefit their constituents,” the research team from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia writes in the New England Journal of Medicine.The influence might be even more extensive than the numbers suggest, say the authors, led by Matthew McCoy, a postdoctoral fellow in the university’s department of medical ethics and health policy.Some of the 104 groups, all with annual revenues of more than $7.5 million, don’t publish detailed information on their sources of revenue or members of their governing board.What was available showed that at least 39 percent of the health-oriented public advocacy groups each got a least $1 million a year from industry.The websites of only 12 percent of the organizations posted conflict-of-interest policies for managing such potential problems.The findings don’t necessarily mean that the organizations have been compromised, McCoy told Reuters Health.“I don’t want to impugn them,” he said. “But I think we have a right to know more. If an organization receives more than 50 percent of its support from a drug or device company, I might take what they say with a grain of salt.”The groups ranged from the New York-based Child Mind Institute which was the only organization of the 104 that explicitly says it does not accept industry support, to the National Hemophilia Foundation, whose 2014 annual report indicates that it received 50 percent to 83 percent of its annual revenue from drug or device companies. (Like many organizations, the foundation only reported donations in a range of dollars.)The foundation responded to Reuters Health with a statement saying that industry officials are prohibited from serving on its board and the organization “has never and will never advocate for any single treatment or group of treatments before legislators, or public and private payers. Instead, NHF advocates for all FDA-approved therapies, and will continue to fight to ensure that individuals with bleeding disorders have access to the therapies they need.”Eighteen groups didn’t report getting money from industry, but 13 of those provided no donor information at all.Of 59 groups that reported the amounts of their donations, 11 received at least 10 percent of their financial support from industry donations.They included the American Diabetes Association, the Epilepsy Foundation, the Arthritis Foundation, the National Kidney Foundation, and the National Hemophilia Foundation.The groups that responded to a Reuters Health inquiry said those donations don’t influence policy.For example, the Kidney Foundation, in a statement, said that although it does accept financial support from industry, “this support does not drive policy positions, priorities, mission or objectives” and the sole industry member on its 24-member board is prohibited from voting on matters related to that person’s business.Arthritis Foundation president Ann Palmer released a statement to Reuters Health saying, “Our corporate partners pay to sponsor events and tools. To keep the needs of people with arthritis at the center of what we do, the Foundation makes advocacy and position decisions independently - our corporate partners do not shape our agenda or advocacy efforts.”The organization would not allow industry members to be on its governing board, she said.An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association among the organizations that receive at least 10 percent of their financial support from industry. The organization tells Reuters Health that in 2016, only 1.04% of its revenue was contributed by pharmaceutical/medical device/biotech companies.SOURCE: bit.ly/2lYvxVA New England Journal of Medicine, online March 1, 2017."
19,MEDIA,Trump White House Gives Local TV Reporters A Seat At The Table,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-regional-media_us_58b8426fe4b0a8ded67af047,The uptick in access to the regional press comes amid war with national media outlets.,2017-03-03,"Jacqueline Policastro, Washington bureau chief for Gray television, appeared after Monday's dinner on local broadcasts in Anchorage, Green Bay, Flint and Roanoke.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b844ac18000036000290d1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As journalists left the White House following dinner Monday night with President Donald Trump, press secretary Sean Spicer told attendees that the administration invited them to honor the power of local television.Such praise may seem at odds with the Trump White House’s ongoing media war, which two days earlier included the president claiming journalists fabricate sources and the press secretary barring news outlets from a press briefing. But when Trump described NBC, ABC and CBS as “the enemy of the American people,” he presumably meant the big national networks, based in New York City and with large Washington operations, as opposed to the local NBC, ABC and CBS affiliate stations scattered throughout the country. The 18 regional reporters who enjoyed braised short ribs Monday night in the state dining room hailed from six television companies ― Hearst, Scripps, Gray, Sinclair, Cox, Nexstar ― that combined own hundreds of such stations, beaming into millions of Americans’ living rooms. Trump still had lunch Tuesday with national news anchors, a long-running tradition whereby the president previews that evening’s State of the Union address, or in this case, a speech to a joint session of Congress. But the White House’s decision to expand the rollout with a regional press, featuring the president and top officials, along with appearances by Vice President Mike Pence and first lady Melania Trump, signaled that officials see value in also engaging, even courting, local reporters.The private dinner follows Trump recently calling on a reporter from a Sinclair-owned station at a bilateral press conference and Spicer opening up daily briefings to local affiliates via Skype, a move that’s been both praised for democratizing the press corps and looked upon warily as a way to potentially deflect away from national issues and controversies.Jacqueline Policastro, the Washington bureau chief for Gray Television, said she appreciated Spicer’s post-dinner comment, which to her demonstrated an acknowledgement of the role local TV stations play in informing millions of busy Americans each day. “Our responsibility in the minute-and-a-half on a local newscast is to provide them political content that has value,” Policastro told The Huffington Post.Policastro oversees a bureau of seven Washington-based journalists who produce segments distributed to Gray’s stations in 54 media markets.While Gray’s more general political news segments may run on stations nationwide, interviews with members of Congress are produced for specific stations directly reaching their constituents. Lawmakers have long recognized the importance of appearing on their local TV newscasts, evident in Policastro and her team nabbing 80 interviews with members of Congress around Trump’s address.Policastro said that many of the markets Gray covers are underserved when it comes to national political news, and so her team’s reports are distributed widely to stations across the country. Her post-dinner report, with details not only on the dinner but also Trump’s preview of the speech, potentially aired in dozens of local affiliates, including cities such as Roanoke, Virginia; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Flint, Michigan; and Anchorage, Alaska.Policastro said she tells her reporters daily that they always “need to think about who we’re talking to, directly to the people in the community where we broadcast” because “that’s who matters to us.” It’s this direct engagement, perhaps, that has led Americans to view local news as more trustworthy than national media (which is only being demonized on a near-daily basis by the most powerful person in the world). Trump already uses Twitter to circumvent the national media filter, and one of his top advisers recently suggested that turning to local TV anchors, in some cases, is more effective than sitting down with Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper. In December, Politico reported that top White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner said at a private gathering that their presidential campaign had struck a deal with Sinclair to run interviews with Trump without commentary. Sinclair, which owns 173 stations and has been viewed as favoring Republican candidates in the past, denied giving preferential treatment to Trump.But regardless of whether a “deal” was struck, Kushner indicated at the same forum why engaging Sinclair was more beneficial than CNN in a state like Ohio. Kushner, who has privately complained to CNN executives about its Trump coverage, pointed out that the national TV network only reaches around 30,000 people the crucial swing state, while Sinclair reaches 250,000.“It’s math,” Kushner said.Here’s some more math to support a strategy of targeting Trump supporters through local media. Trump won Gray’s markets 57.7 percent to Clinton’s 36.5 percent, with a total of 2.8 million more votes going to the Republican nominee, according to Policastro. The Obama White House also made the president available to dozens of local TV affiliates during the 2012 campaign, at times to the consternation of national journalists seeking interviews. The Trump White House did not provide anyone to discuss hosting a regional press dinner and how it fits with a broader media strategy. But another attendee, Mark Greenblatt of Scripps, offered a theory. “They’ve done some polling and they feel like that folks that they really want to connect to ... learn a lot about the world through local TV stations,” Greenblatt said on a radio show Tuesday morning. “So they chose us to bring in to say, hey we really want to value you, we really want to create relationships with you, and we want these direct distribution channels without having to go through the previous gatekeepers.”"
20,ENTERTAINMENT,"Just A Reminder That Women Dominate Pop Music, But Still Rarely Produce It",Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-music-production-max-martin_us_58b6cb66e4b0a8a9b787aff5,"Despite its image, pop music is dominated behind the scenes by men.",2017-03-03,"Max Martin, pop songwriter extraordinaire, points at something at the 2015 Grammy Awards.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b99cf71500002200abd05c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, one of the biggest names in pop music gave a very rare interview. And no, we’re not talking Beyoncé.Producer Max Martin spoke to the Swedish publication Di about his process of writing hits for many big names, including but not limited to Adele, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Selena Gomez, Britney Spears, The Weeknd and The Backstreet Boys.The interview mostly dealt with his career and process of songwriting. But it also touched on his thoughts about including more women in crucial behind-the-scenes roles.“I don’t care where people are from, what their background is. If you’re killing it, you’re in,” Martin began.The Swedish producer doesn’t like attention, so that’s why you might not know his name. But few people likely understand the music industry’s inner-workings over the past two decades quite like he does, which is what makes his take on the issue particularly noteworthy. “It’s crucial that we get more women in on the technical side,” he added. “Today, there are many great female songwriters but there are very few women producers. We need to change that.”It’s true that, if women aren’t finding their way into production roles, it’ll take industry bigwigs like Martin to help them up. But that’s not all they’ll have to do.When they’re not in front of a microphone, women in the studio have always had it tough. Still today, there are so few in music production that no one even bothers to count. The issue went largely unnoticed by the general public until a spate of sexual harassment claims cropped up a couple years ago, most notably Kesha’s lawsuit against Dr. Luke, another power producer and a mentee of Martin’s. Her lawsuit brought the process of creating all of that inescapable pop candy ― that is, hours spent in male-dominated spaces ― into the national spotlight, if only for the duration of a couple of news cycles.For what seemed like the first time, the reality of music industry culture came into focus, and what we saw wasn’t nice.Perhaps that revelation came as a surprise. Unlike other segments of the entertainment industry ― looking at you, Hollywood film ― women are front-and-center in pop, where they are sometimes known as much for their image in tabloids as their passionate vocals. (Their male counterparts, meanwhile, are rarely subjected to the same level of visual scrutiny ― Justin Bieber being an exception.) Pop’s image is that of a space where women reign. It’s a clever trick on the part of record companies and people who stand to make millions off women’s appearances in addition to their powerful pipes, but, not shockingly, it doesn’t tell the full story. A quick look at who takes the stage when the Album of the Year is announced at the Grammys says everything: Behind Adele (in 2017) and Swift (in 2016) is a crowd of men. In pop, women sing, often write or perform instrumental bits in songs; rarely does anyone who’s not a man handle the technical side of production. That means that while women may be the faces of pop, behind-the-scenes work is a space composed of men. It also means expecting women to fit the “cool girl” bill and ignore sometime misbehavior ― because music isn’t about HR bureaucracy and filing complaints with managers. It’s about throwing your heart into something, following your dreams, and having a fantastic time doing it. So it has been, anyway, for ages. Asked about his active attempts to involve more women producers ― after working with a “homogenous” slate of Swedish men in the ‘90s ― Martin had a somewhat encouraging response, heaping praise on one woman he’s started working with, the Swedish singer-songwriter-producer Laleh.“Laleh is a genius. The best way to change things around is to bring in more role models like her. It sucks that there are so many men in my profession,” he said.It does suck, for the women who might be interested in production work but are assumed incapable, even if they aren’t. The musician and producer Grimes explained in a 2014 interview with Fader how men in one studio discouraged her from making herself useful after a session.“I was like, ‘Well, can I just edit my vocals?’ And they’d be like, ‘No, just tell us what to do, and we’ll do it.’ And then a male producer would come in, and he’d be allowed to do it. It was so sexist,” she said. “I was, like, aghast. It made me really disillusioned with the music industry.”It also sucks for any women who’ve experienced what Kesha says she’s gone through ― gross mistreatment at the hands of a male producer. Elevating more women producers behind the scenes is certainly a step toward parity. But if the men already there are continually allowed to create unwelcome spaces, it’s not going to fix the problem ― and part of that stems from the way music professionals seem to view themselves.Whereas Hollywood embraces itself as an industry ― loving nothing more than to gaze at its reflection, pushing out films about the process of making a film or becoming an actress (looking at you, “La La Land”) ― pop seems allergic to mirrors. For some reason or another, music has managed to aggressively protect the idea that it’s nothing but the organic product of a few pure, creative souls who head into a small glass room to do their thing and out comes a hit.

Meadows vows he'll vote against any bill similar to the repeal bill that leaked two weeks ago.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9ab5f1a00003700f4174a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― As the GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act becomes less of a pamphlet and more of a bill, House Republican leaders are hoping recalcitrant conservatives in their party who claim they can sink those efforts won’t be willing to cross President Donald Trump.GOP leaders are insisting that Trump is with them. Yet nobody is quite certain where the president stands on the current repeal bill ― or where he ultimately will be.Republicans were listening carefully to Trump’s words during his address to Congress Tuesday night, and while he didn’t get out in front of the repeal and replace plan, he did seem to back key parts of GOP leaders’ yet-to-be released bill.During a closed-door conference Thursday morning, GOP leaders did everything they could to circle, underline and highlight anything they interpreted as clues that the president supports them. They went so far as to cut up clips of Trump’s speech and tie his vague words to specific components of their plan.In the House GOP leadership edit of Trump’s address, for instance, “tax credits” become “advance refundable tax credits” ― a controversial cornerstone of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s replacement plan that conservatives say is nothing more than another monthly welfare check.The leadership response is less focused on the policy, however, and more on raw power. Their message to their colleagues at Thursday’s gathering: Whatever you may think of the plan, Trump supports it. And that’s all you should need to know.Some members drove that message home ― totally not at the direction of leadership, they insist ― when they lined up at the microphones and talked about how Trump was very popular in their districts and how they would get “fried,” in the words of Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), if they didn’t support the Obamacare repeal.What GOP leaders and their allies lack in subtlety, they may make up for in sheer momentum. The plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was looking like it could be in real trouble early in the week, when more conservative Republicans were drawing hard lines on the legislation and members were coming out saying they couldn’t support the bill if it looked like the one that leaked two weeks ago.The House Freedom Caucus took an official position against any repeal that is weaker than the one Republicans passed in 2015. Those roughly 40 House Freedom Caucus members, as well as the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, were speaking out against the advance refundable tax credits that would be part of a health care plan.But the mood has shifted a bit since Trump’s speech, even though Trump was unclear and barely offered an endorsement of GOP leaders’ plan. “He didn’t say ‘advance’ or ‘refundable,’” Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) noted later in the week. “He did say ‘tax credits,’ and I’ll give him that.”Meadows swears he won’t support a repeal that includes those sorts of payments, saying they would functionally create a new entitlement. But he also won’t say exactly how many votes he truly has to say “no” to a repeal. Most conservatives were hesitant to speculate on the record whether they could actually hold strong, though Meadows told HuffPost on Friday that he thought it’d be unlikely that Republicans could pass the current bill.“It is clear, that without substantial changes to the replacement portion of the bill, there is little chance of reaching the 218 vote threshold,” Meadows said. “HFC continues to look for common ground on conservative areas of concern and we remain optimistic that a path forward will ultimately be found.”But if Trump’s tepid endorsement was enough to move the mood of the conference, imagine the pressure the president could apply if he started calling members ― or perhaps worse, started tweeting about them. After years of shouting about how Congress needs to repeal Obamacare, are Republicans from some of the most pro-Trump districts really willing to oppose a repeal plan that Trump supports?“I know from my constituents back home, if the president is in support of it ― my district is a 68 percent Trump district ― if the president’s in support of it, that gives them a certain comfort level,” Freedom Caucus member Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-Va.) told HuffPost this week.One GOP member said he thought the plan from House GOP leaders was to speed through debate on this bill and “shove it down” other Republicans’ throats, essentially daring conservatives to oppose Trump and an Obamacare repeal.Moving forward quickly with a repeal plan would have the added benefit of not letting opposition outside of Congress harden. Moderate Republicans who often fold to pressure from their leaders would get on board and maybe just hope the Senate could temper the most controversial provisions ― or that the legislation would just fail there entirely.The little secret among House moderates is that an Obamacare repeal vote is easier for them if it’s just going to die in the Senate. No one is clear on what the Senate can pass, both because of the chamber’s rules on reconciliation that could subject parts of the House bill to 60 votes, and because some of the moderates in that chamber may have more of an appetite to hold up a repeal over items like gutting the Medicaid expansion.The Senate is hardly discussing Obamacare at this point, bogged down in confirmations and the latest revelations about Trump and Russia. And senators seem perfectly fine with the House acting first on health care.Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) met with a small group of Freedom Caucus members on Wednesday, and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price has been meeting with members to allay their concerns as well. “And I would say that the discussions are fruitful,” Meadows said.But there are plenty of provisions in the Obamacare repeal bill that conservatives don’t like. “Advance monthly refundable tax credits is a euphemism for a new monthly entitlement check,” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) told HuffPost on Friday, sounding perfectly at ease with voting against the legislation.It’s just a question of whether there are enough conservatives willing to take the heat, and whether the measure’s other pitfalls will cause hang-ups for other members. For instance, hardly anyone is talking about how the legislation is expected to raise the cap on how much insurance companies can charge seniors compared to young people. The ratio is currently 3-to-1 in the Affordable Care Act, but the GOP’s plan would change it to 5-to-1.Still, leadership’s plan to keep the bill hidden until the last possible moment before a markup, move it through committees as quickly as possible and get it to the floor before the end of the month could work ― especially if only a handful of Republicans have the mettle to buck Trump.This story has been updated with a comment from Mark Meadows."

The record rains soaking the most populous U.S. state this winter seemed an impossible reprieve: Following the state’s driest years on record ― which forced extreme water rationing and left some of its poorest residents relying on bottled water ― a possible record amount of precipitation began inundating the state in late 2016, lifting it out of the red in a matter of months.But that rain and snowfall is no end to California’s water woes. In fact, it may just be the beginning.“This has kind of given us a glimpse of what the future might look like,” said Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center and a water expert at the University of California, Davis.Heat is a powerful force, rain or shine.“While more and more people understand that humans are changing the climate, most only know that the planet is warming up,” Peter Gleick, president emeritus and chief scientist of the Pacific Institute, said. “That effect, however, leads to a wide range of other consequences, including rising sea levels, disappearing ice, and ― most relevant for recent events in California ― an increase in extreme weather, including both droughts and floods.”California has the most naturally variable climate in North America, and alternating periods of dry and wet are routine, Mount noted. But the state has seen a steady temperature rise since the 1980s, when researchers first warned that a warmer atmosphere would trigger more intense, lengthier dry and wet spells.“We’re already in a place that has wet wets and dry dries, but those differences are supposed to become even greater over time” as global temperatures rise, Mount explained. The future will leave California with even “wetter wets and drier dries,” like those of the past seven years, he said, noting that temperatures were extremely high during the drought and are still slightly above average during this wet winter. That exceptional heat during wet and dry periods has several consequences that California isn’t equipped to deal with. “With higher temperatures, there’s more evaporation from soils, more transpiration from plants, earlier melting of snowpack and relatively more rain rather than snow,” explained Noah Diffenbaugh, a senior fellow and professor of earth system science at Stanford University. The state’s system of dams, reservoirs and levees is designed to function in a climate where about 30 percent of water is held in snowpacks until it gradually melts and runs off into reservoirs during the spring and summer. But when heat causes more precipitation to arrive as rain rather than snow, like it has this winter, or when snowpack melts too quickly, the system breaks down, like it did at the Oroville Dam last month. “The more precipitation that falls as snow, and the longer that snow stays on the mountain and later melts, the greater the flood control provided,” Diffenbaugh explained.Beyond Oroville, where nearly 200,000 people were evacuated after the dam’s spillways eroded last month, roughly 7 million Californians live in places at risk from flooding.In some instances, long periods of drought preceding heavy rains can raise the flood risk.Soils can become so dry during a drought that when rains finally do come, the earth is “hydrophobic” and can’t absorb water, causing runoffs and floods, Mount explained. In most cases, that problem won’t persist after the soil has had one good soaking, but there are exceptions for lands scarred by wildfires.“We’ve had some of the most severe wildfires on record during this drought, and so those all increase the risk of severe runoff in the context of these very wet conditions,” Diffenbaugh said.Trees and other vegetation are also crucial for catching rain and slowing its journey into the ground or down hillsides. Forests destroyed by powerful wildfires can take years to regrow, leaving most damaged areas prone to flooding for at least two years, the National Weather Service says. However, we won’t know the effects of the rain now falling on California’s wildfire scars with certainty until formal research is conducted, Mount and Diffenbaugh said. Those threats should be a major impetus to update California’s water storage systems, experts said. While the state plans to spend around $400 million to improve its 1,400 dams ― around half of which are designated as “high hazard potential” ― and levees that prevent overflowing river water from flooding cities and farmlands, Mount said we need to spend at least twice that annually after decades of deferrals.In 1997, he recalled, collapsed levees in the Central Valley, the state’s agriculture hub, flooded hundreds of square miles, killing nine people and causing billions in property damage.“We did nothing about it at the time,” Mount said. “We didn’t do anything but patch up the holes and move on. For cynical water watchers like me, it was jaw-dropping to see it.”Busted levees are a serious concern for farmers, who are already dealing with the perils of too much rain after years of too little. While the heavy rains have benefited some already planted grains and field crops, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in its February weather report for the state that some crops are stressed by delayed planting and slowed fieldwork. “We are long past the point where we should be planning – and acting – to adapt to now unpreventable climate changes,” Gleick said. “We see this in California because we pay more attention to California. But these changes are happening everywhere around the world.”Time-lapse GIFs created by Chris McGonigal."

Healthy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b9c16c1a00003700f417ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Twelve people, most of them children, are suffering from an E. coli outbreak that struck five states and may be linked to I.M. Healthy SoyNut Butter, health officials said.Six of the victims were hospitalized, and four developed a kind of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening complication that generally affects about 5 to 10 percent of people who are sickened by E. coli bacteria.Eleven of the 12 infected people are younger than 18 years old. All of the patients live in Arizona, California, Maryland, New Jersey and Oregon. Public health officials haven’t reported any deaths, but they are advising people, daycares and schools to throw away all varieties and sizes of SoyNut Butter, as well as the I.M. Healthy brand of granola coated with SoyNut Butter.The company responded to the news by voluntarily recalling Original Creamy SoyNut Butter with a “best by” date of Aug. 30 or Aug. 31, 2018. However, the company website says the recall doesn’t affect any other products, despite the warning from public health officials. I.M. Healthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post about this discrepancy.This outbreak is caused by shiga toxin-producing E. coli. bacteria, or STEC, the kind most commonly linked to foodborne outbreaks and known to cause the organ failure that some patients experienced. STEC live in the guts of animals, and infect people when they eat tiny amounts of human or animal feces.Anything from working with cattle to swallowing lake water to changing diapers to eating contaminated foods can result in a STEC infection. Consuming unpasteurized milk, apple cider and cheeses made from unpasteurized milk all pose a particularly high risk. Symptoms generally arrive about three or four days after a person ingests contaminated food, and may include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea that can be bloody and vomiting. Most people improve within a week, but the infection can have serious consequences ― including kidney failure ― for the very young and the very old.Diarrhea that lasts for more than three days or comes with a high fever, bloody stool or severe vomiting is an indication that patients should contact their doctors.

These include non-binary, gender-neutral pronouns that go beyond “he” and “she.” In 2014, the city affirmed that transgender students have a right to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identities. These new guidelines expand on that idea and provide resources for educators to support students who may be transitioning. Schools must now use a student’s preferred name and gender on nonpermanent records. For permanent records, they’re required to use the student’s legal name and gender, but documents must be updated if a student’s legal name or gender changes.Further, the guidelines affirm that students should be able to play on intramural sports teams and use locker rooms that match their gender identities. Participation in ""competitive athletic activities and contact sports will be resolved on a case-by-case basis,"" however. The city decided to expand its guidelines after hearing from students, families and staff who wanted stronger direction, said Jared Fox, the NYC Department of Education’s LGBT liaison. The new guidelines address not only transgender children, but all gender nonconforming students. In many ways, this guidance is just a first draft. Fox says the department plans to continually update it based on the needs of students and teachers. New York City’s move comes at a particularly fraught time for LGBTQ students nationwide. The Obama administration told schools in May 2016 to allow transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identities, but the Trump administration rescinded that guidance last week, calling it an example of federal overreach and arguing that such decisions should be made at the state and local level.Fox said he is proud that New York City, home to the largest school district in the country, is dedicated to providing a safe learning environment for all students. “I’m thankful for us to have a document that has the Department of Education logo on it, that says to young people, ‘Your identity matters, and who you are matters.’ That sends a really strong message,” Fox said.This issue will soon play out in a case set to go before the Supreme Court involving transgender teen Gavin Grimm. Grimm is currently in a legal battle with his Virginia school over its decision to bar him from using the men’s restroom. The case could decide which protections transgender people are entitled under the law.That case and the NYC Department of Education’s guidance are about more than just bathrooms and locker rooms, though. They’re about providing all students ― regardless of gender or sexual orientation ― with equal opportunities and safe environments, Fox said.“Students have to feel comfortable before they can learn,” he explained. “If I’m worried about which line I’m going to be in or what I’m going to wear, that’s going to impact whether or not I’m comfortable in the classroom. That’s going to impact whether or not I can learn and achieve.”"
26,POLITICS,Trump's Already Small Circle Of Trusted Advisers Suffers Another Big Blow,S.V. Date and Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-sessions-russia_us_58b8a681e4b05cf0f3ff38b1,Attorney General Jeff Sessions can no longer protect the president from investigations involving Russia.,2017-03-03,"U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions speaks next to U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally at Madison City Schools Stadium in Madison, Alabama February 28, 2016",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b8a7561500002100abceb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – When you get to the White House with such a tiny band of brothers, each and every one seems that much more indispensable.Or so it must seem to President Donald Trump who, just five weeks into his term and two weeks after having to fire his national security adviser, has now watched his closest Cabinet ally neutered in a key role.Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he was recusing himself from any investigations pertaining to the Trump campaign, following the revelation that he spoke with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice last year, despite having testified under oath during his confirmation hearings that he had no contact with any Russians.“I have now decided to recuse myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States,” Sessions said at a hastily called news conference.The attorney general is the one Cabinet member of any presidential administration with the independent authority to launch investigations that could undo the presidency. In Trump’s case, that danger became plausible even before he took office, with U.S. intelligence agencies reporting that Russia had meddled in the presidential election with the goal of electing Trump.Sessions’ decision to stay out of any of the probes underway now, or to come at some point in the future, means he can no longer shield Trump from the results.For Trump, it was another serious blow in an infant presidency that has racked them up, one after the other, since Inauguration Day. Some have involved missteps by the administration ― the chaos generated by a hastily drawn executive order banning travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, for example, or Trump’s insistence that there were “millions” of “illegal votes” in the November electionBut many come back to Russia, and a series of revelations about its intelligence agencies’ role in hurting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and helping Trump by stealing private emails from key Democrats and releasing them through the group Wikileaks over the final weeks of the campaign.Trump has found himself at least one step behind the storyline ― his only response issuing angry tweets about the intelligence community and their leaks.So it was again Thursday. Less than two hours before his attorney general announced he was recusing himself, Trump was visiting an aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia. He told reporters he didn’t think Sessions needed to recuse himself, and expressed “total” confidence in him.That response was similar to Trump’s initial defense of his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after it became known that he, too, had spoken to Kislyak. Those conversations took place immediately after former President Barack Obama expelled 35 suspected Russian spies from the country in retaliation for Russia’s election meddling. Trump did nothing for three weeks after learning details about Flynn’s conversations with Kislyak, but then asked for Flynn’s resignation after those details were leaked to the press.For the tight-knit group of early Trump supporters now atop the federal government, it was a major setback, one that seemed to go against a common mythology of how Trump operates. “In the Trump arena, loyalty is very important,” said Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign aide. “It was a bruising campaign, and the Republican candidate took a lot of shots from inside the Republican tent.”It also meant that an outsider was put in charge of implementing Trump’s foreign policy. Flynn’s replacement as national security adviser, Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, has a reputation for no-nonsense directness. He reportedly has already told the National Security Council and the president himself that the term “radical Islamic terrorism” ― a favorite of Trump and many conservatives ― was counterproductive in the actual battle against terrorists.The sidelining of Sessions may be even tougher for Trump to swallow. The attorney general’s relationship with Trump goes back further than the one he had with Flynn, who endorsed Trump in 2015. In 2014, Trump donated $2,000 to Sessions’ Senate re-election campaign, even though the senator was unopposed. And when Trump began running for president, it was the Alabama Republican who served as a sounding board. Trump decamped to Sessions’ Senate office after attending an anti-Iran nuclear deal rally on Capitol Hill last summer. And he plucked Sessions’ top communications aide, Stephen Miller, to develop policy and write speeches.An aide who worked with Trump said he thought the senator was “tough.” The two bonded both over policy goals and a shared sense of ostracism from the Republican Party writ large. “He was resolute on what he believed in, but wasn’t treated well by the caucus,” said the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “And Trump has been saying the same stuff he has been saying on trade and foreign policy and on immigration. So ideologically, they were aligned.”When Sessions formally became the first sitting senator to back Trump in early 2016, he earned a spot in the soon-to-be nominee’s inner circle. His standing to ask for and receive the Cabinet job he wanted was likely cemented in the autumn, in the aftermath of a leaked “Access Hollywood” tape that sent many Republicans fleeing from the top of their ticket.Sessions, a former U.S. attorney and Alabama attorney general, in contrast went so far as to opine that what Trump bragged about on the tape – grabbing a woman by the genitals – would not be sexual assault. “I don’t characterize that as sexual assault. I think that’s a stretch,” Sessions said in October. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another early Trump backer, called Trump’s recorded boasts “completely indefensible” and said he would not even try to do so. Like Sessions, Christie coveted the attorney general job. Unlike Sessions, he didn’t get it. That Sessions ended up at the Justice Department didn’t surprise Hill Republicans. The job was the one he wanted and, as a loyalist, he got his pick. And for Trump, it meant putting someone he could personally trust, and who largely shared his governing philosophy, in a post that is ostensibly independent from the White House. With his administration under increased scrutiny over its connections to Russian officials, Trump will no longer have his trusted ally in that critical post. What that means for his political future depends, to a large extent, on what Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente now does with his responsibilities to oversee the investigation. Regardless, Democrats aren’t done with Sessions. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, told The Huffington Post that she still wants the attorney general to explain why he gave members misleading information about his meetings with Russian officials. As for Trump, she said her party will continue to push for calls for an independent prosecutor to look into the Russia ties. “There are people like myself who just won’t let this go,” Klobuchar said. Democrats may be out of power, she conceded, “but we can sure keep on the pressure.”Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The 64-year-old R&B-funk veteran landed on the top of the charts in February with the release of his eighth solo album, “In It To Win It.” Featuring collaborations from the likes of Snoop Dogg, Robin Thicke, Lalah Hathaway, Pitbull and Wiz Khalifa, the project debuted at No. 1 on the R&B Album chart, No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the Billboard Top Album Sales chart. Adding to Wilson’s list of current achievements, the album’s lead single, “I’m Blessed,” featuring T.I., is currently this year’s fastest-growing single on the Billboard Adult R&B chart.Wilson, who is also a New York Times best-selling author, is headlining a 30-city “In It To Win It Tour” with special guests Fantasia and Johnny Gill.The former Gap Band member spoke to The Huffington Post about recording “In It To Win It,” and shared some of his secrets to maintaining relevancy for decades and his thoughts on Bruno Mars recapturing the essence of funk music.Congratulations on the success of your new album, “In It To Win It.” How does it feel to land chart-topping success at this stage in your career?It’s what I’ve always wanted. I wanted to make sure that I had a record that would make a statement. I’m excited to have the look of the pop thing going with it. I think that anything that I have on my album has that appeal, and I hope that everybody can look at this record and understand that it’s a special piece. This is a time where people are digitally downloading the one song, and for me to have an album of great records and features, it’s just so beautiful and so fresh, and I’m going for the whole thing. I think it speaks in volumes, what I’m doing. So I’m happy.How important was it for you to tap a new circle of collaborators, who typically would fall outside of your core adult contemporary demographic? I think my fans need to go along with where I’m going. If they gonna connect with me and stay with me, then I need to take them along for this journey that I’m on. I’ve been tapping lightly for so many years, trying to stay loyal to the close fans. But I also have fans that are so very, very young. And so, I have fans from 10 to 20 and they always tell me, “Uncle Charlie, [the only song we know] is ‘Charlie, Last Name Wilson.’” And I was like, OK, so I need to continue to reach out and make records that all of my fans can understand and love and appreciate.So I just thought that I would get some of these artists that I know would love and appreciate me now, get them on my record and bring their fans along with me on my journey. And my younger fans can appreciate some of the things that I’m doing this time around. And my older fans can just understand that you gotta stay young and fresh. So I have to keep everybody active, and go on this journey and party like a rock star.On the album’s title track, you talk about your experiences overcoming racism, homelessness and substance abuse. What prompted you to record the track? I thought people needed to hear it. There’s a lot of people still doing the same things I did, even when I was a young man. A lot of people that I still know that was getting high with me when I was in my 20s and 30s, they’re still getting high. I’m like, “Are you serious? You haven’t moved on? You’re still sitting on that same front porch?” That’s not good at all. What baton are you passing, and who are you passing it to? Because if that’s all you’re doing then you’re teaching your kids and your grandkids to be an alcoholic and a dope head. And so, I have to continue to give a message of self-hope and next-level hope. People always told me that I was too old to get to where I’m at now. They said I wouldn’t ever do this, and I wouldn’t ever do that. It used to hurt me so much to have people tell me that, but until I did not listen to what they were saying and got up to make a difference and do something about it, I didn’t get to where I wanted until I started believing in myself. I started making No. 1 records. And so, I just wanna continue to inspire people and make them understand, no matter what people say about you ― you could be 30, 40, 50, 60 years old ― you could go do whatever you wanna do and be bossin’ at it. But you gotta believe you can do it. So many veteran artists often find challenges appealing to today’s generation of listeners. But yet, you’ve managed to net success while staying true to your core sound. What’s your secret to longevity and remaining relevant in music?I’m a leader, and I’m not copying anybody. You see everybody out here listening to music and just trying to copy that music. I’m not copying any of that. If you listen to some of the biggest records in the world, you’re gonna hear some Charlie Wilson riffs in it. I’m not trying to make a record for another genre, I’m just making great records and I’m staying fresh. I know what’s out there, but I’m not gonna make a record like that. I’m just gonna make sure that my records stay fresh for the time we’re in. And I make timeless records. I always have.   In recent years, popular artists like Bruno Mars have landed success with funk-driven singles like [Mark Ronson’s] “Uptown Funk” and “24K Magic.” What are your thoughts on the resurgence of funk music coming full circle to popular music?It’s great. For him to use “Oops Upside Your Head” as a template for [”Uptown Funk”], I thought it was great. If people like myself or the genre that I came from started making funk records, you know what [listeners] gonna say, right? “It sounds dated.” So, hey, man, sometimes it takes other people to make the record to wake up the funk world. And so it’s great, man. I’m happy and I love Bruno Mars. He’s one of the biggest artists we got out there in the pop world and he’s doing it really well.I’m glad that he’s funking, and he sounds really, really good. I’ve seen him several times and we’ve talked. He understands the stage. And he’s going hard."

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b89d541500002100abce97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spoiler alert: Please proceed with caution if you’re not up to date on “This Is Us.”When “This Is Us” returns on Tuesday, the Pearson family will face a really tough loss: the death of William Hill (Ron Cephas Jones), who succumbed to cancer during last week’s episode. And it’s not going to be easy. William, the biological father of Randall Pearson (Sterling K. Brown), was a fun-loving person with a passion for music and the arts who faced a troubled and storied past. By the time Randall tracked down his dad for the first time, William’s health was failing. As the season progressed, William became a big part of Randall’s life, getting to know his wife, Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson), and their two daughters, Annie (Faithe Herman) and Tess (Eris Baker). So it’s no surprise that the family will take this hard, especially because Beth and the kids didn’t get to say a proper goodbye. In the last episode, Randall and William took a road trip to Memphis to visit William’s old stomping grounds and, along the way, they connected with some of William’s extended family. They stopped by the club where William used to play music and ate at one of his favorite restaurants. But William’s health took a turn for the worse and he never made it back home to see Beth and the kids. Beth did get to see the two of them off before they hit the road in a short but memorable scene. In a way, at that moment, Kelechi Watson had to say goodbye to her castmate Cephas Jones.“There’s this scene where they’re getting in the car to go to Memphis and I bend down into the car and I look in his eyes and I say, ‘You take care of you.’ And the look Ron gave me, I said, ‘Ron, stop. You can’t do that … You know what you’re doing.’ We’re looking at each other like he knows he’s going to leave,” Kelechi Watson told The Huffington Post during a Build Series interview. “We knew that these moments were so precious having him on set.” Because the NBC series toggles back and forth between the past and present, it’s possible we’ll see William in flashback scenes, Kelechi Watson said. Though, she added, “He’s gone now in that everyday way and that was hard.” The actress said William’s death will hit her character “hard.” Probably harder than the audience may expect. “They started off as strangers … and then she kind of sort of let him in. And then he figures his role out in the family, and they become family and they become friends. It’s going to be difficult and she didn’t have a chance to say goodbye,” she said. “And her being his main caretaker in a sense, being home with him. You’ll find out how much she’s helped him in terms of medicine and doctors … So, it’s going to have a big effect.” With only two episodes left, viewers are waiting in anticipation for how Season 1 will wind down. Kelechi Watson assures “This Is Us” fans that some lingering storylines will be tied up in the season finale, especially when it comes to Milo Ventimiglia’s and Mandy Moore’s characters, Jack and Rebecca Pearson. “There are aspects of Jack and Rebecca’s life that we’ve been tracking through the season and we’ll see a lot of that — and some questions will be answered,” she said. “This Is Us” has already been picked up for two additional seasons, so there are plenty more stories to tell.When asked whether viewers will learn more about Beth’s past in upcoming seasons, Kelechi Watson said, “That has to be a possibility playing with time and everything like that. We have the space right now to do it because we have two more seasons. Have they thought about it that far? I’m not sure. I imagine that’s an option that’s available to us. I know that we will learn about who she is, her family and her career.” “This Is Us” airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC. Watch the full Build Series interview with Susan Kelechi Watson below. "
30,HEALTHY LIVING,Being Obese Is Strongly Linked To A Greater Risk For These 11 Cancers,"Lisa Rapaport, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/being-obese-is-strongly-linked-to-a-greater-risk-for-these-11-cancers_us_58b84cb8e4b0a8ded67b0612,Avoiding weight gain as an adult can lower cancer risk.,2017-03-02,There's strong evidence excess weight raises one's odds for developing certain kinds of cancers. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b84d2b1a00003700f4139f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - People who are obese have a greater risk of developing and dying from several types of cancer including malignancies of the breast, ovary, kidney, pancreas, colon, rectum and bone marrow, a research review confirms.Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and the prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past generation. Even though excess weight is thought to influence the odds of developing and dying from a wide variety of tumors, the study found “strong evidence” supporting this connection for just 11 cancers.“Other associations could also be genuine, but there is still substantial uncertainty about them,” lead study author Dr. Maria Kyrgiou of Imperial College London said by email.Globally, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. Roughly four in 10 adults are overweight, and more than one in 10 are obese, a condition that increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems and joint disorders in addition to certain cancers.For the current study, researchers analyzed results from 204 previously published studies exploring the connection between obesity, weight gain, waist circumference and 36 different cancers.Researchers looked in particular for evidence that the previous results might have exaggerated the link between obesity and cancer or found a connection that was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.They found the strongest links were between obesity and malignancies of the digestive organs and for hormone-related tumors in women, according to the report in The BMJ.When researchers looked at what’s known as body mass index (BMI), a ratio of weight to height, they found increases in BMI tied to a higher risk of developing cancers in the esophagus, bone marrow, biliary tract system, pancreas and kidney. Upticks in BMI were also linked to greater odds of colon and rectal cancers in men as well as endometrial malignancies in younger women.A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a healthy weight, while 25 to 29.9 is overweight, 30 or above is obese and 40 or higher is what’s known as morbidly obese. (The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has an online BMI calculator here: bit.ly/1D0ZqDv.)The increased risk of cancer for every 5-unit gain in BMI ranged from 9 percent for rectal cancer among men to 56 percent for tumors in the biliary tract system.For women, weight gain and extra belly fat, a measurement known as waist-to-hip circumference ratio, were also associated with an increased risk of certain cancers. After menopause, women’s risk of breast cancer increased by 11 percent for every 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of weight they gained during adulthood. This was in women who didn’t take hormones to ease menopause symptoms, a treatment that is independently linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.As women added more fat around the midsection, every 0.1 unit increase in waist-to-hip ratio was associated with a 21 percent jump in the odds of endometrial cancer.Researchers found strong evidence linking weight gain to colorectal cancer. They also found a strong connection between BMI increases and getting cancers of the gallbladder, stomach and ovaries, as well as dying from bone marrow tumors.One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t examine controlled experiments designed to prove that obesity directly causes cancer, the authors note.More research is needed that assesses changes in body fat over time to better understand how obesity directly influences the risk of getting cancer or dying from the disease, the authors conclude.The way obesity impacts the risk of cancer also varies in different parts of the body, Dr. Graham Colditz, a researcher at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said by email.But the take-home message is the same for every patient, added Colditz, author of an editorial accompanying the study.“Avoiding weight gain through adult years is important,” Colditz said. “Even if you are overweight focus first on not gaining any more weight; for those who are overweight or obese taking off some pounds can lower cancer risk.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2ldy6nM and bit.ly/2lXEmgB The BMJ, online February 28, 2017."
31,POLITICS,Jeff Sessions Met With Ambassador As U.S.-Russia Tensions Flared,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-russia-timeline_us_58b876c7e4b0a8ded67b6474,"The private talk came as Trump fawned over Putin and just after Obama gave the Russian leader his ""death stare"" over hacking.",2017-03-02,"Putin and Obama meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit on Sept. 5, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b87bc518000035000291eb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Now that Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any Justice Department investigations into Russian meddling in the presidential election, a timeline shows how his reported contacts with its ambassador last year came at key points in U.S.-Russia relations and in Donald Trump’s campaign. Sessions’ recusal Thursday came a day after The Washington Post reported that he had two previously undisclosed meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, one in July and a second one on Sept. 8 in Sessions’ Senate office, two months before Election Day. Sessions didn’t inform lawmakers about the contacts at his January confirmation hearing.At his Thursday news conference, Sessions maintained that he had spoken to the ambassador as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for the Trump campaign. When asked what they discussed, Sessions admitted terrorism and Ukraine came up but suggested the discussion wasn’t political in nature. “I don’t recall any specific political discussions,” Sessions said, though he said envoys “are pretty gossipy.”A review of the timeline surrounding Sessions’ meeting with Kislyak, however, reveals that it came during a significant moment for U.S.-Russia relations. Indeed, Trump and his surrogates were offering high praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime while the Obama administration was airing its complaints with Russia over Syria, Putin’s incursion into Crimea and cyber-hacking targeting campaign officials. If those topics did not come up during the Sessions-Kislyak meeting, it would be hard to fathom why not.Here are the key dates surrounding the Sept. 8 meeting. Sept. 1 ― President Barack Obama’s Treasury Department announces new sanctions against Russia. John Smith, the acting director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, says the new penalties are related to Putin’s meddling in Ukraine.Sept. 3-5 ― Obama and Putin attend the G-20 summit in Hangzhou, China. Obama’s trip begins with an awkward squabble between Chinese and U.S. officials on the airport tarmac over which set of stairs the president and his delegation would use to disembark from Air Force One. Putin is reportedly a popular figure at the summit. Trump used the perceived snub on the campaign trail to paint Obama as a weak leader who doesn’t command respect.Sept. 5 ― Obama and Putin have a tense, lengthy discussion at the G-20 summit in China about a potential cease-fire in Syria. The huddle comes less than a week after the implementation of the new sanctions against Russia. Putin publicly calls on Obama to lift the penalties. Obama later says the two men directly discussed, seemingly for the first time, reports of Russian hacking targeting Democratic Party officials. Obama says that he told Putin to “cut it out.”This widely circulated photo of a so-called death stare between the presidents on the day of their meeting seems to illustrate the state of relations between the U.S. and Russia at the time.Sept. 7 ― Defense Secretary Ash Carter accuses Russia of sowing seeds of global instability and questions if Moscow is genuinely interested in finding an agreement on a cease-fire in Syria.Sept. 7 ― Trump praises Putin on national TV. “[Putin] has very strong control over a country,” he says during NBC’s commander-in-chief forum with rival Hillary Clinton in New York. “Now, it’s a very different system, and I don’t happen to like that system. But certainly in that system he’s been a leader far more than our president has been a leader.”Sept. 8. ― Sessions and Kislyak meet privately in his Senate office.Sept. 8 ― Pence agrees with Trump’s assessment of Putin’s strength as a leader. “I think it’s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,” he tells CNN. “And that’s going to change the day that Donald Trump becomes president.”Sept. 8 ― Trump goes on the Kremlin-backed Russia Today network, where he tells host Larry King that it was “probably unlikely” Russia was trying to interfere in the election. Democrats “are putting that out,” Trump claims.Sept. 9 ― Secretary of State John F. Kerry meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva. They reach an agreement on a renewal of a cease-fire in Syria."

We’re here to answer your most pressing, puzzling, even politically incorrect questions, about all things related to the Chinese in Africa and Africans in China.Over a month into his presidency, Donald Trump has yet to utter a concrete word about his foreign policy vision for Africa. Given that the combative president has picked fights with Mexico, Australia and, of course the Chinese, while antagonizing other long-term allies like the Swedes by presenting false information, a lot of African leaders may actually be relieved that their countries and continent are not foremost on the administration’s mind. Regardless, the president’s seeming lack of interest in Africa could have profound geopolitical consequences.In recent years, the United States has positioned itself in Africa as an alternative to China’s surging influence across the continent.“China is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals,” said former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson, according to a secret diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks in 2010. “China is not in Africa for altruistic reasons,” he added.Not long after, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that warning, cautioning African leaders of a “new colonialism” by the Chinese in Africa. Former President Barack Obama, who was widely viewed as insufficiently engaged in Africa during his two terms in office, picked up on the competition from the East as well, suggesting that the U.S. and not China should be a preferred partner for African states: “We don’t look to Africa simply for its natural resources,” he told an audience of African leaders at a summit in Washington in 2014. “We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and its potential.”Today, in what increasingly appears to be an emerging policy vacuum, the Chinese may now be free of these insights from Washington as the Americans simultaneously, albeit unintentionally, send a message to African leaders that their economic destiny will be more aligned with what happens in the East than in the West. While the bulk of U.S. foreign policy attention is so far focused on issues in Israel and the Middle East, Mexico and parts of Asia and Europe, China is quietly continuing to expand its already sizable influence in Africa. Seemingly every week, multi-billion dollar Sino-African infrastructure deals are announced while Beijing puts the final touches on its new military base in the tiny East African nation of Djibouti as part of its grand global trading strategy known as “One Belt, One Road” that will pass through several African countries. It’s a similar story on the trade front, where the United States is buying less and less oil from countries like Nigeria while China solidifies its role as Africa’s largest trading partner.Even if the White House does begin to focus its attention on Africa, it may be too late, according to Nairobi-based international development economist Anzetse Were.“Once a Trump strategy for Africa is developed,” she wrote in a 2017 column for Kenya’s Business Daily newspaper, “China will analyze the trade, investment and financial gaps in the plan and act to further consolidate its dominance on the continent.”Now, as the rhetoric from the White House becomes more isolationist and even more polarizing, it will be even harder to change the course of Sino-African relations, Were said.The White House has also made it clear ― via influence from Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon ― that it intends to fully disrupt the existing international order, either explicitly by cancelling trade deals and questioning Washington’s long-held alliances, or implicitly through neglect as appears to be the case in Africa, which will have a profound effect on China’s steadily rising influence there.Anzetse Were joins Eric and Cobus ― in the podcast above ― to discuss her recent column and how Africa is bracing for a Trump-inspired shift towards China in response to the new U.S. president’s apparent determination to shake up the international order.Join the discussion.

We’re here to answer your most pressing, puzzling, even politically incorrect questions, about all things related to the Chinese in Africa and Africans in China.Over a month into his presidency, Donald Trump has yet to utter a concrete word about his foreign policy vision for Africa. Given that the combative president has picked fights with Mexico, Australia and, of course the Chinese, while antagonizing other long-term allies like the Swedes by presenting false information, a lot of African leaders may actually be relieved that their countries and continent are not foremost on the administration’s mind. Regardless, the president’s seeming lack of interest in Africa could have profound geopolitical consequences.In recent years, the United States has positioned itself in Africa as an alternative to China’s surging influence across the continent.“China is a very aggressive and pernicious economic competitor with no morals,” said former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson, according to a secret diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks in 2010. “China is not in Africa for altruistic reasons,” he added.Not long after, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed that warning, cautioning African leaders of a “new colonialism” by the Chinese in Africa. Former President Barack Obama, who was widely viewed as insufficiently engaged in Africa during his two terms in office, picked up on the competition from the East as well, suggesting that the U.S. and not China should be a preferred partner for African states: “We don’t look to Africa simply for its natural resources,” he told an audience of African leaders at a summit in Washington in 2014. “We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and its potential.”Today, in what increasingly appears to be an emerging policy vacuum, the Chinese may now be free of these insights from Washington as the Americans simultaneously, albeit unintentionally, send a message to African leaders that their economic destiny will be more aligned with what happens in the East than in the West. While the bulk of U.S. foreign policy attention is so far focused on issues in Israel and the Middle East, Mexico and parts of Asia and Europe, China is quietly continuing to expand its already sizable influence in Africa. Seemingly every week, multi-billion dollar Sino-African infrastructure deals are announced while Beijing puts the final touches on its new military base in the tiny East African nation of Djibouti as part of its grand global trading strategy known as “One Belt, One Road” that will pass through several African countries. It’s a similar story on the trade front, where the United States is buying less and less oil from countries like Nigeria while China solidifies its role as Africa’s largest trading partner.Even if the White House does begin to focus its attention on Africa, it may be too late, according to Nairobi-based international development economist Anzetse Were.“Once a Trump strategy for Africa is developed,” she wrote in a 2017 column for Kenya’s Business Daily newspaper, “China will analyze the trade, investment and financial gaps in the plan and act to further consolidate its dominance on the continent.”Now, as the rhetoric from the White House becomes more isolationist and even more polarizing, it will be even harder to change the course of Sino-African relations, Were said.The White House has also made it clear ― via influence from Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon ― that it intends to fully disrupt the existing international order, either explicitly by cancelling trade deals and questioning Washington’s long-held alliances, or implicitly through neglect as appears to be the case in Africa, which will have a profound effect on China’s steadily rising influence there.Anzetse Were joins Eric and Cobus ― in the podcast above ― to discuss her recent column and how Africa is bracing for a Trump-inspired shift towards China in response to the new U.S. president’s apparent determination to shake up the international order.Join the discussion.

36,IMPACT,Is Climate Action Dead In The Age Of Trump? Ikea's Green Boss Says No,Jo Confino,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ikea-climate-change-sustainability_us_58b72582e4b023018c6c7c5d,"""Federal action could slow change, but change will come.""",2017-03-02,"Steve Howard, chief sustainability officer for the Ikea Group, (left) during a tour of an Ikea store. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b82eaa1a00003400f412fd.jpeg?cache=dOBd8CDJck&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For all those who believe taking action to limit climate change is bad for business, Ikea has a robust rebuttal.The home furnishings giant says that tackling global warming is not just good for people and the planet but is also a cornerstone of the company’s continuing success.Sales of products that help customers save energy and water, as well as curb waste, grew 37 percent last year and will soon be a $2 billion business.Ikea will soon produce more renewable energy from its wind farms than it consumes for its own operations, turning energy from a huge cost to the business into a profit center. The architect of the company’s sustainability strategy has been Steve Howard, who stepped down this week as Ikea’s chief sustainability officer after six years in the post.The Huffington Post caught up with Howard, who also helped found We Mean Business, a coalition of leading businesses and nongovernmental organizations on climate action, to ask him about the impact of Donald Trump’s election, what to say to those who deny climate science and what advice he has for companies seeking to integrate sustainability into their operations.The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.Since the election of Donald Trump we have seen many hundreds of companies signing declarations calling for the United States not to pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. What impact would it have if these calls are ignored?There were 260,000 jobs in the U.S. solar industry last year, 25 percent more than the year before.Federal action could slow change, but change will come, and states, cities and business will not stand still. We have recently seen senior Republican leaders calling for a price on carbon, so where this goes is far from certain.The U.S. can be a real winner in this new job-rich clean economy. And if one important player chooses not to play their part, it is a huge and powerful call to action for everyone else.Given a continuing lack of political momentum for change, despite the Paris accord, what do you see as the role of business in advocating for change?Paris was a game-changer. Actually, I see political momentum has increased, with the obvious risks and exceptions. And it is not just national governments but hundreds of cities and states.But I also see business has stepped up in a whole new way. Via the We Mean Business coalition, which I co-chair, more than 500 businesses have committed to climate actions, such as 100 percent renewable energy or setting science-based emission targets.There is a big role for policy, but increasingly business investment and innovation will develop and scale the clean economy. The opportunity is simply enormous. And where political momentum is lacking, it becomes even more important to find ways to empower citizens and inspire individual change.What would you say to people who deny the science of climate change and claim it is a hoax?To the misinformed I generally explain how we have raised the temperature of the world with a billion tons of heat-trapping gases a week going up into the atmosphere. We can see extreme weather ― from floods in California, to scorching heat waves in Australia.The science is certain, and the only debate to have is about the best policies and solutions to tackle it. When people realize that with our best efforts this is a solvable problem and that we can still have a great quality of life, it is easier to accept the science. For the industry-sponsored climate skeptics, I simply save my breath.Given the complexity of the world and the power of the status quo, what is the one thing you think we could do to leverage real change toward a sustainable future?Let’s get the biggest coalition of organizations, cities, states, businesses and countries to radically decarbonize: We will accelerate change, create great jobs and build the future we want. And let’s do it right now. It is a hugely exciting agenda. If we tackle climate change, many other things will fall into place. What are the top 5 lessons you have learned as head of sustainability at Ikea Group that could help other companies to change for the better?1) Go all in. Whenever possible set 100 percent targets and drive transformational change. A good example at Ikea is our commitment to using LED lights: We banned halogens and compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). With a 100 percent target, it becomes clear to everyone in the business what success looks like ― there is no ambiguity and nowhere to hide.2) It’s about better. Early sustainable products and services were almost always compromised: ghoulish energy-saving CFLs, rough toilet paper, the list goes on. People want and expect each generation of products and services to be better than the last. We have to make sustainability easy, affordable and attractive.3) Make sustainability pay. It is okay to pilot projects that come with a price tag, but for anything to go mainstream it has to pay its way. You simply cannot get anything to scale otherwise.4) Success has many parents. About a year into my job I started to introduce myself internally as “co-responsible for sustainability with everyone else at Ikea.” Change is a team sport, and you rely on the leadership, expertise, passion and energy of your colleagues. I have been part of a change process with many thousands of others.5) Remember your purpose. When it is time to take a tough decision, that is your job ― and if you don’t do it, then you give everyone else a perfect excuse. Can a company the size of Ikea every really be considered sustainable?Scale is an enabler. We make products incredibly efficiently, transport them effectively (think flat pack) and drive economies of scale. Increasingly we have products made from sustainable raw materials, such as Forest Stewardship Council wood, from factories powered by renewable energy, with working conditions secured against our code of conduct, sold in wind and solar-powered stores. But to be truly sustainable, we need to tackle the final challenge and ensure that customers can repair, recycle or sell their Ikea products.If the commitment to change is there, most businesses can be sustainable and be stronger for it. Scale and affordability connect to another rule: that sustainability must be affordable for many people, not a luxury for the few.Ikea relies on continually selling more products. Given that we live in a resource-constrained world, aren’t you part of the problem rather than the solution?Last year I mentioned that in some developed countries we were approaching “peak stuff,” where increasingly people are valuing purpose and experiences alongside what they own and buy.In contrast, many people in Asia, Africa and South America aspire to the lifestyles that many of us enjoy today. Peak stuff is way off in these regions. And even in richer countries, there are still many who share these aspirations because they too live on limited means.But to meet people’s needs in a resource-constrained world, it’s clear that the extract, make, use, throw-away society clearly needs to change to a much more circular model. If we source products sustainably, and they last a long time and have a circular business model, I think it will be okay for a long time to come."

He has a deadly peanut allergy and they rubbed peanut butter on his face while he was passed out,” she said.Seely said the incident took place last fall, but her son ― who has since transferred to another school ― only just told her about it. She identified his former fraternity as Alpha Chi Rho, which CMU said is not a recognized fraternity and is located off-campus.“They were removed for hazing in 2011,” Heather Smith, CMU’s director of communications, told The Huffington Post on Thursday. “They tried to appeal last fall, but they were denied.”In a statement released by the national chapter on Friday, the fraternity said the individuals behind Seely’s mistreatment had been operating under the Alpha Chi Rho name without permission for some time. The fraternity said it asked the CMU students to stop using the name, but the requests were ignored.“Alpha Chi Rho does not condone this type of behavior ― or any form of hazing ― and it stands in conflict with our mission to cultivate men of character, honor and integrity,” the national chapter said. Seely told the Detroit Free Press she wasn’t sure why her son had only just reported the incident.Because the case is a potential criminal matter, Smith said CMU has contacted local police and the school’s office of student conduct. “We responded immediately,” she said. Mount Pleasant police confirmed to HuffPost that the department became aware of the incident this week, but said that, as of Thursday, no report has been filed to launch a police investigation.It’s not clear whether the individual or individuals who put peanut butter on Andrew Seely’s face knew he had an allergy.One student, who identified himself as an Alpha Chi Rho fraternity member and declined to give his name, told local station WDIV that members of the frat weren’t aware of his allergy.“It was just a joke, trying to be funny and put it on his face,” the student said. “We didn’t know he was allergic. It was just college students being kids.”Members of Alpha Chi Rho told WDIV they offered to pay Seely’s medical bills at the time of the incident.“We’re sorry to his family that just trying to be funny made it look like we were violent,” the student said. “We were not trying to be violent in any sense.”Teresa Seely and the unofficial, local chapter of Alpha Chi Rho did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.This story has been updated to include the national chapter’s comments."

Witnesses told NOLA.com they heard 10 gunshots.Gibson performed in drag shows across the country and was best known by her stage name, Chyna Doll Dupree. Gibson’s friend Dayshawn Brown said entertaining was her life.“Chyna didn’t affiliate herself with any kind of drama,” Brown told NOLA.com. “It’s a shocker to everyone because she didn’t have any drama with anyone, and I’ve never heard her say she was into something.”Just two days later, 25-year-old Ciara McElveen was found dead with multiple stab wounds in the 7th Ward. The New Orleans Police Department doesn’t believe the killings are connected or that they were hate crimes, according to the publication. No arrests have been made, according to local NBC affiliate WDSU.McElveen became the third black transgender woman killed in Louisiana last month. On Feb. 19, Jaquarrius Holland, 18, was fatally shot in Monroe following a verbal altercation. News reports initially misgendered her, according to The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs.“My friend was an amazing dresser, a listening ear, and a wonderful person,” a friend of Holland’s posted on a GoFundMe page to cover her funeral costs. “You slayed your makeup/hair EVERY time! MY FRIEND didn’t deserve this at all! SHE was beautiful.”There have been at least seven homicides of transgender women of color in the U.S. in the first two months of 2017, according to NCAVP. Last year, 27 homicides of transgender people were reported, according to GLAAD. However, the actual number of murders is likely higher due to both lack of reporting and the misgendering of victims in news reports, by the police or by their own families. 2016 marked the deadliest year for transgender individuals in the U.S. yet.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated all three killings took place in New Orleans. Two took place in New Orleans, and a third in Monroe."

The ruling is expected to discourage government workers from using their personal email accounts for official business as a way to avoid disclosure. The decision, which concludes a years-long dispute over the use of private email by San Jose city officials, applies to state and local employees. A 2015 survey by the Associated Press found that many of California’s top officials, including Gov. Jerry Brown (D), Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and then-Attorney General Kamala Harris (D), occasionally used private email to conduct government business.“We hold that when a city employee uses a personal account to communicate about the conduct of public business, the writings may be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act,” reads the opinion, authored by Associate Justice Carol Corrigan. There’s been increased scrutiny in recent years over the use of private accounts to conduct official business, most notably in the case of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her use of a private email server. In July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that some personal emails could be subject to disclosure via the Freedom of Information Act.Californians hoping to glean gossip or otherwise strictly personal information about their local officials, however, will be disappointed. The ruling specifies that the communications in question must “relate in some substantive way to the conduct of the public’s business.”“The public might be titillated to learn that not all agency workers enjoy the company of their colleagues, or hold them in high regard. However, an employee’s electronic musings about a colleague’s personal shortcomings will often fall far short of [that standard],” Corrigan writes.Corrigan also offered some legal guidance on how to search government employees’ personal accounts without violating their privacy, including allowing the officials in question to conduct searches themselves. However, she noted, it’s up to agencies to make their own policies for handling such searches. You can read the full ruling here. "

They would have subjected broadband internet service providers to more stringent data security requirements than websites like Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc or Alphabet Inc’s Google unit.The decision will “provide time” for the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission to devise “a comprehensive and consistent framework” to protect online privacy, the agency said in a statement.Internet service providers hailed the decision. Consumer advocates objected.Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president of government communications, called it “a sensible, pro-consumer approach” in which “consumers remain protected by the safeguards in place for the past two years.” AT&T and Verizon also praised the action.But Laura MacCleery, a vice president at Consumer Reports magazine, called it “a troubling first step towards unraveling critical, pro-consumer online privacy protections.”The rules would have required internet service providers to obtain consumer consent before using precise geo-location, financial information, health information, children’s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. For less sensitive information such as email addresses or service tiers, consumers would be able to opt out.MacCleery said the Consumer Reports had “heard from more than 50,000 consumers who support these rules through petitions and comments directly to the FCC.”FCC Chair Ajit Pai and acting FTC Chair Maureen Ohlhausen in a joint statement said they would work to ensure a consistent privacy framework.“After all, Americans care about the overall privacy of their information when they use the internet, and they shouldn’t have to be lawyers or engineers to figure out if their information is protected differently depending on which part of the internet holds it,” they said. “The federal government shouldn’t favor one set of companies over another,” they added.FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, objected in a statement that the agency “should be the ‘cop on the beat’” but instead “is leaving broadband customers without assurances that their providers will keep their data secure.”In October, Republican commissioners including Pai said the rules unfairly gave websites the ability to harvest more data than service providers and dominate digital advertising."

Ford at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding facilities in Newport News, Virginia, U.S. March 2, 2017. (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b896f01a00003400f41537.jpeg?cache=q3i39QwiDu&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Timothy Gardner and Valerie VolcoviciWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is proposing to slash a quarter of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s budget, targeting climate-change programs and those designed to prevent air and water pollution like lead contamination, a source with direct knowledge of the proposal said on Thursday.President Donald Trump has long signaled his intention to reverse former Democratic President Barack Obama’s climate-change initiatives. But the Republican president has vowed his planned overhaul of green regulation would not jeopardize America’s water and air quality.The 23-page 2018 budget proposal, which aims to slice the environmental regulator’s overall budget by 25 percent to $6.1 billion and staffing by 20 percent to 12,400 as part of a broader effort to fund increased military spending, would cut deeply into programs like climate protection, environmental justice and enforcement.The Washington Post was first to report the staff and overall budget cuts, but the source disclosed new details on the impact the cuts would have on programs.The EPA had until Wednesday to report back to the White House. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the budget proposal or its counter proposal.The proposal, sent to the EPA this week, would cut into grants that support American Indian tribes and energy efficiency initiatives, according to the source, who read the document to Reuters.State grants for lead cleanup, for example, would be cut 30 percent to $9.8 million. Grants to help native tribes combat pollution would be cut 30 percent to $45.8 million. An EPA climate protection program on cutting emissions of greenhouse gases like methane that contribute to global warming would be cut 70 percent to $29 million.The proposal would cut funding for the brownfields industrial site cleanup program by 42 percent to $14.7 million. It would also reduce funding for enforcing pollution laws by 11 percent to $153 million.The budget did not cut state revolving funds for programs, that Congress tapped last year to provide aid to Flint, Michigan, for its lead pollution crisis.All staff at a research program, called Global Change Research, as well as 37 other programs would be cut under the plan.CONGRESSIONAL HURDLESThe Republican-led Congress would have to approve any EPA cuts. Some of the cuts are unlikely to pass as they are popular with both Democrats and Republicans. Congress would be unlikely to approve a proposal to cut all staff in a diesel emissions program, for example.Scott Pruitt, the new head of the EPA, told U.S. mayors on Thursday he would make a priority of cleanups of industrial and hazardous waste sites and improving water infrastructure, even as the White House proposed severe proposed cuts to those programs.“In this budget discussion that is ongoing with Congress that is just starting, there are some concerns about some of these grant programs that EPA has been a part of historically,” Pruitt said.“I want you to know that with the White House and also with Congress, I am communicating a message that the brownfields program, the Superfund program and the water infrastructure grants and state revolving funds are essential to protect,” he said.A state air pollution expert said the program cuts, if enacted, would harm some of the people most at risk from particulate and lead contamination.“Any of these programs where they’ve cut air pollution or water pollution is going to have a direct effect on inner cities,” said Bill Becker, director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies.(Reporting by Timothy Gardner and Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Peter Cooney)"

There is no ice in sight on this Great Lake which is usually frozen during the month of February. It is only the second time that the lake has not frozen-over since records began 50 years ago.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b87f3918000036000291f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A program to kill geese in a New Jersey town is having its final swan song.After four years of rounding up and euthanizing Canada geese in the town of Edgewater, Mayor Michael J. McPartland said Tuesday there were no more geese left to gas.“Last year we euthanized only seven birds,” McPartland told NJ.com. “That is down from about 100 birds four years ago.”The four-year contract with the Department of Agriculture was designed to keep the Canada geese population down. The geese caused havoc on the town’s Veterans Field, which was closed for renovations in 2011 after toxins were found in the soil. The goal of killing the geese was to cut down on goose droppings and improve public safety, according to NorthJersey.com.The decision to kill the geese was met with protests. More than 5,000 people signed a petition asking the mayor to stop gassing the geese.McPartland said the protesters did not affect his decision to decide against renewing the contract with the USDA.“They crucified us, the town and council, looking for notoriety,” McPartland told NJ.com. “There are 70 municipalities in the state that use the USDA program and kill far more birds than us.”McPartland said the town will find new ways to stop the geese, including putting up new fences, and even getting a Border Collie to protect the local park.Still, if the geese population booms again, McPartland said he won’t rule out going back to the gas.“Statistics have shown that the [euthanasia] program worked,” McPartland told NewJersey.com.

The 21-year-old is one of the NBA's most creative dunkers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b5f64222000020004adc39.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Aaron Gordon entered the NBA in 2014 as an enticing young prospect who’d already achieved tremendous success at every major level. After capturing two California state championships and dominating the AAU circuit, he earned MVP honors from the highly prestigious McDonald’s All-American Game ― an award previously won by the likes of LeBron James, Jabari Parker and Dwight Howard. In college, he was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year while guiding Arizona to the Elite Eight.Finally, the Orlando Magic made the San Jose native the fourth overall pick in the NBA draft, providing one of the league’s most hapless franchises with a marquee name. Maybe he wasn’t the next Shaq or Penny Hardaway, but Gordon offered hope and excitement to a rudderless organization in dire need of it. What’s more, Gordon possesses many of the qualities that teams covet in an emerging star, including humility and selflessness.At just 21 years old, Gordon has an almost supernatural understanding of what his body needs to be successful. He believes that the mental aspect of basketball is just as important as the physical side ― maybe even more so. It’s why he sets aside specific times to nap at least 30 minutes per day, and why he devised a nutrition plan based on a high-protein diet to help him operate as efficiently as possible. It’s also why he practices yoga and acupuncture regularly during the offseason to help his muscles regenerate. “I’m at the point where I come out on the court, I’m looking to do just play,” he tells The Huffington Post. “It sounds simple but it’s not. I clear my mind and I stay in the present moment and I play the game. I make the read, I see the game, I feel my body, I feel my feet and it’s just more fun. It’s liberating.”By trading Serge Ibaka to Toronto, the Magic have reinstalled Gordon in his natural four-man slot, yielding excellent early returns. At 6 feet 9 inches and 220 pounds, Gordon is a superior athlete and physical specimen ― even by NBA standards ― with a lightning-quick first step and the rare ability to defend all five positions. A ferocious and creative dunker who uses his strong frame to absorb contact, he also finishes very well at the rim. He displayed all of this in a Feb. 25 win over Atlanta, connecting on 7-11 shots while tallying 18 points, 3 assists and 2 steals ― a testament to his dynamic versatility and remarkable athletic ability.Gordon, who in his third season as a pro is averaging a career-high 11 points per game, feels more at ease on the floor, even when he’s played out of position on the wing.“He made some great, great plays,” Orlando head coach Frank Vogel said after the win against Atlanta. “He’s getting the ball now with space and no one between him and the basket, whereas when he was playing on the perimeter, they were backing up and there was a body in front of him at all times.”“You have to be very diligent and very disciplined,” Gordon said. “Becoming very in tune with what’s happening, from my toes to the top of my head to my fingertips.”“After my rookie-year injury [a fractured left foot], I understood that if I want to be a Hall of Famer ― if I want to do everything I want to do ― then I’m gonna need to take care of my body,” he said. “I’m very detail-oriented when I need to take care of my body.”Part of how Gordon stays fresh and sharp is finding ways to challenge his brain. While many young NBA players spend a nontrivial amount of time on video games and social media, Gordon’s downtime revolves more around reading and meditation, a habit he says began during his youth. He often plays the piano ― Outkast is a favorite ― to exert his mind in multiple ways, and he marvels at how his downtime makes him feel.“Sports psychology isn’t all that embraced yet in the sports world,” he says. “It’s starting to become prevalent and more recognized.”When Gordon was 11 and just beginning to comprehend how far basketball might one day take him, he tore his ACL and sustained a major concussion. As he worked his way back, it was his older brother Drew ― starring for UCLA and then New Mexico ― who garnered all the headlines. By taking a step back, Gordon also came to understand how much the game can consume you.“[My brother] went through a little bit of that identity crisis,” Gordon said. “Like, ‘Am I a basketball player or am I a human being?’”When Drew discovered that delicate balance, his game then kicked into high gear, blossoming to new heights. Following a brief NBA stint, the older Gordon brother has since become one of the best professional players in all of Europe. Ultimately, it was witnessing Drew’s struggle and perseverance that allowed Aaron to grow as a person, and as a player. The next steps are to deploy his strenuous practice regimen and complement his powerful athleticism. By becoming a more consistent perimeter shooter (he converts just 28 percent from 3 and 32 percent in catch-and-shoot opportunities), a better ball handler and a more confident post-up player, Gordon’s production will dramatically increase.Regardless of what happens on the court, though, Gordon ― whose vibrant personality has led to endorsement deals with Nike and Uptime Energy ― will be at peace seeking fulfillment from other aspects of life, hoping a sound mind and body will only help.“Basketball is not my life,” he says. “It’s a portion of my life. I like developing the person before I like developing the basketball player. What happens is if you develop the person, then the basketball player becomes better... I realize that it’s easy to fall into the trap of becoming a basketball player, but eventually you go through an identity crisis.”“It’s never too late to understand who you are as a person,” he muses. “Basketball has always been a sanctuary for me to free my mind, and it’s not gonna change.”Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Gorka has a long history of spouting Islamophobic rhetoric and on Wednesday, he once again skirted a basic question about Trump’s view of Islam.In an interview with NPR on Wednesday, host Steve Inskeep asked Gorka, “Does the president believe Islam is a religion?”Gorka spurned the question, telling Inskeep, “This is not a theological seminary. This is the White House. And we’re not going to get into theological debates.”“If the president has a certain attitude to a certain religion, that’s something you can ask him,” Gorka said on the radio show. “But we’re talking about national security and the totalitarian ideologies that drive the groups that threaten America.”Later on in the interview, Gorka admitted that Islam itself is not the enemy. But he still believes that terrorism is fueled by religious fervor ― a phenomenon he called “global jihadism.”Jihad is a word that is often misused by both Muslim extremists and by Islamophobes. For the overwhelming majority of the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims, jihad is a religious concept that means “to struggle” and refers to a Muslim’s inner struggle to become a better person.This is the second time Inskeep asked Gorka to comment on whether Trump believes Islam is a religion. In an earlier interview on Feb. 3, Gorka told Inskeep that this is “not a discussion about Islam as a religion or not a religion. It’s about radical Islamic terrorism.”The Huffington Post reached out to The White House for clarification on Gorka’s statements, but has not heard back. Trump hasn’t publicly responded to the question of whether he believes Islam is a religion.But the president has displayed an inability to distinguish between the Islam and terrorism. On the campaign trail, he said he thinks “Islam hates us.” Gorka’s comments reflect the dangerously misguided view of Islam held by many of Trump’s top advisors. Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, has described Islam as a “political ideology.” In the past, Bannon has given anti-Muslims extremists a platform to spread their views on his radio show. Gorka himself has touted the view that the violence perpetuated by militant groups like the Islamic State is rooted in Islam and in the “martial language” of the Quran. His views align with the vision of Islam promoted by anti-Muslim hate groups, whose numbers have been rising in the U.S. These hate groups often speak of Islam as a totalitarian ideology, one that seeks to impose a brutal interpretation of Sharia law on American courts. But this is a deeply flawed view of Islam.Much like Jewish Halakha, Sharia is a set of religious laws that cover aspects of a Muslim’s spiritual life. No Muslim organization has ever called for Sharia to supersede the U.S. Constitution. John L. Esposito is a Georgetown University professor and author of Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam. He told The Huffington Post that terrorist groups like ISIS exploit religion for political purposes.“Religion is used by ISIS to legitimate its cause and recruit and mobilize followers,” Esposito told The Huffington Post in an email. “But ... the vast majority of Muslims regard this use or that of [Al Qaeda] and other terrorists as a hijacking of their religion ... Their barbaric actions (the killing of civilians, men, women and children) contradict Islamic law itself.”Although Gorka dodged NPR’s questions about whether Trump thinks Islam is a religion, the administration has had no problem attempting to link Islam to terrorist attacks. H.R. McMaster, Trump’s own national security advisor, has tried to persuade the White House to stop using the term “radical Islamic terrorism,” saying that terrorists like the Islamic State militants are not representative of Islam as a whole and that the term alienates American Muslims.But Trump has used the term often, on the campaign trail and in the White House. He said it with relish during his first speech to Congress.Gorka emphasized his support for the term during the interview with NPR. “It is radical Islamic terrorism, and that’s never changed and it will not change,” Gorka said.Esposito believes the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” sends the wrong signal. “To use the word Islamic will imply to many that these terrorists and their actions are supported by the overwhelming majority of Muslims or seen by them as somehow religiously legitimate​,” he told HuffPost.While Trump and his administration speak often about what they call radical Islamic terrorism, they have remained resolutely quiet about supporting America’s 3.3 million Muslims. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have been on the rise for years. This year alone, mosques have been vandalized and deliberately set on fire and a prominent Muslim civil rights leader has been threatened with assault.  Catherine Orsborn, campaign director of Shoulder to Shoulder, an interfaith organization dedicated to ending Islamophobia, told The Huffington Post that the White House’s focus on “radical Islamic terrorism” highlights a “huge disconnect” between what American Muslims are facing and how the administration is thinking about these issues.“They’re not demonstrating any level of concern for American Muslims to live in peace and security,” Orsborn told HuffPost last week. “And we need our government to not only speak out against attacks on Muslims, but also show by their actions that they do indeed respect the rights and freedoms of American Muslims as part of the fabric of our country.” "

As is the case with extreme rainfall events, these storms are becoming increasingly common due to our warming planet.Just because these storms tend to fly under the radar both in media and research circles doesn’t mean they should be taken any less seriously, according to study co-author Amir AghaKouchak, a civil and environmental engineering professor at University of California-Irvine.“Non-extreme weather events don’t get a lot of attention, but we spend a lot of money on them,” AghaKouchak told The Huffington Post. “The cumulative costs are significant and we need to start monitoring them and collecting data to understand them better.”AghaKouchak was inspired to look into the collective impacts of these smaller flooding events after he learned of the so-called long tail theory, which suggests the cumulative impact of a frequent, minor event could match or exceed that of a rare, major event.He wondered if the impacts of more common, less extreme flooding events that might strike a coastal U.S. city, for example, a few times per month or a few times a year might similarly match — or even exceed — the impacts associated with major disasters on the magnitude of a Katrina or Sandy.The results, based on a cumulative hazard index developed by the researchers, indicate that less extreme “nuisance” flooding could prove just as destructive to many cities, over time, as those extreme events.The researchers’ analysis considered the future risk of flooding events ranging from minor “nuisance” flooding and extreme disasters and compared estimates of these storms’ impacts in 11 U.S. coastal cities.Their analysis found that five of the cities — San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, New York and Washington, D.C. — had estimated impacts associated with minor flooding that was just as, or more, serious than the impacts associated with extreme events.Of course, the study notes, direct comparisons between the varying impacts of different types of storms are difficult to make, particularly when it comes to intangible costs like human fatalities that can be caused by extreme storms.But still, the costs associated with minor storms can prove tremendous ― and life-threatening in their own right.“If we act too late, we will have significant negative impacts,” AghaKouchak said.Such flooding can significantly degrade infrastructure like roads and building foundations. It can also impact sewer infrastructure, potentially resulting in serious public health risks. These minor flooding events are also a drain on municipal budgets — due to the resources required to pump water out of streets — and also can force the closure of schools and businesses.Rising sea levels spurred on by climate change are contributing to increased frequency, and an increased cumulative effect, of these storms.In D.C., the study noted, the number of hours of nuisance flooding per year has increased almost 400 percent over the last 50 years, from about 19 hours between the years 1930 and 1970 to about 94 over the past two decades. Projections indicate that number will continue to grow at an increasing rate — to as much as 700 hours per year — by 2050.To address the problem, AghaKouchak said coastal cities will need to get proactive with flood control measures, though he added that there is no one-size-fits-all solution.New York City is already working to do just that, launching an ambitious flood resiliency plan that includes the large “Big U” project aims to flood-proof lower Manhattan.The $505 million project, however, is not yet funded fully. And, of course, what works in New York may not work in Miami — or anywhere else for that matter.“These issues are very local and there is no single recipe for all cities around the country,” AghaKouchak said. “Each city has to come up with their own plan, and each plan won’t necessarily work in other places.”The issue is growing more serious with time. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s latest sea-level rise estimate anticipates scenarios ranging from 1 foot to an “extreme” 8.2 feet rise by 2100.Beyond the inconvenience of shutting down roads or schools, the trend could force millions of people from their homes. A recent study estimated that as many as 13.1 million Americans could be displaced if the sea level rises 6 inches by century’s end. An estimated 4.2 million people would be forced out of their homes by a 3-inch rise, according to the study.Because the stakes are so high, AghaKouchak believes action should be taken— and funded — as quickly as possible.“This may not get a lot of attention, but beyond a certain point, we will see the impacts everywhere,” AghaKouchak said. “The sooner we take action and plan, the better.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

The rapper and executive producer of “Time: The Kalief Browder Story,” was featured in the docuseries, remembering Browder as a “prophet.”“I believe our prophets come in many shapes or forms,” Jay Z said in the episode that aired Wednesday. “Sometimes our prophets come in the form of young undeveloped energy that will teach all us grown-ups how to love better and have more compassion.”Jay was first touched by Browder’s story when he met the young man after he was released from Rikers Island. Unable to make the $3,000 bail and unwilling to take a plea deal for allegedly stealing a backpack, Browder had spent years behind bars waiting for a trial that never happened. He was abused by correctional officers and inmates, and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement. In 2013, the charges against him were dropped. His sister Nicole Browder previously told The Huffington Post that her brother was consumed by paranoia and started fights with his family once he returned home. It was a serious change from Browder’s demeanor before his arrest, she said. In 2015, at just 22 years old, Browder died by suicide. Jay Z said he was “thrown off course” when he heard about Browder’s death, but he hopes the young man’s story will “save a lot of lives.”“What was done to him was a huge injustice, and I think people see his story and realize like, man, this is going on,” he told Democracy Now! earlier this year. “This is not like one case that happened. This is happening to a lot of people, you know, especially places where I come from ― inner boroughs and Marcy Projects and the Bronx and Brooklyn and all these places. So, it’s very important, his story.”H/T The GrioRead more about “Time: The Kalief Browder Story” here. "

The plaque beneath reads, “This sculpture honors the caring and robust lives of William L. Corporon, M.D., Reat Griffin Underwood and Teresa R. LaManno.

He killed three Christians instead, 53-year-old LaManno, 14-year-old Reat Griffin Underwood and Reat’s 69-year-old grandfather, Dr. William L. Corporon. Grandfather and grandson had gone to the community center so Reat could audition for a singing competition. They pulled into the parking lot just as Miller opened fire. Five minutes later, Reat’s mother, Mindy Corporon, arrived for the audition. She said she remembers pulling into the parking lot to find her father dead with a gruesome close-range shotgun wound and her first-born taking his last breaths.“It was like a building fell on top of me,” she told The Huffington Post on Monday evening, sitting at her dining table beneath photos of Reat and his younger brother, Lucas. Corporon, 48, wears an earring in the shape of a butterfly, which has come to represent her memories of Reat, and a small gold crucifix around her neck.She keeps busy, looking after Lucas, who turns 15 this Saturday, running a wealth management firm and working at Seven Days, an organization she founded to unite people of all faiths and cultures to help eliminate hate and the violence it can cause. She’s told the story of her family’s tragedy many times. The repetition helps her heal, she says, and it’s a story she tells with astonishing grace and composure. But when she heard about the Olathe shootings last week, the horror of that day in 2014 came rushing back. “All the sudden I just shut down and I had to go to bed,” she said. “I couldn’t function anymore.” Tragically, what happened at the Jewish Community Center was not an isolated incident. Seven months later, in December 2014, a 15-year-old Somali-American boy, Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, was intentionally run over and killed outside the Somali Center of Kansas City mosque. The driver was a Somali Christian man named Ahmed H. Aden, a man mosque members said had been harassing and threatening them for months. Two months earlier, a parishioner had taken a photo of Aden driving by in his SUV. On the back of the vehicle was a bumper sticker that read, “Quran is a virus disease (worse) than Ebola.”The following year, in 2015, FBI statistics show, hate crimes in the Kansas City area jumped 35 percent, driven largely by a a 60 percent increase in religiously motivated hate crimes.The same was true across the U.S., where general hate crimes rose 7 percent, driven by a 67 percent increase in hate crimes targeting Muslims. But while the FBI counted 5,479 hate crimes that year, another government report estimates that number to be much higher.A survey by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that there are likely a staggering 260,000 hate crimes annually in America, most of which go unreported. This trend can be seen abundantly in Kansas City, especially since the presidential election: swastikas, “n****r” and “Hail Pres Trump” were drawn inside a library; swastikas have been found spray-painted on a school building; a gay man was assaulted and his car was vandalized with derogatory terms; and an Olathe school principal sent a letter home to parents saying multiple students had been “harassed based on their race/ethnicity.” The Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City, where Mindy Corporon’s son and father were killed, is among 77 Jewish Community Centers across the U.S. to have received bomb threats in 2017.The postelection period has also been a catalyst, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracked over 1,000 bias incidents in the month after the Nov. 8 election. Perpetrators in some 37 percent of those incidents, according to the SPLC, directly referenced either Trump, his campaign slogans or his comments about sexual assault. But Mindy Corporon doesn’t blame Trump for recent hate crime incidents. “Make America great again,” like any slogan, she said, can be interpreted for both good and bad. What concerns Corporon now is that there are more people like Miller out there. “People have free speech, but I think there’s a limit on how free it needs to be if you’re spewing so much hate that it leads to that type of behavior,” Corporon said. “And they go on to shatter someone’s life because of it.” Miller was never actually charged with a hate crime. That’s because Kansas is one of the few states that doesn’t have a hate crime statute. And although the federal government flirted with charging Miller with a hate crime, it became a moot point once the state of Kansas pursued ― and ultimately got ― a death sentence.This story was reported using data from ProPublica’s Documenting Hate Project.

If you’ve been a victim or a witness, tell us your story. “It doesn’t mean it’s not a hate crime if it’s not charged that way,” Corporon said. “It’s not like they’re taking it away from us.

The community, she said, knows it’s a hate crime, whether the federal government ends up calling it that or not. She understands better than anyone what Sunayana Dumala ― the wife of Kuchibhotla, the man killed at Austins ― must be going through. She knows the deep anguish and the shock, and she knows what’s ahead. Dumala traveled with her husband’s body back to India on Monday, where he was cremated in a Hindu funeral ceremony. Asked what she would tell Dumala if given the opportunity, Corporon said, “If I told her something right now, she wouldn’t remember anyway.” “She’s with the people that she needs to be with,” Corporon added. “At some point in time, I know that we will meet.” If there’s anything Corporon has learned over these last three years, first, she said, it’s that “we’re not born to hate. We’re born to want to be nurtured and valued and loved and to give love.”  And second, she said, is that there is evil in this world. “I didn’t believe in evil,” she said. “But there is evil.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the number of Jewish Community Centers that have received bomb threats in 2017.

So when one working mother needed to nurse her baby during a live TV appearance, she managed to pull it off with only the slightest hitch.On Feb. 24, writer and entrepreneur Rachel Sklar tweeted a gif from a CBC News broadcast in which she appeared as a guest commentator. “I went on TV while nursing and you couldn’t tell (until the end),” she wrote, referencing the moment her baby’s hand sneakily appeared in the frame.Sklar has a 1-year-old daughter named Ruby. The clip she tweeted is from a January 2016 broadcast. “I have been providing occasional commentary for CBC News for almost a decade now,” Sklar told The Huffington Post, adding that the network still calls her occasionally to comment on matters relating media, politics and gender.“They had reached out to invite me to comment on the new diverse Barbies, and I let them know I was home with no childcare and might have to nurse her to keep her quiet if I couldn’t get her to sleep ― which is what I did!” the mom explained. “I used my laptop camera and set it up so it cropped me just below the shoulders. It was about a five minute segment.”Sklar has experience subduing her baby girl while appearing on live television. During a CBC News segment about then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and “Saturday Night Live” in October, Sklar devised a system.”I rocked Ruby in the bouncer with my foot while holding the iPad out and talking into it,” she explained, adding, “That was not the best setup.” During another appearance in October, Ruby was asleep but woke up about halfway through the segment. “She toddled out, so I scooped her up and breastfed her on air again. Her little arms came up this time too,” Sklar recalled, adding that she’d warned CBC ahead of time this might happen. “They were very quick with the chyrons and the B-roll,” she said. “This one was a bit more of a juggle in trying to stay on topic while keeping her shushed, so I had to end it myself.”Sklar’s on-air breastfeeding is reminiscent of a similar occurrence in August of 2015 when Ireland-based journalist and TV personality Dil Wickremasinghe nursed her 11-week-old son Phoenix while discussing attachment parenting on the talk show “Midday.” U.K. reality star Sam Faiers also made a splash for breastfeeding her 9-month-old son, Paul, during an appearance on ITV’s “This Morning” in October. And back in March 2015, journalist Rebecca Traister went on MSNBC with her newborn daughter, Bella, though she did not nurse the baby.Being able to nurse on the job is a privilege for Sklar.“I work for myself, so I have had a ton of flexibility around nursing,” she told HuffPost. “That said, I have had a number of meetings or professional events that I bring her to ― SXSW, WHCD, DNC ― because otherwise I wouldn’t be able to go (especially since she was a bad eater early on and wouldn’t take a bottle ― the struggle was real), so I’d nurse where needed.”Sklar said she nursed Ruby during a panel at the BlogHer conference in 2015 and also “quietly in the background” of a professional dinner she attended.“Next to sleeping, nursing is the most reliable way to keep a tot quiet,” Sklar said. “Things are different now she’s a toddler and is in daycare full-time but even so, it’s a great tool to have in the arsenal.”"

The blast was followed immediately by gunfire between security forces and an unknown number of attackers.Fighting at police headquarters, not far from a military training school, lasted for several hours with gunmen barricaded inside the building.Najib Danesh, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said the attack was neutralized by late afternoon and security forces were conducting checks of the area.He said 15 people, including 11 civilians, were killed in the attack and in a separate one minutes later at an office of Afghanistan’s main intelligence agency, the National Directorate for Security (NDS), to the east of Kabul.Another 50 people, including women and children, were wounded in the two attacks.A senior army official said the attack on the NDS office was over more quickly.“Two terrorists entered a building. One blew himself up and the second was shot by Afghan security forces,” said Abdul Nasir Ziaee, commander of 111th corps based in the east of the city.A spokesman for the Taliban, who sometimes exaggerate the impact of their operations, sent a statement claiming responsibility for the attacks, which he said had killed dozens of soldiers, police and intelligence officials.Last month, a suicide bomber killed at least 20 people outside the Supreme Court in Kabul. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for that attack.The Taliban are seeking to expel foreign troops, defeat the U.S.-backed government and reimpose Islamic law after their 2001 ouster.The Wednesday attacks come shortly ahead of the period when the Taliban usually announce a spring offensive, and underline warnings from Afghan officials that they faced a difficult year.In the northern province of Baghlan, the Taliban seized control of a district center after days of heavy fighting. Faiz Mohammad Amiri, governor of Tala wa Barfak district, said the Taliban had taken control. Four members of the security forces had been killed and another four wounded.The Taliban’s main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, said light and heavy weapons had been captured.Government forces have struggled to control the insurgency since a NATO-led force ended its combat mission in 2014.According to U.S. estimates, Afghan government forces now control less than 60 percent of the country although they hold all main provincial centers."

CNN first reported the strike.The official said Masri, as he was widely known, had sought refuge in Iran after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, and was believed to have been in Syria helping to direct Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, an al-Qaeda branch previously called the Nusra Front, the official said.The Iranians released him from house arrest almost two years ago, in exchange for a diplomat being held hostage in Yemen by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.An Iranian diplomat held hostage in Yemen since 2013 returned home to Tehran in 2015 amid conflicting accounts of how he was freed from his unidentified abductors. At the time Iran said the diplomat had been rescued by an Iranian intelligence operation in Yemen. But Yemeni media run by the Iran-allied Houthi group said the diplomat was freed in a prisoner exchange that took place in another country.Masri’s death was the end of an almost 19-year U.S. hunt for him. A second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Masri was thought to be one of the planners of the 1998 attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania."

In a new report published on Tuesday, the United Nations warns that tens of thousands of children may face extreme threats of violence and abuse along the way. Interviews with more than a hundred migrant and refugee women and children in Libya in September 2016 revealed that many children traveling along the central Mediterranean migration route have been exposed to sexual violence, abuse, exploitation and detention, the UN’s Children’s Fund said in its new report, “A Deadly Journey For Children.”Three-quarters of the children surveyed told researchers of violence and harassment at the hands of adults while making their way to the Mediterranean coast. Several of them experienced sexual abuse, some of them multiple times. Many of those held in Libyan detention centers detailed horrid living conditions and constant fear. “My journey from Nigeria to Libya was horrible and dangerous,” said Jon, a 15-year-old boy who left his home country fearing Boko Haram militants. “Only God saved me in the desert, no food, no water, nothing. The guy who was sitting next to me on the trip died. And once one dies in the desert, they throw away the body and that’s it.”More than 28,000 migrant and refugee children crossed from Libya to Italy in 2016, UNICEF said, twice as many as the year before. At the time of UNICEF’s survey, an estimated 23,000 children had been officially identified in Libya, although the organization believes the real number is at least three times higher. Most of these children left their home countries in Africa and the Middle East hoping to find safety and prosperity in Europe. They traveled across the Sahara to Libya’s Mediterranean coast, almost always after paying a smuggler hundreds of dollars to ferry them along the way. Of the children arriving on the Italian coast, 9-in-10 did so alone, unaccompanied by adult family members or friends. The most dangerous legs of this route, UNICEF says, is the Mediterranean crossing and the trek from the southern border of Libya’s desert to the coast. Five years after the ouster of Muammar Gaddafi, there’s no rule of law in many parts of Libya. The Tripoli-based government and General Khalifa Haftar are locked in a debilitating battle for control. Armed groups hold sway over large swathes of land and crucial smuggling routes. Several extremist militant groups have pledged allegiance to the self-described Islamic State. Migrants and refugees traveling in this security vacuum, particularly unaccompanied children, are at extreme risk. UNICEF says children reported experiencing extortion, violence, sexual abuse and detention at border crossings and checkpoints. Women and children traveling together reported being separated. Most of the children told of verbal or emotional abuse, and about half had suffered physical abuse. They often lacked food and access to basic health care. Libyan authorities run 24 detention centers for migrants and refugees which hold between 4,000 and 7,000 people. Children who had been detained told UNICEF of poor nutrition, a lack of clothing and access to medicines. They were often crammed in small cells with adults. “Here they treat us like chickens,” Jon from Nigeria said about the center he’d been detained at for seven months. “They beat us, they do not give us good water and good food. They harass us. So many people are dying here, dying from disease, freezing to death.” In addition to the official detention centers, armed militants operate an unknown number of unofficial holding pens. According to UNICEF, “the militia-run detention centers were no more than forced labour camps, farms, warehouses and makeshift prisons run by armed groups.”More than 5,000 people died last year while trying to cross the Mediterranean, at least 700 of them were children. The number is only expected to rise in 2017. This winter has been the most deadly on record so far. At least 1,191 migrants and refugees drowned in the central Mediterranean between November 2016 and January 2017. “The men who pushed us on the boat told us to look at the stars,” recounted 9-year-old Kamis. “The boat was in the middle of the sea and everybody was crying. The wind was moving our boat so everybody was shouting. Everybody was crying. When we saw a small ship, we shouted, ‘Please come and rescue us.’ They rescued us and took us to dry land.”Since nearly dying at sea, Kamis and his mother Aza, who paid $1,400 for their journey from Nigeria to Libya, have been detained in the country. “They did not tell me the truth. They did not tell me the risks involved or the difficulties I would face,” Aza said. “It all became a reality for me when I saw the situation. The sea that expanded right before my eyes. ... I have done all this for my children and for their future, and I did not want to lose them.”"

Shell is one of the largest producers of crude oil in northern Alberta.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b624401b00003600b5b33e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON — “Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.” That was among the many clear warnings that oil giant Shell issued in a film it produced about climate change more than 25 years ago. Many environmentalists, however, argue that the company has largely ignored its own alarm bells.The 1991 film, “Climate of Concern,” resurfaced Tuesday on the Dutch online news outlet The Correspondent. It’s the latest in an ever-growing body of evidence that suggests the oil industry has long known about the climate risks associated with carbon dioxide emissions — and has actively worked to cover them up.“The need to understand the interplay of atmosphere and oceans has been given a new sense of urgency by the realization that our energy-consuming way of life may be causing climatic changes with adverse consequences to us all,” the nearly 30-minute video notes. The film is eerily prophetic, warning of spiraling global temperatures, a sea level rise that could prove “disastrous,” wetland habitats inundated by salt water and ferocious storm surges brought on by warming ocean temperatures. “What is now considered abnormal weather could become a new norm,” the film’s narrator says. “In a crowded world subject to such adverse shifts of climate, who would take care of such greenhouse refugees?”According to The Correspondent, which shared the video with The Guardian, the film was produced for the public eye, particularly for viewing in schools and universities, but has gone largely unseen for many years. In a separate 1986 document reviewed by both publications, Shell reportedly wrote of the uncertainties regarding climate science but noted that “changes may be the greatest in recorded history.”In an interview with The Correspondent, professor Tom Wigley, the former head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, which assisted Shell in creating the film, spoke about the accuracy of its predictions. “It’s amazing it’s 25 years ago,” Wigley said. “It was quite comprehensive on what might happen, what the consequences are, and what we can do about it. I mean, there’s not much more.”Along with linking fossil fuel consumption and rising carbon dioxide emissions to warming global temperatures, the film celebrates renewable energy technologies, including solar and wind. Although Shell does recognize climate change and made investments in wind energy, it is also a key player in the destructive and dirty Canadian tar sands.In an email Tuesday to The Huffington Post, a Shell spokesman said, “Our position on climate change is well known; recognizing the climate challenge and the role energy has in enabling a decent quality of life. Shell continues to call for effective policy to support lower carbon business and consumer choices and opportunities such as government lead carbon pricing/trading schemes.”But environmental groups aren’t convinced that the company has walked the walk when it comes to acting to combat climate change.“The fact that Shell understood all this in 1991, and that a quarter-century later it was trying to open up the Arctic to oil-drilling, tells you all you’ll ever need to know about the corporate ethic of the fossil fuel industry,” Bill McKibben, the co-founder of 350.org, said in a statement. “Shell made a big difference in the world ― a difference for the worse.”In the film (which can be seen in full here), Shell warned that while global warming was not fully understood, “many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible.” “Whether or not the threat of global warming proves as grave as the scientists predict, is it too much to hope that it might act as the stimulus, the catalyst, to a new era of technical and economic cooperation?” the narrator asks. “Our numbers are many and infinitely diverse, but the problems and dilemmas of climatic change concern us all.”"

Then, they increased the exposure until they detected a pacemaker failure.Five patients in the study had what’s known as unipolar leads, when pacemakers have just one contact point with the heart. The remaining 114 participants had bipolar leads, with two points of contact. In all five patients with unipolar leads, pacemakers set to either basic or maximum sensitivity were impacted by the initial exposure of 50 Hz, the study found.For patients with bipolar leads, electromagnetic interference occurred with about 72 percent of cases with maximum sensitivity and 36 percent of instances with nominal sensitivity, researchers report in Circulation.It’s possible that staying more than 12 inches away from an electromagnetic source like an appliance or tool might limit the potential for pacemaker interference, the authors note.Still, the researchers conclude that people exposed to stronger electromagnetic fields on the job, such as workers in certain types of manufacturing, might need to consider the potential for pacemaker malfunction.“Patients should inform the doctors before device implantation if they are exposed to strong electromagnetic fields in daily practice or in the work environment,” Napp said. “During follow up visits in the pacemaker outpatient clinic, care must be taken while reprogramming the sensitivity of the device.”Welding in particular can expose patients to electromagnetic fields that interfere with pacemakers, said Dr. Gordon Tomaselli, chief of cardiology at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.“It’s not surprising that pacemakers could be coaxed to experience electromagnetic malfunction,” Tomaselli, who wasn’t involved in the study, said in a phone interview.Most tools and appliances people use at home probably aren’t a problem, Tomaselli added.“Welders are a problem, but with most other tools people would use I don’t prohibit that,” Tomaselli said. “But certainly if people are feeling odd or fatigued or having symptoms like they had before they got the pacemaker I tell them to see me or see their doctor.”The study was funded by grants from the German Social Accident Insurance Institution for the Energy, Textile, Electric, and Media Products Sector and the Research Unit for Electropathology.Dr. Napp and another author, Dr. Matthias Daniel Zink, have both received various forms of support from pacemaker manufacturers.SOURCE: bit.ly/1q3uqj1 Circulation, online February 27, 2017."

68,MEDIA,"Media Figures Tout Trump's ‘Presidential’ Shift, But His Divisive Policies Remain The Same",Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-presidential-tone-divisive-policies_us_58b6fd15e4b019d36d0fcdd6,"""Nationalism with an indoor voice,” is reportedly how one senior White House source described it.",2017-03-01,"CNN highlighted Trump's ""presidential"" tone on Wednesday's homepage, via @JuddLegum.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b713ec2200001f004ae031.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump was elected president of the United States on Nov. 8 and placed his hand on the Bible and swore to defend the Constitution on Jan. 20. But it was on the night of Feb. 28, following Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress, that prominent media figures finally declared him president. “I feel like tonight, Donald Trump became the president of the United States,” Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said. “He became president of the United States,” liberal CNN commentator Van Jones said after the speech. Specifically, Jones praised Trump’s honoring of Carryn Owens, the wife of slain Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens, as “one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics.”On NBC, veteran anchor Tom Brokaw said the media had been waiting for Trump to “pivot to being presidential.” Trump’s address, he said, “is easily the most presidential he’s been.”Journalists also highlighted Trump’s newfound “presidential” tone on Twitter.Members of the news media have long sought a moment when Trump, a 70-year-old politician and entertainer seemingly set in his ways ― ever quick to insult, boast and exaggerate ― would suddenly “pivot” into a more subdued statesman.The speech to Congress on Tuesday night was similar to a State of the Union address in its delivery, and carried with it the ceremonial pomp and circumstance that comes with the job. Trump read his prepared speech off a teleprompter without veering off script to lob attacks on opponents and air grievances with “enemies” in the media. But the hour-long shift in style doesn’t change the substance of his remarks. Trump again promised to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and stoked fears of out-of-control immigrant crime, as he did when he launched his presidential campaign 21 months ago by saying Mexican “rapists” and drug dealers were streaming into the country.He again promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, while offering no specifics on how to do it. Trump also called for a $1 trillion infrastructure plan without providing details on how to implement it. He again spoke of the United States fighting “radical Islamic terrorism,” a phrase his national security adviser reportedly urged him to leave out. Though Brokaw dubbed Trump’s speech his “most presidential,” the veteran news anchor also highlighted its divisive claims about immigrants. “There’s a lot of crime in America that doesn’t involve immigrants, including shooting crimes,” Brokaw said. “We have had mass murders that don’t involve immigrants, don’t involve Islamic terrorists as well. No one is condemning gun violence in the country; only when it involves an immigrant of some kind. So he’s saying, ‘I want to be inclusive,’ but he singles them out.”Trump’s rhetoric, at times, butted heads with reality. For instance, he claimed his administration would promote “clear water” just hours after he signed an executive order to dismantle the Obama-era Clean Water Rule. Trump also called for an end to “trivial fights,” despite his years of spats on Twitter over matters such as “Saturday Night Live” skits. During Tuesday night’s speech, Trump also uttered several false or misleading statements, including a claim that 94 million Americans are out of the labor force. That sensational number includes students, the disabled and elderly. CNBC reported last month that only 5.4 million are actively looking for work.Some journalists, like Mother Jones’ David Corn, expressed concerns about the press’ reaction to Trump’s address.On Wednesday morning, Jose Antonio Vargas, an undocumented journalist and founder of the organization Define American, called out English-language media in the U.S. for its “sheer ineptitude” in covering immigration. “It’s been incredibly frustrating and angering to hear reporters who should know better, who should be operating in facts, who should be wanting context, just be willing to buy what Donald Trump was selling as a candidate and now as president,” Vargas said. But it’s not only critics of Trump’s policies who suggest his nationalistic policies and vision for America hasn’t changed despite his “softer” or more “moderate” delivery on Tuesday night. Bloomberg Businessweek’s Joshua Green, who profiled Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon in 2015 and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller this week, tweeted that an unnamed senior White House official described the speech to him as “nationalism with an indoor voice.”And the Washington Post’s Robert Costa, another reporter plugged into the Trump White House, tweeted that sources there “are frankly surprised at how pundits are warming to the speech.” These White House sources, Costa noted, “say Trump has not changed” and that there is “no big shift in policy coming.”Elise Foley contributed reporting.

He promoted family leave and child care policies but offered no details.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b632c32200001f004add6d.jpeg?cache=3KUCAYpcGW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before an audience Tuesday night that included female legislators dressed in white to protest his record on women, President Donald Trump told a joint session of Congress that he wanted to work with them on two policies that are key to gender equality and long the territory of Democrats: paid family leave and affordable child care.“My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave,” Trump said. The child care and leave ideas come at the urging of Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who holds no official position in his administration but has reportedly been pushing legislators to pass a child care tax credit as part of a larger tax overhaul. Her proposal would cost an estimated $500 billion over 10 years, according to Bloomberg.Even if the policies come to nothing, and the versions that Trump has floated before have been extremely weak, that a Republican president is even talking about them is fairly remarkable. Particularly this president, a man accused by more than a dozen women of sexual harassment, who’s already moved to curtail abortion rights overseas and whose presence in the Oval Office has led millions of women across the country to take to the streets in protest. Trump’s inner circle is entirely male with the exception of senior counsel Kellyanne Conway. Indeed, the last president to put so few women into his first Cabinet was Ronald Reagan. Trump has also offered little indication that he’s thinking of the needs of working women, recently addressing a roomful of governors and “their wives,” perhaps having forgotten that some U.S. governors are women.Trump on Tuesday seemed to be trying to position himself as more female friendly, also touting a partnership with Canada meant to foster entrepreneurship among women.The U.S. is the only developed economy without paid leave. The lack leads many women to leave the workforce or scale back their careers and ultimately keeps many out of the labor force. The lack of affordable child care also holds women, who are typically the family caretakers, back from the workforce. Since at least the 1970s, the GOP has opposed supporting day care because it clashed with “family values.” President Richard Nixon even vetoed a bipartisan bill that would’ve provided for subsidized universal childcare. The underlying rationale was: don’t encourage women to work because they belong at home.“I know of no mainstream elected Republican who’s on board with child care support,” Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Center for American Progress, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday.In reality, most children are now growing up in households where the mother works outside the home.Trump offered no further details on these plans in his speech, but he seems to be following up on two proposals he made over the summer during the presidential campaign.Citing his daughter, Trump said then that he’d like to give women six weeks of paid maternity leave and provide tax credits for parents who pay for child care.Both policies were widely panned at the time by policy experts who said neither would have its advertised effect. The tax credit would wind up benefiting parents at the higher end of the income scale, who actually get tax refunds. Tax deductions are more valuable to people who make a lot of money (and pay a lot of taxes) than they are to those with low incomes who already pay little income tax.Plus, a onetime cash infusion for those lower-income families would be hard to budget out over a year to pay the high cost of child care. In some states, day care costs more than college tuition. “Even with Ivankacare’s regressive, flawed structure, it’s nice to at least hear an American president take child care seriously as an economic issue — an approach that many other first world countries were on board with a generation ago,” Madowitz said.Trump’s paid leave proposal leaves out adoptive parents and fathers ― and runs counter to most state and city policies that now offer paid family leave to caretakers who require time off to look after an infant or a sick relative.“The words say ‘parents’ and ‘family leave,’ but the proposal he has put forward is for maternity leave only,” said Ellen Bravo, co-director of Family Values @ Work, “leaving out non-birth parents and all the other reasons people need leave for their own serious illness or that of a family member. The proposal is also for only six weeks and would come from an under-funded source: state unemployment insurance funds. The devil is in the details, and if these are the details, they are devilish indeed, leaving behind those most in need of leave and least likely to have access.” "

In the photo, the baby wears a cranial helmet with the words “Nevertheless she persisted.”In the caption, Lori dedicated the post to her fellow NICU parents. “My little girl was born with some health issues that resulted in some pretty intense interventions that ended up saving her,” she wrote. “We were told by the doctors some pretty scary news ... we were given an explanation of what to expect but nevertheless, despite the rollercoaster, she persisted”“Nevertheless she persisted” is of course a reference to the battle cry many women adopted after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) silenced Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as she read a letter from Coretta Scott King during during a debate over the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) for attorney general.“She was warned,” McConnell later stated. “She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.”Lori told The Huffington Post she was struck by the incident. “I watched Senator Warren as she was trying to read the letter from Mrs. King. I saw the look of shock as they tried to silence her and her disbelief that they wouldn’t let her read the letter regarding Sessions. I was in shock myself,” she recalled.“When I heard Mitch McConnell use that phrase as a way to explain what happened and his treatment of Senator Warren, it bothered me, and apparently I wasn’t alone,” she added. “So let’s take what he said and empower ourselves with it.

I was in shock myself,” she recalled.“When I heard Mitch McConnell use that phrase as a way to explain what happened and his treatment of Senator Warren, it bothered me, and apparently I wasn’t alone,” she added. “So let’s take what he said and empower ourselves with it.

75,POLITICS,DOJ Fought Texas' Voter ID Law For Years. Now It Just Wants To Wait For A Fix.,Roque Planas and Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justice-department-texas-voter-id-law_us_58b624d6e4b060480e0cce6d,The Trump administration wants to give the state more time to tweak a law that courts have found discriminates against Latino and black voters.,2017-03-01,"A woman waits to vote after having an ID check in Austin, Texas.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b62dbd27000020007d732a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — The Department of Justice walked a fine line Tuesday on its commitment to ensuring voting rights when it asked a federal judge to give Texas a few months to try to fix a voter ID law that courts have found violates the Constitution and federal law by discriminating against minority voters.John Gore, the No. 2 in command at the department’s Civil Rights Division, stopped short of denying that Texas purposefully discriminated against the state’s Hispanic and black voters when it passed a law in 2011 requiring citizens to present photo IDs to cast a ballot ― a position the Obama administration had taken for years.In a shift for the federal government, he urged U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzalez Ramos to hold off on resolving that key question in the long-running case, which was once regarded as a test case for whether the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had any life left in it after the Supreme Court scrapped one of its major provisions. To add to the symbolism, Gore’s plea came on the same day Attorney General Jeff Sessions closed out Black History Month with a paean to civil rights for all.  Gore told Gonzalez Ramos that the Trump administration’s new position in the case, unveiled Monday in a last-minute court filing, “speaks for itself.”Which is to say, Texas Republicans ― who hold majorities in both houses of the state Legislature ― are already taking steps to pass a new voter ID law. While cautioning that the proposal might fail or be amended, Gore said the Justice Department now believes the proposed legislation will probably fix the problems the court found with the original law ― and that there’s no need for Gonzalez Ramos to take action now to determine whether lawmakers intended to disenfranchise black and Latino voters when they enacted the law in 2011.“A new law might fix some of the issues the 5th Circuit identified,” Gore said, in a reference to an appeals court ruling last summer that kicked the case back to the lower court so that DOJ, voting rights advocates and Texas may address claims that lawmakers took race into account when approving the original voter ID bill.If the judge moves forward with a ruling now, Gore added, the court “might have to do its work all over again,” and so he advised waiting for legislators to act so the case can be resolved “only once and not potentially twice.”In 2014, following an eight-day trial, Gonzalez Ramos ruled that Texas’ voter restrictions amounted to a “poll tax” that violated the Voting Rights Act and the equality guarantee of the U.S. Constitution, among other findings. But in a partial reversal, the full U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in July disagreed with Gonzalez Ramos that Senate Bill 14 was passed with a discriminatory intent ― while concluding more broadly that the voter ID provision did have a disproportionate effect on minority voters.“My primary theme is very simple, and that is your honor got it right the first time,” said Ezra Rosenberg of the judge’s sweeping 2014 ruling. Rosenberg is an attorney for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the several civil rights organizations challenging the Texas law.These groups found themselves in an awkward position Tuesday, sitting on the plaintiffs’ side alongside the DOJ lawyer ― while attorneys for Texas, the longtime defendant in the case, sat on the opposite side of the courtroom. On the very day Donald Trump was elected president, the federal government signaled it would take a different position in the case ― after years of opposing the law in court during the Obama administration.Angela Colmenero, representing the state of Texas, argued that Republicans pushed the bill through only after six years of Democratic opposition made it clear that consensus on voter ID would be impossible to reach. Referencing a PowerPoint presentation screened off to her left, she said the state passed the law in response to public opinion demanding that the legislators update their system of voter registration to protect against fraud. “I remember specifically asking about it,” Gonzalez Ramos said, referring to the scarcity of actual instances of voter fraud presented at trial. “The [5th] Circuit also realized there’s really no evidence of this voter fraud.… We can’t talk about so-and-so’s grandfather that voted when he was dead — that was not court evidence.”Colmenero later reminded Gonzalez Ramos that when she first held the trial over the law’s legality, the voting rights plaintiffs never presented an email or public statement from any Texas legislators that showed they intended to suppress minority votes ― let alone a conspiracy between the state House of Representatives, Senate and Gov. Rick Perry. But this, too, appeared to fall flat with the judge, who in the lead-up to the November election had already taken steps to make sure Texas did its part to inform voters that they could vote even if they lacked the proper identification.“There can be public support for things that are unconstitutional, correct?” the judge asked. Janai Nelson, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, told the court that the five attorneys representing the plaintiffs didn’t have to unearth an email or public statement showing that Texas Republicans passed the law in an attempt to suppress minority votes to retain their stranglehold over state politics. Texas has a long history of voter suppression, she argued, and legislators acted with “surgical precision” to make sure that the law would exclude photo identifications that black and Latino voters are likely to have, like the ID cards issued to students or government employees. “These decisions were not justified by policy,” Nelson told the court. She later told The Huffington Post that “the idea that discrimination requires a ‘smoking gun’ is very outdated. The way it operates today is more subtle.”Partisanship in Texas splits strongly along racial lines. This session, people of color account for 91 percent of the Democrats in the Texas Legislature, according to an analysis by the Texas Tribune. By contrast, roughly 96 percent of the Legislature’s Republicans are white in a state where they are a minority of the population. During his presentation, Rosenberg, the civil rights lawyer, noted that these dynamics are relevant circumstantial evidence that lawmakers had race in mind when enacting the voter ID law.If Gonzalez Ramos were to find again that Texas intended to keep blacks and Latinos away from the polls, the state could be required to clear future changes to its voting procedures with the Department of Justice ― a process that the Supreme Court weakened in 2013 when it freed Texas and other jurisdictions with a history of discrimination from direct federal oversight. In January, the high court left open the possibility of revisiting the Texas law at a later time. But voting rights advocates don’t see a need to wait.“This is a law that was passed with discriminatory intent,” Rosenberg told HuffPost following the hearing. “It should not be on the books one day longer.” Cristian Farias reported from New York."

77,POLITICS,Why Some People In America's Salad Bowl Are Eating Junk Food,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/poor-food-cost-nutrition_us_58b07674e4b060480e0788a6,"Even in California's bountiful Central Valley, prices can put healthy fruit and vegetables out of reach.",2017-03-01,"A worker harvests cantaloupes on a farm near Firebaugh, California. Central Valley provides much of the nation's fresh produce, but many residents can't afford to buy these foods.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b734f22200001f004ae103.jpeg?cache=8lZi2i4W9l&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The nation’s salad bowl has a surprising and growing problem.California’s Central Valley produces almost one-third of the nation’s domestically grown fresh produce. But many of the region’s residents don’t eat much fruit or vegetables ― a fact reflected in the region’s heightened rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and other serious health concerns. This problem, of course, isn’t unique to the Central Valley — few Americans today eat as much fruit and vegetables as we should.But the stark contrast between the food many of the farm-heavy region’s residents are harvesting in the fields and what they’re eating in their homes prompted researchers at the University of California, Merced, to ask people what motivates their food purchases.The answers, UC Merced public health communication professor Susana Ramirez told HuffPost, were surprising. “The ‘where I can get it’ concern, at least in this community, is not as big of a concern as ‘how can I pay for it,’” Ramirez said.Researchers began the study thinking that Central Valley residents’ limited consumption of healthy food was likely because a significant portion of the population live in “food deserts” that are at least 10 miles from a large grocery store.But researchers soon discovered that access to healthy foods might not be the problem — at least not for the 79 Merced County residents they surveyed. The residents — who, like much of the Central Valley, are predominantly Latino and mostly lower-income — overwhelmingly said that they had “ample” access to fruits and vegetables in their neighborhoods, even if there were no traditional grocery stores.Instead of supermarkets, the residents said fresh fruits and vegetables were available from farmer stands, farmers markets, mobile vendors and as gifts from neighbors.“If you live in that community, you learn to adapt,” Ramirez said.But ingenuity can only go so far in the face of crippling poverty. The latest census data show 25 percent of Merced County residents living below the poverty line.According to the study, 65 percent of participants said fruits and vegetables were too expensive for them, even though more than 70 percent agreed that they had access to a “large selection” of healthy foods. The findings were in line with responses to the 2014 state health interview survey, the study noted. “They’re saying that the [fresh, healthy] food is there, but they can’t buy it — though they would like to buy it,” Ramirez said. “The problem in this particular community is the tremendous level of unemployment and poverty — and these factors can’t be compensated for in other ways.”Of course, many staple fruits and vegetables aren’t particularly expensive. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s thrifty food plan and other resources outline how affordable foods can be part of a balanced diet.But the cost for some families goes beyond the sticker price, Ramirez explained. Members of many lower-income families work multiple jobs and don’t have the time to shop without a car, then prepare foods, for example. And fresh foods spoil or might be shunned by children, risking wasting household resources.These factors can push people toward convenience foods like packaged and processed grocery staples and fast-food items to keep their families fed.“If I can go to McDonald’s and I can get a chicken sandwich for $1 and a salad for $6, I’m going to have to think twice about” choosing the healthy option, one respondent told researchers. The study suggests that public health and food-access advocates focused on expanding supermarkets to so-called food deserts may be missing the point. While some research links the opening of a supermarket in a former food desert with healthier eating habits, other recent research contradicts that finding, suggesting a new supermarket had little impact on community members’ food purchases. Ramirez suggested that affordability is a key component of efforts to increase access to healthy foods in underserved communities, particularly at a time when the government’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could face cuts. Ramirez pointed to examples like Double Up Food Bucks — an initiative that allows customers using SNAP benefits to double their benefits when they buy fresh produce. Previous research shows such programs increase fruit and vegetable consumption among participating families. “We don’t have to reinvent the wheel,” Ramirez said. “We already have really successful assistance programs that put money in peoples’ pockets so they can buy produce, and that’s what they do with it.”―-Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food, water, agriculture and our climate.

78,POLITICS,Donald Trump Urges Unity With All The Lawmakers He's Insulted For The Past Year,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-joint-address-congress_us_58b66849e4b060480e0cf6cf,"""The time for trivial fights is behind us,"" the president declared in his first address to Congress, to audible laughs.",2017-03-01,"President Donald Trump appealed to Congress to work together to get things done, despite the fact that he's accused lawmakers of being stupid, ugly and weak.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58b66ad41b00003600b5b3d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― If anyone was hoping for fireworks in President Donald Trump’s first joint address to Congress, Tuesday night was a big disappointment.Trump actually stayed on script for an hour. Republicans got up and applauded him on cue; Democrats stayed quiet on cue. There were no dramatic outbursts by lawmakers, like Rep. Joe Wilson’s (R-S.C.) infamous “you lie!” moment at one of President Barack Obama’s addresses. Instead, Democrats waged a silent protest against Trump. Congresswomen dressed in all white in a nod to the suffragette movement and women’s rights. Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), who has made a tradition out of snagging an aisle seat and getting himself on TV shaking the president’s hand as he walks by, didn’t do either this time.But if you were looking for excitement, that was it. It was a ceremony that, for the most part, was just as boring and routine as these things go.Yet there was something bizarre about Trump glad-handing his way through the House chamber like past presidents and imploring Congress to enact his policies: He was appealing to a roomful of people that he’s been insulting and humiliating for the last year.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) sat behind Trump on the dais for the duration of his speech, smiling and applauding with everyone else. But it was just months ago that Trump lashed out at Ryan, calling him “a man who doesn’t know how to win” and “very weak and ineffective.” That was around the same time, in October, that Ryan disinvited Trump from an event in his home state, after a 2005 video surfaced of Trump making crude and sexist remarks about women.Looking out into the crowd, a few rows in, Trump could easily spot Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the target of some of his nastiest attacks on the campaign trail. Among other things, Trump fueled a conspiracy theory that “Lyin’ Ted’s” father was an associate of President John F. Kennedy’s murderer. Trump also tweeted an unflattering photo of the senator’s wife, Heidi Cruz, with a warning that he would “spill the beans” on something about her.A couple of seats over from Cruz sat Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), aka “Little Marco,” who Trump accused of being corrupt. Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) also sat up front during Tuesday’s speech. Trump has called Graham “one of the dumbest human beings I’ve ever seen,” and criticized McCain’s status as a war hero because he got captured and spent five and a half years in a North Vietnamese prison.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was also in clear view of the president. Trump has gone relatively easy on him; he’s just made fun of the way he looks.Those are just some of the Republicans that have been on the receiving end of Trump’s assaults. He’s gone after plenty of Democrats who were in the room, too. These include Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who Trump accused of crying fake tears, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who he’s called “incompetent.”And yet, on Tuesday night, the same president who still gloats about his win and the size of his crowds said he came to Congress with a message of unity.“The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us,” Trump declared to audible laughs from Democrats. “We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.”After the speech, Republicans were reluctant to say anything critical of the president or his newfound message of harmony.“I think he and the speaker get along very well,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.). “It wasn’t surreal at all.”But some admitted they were just relieved he didn’t go off script and start insulting people.“I count my blessings. No belligerence tonight was among them,” Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told The Huffington Post.Sanford acknowledged the absurdity of Trump urging unity with the same people he’s torn to shreds in the past year. He just put it more diplomatically.“I would just say this: Memories tend to die slowly in the world of politics,” he said. “I don’t think it was lost on many of the people who have been contestants in the Republican primary, or maybe on the opposite side of a policy debate in the campaign, that some of what he said was maybe a long way from what he said ten months ago, or six months ago.”Democrats were more willing to point out the gaping disconnect between the president’s words and his persona.“It felt surreal to see Donald Trump walk in and be identified as the president of the United States and start giving that speech,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), who Trump trolled last month on Twitter over his role in Democratic National Committee elections.“He goes in there and gives a speech, where he says a few nice things about some people with illnesses and some soldiers and some police officers, and now all of a sudden we think he’s a good guy?” Ellison said. “He’s not a good guy. He’s a good actor.”In the end, there was one thing that did make Trump’s joint address to Congress different from those of his predecessors: immediately after his speech, Democrats got up and left without waiting to see him off first.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The suspect, 51-year-old Adam Purinton, is accused of hurling racial slurs at the men before opening fire. Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, 24, were both injured in the attack.Later, a bartender at an Applebees called police saying Purinton had confessed to having just shot two “Iranians.” The FBI is now investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.In a Facebook post, Sunayana Dumala, the widow of the deceased, said it was her husband who gave her the courage to pursue her dreams in America. “He’d played a major role in me attaining a job, always encouraging and working with me though my disappointments, especially as I was starting back again after 4 years of a career break,” she wrote.Dumala described her husband as a hard-working optimist often adored by children. When they first met, Dumala said Kuchibhotla was “so charming I couldn’t resist.”In the touching post, Dumala also asks what the U.S. government will do to stop hate crimes:I will now ask same question — On what basis we decide a person is good or bad, and of course, it’s not based on the color of your skin. So what decides that? Many times, these issues are talked about for a few weeks and people tend to forget about them afterward, but the fight must go on towards eradicating hatred from the minds of people. So what is the government going to do to stop hate crime?In his joint session with Congress Tuesday night, President Donald Trump finally condemned the shooting. It took him six days.“Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms,” Trump said."

When they learned they were having another kid, they decided to hold off sharing the news until they found out the sex of the baby.“We have had a few miscarriages, and it devastated us ― so we wanted to be cautious about who and how we announced,” Tannin told The Huffington Post. “After finding out he was a boy, Katie got the idea that we should keep it a secret for longer.”Although they couldn’t totally hide the pregnancy from Katie’s parents and siblings who live close by, the couple chose not to actually announce the news to anyone.“Katie spent quite a bit of time trying to convince me we should keep it a secret until the end, and eventually I gave in,” Tannin said. “After the belly gets big enough, it is impossible to hide, but at the time of the video, the only people who knew were a few close friends, a few people in Katie’s family who have seen us recently, and my dad.”As Tannin’s viral video shows, when his parents, Carolynn and Jeff, came for a visit on Feb. 18, the grandmother was in for a big surprise. Katie was set to be induced the following day, which happened to be Carolynn’s birthday.Tannin described her reaction to the surprise as “speechless.” Said the dad, “She was ultimately excited, and she told me later that she was ‘elated,’ and that it was one of the best birthday presents she has ever had.” On Feb. 20th, the Peases welcomed baby Saul. “He is doing great, sleeping well, eating well, and going through diapers as fast as we can put them on him,” Tannin said, adding that Saul’s big brothers have warmly welcomed him into their home. “They tell him they love him every chance they get,” he said.Keeping the baby news a secret was difficult for Tannin at times. “There was one point where my sister was driving through town from Montana to Texas, and she wanted to go to lunch with us,” he recalled. “To keep the news hidden, I ended up taking the boys and told my sister that Katie had a long night and was taking a nap.”The dad posted the video on Facebook to share his family’s excitement about the new baby. “I hope people take the video in the spirit it was made,” he told HuffPost. “It was a fun surprise that was perfect for our family.”"

He said local police are “keeping an open mind” that this could have been a hate-based attack.“In light of recent events around the country, the possibility of this being a hate crime is something we are keeping on the table, but at this point we have not collected enough information to classify it as a hate crime,” Cullum said.Mazo told HuffPost he believes there was never any real danger to congregants, but that someone was trying to send a message to the synagogue, which serves Jewish communities in Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.“This is an individual just trying to make us afraid,” Mazo said. “Somebody could have inflicted way more damage, but their goal is to instill fear. We stand up to fear ― we do that as a community and as a religion.”The apparent attack on the synagogue comes amid increased reports of anti-Semitic acts and vandalism around the country. Since the beginning of the year, over 70 Jewish community centers have been targeted in at least five waves of phoned-in bomb threats. No bombs have been discovered at these centers, but the repeated phone calls have Jewish community members on edge. HuffPost is tracking the threats here. Mazo noted that it’s a “scary time” for Jews across the country. He called the recent desecration of cemeteries in Philadelphia and St. Louis “reprehensible” and called the incident at his synagogue an act of hate.“I believe it’s in response to the climate in our country right now, it comes in response to the rhetoric that comes from the top,” he said. “It’s sickening. It’s upsetting, and I do believe it’s an act of hate.”Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke called on his community to stand with Jewish residents.“What’s happened here, and across the United States, is sickening and unacceptable behavior,” Winnecke said in a Facebook statement. “Our children deserve better role models than those who commit acts of injustice and hate.”On Tuesday, the Islamic Society of Evansville offered its support on Facebook.“These hateful attacks are not only against the Jewish community, but are attacks on us all as one human family; attacks on the values we hold dear as Americans. Religious and ethnic intolerance have no place in our society and we stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters against religious intolerance.”The Temple announced on Facebook that it has been “overwhelmed” with messages of love from supporters, including from “Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and atheist friends.”Mazo told HuffPost that an interfaith service will be held on Friday to spread “hope and love.”"

He didn’t pitch conspiracy theories about millions of illegal votes. He didn’t call the news media the “enemies of the American people.”For Republicans nervously watching the new president for signs of calm leadership, that was the good news, as Trump stuck to his teleprompter for nearly all of his 5,000-word, hourlong address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, the first of his term.“I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit,” Trump read, using language almost any president of either party might have used. “I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.”Now for the bad news: Trump provided no details on how a promised replacement of the Affordable Care Act would work; how, precisely, tax reform would be structured or paid for; or even the functioning of his “trillion-dollar” infrastructure plan.And all of that’s before Trump has had the chance to return to Twitter, as he is wont to do, where he’s not reading off a prepared script and can say what he really feels.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) blasted out praise immediately after Trump had glad-handed his way out the House chamber, calling the speech “a home run” and thanking Trump for taking the lead on repealing Obamacare and reforming the tax code, long a priority for the congressman.“I want to thank President Trump for putting us on a path to a better future,” Ryan said in the statement.Ryan, though, may come to rethink that enthusiasm in the coming weeks and months.Because Trump in many ways boxed in his Capitol Hill party mates even as he provided scant details on what should be done.On health care, for example, Trump called for a replacement of the Affordable Care Act that would “expand choice, increase access, lower costs and at the same time provide better health care” ― an impossible combination.His new plan, he said, would continue to insure those with preexisting conditions and use tax credits and health savings accounts to help Americans pay for them. How big would the tax credits be, and who would be eligible? Trump didn’t say, but he did promise: “The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.”On tax reform, Trump voiced continued support for lower rates on both corporations and individuals ― an idea that Republicans leaders like Ryan can easily support. “It will be a big, big, cut,” Trump promised. But then Trump added his support for including a feature to tax imports and subsidize exports, an idea that Ryan is backing, but it’s already seeing powerful opponents in the business community and the Senate lining up.On his much touted, trillion-dollar plan to rebuild roads, bridges and tunnels, Trump dispensed with it in 56 words. The only details offered were that it would include both public and private capital, and would create “millions of new jobs.”As for a “compromise” on immigration reform with a pathway to at least legalization for undocumented immigrants ― as Trump earlier Tuesday had suggested he could support ― there was not a word, making it easy for Democrats to conclude there was no reason to work with Trump at all.“Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved,” Trump said. “Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people.”Trump probably should not be surprised if the reality of making that happen is a good deal harder than reading words off of his teleprompter."

The bi-partisan standing ovation that she drew lasted for several minutes as the widowed mother of three wept openly and, with eyes turned toward heaven, mouthed the words “I love you” to her dead husband.Her husband’s sacrifice and her reaction broke through the partisan rancor that plagues Washington ― as well it should have.But as a recent widow myself, I cringed on her behalf. By inviting her there, Trump exploited her and her husband’s death to score political points and to insulate himself from criticism about the raid in Yemen. Just earlier in the day, Trump ― the commander-in-chief ― shifted responsibility for the tragedy to the military. “They lost Ryan,” said the President, straight out of the blame-someone-else-on-the-playground handbook. Bill Owens, Ryan’s father, would have none of it. He has called for a full investigation into his son’s death and flat-out accused Trump of using the tragedy for political gain. But putting politics aside, the rawness of Ms. Owens’ loss caused that now-familiar knot in my widow’s gut to pull tighter. I recognize grief when I see it and hers was on full display in front of Congress, America and the rest of the world.It was genuine, authentic, and very, very real. What wasn’t any of those things was the reason why she was there in the first place.Why was she invited to watch the speech from the First Lady’s box, seated next to First Daughter Ivanka, whose polished coolness stood in stark contrast with the widow’s struggle to stay in control? Shouldn’t the first step in honoring her husband and recognizing her loss have been respecting her enough to not turn her into a spectacle?I know that presidents since Ronald Reagan have given speeches where they spotlight individuals to make a point, vignette-style. But Carryn Owens was used, paraded out to deflect attention from the man who some hold responsible for her widowhood. It was a move Trump has used in the past. Remember when he lined up women who had accused Bill Clinton of rape after the “I grab their pussies” audio surfaced? As HuffPost’s Jessica Samakow pointed out at the time, Trump doesn’t care a whit about the sexual assault of women. And I’d be highly suspect that he cares a whit about Carryn Owens or her suffering. What he did to Carryn Owens was gross and manipulative. There is such a thing as a Widow’s Card ― when the inherent sympathies directed toward widows are used for someone’s gain. And while Owens may not have played that card, the President played it for her.I know this because I have spent the past eight weeks watching how people respond to the news that my husband died. They want to show me kindness, give me things, help me. It’s human nature perhaps. I’ve seen it happen repeatedly. My plumber went out and bought me my very own toilet snake ― gratis, because you know, I’m a widow now. The mobile car detailing guy quoted me a price, but dropped it when he heard this was my dead husband’s car that I’m getting ready to sell. Nice gestures, yes, but quite honestly it makes my skin crawl a little. I’m not comfortable being on the receiving end of pity, and that’s what the Widow’s Card buys you. In the case of Carryn Owens, her card bought a round of applause born from sympathy. But it also bought praise for a man who cares very little for any human life outside of his own. "

Carryn Owens is the widow of Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens, who died during the Jan. 29 operation. She attended Tuesday’s address as a guest of the president and sat next to his daughter Ivanka Trump.Trump paid tribute to Owens and her husband near the end of his speech.“We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens,” he said. “Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.“I just spoke to our great [Defense Secretary] Gen. Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, ‘Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.’ Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you.” The audience inside the House chamber rose to its feet as it gave Owens a lengthy standing ovation. It was a visibly emotional moment for Owens, and tears streamed down her face throughout the ovation.“Ryan is looking down right now, you know that? And he’s very happy, because I think he just broke a record,” Trump said of the applause. What went unacknowledged in Trump’s tribute is the controversy surrounding Owens’ death. The raid, ordered by Trump, was reportedly approved “without sufficient intelligence.” And in contrast to the Mattis quote Trump read during his speech, NBC reported Monday that the raid yielded no significant intelligence. Owens’ father, Bill Owens, has demanded an investigation of his son’s death and has accused the Trump administration of using his son’s death for political gain. He also said he couldn’t bear to meet the president at the airport when his son’s casket was carried off the military plane.“Don’t hide behind my son’s death to prevent an investigation,” he told The Miami Herald earlier this week. “The government owes my son an investigation.”Earlier Tuesday, Trump dodged responsibility for the raid and instead blamed the military and former President Barack Obama’s administration in an interview on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends.” “This was a mission that was started before I got here. This was something they wanted to do,” Trump said. “They came to me, they explained what they wanted to do ― the generals ― who are very respected, my generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. And they lost Ryan.”"

Artists including New Kids on the Block, Katy Perry, and Bette Midler were among the many fans who contributed to the campaign, which will go toward production sessions.The album was initially scheduled for a September 2015 release and the group received backlash from supporters after postponing the project. According to Diggins, the delay came as a result of the group’s 2015 North American tour.“I could go on in more detail to explain how TLC’s touring, schedule, writing schedule and producing schedule was delayed,” he wrote. “But the simple fact is that Tboz & Chilli were inspired to make a record that they could be proud of and they would not settle for less and sometimes you just cannot rush art.”“They demanded of themselves a record that would stand up to the great body of work created in the past and that you would be proud of,” he continued. “Because your belief and support is the greatest form of love and we want you to be proud.”The as-yet-untitled album will mark the group’s first studio album since their 2002 platinum album, “3D,” which was released seven months following the death of member Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes."

Bush.Five Supreme Court justices will attend the address: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito will also skip the ceremony, Kathleen Arberg, a court spokeswoman, told Bloomberg.No reason was given for Ginsburg’s expected absence. She did not reply to a Huffington Post request for comment.Trump and Ginsburg have been at odds over the past year after she said the then-candidate “really has an ego” and called him “a faker.” Ginsburg also told The Associated Press before November’s election that she’d rather not “think about [the] possibility” of a Trump presidency. She later walked back her comments as “ill-advised.”Trump, for his part, called on Ginsburg to resign over the statements, saying on Twitter that the 83-year-old’s mind was “shot.”Bloomberg notes Alito has forgone the congressional speeches since 2010, following Obama’s criticism of the controversial Citizens United ruling. Alito was seen mouthing the words “not true” during the address, which lambasted the decision. Thomas has not attended since 2009."

It’s a solemn and public act that marks the beginning of the season of Lent, a time of fasting and reflection within the Christian calendar. This year, in an effort to highlight queer spirituality, some Christians added a bit of glitter to the holy day. The Glitter+Ash project seeks to celebrate queer Christians’ “gritty, scandalous hope” on a day that many in the church choose to be visibly Christian. According to Parity, the Christian LGBTQ organization that helped organize the event, 14 denominations participated in the project. Parity reportedly sent out packets of purple glitter mixed with blessed ashes to 150 sites in 29 states and three countries.The organization hopes that during a time when queer Americans’ human rights are being taken away, these glitter ashes will be a powerful reminder not to despair.“God insists that we look for the spark of life, of hope, in ourselves and one another,” the organizers wrote on Parity’s website. “This Ash Wednesday, we will make that spark easier to see.”Rev. Marian Edmonds-Allen, executive director of Parity, told The Huffington Post that she spent Wednesday morning distributing ashes at the Stonewall National Monument. “It was very meaningful being at Stonewall, of all places, and remembering the thousands and thousands of LGBTQ+ pioneers who fought so hard for someone like me to be able to be a lesbian minister, and for my transgender teenager to be safe in the world,” Edmonds-Allen told HuffPost. “It’s a long line ― a legacy of love and activism.”But Parity’s project has attracted the attention of critics. Some Christians complained that the glitter takes away from the solemnity of what is meant to be a day of repentance and reflection.Jacob Lupfer, a contributing editor at Religion News Service, called the project a “distraction at best and a sideshow at worst.”“Ash Wednesday services are neither the time nor the place for churches to fight their perennial battles over LGBT affirmation,” he wrote in an op-ed.For Rev.

I see within Christianity a relentless rupturing of false binaries ― between the human and divine, sacred and profane, self and other, life and death,” Edman, who also distributed ashes at Stonewall, told The Huffington Post. Edman said that queer Christians have much to contribute to how the church thinks about the season of Lent ― about the suffering and crucifixion of the faith’s founder, and also the joyful hope present in Jesus’ resurrection. “Queer people know more about that experience than most people recognize,” Edman told HuffPost. “We know so much about what it is to put ourselves at risk for the sake of love, for the sake of what we know to be true.

In addition to O’Donnell, it featured speeches from progressive activists like Rabbi Jason Kimelman-Block of the Jewish social justice organization Bend the Arc, and Jordan Marie Daniel of the Native American group Rising Hearts.“Hello, Washington, D.C.! Look at this crowd of 1.8 million people. This is Donald Trump math, ladies and gentlemen! You say it, the media buys it,” O’Donnell quipped.O’Donnell, former co-host of “The View,” has a longstanding public feud with Trump that began about a decade ago. She focused her remarks on Trump’s mistreatment of women, lies, and ties to Russia.“This is not Russia,” O’Donnell said. “To Donald Trump and his pathetic band of white-privileged, criminal businessmen, I would like to say to him, ‘Nyet, sir! Nyet! Nyet! Nyet! No, we won’t. We have seen what you have done sir. We have seen your connections with Russia. The game is over.’”In an interview with the Washington Examiner after her speech, O’Donnell said she believes Trump deliberately colluded with Russia to hack Democratic emails in an attempt to sway the election.“He is going down and so will all of his administration. The charge is treason,” she told the newspaper.In her speech to the crowd, O’Donnell said a young conservative man asked her earlier in the day if she was being paid by liberal billionaire George Soros to speak.“I said, ‘Sir, I have never met George Soros, but he seems like a lovely man. One day I’d like to share a souvlaki with him,’” she recalled.Trump’s presidential campaign gave his nasty spat with O’Donnell new life as the duo ratcheted up their war of insults on television and social media. As a candidate, Trump mocked O’Donnell in order to deflect a question about his history of sexist comments. “You’ve called women you don’t like, ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs,’ and ‘disgusting animals,’” then-Fox News host Megyn Kelly began a question to Trump in an August 2015 debate.“Only Rosie O’Donnell,” Trump interjected.O’Donnell called Trump’s campaign a “nightmare” and mockingly live-tweeted Trump’s debates with Hillary Clinton. Most recently, she temporarily changed her Twitter avatar to a photo of her face on the body of Trump’s chief strategist Steve Bannon in response to public demands that she play Bannon on “Saturday Night Live.” (She has said she has no plans to appear on the show, however.) The rally was small by the standards of anti-Trump demonstrations, likely due to the torrential rain. But it nonetheless provided a glimpse into the spontaneous wave of grassroots activism that has taken off since Trump’s inauguration. Many attendees had come from outside Washington and were active in other ways.Mary Ford, of Ellicott City, Maryland, has protested outside the White House once a week since the inauguration, each time with a different homemade sign. She had arrived four hours before the rally began on Tuesday with a placard stating, “Trump’s words and actions are cruel!”Ford, who regularly calls members of Congress encouraging them to resist Trump, said that that particular sign was inspired by Trump’s withdrawal of a policy protecting transgender students’ rights.Donovan McQuillen, a 29-year-old construction superintendent, drove from Baltimore. He was there to stand up for environmental protection, including opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline, which Trump recently authorized to be completed.“We’ve been losing the fight to corporations that do not behave ethically,” McQuillen said. “In this country, we’ve reached this point where we do put profit before the planet.” "

A day later, Lego announced she would be enshrined forever in glossy plastic.The toy company announced the winner of its semiannual Lego Ideas competition this week: a set honoring five women of NASA. The women are computer scientist Margaret Hamilton, mathematician Katherine Johnson, astronaut Sally Ride, astronomer and executive Nancy Grace Roman and astronaut Mae Jemison. The idea was proposed last year by Maia Weinstock, deputy editor of MIT News. “Women have played critical roles throughout the history of the U.S. space program … yet in many cases, their contributions are unknown or under-appreciated — especially as women have historically struggled to gain acceptance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM),” Weinstock wrote in her proposal.Lego announced the news Monday on Twitter. “We are really excited to be able to introduce Maia’s ‘Women of NASA’ set for its fun and educational value, as well as its classic build-and-play experience.”“As a science editor and writer, with a strong personal interest for space exploration as well as the history of women in science and engineering, Maia Weinstock’s ‘Women of Nasa’ project was a way for her to celebrate accomplished women in the STEM professions,” Lego Ideas spokeswoman Lise Dydensborg said.The set will become available in late 2017 or early 2018, according to NASA’s Hubble Twitter account.Weinstock thanked followers on Twitter for supporting her Lego Idea.For updates on the project as the set goes into production, fans and future customers can follow Weinstock’s @LegoNASAWomen account on Twitter.This Women’s History Month, remember that we have the power to make history every day. And in 2017, that feels more urgent than ever. Follow along with HuffPost on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in March using #WeMakeHerstory."
