Trump’s Dec. 6 decision sparked regional protests and prompted the Palestinians to rule out Washington as a peace broker in any future talks.Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described Trump’s policy shift on Jerusalem and the passage of the amendment as “a declaration of war against the Palestinian people”.“The vote clearly shows that the Israeli side has officially declared an end to the so-called political process,” Abu Rdainah said, referring to U.S.-sponsored talks on Palestinian statehood that collapsed in 2014.Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its “eternal and indivisible” capital.Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.The amendment, long in the legislative pipeline, was passed with 64 lawmakers voting in favor and 52 against.Opposition head Isaac Herzog said Jewish Home was leading Israel “toward a terrible disaster”. Jewish Home’s leader, Naftali Bennett, said the vote showed that Israel would keep control of all of Jerusalem forever.“There will be no more political skulduggery that will allow our capital to be torn apart,” Bennett said on Twitter.A bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations led by the president’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress.On Sunday, Netanyahu’s Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution to effectively annex Israeli settlements built in the West Bank. [L8N1OV0GP]Political commentators said Likud’s decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election while he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing.Parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019 but the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among coalition partners in his government could hasten a poll.Some commentators, pointing to an existing law that already sets a similar high threshold for handing over territory in a land-for-peace deal, have said Jewish Home was essentially competing with Likud for support among the right-wing base.(Reporting by Maayan Lubell, additional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Raissa Kasolowsky)"

Companies failing to comply with this law will face fines.A board member of the Icelandic Women’s Rights Association, Dagny Osk Aradottir Pind, told Al Jazeera that the legislation is a mechanism to “ensure women and men are being paid equally.” She added that Iceland has had legislation in place saying men and women should be paid equally “for decades,” but a gender pay gap has persisted.“The legislation is basically a mechanism that companies and organizations ... evaluate every job that’s being done, and then they get a certification after they confirm the process if they are paying men and women equally,” she said.Iceland is the first country to execute such legislation. The country first announced the measure in March 2017 on International Women’s Day.Currently, Iceland’s Parliament consists of nearly 50 percent female members. The World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked the nation as the world’s most gender-equal country for the last nine years, acting as “a leader on female political empowerment and a strong performer on wage equality.” The United States comes in at No. 49. The WEF noted in its report that despite Iceland’s achievements toward equal pay, “its gender gap in the areas of economic participation and opportunity and educational attainment” have still widened over the years, following a global trend. The organization estimates that it will be a century before the overall gender gap worldwide is closed.The Icelandic government has said it is committed to closing the gender pay gap by 2022.“I think that now people are starting to realise that this is a systematic problem that we have to tackle with new methods,” Aradottir Pind told Al Jazeera.“I really feel that we have managed to raise awareness, and we have managed to get to the point that people realize that the legislation we have had in place is not working, and we need to do something more,” she added.So ... who’s ready to grab a balaclava and some sweaters and move to Iceland?"

I support the right of the Right to speak, even when their speech is incendiary or just plain ridiculous, but not their right to intimidate and harass people they would rather not have on “their” campus or in “their” country. The line between speech and intimidation is a difficult line to draw, but I think it is legitimate to draw it. Chanting “Trump, Trump, Trump,” “Build the Wall,” or “Lock them Up,” is reminiscent of chants at Nazi rallies in Hitler’s Germany. It is not intended as an act of free speech, but to shut speech down.The real problem in the United States is not the silencing of the “political right.” The airwaves are flooded with their “alternative facts” and hate-filled venom on Clear Channel radio and Fox News cable television. The real problem is efforts by the Trump administration and his rightwing fanatics to censor and silence open discussion and the use of evidence and reason in the United States.In December, policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the United States’ leading public health institute, were presented with the list of seven banned words they were not to use in their budget requests. The CDC’s unholy word list includes (1) diversity, (2) fetus, (3) transgender, (4) vulnerable, (5) entitlement, (6) science-based, and (7) evidence-based. How scientists and medical professionals could write reports that are not “science-based” remains unclear.It later turned out that this was not an official agency ban imposed by the Trump administration, but a more or less self-imposed attempt by CDC employees who feared a right-wing Congress would refuse to fund projects too closely identified with such “controversial” ideas.They have a right to be afraid. Other Trump agencies have distributed word ban list. In February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) instructed staff to avoid using the term (8) climate change and to substitute weather extremes instead. (9) The phrase “reduce greenhouse gases” was also blacklisted. USDA staff was told to use “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency.” Last March, the Department of Energy (DOE) banned staff from referring to climate change or the (10) Paris Agreement in written memos, briefings or other written communications.The impact of the Trump assault on science is most clear at the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), where over 700 employees, including 200 scientists and 96 environmental protection specialists, have been pushed out, quit, or retired since Trump took office. Morale at the agency dropped even lower when employees and the public recently learned that Republican Party operatives were trying to gain access to internal emails to root out EPA officials who oppose the Trump anti-science agenda.Self-censorship may actually be more dangerous than an official word ban. Science and democracy both require an open exchange of ideas. When scientists and citizens are afraid to speak out, both human advancement and freedom shrivel. The best response is to use the words over and over again.To help teachers address the official and unofficial word bans in their classes, I propose a “High School Homework Challenge.” Students should write a coherent paragraph using all ten words and phrases officially and unofficially banned by the Trump Administration. For extra-credit, text your paragraph to Donald Trump at @realDonaldTrump.Follow Alan Singer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReecesPieces8 "

(Adult men are occasionally victimized as well). We have many courageous women and the #MeToo movement to thank for bringing this issue out of the shadows and into the open where it is being discussed among friends, by policymakers, at workplaces, and in our families and other social milieu. The quality of this long-deferred public debate will be depends on at least three things: (1) how accurately we identify the causes of sexual harassment; (2) how carefully we distinguish among the distinct behaviors now lumped under this portmanteau phrase; and (3) how wisely we design measures to assess, punish, and prevent those behaviors. Causes. Sexual harassment has several causes. The first is lust, sheer animal attractions between men and women. Lust is inevitable (for psycho-biochemical reasons), pleasurable (if indulged in mutually desired and gratifying ways), and necessary (to perpetuate our species). But our grotesquely sexualized popular culture dangerously stokes and magnifies this lust. Second, a pervasive power imbalance converts this lust into opportunities for exploitative, almost onanistic self-gratification by aggressive, narcissistic men against more vulnerable women. Third, harassment can reflect genuine misunderstandings, mixed signals, interpersonal clumsiness, and loss of ordinary self-control due to excessive drinking, substance abuse, and other factors. These causes cannot be eliminated but can be ameliorated ― as crime, poverty, and teenage pregnancy have been.Drawing distinctions. Much public discussion of sexual harassment suggests that it is all of a piece and deserves undifferentiated condemnation and punishment. But it isn’t this simple. Many women affirm what should be obvious: the term is being applied to a variety of behaviors and situations whose moral offense and harmful effects are quite different. Yet New York Times columnist Brett Stephens and actor Matt Damon have been pilloried for making the same point.The law already does some of this line-drawing. Centuries of legislative and judicial decisions have elaborated important defining concepts like force, battery, consent, autonomy, and reasonable fear for one’s bodily or psychic integrity. Sexual assault, so defined, is both a crime subject to penal sanctions, and a tort subject to monetary sanctions. These laws can deter and punish harassment but much of it is neither criminal nor tortious and so goes unremedied. More line-drawing is essential. Kathleen Kelley Reardon, a management professor and blogger, recently offered guidance, describing a “spectrum of sexual misconduct at work” ranging from the inoffensive to the “egregious.” She deems “common off the cuff compliments on such things as hair style and dress” to be non-offensive. But this category should also include sarcasm, digs, and words that hurt people’s feelings. In our free-wheeling society, in which we interact with people whom we know only superficially, our exchanges need breathing space and spontaneity. We should endeavor not to offend, of course, but in the course of lively exchanges, our comments and intentions can easily be misunderstood and resented. The offended person should candidly tell the speaker that she objects, and why. Although this might deepen the resentment, an exchange that exhumes the real individuals buried beneath the superficial chit-chat might instead yield more rewarding interactions. Context matters. Reardon next lists “awkward/mildly offensive” comments exemplified by “comments on gender differences.” But here too, she condemns too broadly. While legal and social equality for women and sexual minorities advances, many gender differences persist, deeply rooted in biology and culture. These differences enrich our lives and our experiences of one another. We should not be discouraged from discussing them, even if some comments are unwelcome to those convinced that differences are “merely” constructs of a deeply unequal society. Jokes about gender differences may be crude or unfunny but even annoying jokes can contain some insight about our relationships – for example, that men and women often do see things differently. If one is offended, one should inform the speaker that it’s not funny or even walk out. More offensive, according to Reardon, are acts like “holding a woman’s arm while talking,” “uninvited hugs,” “patronizing/dismissive/exclusionary behavior toward women,” and “implying or stating that women are distracted by family.” Even here, reasonable people may disagree. The meaning of such acts largely depends, again, on their context, which is often ambiguous. How is one to know whether a friendly hug of a woman whom one has met before is “invited” or not? Inquiring would destroy the gesture’s warmth and spontaneity. Remaining aloof is safer but such common interactions are simply too variable to be regulated unless they are genuinely fearful or oppressive, which they seldom are. Does Reardon’s norm against “exclusionary behavior” condemn social gatherings in which the men and women commonly talk among their gender peers, presumably out of choice? And why is it offensive to suggest that a woman is distracted by her family when research clearly shows that she does in fact end up spending much more time than her husband in managing their children? Again, Reardon’s admirable wish to avoid demeaning or sidetracking women gives too little weight to context. Thus we should view such a comment by a job interviewer (offensive and possibly illegal) differently than one by a neighbor or garrulous massage therapist. Even more serious offenses, for Reardon, are comments that “devalue” women – denigrating them as a group or making demeaning reference to their physical attributes. Such comments may be crude, thoughtless, and insulting, but the remedy for the offended should be to refute and censure the comment rather than trying to silence the commenter by formally sanctioning his unwanted speech. A worrisome analogy occurs on too many campuses where opponents of controversial ideas try to censor them by insisting that they are pained by being exposed to them. Our line-drawing, then, should discourage offensiveness while not encouraging hyper-sensitivity and undue umbrage. Some of Reardon’s examples of “evident sexual misconduct” ― grabbing, rude patting, and unwelcome holding or kissing of a woman; describing her as a “slut” or “frigid;” and accusing her of using her gender to advance her career ― are not merely objectionable; they could well constitute a tortious assault, battery, or defamation. But her catalog of misconduct goes further. It condemns looking a woman up and down “in a sexually suggestive manner.” Depending on what that phrase means, it might condemn admiring glances that – if they go no farther ― do no real harm. She would also punish a man who ignores a woman’s expressed disinterest in a relationship and continues to “hassle” her. Depending on what “hassle” means in a specific context, this may either protect the woman or condemn a kind of male persistence that has yielded many happy relationships. Reardon’s more “egregious sexual misconduct” examples are already criminal, tortious, or both – and rightly so. But the real challenge concerns whether and how we should regulate aggressive but non-violent conduct and less egregious behavior that still causes fear and offense. Here, line-drawing is much more challenging. People interact in infinitely varied ways and assess signals and meanings very differently. Again, context and intent matter. Most social norms are opaque and informally enforced. Safety and security are at stake, but so are other values. In this realm, then, adopting hard-and-fast rules is less desirable than clarifying social expectations about how we should behave in various situations, how we should communicate our desires, and how individuals and institutions should respond when those norms are allegedly violated. Procedures. Consider how educational institutions have handled sexual harassment claims. We see that even benign, well-resourced schools are caught in a cultural crossfire. Their efforts to handle these disputes with campus-specific procedures and standards founder on the high stakes. Accusers demand protection and justice. The accused, facing the prospect of expulsion and criminal prosecution, demand rigorous procedural safeguards. Onlookers - other students, alumni, civil rights officials, ideologues of left and right, and the media ― have their own fish to fry and are ready to pounce on these disputes however they are resolved. No one seems satisfied by the schools’ makeshift arrangements.Law enforcement agencies, for all their limitations, are far better equipped to handle these difficult disputes. Schools, workplaces, and other institutions should not adjudicate sexual harassment claims but should instead limit their role to determining whether the accuser has alleged facts that, if true, could constitute legally actionable harassment. If so, the institution should advise the accuser to consider taking her case to the police and obtaining a lawyer. It should release as little identifying information as possible until the matter is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Judicial rulings, official pressures, and public demands have already strengthened institutions’ existing incentives to prevent harassment, but more prevention efforts can surely be undertaken. Importantly, they can punish the heavy drinking and drug use that fuel much harassment and can denounce the hook-up culture. Law enforcement agencies should look to the best practices of other such agencies, which include allocating more resources to informal counseling of fearful accusers and improving fact-finding processes. Harms to the career, dignitary, and security interests of harassment victims are hard to quantify or even identify in individual cases. Remedies for victims seem arbitrary. Most likely receive nothing, not even an apology. Accusers may suffer informal blacklisting. Yet some others get payoffs that seem far higher than the actual harm they could have suffered, as when Bill O’Reilly paid Lis Wiehl $32 million. We should clarify what we mean by non-criminal sexual harassment, which procedures are fair and effective, and then ensure that both harassers and victims get what they deserve."

The U.S. is watching!”Trump and his administration have repeatedly praised demonstrators since protests broke out against the Iranian government last week. But several people ― including Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations ― have called out Trump for being hypocritical. Although he claims to support everyday Iranians’ rights, his administration has spent the last year fighting in court to enforce a policy banning them from coming to the U.S. Thousands of people across Iran have poured into the streets over the last week to protest the government and religious leadership. More than 20 people have died as law enforcement has cracked down on protesters speaking out against corruption and calling out economic and social issues in the conservative, religious country.In one of his first tweets of the new year, the president declared his support for “the great Iranian people” and said they were “hungry for food & for freedom.”  The tweets came almost exactly a year after the Trump administration’s first immigration ban blocked Iranians and other people from largely Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. In the latest iteration of the ban ― which was announced in September and has since been mired in legal challenges ― citizens from eight nations, including Iran, are indefinitely banned from entering the U.S."

Even regions as far south as Jacksonville, Florida, could see snow on Wednesday.Farther west, residents in Dallas aren’t expected to see a temperature above freezing until midweek.

Those who violate the Federal Aviation Administration order and fly anyway can be hit with civil penalties, criminal charges and ― if they’re deemed to be an imminent security threat to the vice president ― the “use of deadly force.”Wood noted that she respects the need for security, but said she was frustrated by the complete lack of a heads-up. She estimated her loss to be around $10,000 ― potentially as much as $20,000.“I found out the morning of his arrival,” she told the New York Daily News. “We weren’t given any advance notice. I couldn’t try to plan and change our launch site because we need insurance and approvals and permits and to try to move that on such short notice was impossible.”In some respects, Pence is just following in his boss’ footsteps. President Donald Trump’s kids took a trip to Aspen last year, a jaunt that cost taxpayers upward of $330,000 in security costs alone, as the roughly 100 Secret Service agents that accompanied them had to rent ski equipment, buy lift tickets and pay for accommodations in the pricey resort town. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
13,POLITICS,"Trump Takes Credit For Airline Safety, Despite Slim Record",Ethan Klapper,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-airline-safety-slim-record_us_5a4bbbf0e4b025f99e1df476,The last major overhaul of airline safety actually took place during the Obama administration.,2018-01-02,"President Donald Trump speaks after touring a Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner in North Charleston, South Carolina, Feb. 17, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4bbe891d000027005c1e40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to take credit for 2017 being the safest year on record for commercial aviation around the world, saying he had been “very strict” on the industry.But his actual record suggests this is an overstatement.In fairness, the Trump administration did announce new security measures in June for flights entering the United States from abroad. Not all of those measures have been made public, but the new rules mean in part that U.S.-bound passengers are now asked a round of basic security questions, with enhanced screenings for a selected group of passengers on each flight.On the other hand, 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as 2016 and 2015, so there’s no statistical change to suggest the new security measures had a major impact. (The figure in Trump’s tweet refers to aviation safety worldwide, not just in the U.S.) In fact, there hasn’t been a fatal commercial passenger airplane crash on an American airline since February 2009, when a Colgan Air Dash 8 propeller plane crashed on approach to Buffalo, New York. Forty-nine passengers on the plane were killed, along with one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed that crash to pilot error, and the following year, President Barack Obama signed a major piece of legislation that raised the bar for commercial flight training, among other safety-related improvements.That doesn’t mean there have been no aviation-related deaths in the U.S. since then. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines flight crashed in San Francisco, killing three teenagers. A few weeks later, a commercial freight crash in Birmingham, Alabama, killed the captain and first officer.But the last major reform of aviation safety in the U.S. nevertheless dates to the Obama administration, while Trump’s signature aviation policy thus far has been his proposal to privatize the nation’s air traffic control system, part of the Federal Aviation Administration. In a White House ceremony in June, Trump cited the agency’s outdated infrastructure and argued such a change was long overdue.“We live in a modern age, yet our air traffic control system is stuck painfully in the past,” he said.Trump’s proposal would have created a not-for-profit corporation funded by user fees, to be governed by a board consisting of representatives from the industry and government. Proponents argued this was the best way to invest the billions of dollars required to overhaul the system. Opponents, like the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents general aviation pilots, warned of “unintended consequences and risks.”Then, a little over two weeks later, the Senate killed the proposal, at least for the time being. And as the Washington Examiner reported Tuesday, Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Congress’ main proponent of air traffic control privatization, plans to retire at the end of his term, which would deal another blow to Trump’s signature aviation initiative.Meanwhile, Trump still hasn’t nominated anyone to run the FAA, despite his insistence that he’s been paying close attention to aviation. The last day of Administrator Michael Huerta’s five-year term is Saturday. Huerta, an Obama appointee, will be succeeded on an acting basis by his deputy, Daniel Elwell, who was appointed by Trump.But Trump has not yet nominated Huerta’s permanent successor. The White House declined to comment on when an announcement might be made, but offered a statement that echoed Trump’s tweet.“President Trump has raised the bar for our nation’s aviation safety and security,” Raj Shah, principal deputy White House press secretary, said. “Last year, the President announced his initiative to modernize Air Traffic Control and under his leadership, the Department of Homeland Security released enhanced security measures to ensure safer commercial air travel. The President is pleased there were no commercial airline deaths in 2017, and hopes this remains consistent in 2018 and beyond.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said there have been no fatal commercial airplane crashes in the U.S. since February 2009. In fact, three people were killed in an Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco in 2013.This article has been updated to reflect Shuster’s plans for retirement, and to include information about a commercial freight crash in Alabama in 2013."

Paying the more than $1,700 in fines Davis still owed was a way to put that forgiveness into action. Now, Yasin wants Davis move on with his life. “He needs to keep going, don’t even look back. The back is gone,” Yasin said. “I look forward to seeing him work and study and become something in the future. And at that time, he’ll talk about what happened with him ... how he flipped his life from bad to good.”Davis was one of three men arrested after the mosque was vandalized in October 2016. He drove to the mosque in his mother’s minivan and reportedly stood watch as one of his friends drew swastikas, curses, and the words “Go Home” on the building.Davis has expressed deep regret for the crime, writing the mosque a letter of apology from jail.The mosque leaders decided not to press charges against the men ― not wanting the act to destroy their futures. Still, Davis was convicted of a felony and burdened with about $3,200 in fines.The story gained national attention after Davis and mosque leaders were profiled in a New York Times story in August. Al Salam received letters and pledges of support from their local interfaith community and from across the country. Yasin said one organization, the Jay Pritzker Foundation, gave the mosque a $25,000 donation. The amount took the congregation by surprise ― and re-energized its desire to help Davis.Meanwhile, Davis was worried about paying his fines. And failure to meet the monthly payments could have resulted in more jail time, according to a follow-up story in the Times last week. Part of his debt was reportedly paid off by a Times reader. But the remaining $1,731 was donated by the mosque. Yasin said he brought a cashier’s check for that amount to the Sebastian County Courthouse on Dec. 11. “I was honestly super happy,” Yasin said. “When we start something good, we have to finish it all the way.”In last week’s Times’ story, Davis was described as being dumbstruck by the news that his debt had been paid. “It’s a great weight being lifted off of my shoulders,” Davis told the Times. “And I don’t deserve it, but this act of kindness, it’s just, wow.”For Yasin, reading about Davis’ shock was a confirmation that the congregation’s decision was the right thing to do. “We need that shock for him, to stop all evil acts in the future,” he told HuffPost. “He’ll say, ‘Look at those people, I hurt them, I hurt their mosque, I hurt their God, and with all those bad things, they still showed me the most love I’ve ever received.’”“That’s how we treat people in Islam,” Yasin said. “Islam is a love religion. Islam is peace.”"

Comics writer Greg Pak launched the social media campaign last month so that those in the community could support each other in 2018. With Pak’s original post receiving hundreds of retweets, people were clearly eager to honor the work of their fellow Asian-Americans. Writing on his website Dec. 21, Pak recalled an encounter 15 years ago, when he was taking his sci-fi anthology film “Robot Stories” to festivals.“I remember a distributor telling us to our faces that it seemed weird to him that the film had all these Asian people speaking English without accents. I think we just stared at him in astonishment,” Pak wrote. “He didn’t say it in a rude manner; he wasn’t trying to be offensive. He just totally didn’t get it... Even though he [was] literally talking to real live Asian Americans, he didn’t seem to understand that Asian Americans exist or could tell stories that other people could relate to.”But with the help of grassroots Asian-American film festivals, Asian-American cultural groups and other organizations, Pak says they were ultimately able to play the film across the country. It won dozens of awards, and was eventually picked up on DVD. The story serves as proof of the power of community support, he noted.In the past couple of weeks, using Pak’s hashtag, people have been sharing news of their upcoming work. Some big names like blogger Angry Asian Man, writer Melissa Hung and actor Yoshi Sudarso have chimed in with their own additions. Judging from the hashtag, 2018 looks like it’s going to be an incredible year. "

She also broke news of the memo on Tuesday.According to the memo from Sarah Broderick, Vice Media’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer, Creighton suggested he take leave while a special committee of Vice’s board reviews the allegations made against him in the Times story. In 2016, the story said, Creighton paid $135,000 to a former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing “an intimate relationship” with him.While an independent law firm at the time found the claim to lack merit and the company paid the settlement “to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation,” Broderick wrote in Tuesday’s memo, the committee will carry out the second review as a “further step” and make a recommendation on his employment by Jan. 11. The claims against Germano, who also serves as the CEO of Vice digital agency Carrot, will be investigated by Vice’s human resources department alongside an external investigator, according to the memo. One former Carrot employee told the Times that in 2012, Germano told her at the company holiday party that he hadn’t wanted to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her. Another former employee said Germano pulled her onto his lap during a work event at a bar in 2014. After reporting the incident to HR, she felt the incident caused her to fall “out of favor” at the company and left.In anticipation of the Times report, about which rumors circulated weeks before it was published, several Vice employees told HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg in November that they were disappointed in the company’s lack of response to other toxic workplace allegations published in a damning Daily Beast report days earlier. Several also said they were cautiously hopeful that promises to address the problems at the company ― such as establishing an all-female advisory board that includes Gloria Steinem, former Michelle Obama chief of staff Tina Tchen and other high-profile names ― will be carried out effectively.

It is in our hands to make our society safe and secure for our future generations and create a fearless world,” Dumala wrote in a Facebook post late Monday night. “Please, make this as one of your priorities and work towards it as even though we know life is uncertain we are never prepared for that uncertainty. ”Dumala was thrust into the national spotlight after her husband was attacked at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, on Feb. 22. The suspect, Adam Purinton, reportedly shouted “Get out of my country” before shooting at Kuchibhotla and another Indian immigrant, Alok Madasani. Kuchibhotla died in the attack and Madasani was injured.Purinton has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder in Kansas’ Johnson County. He was indicted on federal hate crime charges in June. In her Facebook post, Dumala called 2017 one of the worst years of her life. “Like every other year both me and Srinu welcomed year 2017 with lot of hopes. A year of promises to be with each other and hopefully grow our family by adding new addition,” Dumala wrote. “Unfortunately, it didn’t turn out that way because of one man’s ignorance, hate and anger, giving our family an irreparable loss and shattering our dreams.”Dumala also addressed her husband directly in the post, telling him about how he continues to inspire her.“Srinu you are very dearly missed by everyone and nothing can replace your natural aura and charisma that made you special,” she wrote. “But it is your positive attitude that is driving us forward and it is with same positivity I welcome year 2018 with the hope that we spread the message of love and empathy.”Since her husband’s death, Dumala became an activist and a public figure in the Indian American community. She’s spoken out for immigration reform and has tried to spread a message of love and empathy. In early December, Dumala joined others touched by tragic hate crimes at a forum organized by The New York Times at Rockhurst University, in Kansas City, Missouri. She appeared alongside Ian Grillot, a bystander who attempted to intervene during the attack on Kuchibhotla, and Mindy Corporon, who lost her father and son during a shooting at a Jewish community center in Overland Park in 2014.

It is in our hands to make our society safe and secure for our future generations and create a fearless world,” Dumala wrote in a Facebook post late Monday night. “Please, make this as one of your priorities and work towards it as even though we know life is uncertain we are never prepared for that uncertainty. ”Dumala was thrust into the national spotlight after her husband was attacked at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, on Feb. 22. The suspect, Adam Purinton, reportedly shouted “Get out of my country” before shooting at Kuchibhotla and another Indian immigrant, Alok Madasani. Kuchibhotla died in the attack and Madasani was injured.Purinton has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder in Kansas’ Johnson County. He was indicted on federal hate crime charges in June. In her Facebook post, Dumala called 2017 one of the worst years of her life. “Like every other year both me and Srinu welcomed year 2017 with lot of hopes. A year of promises to be with each other and hopefully grow our family by adding new addition,” Dumala wrote. “Unfortunately, it didn’t turn out that way because of one man’s ignorance, hate and anger, giving our family an irreparable loss and shattering our dreams.”Dumala also addressed her husband directly in the post, telling him about how he continues to inspire her.“Srinu you are very dearly missed by everyone and nothing can replace your natural aura and charisma that made you special,” she wrote. “But it is your positive attitude that is driving us forward and it is with same positivity I welcome year 2018 with the hope that we spread the message of love and empathy.”Since her husband’s death, Dumala became an activist and a public figure in the Indian American community. She’s spoken out for immigration reform and has tried to spread a message of love and empathy. In early December, Dumala joined others touched by tragic hate crimes at a forum organized by The New York Times at Rockhurst University, in Kansas City, Missouri. She appeared alongside Ian Grillot, a bystander who attempted to intervene during the attack on Kuchibhotla, and Mindy Corporon, who lost her father and son during a shooting at a Jewish community center in Overland Park in 2014. Dumala spoke about the incredible amount of support she’s received since the tragedy from her neighbors, her employer and others. “This is what America stands for,” she said during the panel, according to KCUR. “We are one people.

The former “Charmed” star, who was one of the early adopters of the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct and predatory men, will star in and produce her own five-part E! documentary series titled “Citizen Rose,” the network announced Tuesday.The series, timed to coincide with the release of McGowan’s memoir, Brave, is scheduled for a two-hour premiere on Jan. 30, with four more installments to air sometime in the spring. “You are formally invited into my mind and world,” McGowan said in a statement. “I am thrilled to partner with E! to amplify my message of bravery, art, joy and survival. As I ready my book, Brave, I realized I wanted to show how we can heal through art even when being hounded by evil.”McGowan was one of the first to speak out against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, who she says raped her in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Multiple damning investigative reports soon followed, describing Weinstein’s decades of predatory behavior and sparking a nationwide conversation about sexual harassment and assault. E! has a history of tapping high-profile figures for limited reality series. Cameras followed Caitlyn Jenner for two seasons of “I Am Cait” and, more recently, Mariah Carey on the short-lived “Mariah’s World.”“Rose McGowan’s courage in addressing sexual abuse and harassment in Hollywood ignited a conversation and inspired other women to speak out against their abusers,” E!’s Amy Introcaso-Davis said. “We look forward to taking viewers inside this talented, dynamic woman’s world as the first allegations unfold and she becomes a leading voice in a critical cultural change.”Need help?

The reality TV star and heiress said she’s engaged to actor Chris Zylka after nearly a year of dating. He popped the question atop a mountain in Aspen, Colorado, during a New Year’s weekend ski vacation. “I am so excited to be engaged to the love of my life and my best friend,” Hilton told People. “I have never felt so happy, safe and loved. He is perfect for me in every way and showed me that fairytales really do exist!”Hilton was briefly engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw in 2003, and later to Greek shipping heir Paris Latsis. Zylka and Hanna Beth, a model and designer, were set to be married in 2014, but ended their engagement the following year. “Paris is the most beautiful and incredible woman both inside and out,” Zylka told People. “I feel like the luckiest man in the world to be marrying my dream girl. I can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives together.”The socialite called her new diamond sparkler the “most beautiful ring that I’ve ever seen,” and flashed the bling for a photo shoot because, of course, she did. The impossibly blonde duo first met at an Oscars party eight years ago, but their paths didn’t cross again until 2015, when their romance began. Hilton made the relationship Instagram-official in February with a series of Valentine’s Day tweets featuring “The Leftovers” star. “Ever since our first date I knew there was something special about him,” Hilton explained. “I have never in my life met a man so loyal, dedicated, and loving. I knew right from the start that I wanted to be with him forever.”And if you needed any more convincing that Zylka is the real deal, he actually got Hilton’s name inked on his forearm (in her favorite Disney font, of course), because nothing says commitment like a tattoo you’ll probably regret later. 2018 ...

To that end, we’ll be taking a first glance at 2018 to see what’s changed and what’s the same. Along the way, we’ll recap the month’s biggest tunes—to illustrate these trends at work and top of your playlist at once.In keeping with developments over the last few years, this year’s inaugural picks err on the slow side—with more than half the list clocking in below 110 beats per minute (BPM). As with most musical developments, this shift is cyclical. But, for the time being, hitmakers and listeners alike continue to favor slower tracks—even in a workout. Beyond that, club culture also remains a key influence in gym tracks—with dance remixes from Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, and Maroon 5 each making the cut this month. Lastly, the biggest change from this time last year is the presence of two hits with Spanish titles—“Mi Gente” and “Echame La Culpa”—owing largely to the breakout success of summer smash “Despacito.”In short, the top of the year foreshadows a year of slower tracks, club beats, and Spanish lyrics. Which of those trends will endure is anyone’s guess. In a month, we’ll check back. And, in the interim, here’s the full list—according to the votes logged on workout music site Run Hundred:Kelly Clarkson - “Love So Soft (Ryan Riback Remix)” - 126 BPMTaylor Swift - “Call It What You Want” - 82 BPMKesha - “Praying (Frank Walker Remix)” - 81 BPMJ Balvin, Willy Williams & Beyonce - “Mi Gente” - 105 BPMNick Jonas - “Watch Me” - 126 BPMMaroon 5 & SZA - “What Lovers Do (A-Trak Remix)” - 110 BPMDua Lipa - “New Rules” - 117 BPMBeck - “Up All Night” - 110 BPMLuis Fonsi & Demi Lovato - “Echame La Culpa” - 96 BPMSelena Gomez & Marshmello - “Wolves” - 125 BPMCheck out this month’s top 10 workout songs on Run Hundred.For more by Chris Lawhorn, click here."

Eight other facilities on the island will remain open for now.The current jail population on Rikers Island is 8,705 inmates, a “record-low figure last reported in 1982,” the mayor’s office said in a statement.“Every day we are making New York City’s jail system smaller and safer,” de Blasio said in a statement. “This announcement is an important step in our plan to close Rikers Island and create more community-based facilities to better serve people in custody and our hard-working correctional staff.”In March, de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito announced the plan to close Rikers Island permanently over the next 10 years and instead create “smaller, safer” jails to house inmates. Federal reports over the years have found overwhelming reports of abuse, neglect and use of excessive force at the prison complex.An exact deadline for the first Rikers Island closure has not been set, but there will be no planned layoffs of corrections staff, the mayor’s office said.“The City’s decision to shutter a sprawling, decrepit jail like George Motchan Detention Center is a great start to a new year,” Tina Luongo, attorney-in-charge of the criminal defense practice at The Legal Aid Society, said in a statement. “The key is to ensure that we continue to reduce the population of every single facility and until we close Rikers Island, also ensure that programming continues to serve people who are detained.”"

Typically, the past week or so has been spent reviewing the last 12 months, making resolutions, and posting about the former and latter on social media. Even for people like me who are pretty anti-new years resolutions, there’s something about the new year and all the “2017 in review” type posts that make this a natural time for some personal reflection. I put this off for a bit, because honestly, I was struggling to be happy with what I was looking back on. So here I am today, staring 2018 in the face, and I’m deciding to break it down: What did I accomplish in 2017?In my current semi-sleep deprived state, only worsened by the New Year’s Eve festivities, this question is a bit harder to answer than it has been some other years. My one-year-old (or is it 14 months old, when can I stop counting months??) is running around the living room, pointing at our kitty cat and yelling in her own language. I’m waiting for the caffeine to kick in and stretching out the kinks in my back from snuggling her in bed all night.This was a challenging year. The electoral college put an unimaginable man in the White House. Hatred and divisiveness came out from their formerly hidden corners and were translated into death threats, violence, and a terrifying new reality. I cried over shootings, I cried over families being torn apart, I cried over injustices I was seeing all over the world. All of these incredibly large and tragic problems made my own issues seem insignificant, but somehow I still managed to cry over those too. I was insulted, judged, hurt, and taken for granted, partially because I’m a mom, partially because I’m a woman, and partially because I’m a human, and we clearly have this terrible tendency to treat each other very poorly at times.But negativity is draining, and there’s enough of it on my social feeds as everyone looks back at 2017, so I forced myself to make a list of what I actually accomplished in 2017. I’m sharing it in hopes that this can perhaps bring some encouragement to others, especially working moms with young children (or single child in my case), who may have had some similar feelings as they looked back on 2017.So here we are, in no particular order, 2017 Accomplishments of Working Mom:Pediatric Bodyguard - Ensured a minimum of boo boos and stranger dangerSpeech Therapist - Encouraged development of child’s language skills, working from nonsense gurgles to eventual communication that people other than you could understandMobility Coach - Assisted physical development, from head lifting to walking, running, pointing, and grabbingSleep Specialist - Figured out how to get child to sleep through the night, or at least in cycles of sleep patched together with interruptions to make some semblance of sleep, plus the appropriate amount of nap time sleeping, while also ensuring that you got enough shut-eye to function at home, at work, and sociallyScheduler/Strategist/Logistics Coordinator - Fit in a 40+ hour work week, exercise, play time, meal time, bath time, adult time, grocery time, doctor time, story time, volunteer time, professional development time, nap time, babysitter time, family time, bedtime (child’s), bedtime (yours), plus other appointments as neededChef/Baker/Milk Producer - Prepped and/or coordinated and consumed healthy meals for yourself and other family members. Sometimes this included producing milk in your own freaking body and then functioning as a cow for childNegotiator/Mind Manipulator - Perfected techniques for high-stakes situations such as leaving playground without a complete meltdown, or securing ownership and use of your own cell phone, or keeping child distracted and happy during a long car ride, or quiet during an important phone callMaid - Self explanatory. Included exponentially more laundry than you ever thought possible and dried banana smooshes in very strange placesWork - Whatever your job is, you got it done, plus some, because you were determined to set a great example for your child and had to fight the working mom stereotypes every day. Plus, you know, bring that bacon home to pay for things like tiny shoes which were outgrown before you could instagram them properly even though they are the cutest thing you’d ever seen. And health insurance. ($$$$$$ but that’s another, more frustrated and angry blog topic)Entertainment Curator - Netflix shows don’t play themselves. This is a real jobGrocery Store Wine Specialist - Self explanatoryAccountant - Figured out how to pay for all of the aboveResearcher - Determined the best approach for all of the above. Googled and message boarded at your own risk.And of course, all other tasks as assigned/needed - On call for anything and everything. So yea, if you did all that in 2017, give yourself a round of applause while I’m over here attempting to pat myself on the back. Working moms are some of the hardest workers on the planet (research supports this, I promise), even if it can sometimes be hard to pick out what exactly you accomplished in the last 12 months in this sometimes blurry adventure we call life. Here’s to stepping into 2018 with confidence and positivity! We got this!"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held up his hometown as a bastion of progress and a template for what Americans should strive for in the face of the Trump administration’s policies.“We have an administration in Washington which, instead of bringing us together, is trying to divide us up to appeal to our very worst prejudices,” the Brooklyn-born Sanders said Monday afternoon on the front steps of New York City Hall. In the time since Sanders attended the inauguration of President Donald Trump last January, he said, the White House began “eviscerating environmental legislation and making us more dependent on fossil fuel and not less.” The Republican-controlled Congress attempted to “throw 32 million people off of the health care they have.” And the president signed a sweeping tax bill providing “the billionaire class with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks while raising taxes on millions of working-class families.”“In this city, the largest city in our country, the people of New York under Bill de Blasio have chosen to move government in a very different direction than what we’re seeing in Washington,” Sanders told the crowd. The senator praised the 56-year-old mayor, considered one of the most progressive in the country, for running on a populist platform to increase affordability for working-class families. He especially touted the city’s universal preschool program ― a signature achievement for de Blasio that serves about 70,000 kids. “While many politicians don’t even talk about the crisis of child care, the de Blasio administration has taken a major and important step forward in leading this country toward universal pre-K education,” Sanders said.New York is still plagued by an affordable housing crisis, with rents rising twice as fast as wages. Scott Stringer, the city’s comptroller, and Public Advocate Letitia James ― both of whom were also sworn in for second terms on Monday ― railed against rent hikes in speeches ahead of Sanders and de Blasio. But Sanders commended the efforts of de Blasio’s administration, which went to court last year to defend the city’s decision to bar landlords from raising prices on rent-stabilized apartments.Sanders also highlighted the mental health initiative of New York City’s first lady, Chirlane McCray, as well as de Blasio’s promise to defend the approximately 175,000 so-called Dreamers in the city who were given legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Trump repealed in September.“The issues go on and on again,” Sanders said. “The bottom line is what Mayor de Blasio and his administration understand is that in this country, in the home of Ellis Island, our job is to bring people together with love and compassion and to end the divisions and the attacks that are taking place.”In a short speech capping off his inauguration on Monday, de Blasio thanked Sanders and his wife, Jane, for spearheading a populist campaign that galvanized a long-dormant leftist movement across the country.“These two proud Brooklynites have changed America in a profound way,” de Blasio said. “Bernie and Jane, you have proven that the voices of the people are what matter most, and the political process in this country will never be the same. It will be better, it will be more democratic, because of what these two have done.”The mayor said last month that meeting Sanders was the highlight of his first term, an example of what the New York Daily News described as an “emerging bromance” between the two men. Yet de Blasio supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is also a former New York senator, in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, and campaigned for her in Iowa.Some progressive activists have speculated that Sanders threw his support behind de Blasio to bolster the mayor against centrist Democrats such as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is being discussed as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), a loyal Clinton ally with whom de Blasio has long feuded."

Global anxieties over nuclear weapons are the highest since the Cold War, and climate change is moving faster than we are. Inequalities are growing, and we see horrific violations of human rights. Nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise.”Facing such challenges, Guterres said he was “not issuing an appeal” but a “red alert for our world.” Only international unity and cooperation, he stressed, could now help solve these many crises.“I truly believe we can make our world more safe and secure. We can settle conflicts, overcome hatred and defend shared values but we can only do that together,” the U.N. chief said. “I urge leaders everywhere to make this New Year’s resolution: Narrow the gaps. Bridge the divides. Rebuild trust by bringing people together around common goals. Unity is the path. Our future depends on it.”Hours after Guterres’ message, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a New Year’s Day speech, in which he spoke of a “nuclear button” on his desk, ready for use if the hermit kingdom is threatened. “The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat,” he said, adding that he was “open to dialogue” with South Korea and emphasizing that “these weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.”Adm. Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that the U.S. is “closer to a nuclear war with North Korea” than ever before. "

Her co-host, talk-show and game-show king Steve Harvey, officiated.Menounos, 39, didn’t let the icy temps prevent her from wearing a strapless gown under a sheer lace coat. Undergaro, 51, remained in a winter overcoat as the two shared a post-“I do” kiss that perhaps warmed them up for a few moments.The idea for the on-air ceremony came just two weeks ago when a producer mentioned to Menounos that she had hoped for an on-air wedding of a different couple, unless she and Undergaro wanted to finally get hitched, People magazine reported. So Menounos texted Undergaro, and the ceremony became a go.The two were engaged on Howard Stern’s radio show in 2016 and Undergaro had actually been in talks about tying the knot there, People noted. But it all worked out Sunday night.The guest list included her parents, Constantine and Litsa Menounos, who has stage 4 brain cancer, and the many people in Times Square and in TV land.Menounos took to social media a little earlier to warn viewers of tears ahead. The happy occasion was the culmination of a tough year for Menounos, who had most of a benign brain tumor removed before she left E! News."

He also warned “libs” to “bring a hard hat” because “I’m going to smack you around.”The affidavit said that last January, Clarke texted his deputies to detain Dan Black after the plane they were on landed in Milwaukee. Black had shaken his head after he recognized Clarke and they had a brief conversation, and Clarke took it as a slight.“Just a field interview, no arrest unless he becomes an asshole with your guys,” Clarke texted a deputy, according to a screenshot obtained by the FBI. “Question for him is why he said anything to me. Why didn’t he just keep his mouth shut?”After Black exited the plane he was met by six deputies and two police dogs, questioned, and escorted out of the airport, according to the affidavit. The affidavit was originally filed in March to obtain a search warrant to access Clarke’s emails. An investigation of the incident by the Audit Services Division of the Milwaukee County controller’s office determined that Clarke had “used his official position as sheriff of Milwaukee County in excess of his lawful authority to direct his deputies to stop and question Black without legal justification,” the affidavit stated. Still, federal prosecutors informed Clarke’s attorney in May that they weren’t going to pursue charges against him over the incident.On Saturday, Clarke lashed out in several tweets about “libs,” “lib media” and “fake news” following the stories about the affidavit. The “tasting blood” tweet included a photoshopped image of Trump holding a wrestler labeled “CNN” who was being kicked in the face by a smiling, photoshopped Clarke.“When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is go right at them,” Clarke tweeted. “Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD.”He later tweeted: “Nothing like getting under the skin of lefties like I did today.” He warned “libs” to “bring a hard hat,” because “I’m going to smack you around until you crawl back to your mom’s basement.”Clarke posted a note apparently from Twitter saying that it had received complaints about the “tasting blood” tweet, but that it “could not identify any violations of the Twitter rules.” Clarke tweeted: “Twitter says no violation. Duh.”Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the note posted by Clarke or whether it was legitimate.One of the Twitter rules is: “You may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.” Clarke complained in an earlier tweet that the affidavit was old news and that the Justice Department had informed his lawyer that “there was no evidence of wrongdoing for doing police work.”In fact, the letter said that a decision had been made “not to criminally prosecute any civil rights offenses” against Clarke using “the only federal statute likely available to us” because of concerns that such a case would be difficult to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt.” The letter warns, however, that the “decision could change if additional information came to light.”The FBI sought access to Clarke’s emails because agents believed he either personally attacked Black in posts on the Milwaukee County Sheriff Facebook page, or encouraged his staff to do so, according to the affidavit.A civil rights lawsuit by Black is still pending against Clarke.Clarke, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in July 2016, infamously encouraged Trump supporters to take up “pitchforks and torches” shortly before the 2016 presidential election because the system was “rigged” against the GOP nominee. He has also called members of the Black Lives Matter movement “creeps.”In June he said he turned down a job offer from the Trump administration to be assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. He resigned as sheriff in the wake of concerns about troubling deaths in the county jails his office supervised. "
38,POLITICS,Top GOP Races To Watch In 2018,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/top-gop-races-2018_us_5a455364e4b06d1621b7bd52,The midterm elections are shaping up to be one of the most contentious in recent history.,2017-12-31,"Republican candidate for U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon shake hands during a campaign event in Fairhope, Alabama on Dec. 5, 2017",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4555bb2100003e005f6280.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― With a hint of a blue wave on the horizon, Republicans are facing added pressure to get their house in order and field the best candidates possible ahead of next year’s congressional midterm elections.If last month’s raucous Senate election in Alabama is any indication, it won’t be easy.Even though Democrats are defending a historically high number of Senate seats, including many seats in traditionally red states, Republicans have had substantial difficulty persuading quality candidates to run against Democratic incumbents next year. And given large Democratic statewide gains in local elections in Virginia and New Jersey last month, the chances of Democrats retaking the House have shot up ― a scenario many thought unthinkable just a year ago.Further compounding the challenge in maintaining GOP control of Congress is overwhelmingly negative public sentiment about a first-term president, as well as an insurgent effort to purify the Republican Party that is being led by Steve Bannon. While the former White House aide and current executive chairman of Breitbart News suffered a stinging defeat by backing Roy Moore, the loser in Alabama’s Senate race, he’s still looking to boost other anti-establishment GOP primary challengers across the country.“The environment today is not great, the generic ballot’s not good, and I’d love to see the president’s approval rating higher,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) acknowledged in an interview on Thursday. “So I think we should anticipate a real knock down, drag out — even on the Senate side.”It isn’t all bad news for Republicans, however. The successful passage of their tax cut legislation and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate in the process finally gave them something to tout as they head into 2018 ― a victory they badly needed after a long and grueling year marked by few major legislative accomplishments. The achievements ought to make life a bit easier for GOP incumbents facing the threat of a primary next year.Whether voters reward GOP lawmakers for their work in the general election, however, is another story. The tax cut bill is deeply unpopular, with just 33 percent of the American public in favor of it, according to a recent CNN poll. Voters also increasingly want Democrats to control Congress after 2018. A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released this month showed that 50 percent of voters favor the Democrats in power, while just 39 percent favor Republicans on top. Democrats have framed the result in Alabama as part of a referendum on the GOP tax bill, especially in the suburbs, where voters are most likely to be affected by the bill’s shrinking of the state and local tax deduction. In addition to going after GOP lawmakers for supporting the tax bill, Democrats also say they will use the controversy over Moore, who was credibly accused of preying on teenagers, to attack incumbents in 2018 Senate races.“There were lots of Republican Senate candidates who either supported Roy Moore or refused to take a position,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview last week. “We will remind voters of that just like we will remind them six months from now that the GOP promised big increases in their paychecks when in fact corporations will use the money for stock buybacks and reward their shareholders.”Republicans face more immediate problems in the race for the Senate. For example, they’ve yet to settle on a suitable candidate to run for the seat of retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona). McConnell hinted this month that person may be the establishment-minded Rep. Martha McSally (R-Arizona), but she’s yet to officially enter the race. Meanwhile, Bannon has already endorsed far-right candidate Kelli Ward, setting up another likely intra-party showdown there.Some conservatives aren’t satisfied with either choice right now:The GOP has also had problems fielding top-tier candidates in other states. As a Democrat from a state President Donald Trump carried overwhelmingly in last year’s election, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) is seen as one of the most vulnerable senators up for re-election next year. But her most logical challenger, Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) has left top Republicans looking elsewhere because of his penchant for controversial remarks. Wealthy former state Sen. Tom Campbell has jumped into the race, but Cramer has not yet announced whether he will do so.The top Democratic target in Nevada, Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), must first fend off a primary challenge from Danny Tarkanian, who is mounting his sixth try at elected office. The Bannon-backed conservative candidate says Heller is not sufficiently supportive of Trump’s agenda. When Heller opposed several early versions of a bill repealing Obamacare earlier this summer, Trump issued a memorable threat to him at a meeting at the White House. “Look, he wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?” he asked, with Heller seated nearby.Another GOP brawl of Alabama proportions could also be brewing in Mississippi, where Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) is facing re-election next year. State Sen. Chris McDaniel, who narrowly lost to the state’s senior Sen. Thad Cochran in a wild and bitter election in 2014, is expected to announce next month whether he will challenge Wicker. McDaniel has been encouraged to run by Bannon, and is likely to take a similarly anti-establishment position if he decides to enter the race. According to The Washington Post, however, Trump in October assured Wicker of his support for his re-election bid.It’s also possible that Mississippi could see two Senate elections next year. Cochran, 80, has been absent from Washington for months and has been unable to cast votes due to issues with his health ― a condition that has fueled speculation that he will step down in January.Indiana’s crowded GOP Senate primary to take on vulnerable Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, meanwhile, has already been a slugfest. The primary isn’t until May, but Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita have whacked each other early and often over just about everything ― residency, Wikipedia, planes and even top hats. Despite his designs for the shape of the party in the Trump era, Bannon ended 2017 in worse shape than when it began. In addition to his setback in Alabama, Bannon cut ties this week with Paul Nehlen ― the far-right activist who is challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) ― after HuffPost revealed he appeared on fascist podcasts and posted incendiary tweets that were widely considered anti-Semitic. Nehlen, who stumped for Moore in Alabama, received favorable coverage on the Breitbart News website when he ran against Ryan last year. Still, Bannon remains active in other House races. Former Rep. Michael Grimm has his support in a campaign to oust Rep. Dan Donovan (R-N.Y.) next year ― a long-shot bid from a disgraced former convict who once threatened to throw a reporter off a balcony. Bannon is also fundraising on behalf of another New York Republican ― Rep. Lee Zeldin, a vulnerable Democratic target who opposed the GOP tax cut legislation.Even as top Republicans are sounding the alarm about their prospects for the 2018 elections, there’s one person who doesn’t sound exactly worried. The president this month tweeted that the GOP would do “very well” in 2018, even though his tally for the year was incorrect. (Republicans won five races, while Democrats won two.) CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the political affiliation of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller. He is a Republican."

They take the best roles that come to them, and somewhere along the way, we extrapolate narratives about their cultural significance.Annette Bening’s coalesced sometime around “American Beauty,” when it became clear that she was meant to portray go-getters whose tough facades hide vulnerable interiors. Before that 1999 drama about upper-middle-class suburbia, she was a tenacious ingenue wrapped up with the mob (“Bugsy”) and a lobbyist dating the world’s most powerful man (“The American President”); after it, she was a theater star filling the voids of middle age (“Being Julia”), a lesbian mother whose marriage was threatened by an interloper (“The Kids Are All Right”) and a late-’70s Californian struggling to grasp the changing times (“20th Century Women”). Bening’s new movie, “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool,” which opens in limited release this weekend, fits in nicely. She plays Gloria Grahame, the onetime luminary whose desire to keep working clashed with Hollywood’s obsessive focus on youthfulness. After years of success, the industry lost interest in Grahame; she spent her waning days sick and struggling to find parts.“Film Stars” is based on a 1986 book of the same name, written by Grahame’s much younger lover, British actor Peter Turner, portrayed in the movie by Jamie Bell.Bening adopts the wispy elocution of 20th-century actresses taught to speak with a posh affect that sounds almost British. With that accent and corresponding accoutrements, Bening is, once again, a marvel. In her hands, Gloria is both fragile and steely. Earlier this month, I sat down with Bening in New York, where we discussed her husband Warren Beatty’s February Oscar flub, the state of Hollywood amid the current sexual misconduct firestorm, and one key similarity between “Film Stars” and last year’s “20th Century Women.” My new favorite beat is Annette Bening dancing in movies set in 1979. In “20th Century Women,” it’s “The Big Country” by Talking Heads. In “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool,” it’s “Boogie Oogie Oogie” by Taste of Honey. In “20th Century,” it was all about how Dorothea couldn’t really get into the groove. But she was trying to figure out, “What is the heartbeat and the meaning behind punk?” So there’s that. And the disco, with Jamie Bell playing Peter, is just about trying to check out this new neighbor, and having a little disco to get the vibe and figure out what’s happening between us.Jamie told me that he actually went online and looked at “Saturday Night Fever” to see what John Travolta was doing. I, however, lived at that time, so I was like, I remember coming to visit the Odyssey in New York. The Odyssey was one of the great disco clubs. It was a big club with huge risers. Everyone is dancing together, and I remember — because I was visiting from California, and I was still like, “Wow, New York!” — there was a guy in there naked. For sure I remember that. Just wildly having a great time, full-on.Like a go-go dancer? Was he employed by the club?No, I think he was just a wild man who was very happy to dance and try to rub up against people. What can I tell you?We’ve heard a lot about rubbing up against people lately.We certainly have. It’s the theme.Before we say more about that, I want to know about the dancing. In both movies, those scenes are electric. Does the choreography, so to speak, unfold organically?It is so fun. A lot of the work in this film was really quite heavy because of the nature of the story, so having this moment to play and have fun ― I could have done it all day long. Jamie was also really making me laugh because he’s kind of like a peacock in the scene. He kind of shows off. He makes me laugh anyway — he’s a really good guy. We got on great. So that was so fun, that day. Yeah, we just improvised. The camera operator moved around us, and it was really a kick. It was good fun.Gloria Grahame is someone who thirsts for validation, yet it feels like that’s something you never needed to look hard to find. Once “The Grifters” opened in 1991, you never stopped working, aside from a few years when you opted to take a break.I think that was really a big thing for her, struggling to, first of all, just find work. I mean, once she got past “Oklahoma!” a film she did with [director] Fred Zinnemann, she did a lot of B movies as well. But she did a number of great movies: “Bad and the Beautiful,” that’s when she won her Academy Award. But there’s no question that when it got into the ’60s and the ’70s, she couldn’t find work. She really did care about her craft. When she came back to New York, she was going to Stella Adler acting class. Robert De Niro was in those classes; he saw her. He told me he didn’t know who she was at first, and somebody else was like, “You know who that is? That’s Gloria Grahame.”Gloria, I think, was really pragmatic. First of all, she just needed to make a living, quite frankly. It was just as simple as that. ... And I don’t think she took herself that seriously. Do you know what I mean? I think she had a good time in life. She embraced the moment, and she didn’t care. If other people made judgments about her personal life, well, that was their business. I mean, really, in a remarkable way, obviously: She married her stepson. She did what she wanted, and God love her for that. I respect that.She did things that other women wouldn’t do at that time, and because she was so typecast as the bad girl or the femme fatale, in a way I think she accepted that. But in another way, people thought that’s who she was. Well, that wasn’t who she was. That’s who she was playing. But she had stormy relationships, and she was married four different times, with four different kids. She had a very colorful life.Am I right to assume your Hollywood trajectory was more seamless? It seems like once “The Grifters” hit, you had it made.I would say I was really lucky because I didn’t start doing movies until I was almost 30. And then I made “The Great Outdoors,” which is this completely goofy comedy. I was so grateful to get a film and to work. I remember we were working on a lake up towards Yosemite, and we were all staying in these little cabins, which I thought was the coolest, best thing in the world. And then we had to go around the lake to start, and we would of course have to get there very early. We would literally leave at 4 in the morning to drive around the lake, and I remember thinking how exciting it was to get up at 4 in the morning.I did that film, which was totally fun. Then I did this gigantic period drama in Europe for six months, “Valmont,” which is another story I won’t go into.Was it not as fun?Super fun! No, I learned everything. I’m so grateful. I made one of my best friends in life, Siân Phillips, who’s this superb actress. Miloš Forman taught me so much. But what happened with that was it also didn’t really have much of a life after we put it out. “Dangerous Liaisons” had come out, and our movie was the second one [based on the French novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]. So I’d done these two movies, and nothing happened. But I’d had an incredible experience being in them and trying to learn about it.So then “The Grifters” was the first one that was acclaimed, with Academy Award nominations and lots of attention and respect. It was like, “Oh! I see! That’s what it’s like when it’s well-received.” So the worst that can happen is that it’s not well received, and that’s still pretty fucking good.You still made the movie. You still did the thing.You still have the process. And I don’t mean to sugarcoat that, but you know what? On a certain level, that is the case as an actor.I wanted to have babies, right? So I was stopping and having babies, really. I’d made a handful of movies, and then I started having kids. And then I would stop, have my kids, not work. I know with my last one, it was a couple years I didn’t work because I didn’t have time to take a shower, let alone make a film. That was 17 years ago. For me, it was what I wanted to do at the time. And every once in a while, I would think, “Well, I hope there’s still stuff going on for me when I’m ready.” But I didn’t want to miss out on my kids, so I would take time off.And you know what? It’s such a relief when you get out of the craziness of show business, basically. You just kind of keep things quiet, you sit on the floor, you have your life. For me, that was absolutely key. And then I’ve been able to just keep going when I’ve been ready, and I’ve felt like there have been interesting things out there for me. I’ve been able to only do what I love.If I didn’t have the kind of career where I could just follow my heart, by the way, I’d do that. I have no problem with that. When I was starting out and auditioning, I would audition for anything. I’m pretty proud of all that.And yet you’ve been able to make movies that aren’t getting made a lot anymore. “The Kids Are All Right” came out in 2010, when Hollywood studios had officially gone franchise-crazy. Yet you aren’t getting sucked up into the corporate, big-budget machine. Yeah, there’s a lot of that. You know, sometimes I pass them by, and sometimes I’m not asked, quite frankly. But I’m able to do what I love. I’m not saying the movies are always good, but at least you’re following your heart, and you’re working with other people you really love being around and that you learn from. That’s about as good as it gets.In thinking about “Film Stars” and actresses who dream of finding work in Hollywood, do you expect a sea change now that so many men in power are being outed for who they truly are? Will it become easier for young women?Well, this is certainly a tipping point ― I don’t think there’s any question. I think this behavior will still go on, and people will still harass other people and, sadly, assault people. But I think maybe the good part is that all of these people who are coming forward don’t have to live with this kind of secret ― men and women. And we can have a nuanced conversation about this so that we’re able to really distinguish between unwanted touching, come-ons, etc. We have to distinguish between that and harassment and assault. These are different things, and we can talk about them in a nuanced way.But for the people who’ve been traumatized, if this gives them some relief, I think it’s fantastic. And also because hopefully it started in show business, what looks like is happening is that it’s percolating out into the workplace. Those are the people that I’m worried about the most: the woman who’s working at the McDonald’s who’s a single mom who can’t quit whose boss is harassing her.Who has no mass media platform.Who has no platform and no leverage. So that’s what we really hope it percolates into: the broader community.Have you witnessed power structures that support environments that let such harassment happen?Sure. It’s in your business, it’s in my business. It’s in all businesses, quite frankly.Do you think Hollywood is equipped for the changes necessary to ensure moral corruption is targeted? In other words, can women finally achieve parity? Just yesterday, there was a lot of talk about the Golden Globes not nominating a female director, especially when your “20th Century Women” co-star Greta Gerwig was a front-runner for “Lady Bird.”Well, I hope so. I guess it’s very much going to be back and forth. I was really surprised that she wasn’t nominated. I was really surprised that Patty Jenkins wasn’t nominated [for “Wonder Woman”] — that’s another one where I thought, “Wow, that’s shocking.” I know there’s a lot of good work being done, so it’s tricky. It’s as though there’s a glut. You know because you’re watching a billion movies. ...But I do think, overall, more women are directing, more women are producing, there are more women’s roles. There’s also just more work because of the screen — it’s becoming one screen. There’s so much good television. There’s a lot of good stuff. I can’t keep up. Can you? I can’t keep up with the amount of stuff that I really want to see on television and in the movies. There’s so much good stuff, so I do think it is changing. I think the culture is changing, but then we also have these weird moments like what you just raised. I can’t explain that.Have you seen “Lady Bird”?Oh, I love it. It’s superb. Absolutely. Greta was preparing that film when we were working on “20th Century Women.” She’s just so impressive. I love what she did in “20th Century Women.” I loved watching her. I found, in watching her, that I really feel like I learned something from her. And I think she was doing a different kind of acting work than I’d ever seen her do. And then she’d mention, “Oh yeah, I’m making this movie.” And I’m thinking, “God, you’re writing and directing a film?” I mean, she’s amazing.Your casting as Kathleen Blanco in the Hurricane Katrina edition of “American Crime Story” is inspired. Where does that project stand, now that it’s been postponed? Thank you, I was also very excited. To prepare for it, I read “Five Days at Memorial.” It’s a genius book by Sheri Fink that basically goes into Memorial hospital [in New Orleans] and uses that as a microcosm for all of Katrina. It’s disturbing, clearly, but it is so minute-by-minute fact-based, and it’s an incredible read. And then there’s another book, which is a general overview, called “The Great Deluge” [by Douglas Brinkley], which basically takes you through the entire Katrina. It’s also a great read.So what ended up happening, from what I understand, is that, as [TV producer] Ryan Murphy approached trying to do Katrina and really trying to do it right, he found that he didn’t feel right about the way in which he originally was going to approach it. So he said, “Wait a minute.” He wanted to hit the pause button because, you know, he does so many things. He wanted to be able to stop and go back, and I think he’s just going to focus on “Five Days at Memorial,” from what I understand. I think I’ve got that right. Forgive me if I don’t. So I’m not in that. That’s OK. I mean, I’m disappointed, but I get it, totally. He needs to get the story of Katrina right. We need to be told that story as a country because there was so much suffering and death because of poverty and racism. And that’s the real ugly story behind Katrina that needs to be told. I know he wants to do that.Finally, I have to ask you about the Page Six report from earlier this year, when you called Warren Beatty and told him to come home after the “Moonlight” Best Picture fiasco at the Oscars.Oh! I was at home with my daughter watching the show. We looked at each other, and it was like, “Is this really happening? Is this real?” I thought he handled himself with such grace in such a difficult situation.I was on the board at the Academy [of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] for many years, so I know the protocol. I know how those things go. I’ve also presented many times, and it’s very clear what they do. They hand you the envelope. They usually show it to you in the dark. They usually shine a flashlight on it, and it says on the outside what it is. So how that didn’t happen, I don’t know.They feel very badly about it at Pricewaterhouse, and they went into this whole gigantic explanation to the academy as to why it had happened. But the bottom line is my husband sort of saved the day, and I was proud of him. But then it was over and I was like, yes, “Come home. Come home!”I’m sure you had a lot to discuss.We did. We did."

I know he wants to do that.Finally, I have to ask you about the Page Six report from earlier this year, when you called Warren Beatty and told him to come home after the “Moonlight” Best Picture fiasco at the Oscars.Oh! I was at home with my daughter watching the show. We looked at each other, and it was like, “Is this really happening? Is this real?” I thought he handled himself with such grace in such a difficult situation.I was on the board at the Academy [of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] for many years, so I know the protocol. I know how those things go. I’ve also presented many times, and it’s very clear what they do. They hand you the envelope. They usually show it to you in the dark. They usually shine a flashlight on it, and it says on the outside what it is. So how that didn’t happen, I don’t know.They feel very badly about it at Pricewaterhouse, and they went into this whole gigantic explanation to the academy as to why it had happened. But the bottom line is my husband sort of saved the day, and I was proud of him. But then it was over and I was like, yes, “Come home. Come home!”I’m sure you had a lot to discuss.We did. We did."

Two were found Wednesday on Wellfleet and Orleans beaches. The third was discovered Friday near Brewster.Atlantic White Shark Conservancy experts examined each animal and determined they “likely succumbed” to cold shock, though they won’t know for certain until necropsy results are available. Organs and tissue samples were collected from the first two, and the third shark was taken to the fisheries service center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to thaw.The sharks, which are common off Massachusetts, were most likely moving south with the warmer water when they got “caught by the hook” of Cape Cod and were hit by the cold, the shark conservancy said on Facebook.Cold shock occurs when an organism is suddenly exposed to extreme dips in temperature. It can cause muscle spasms or cardiac arrest. Sharks affected by cold shock may become stranded on land and quickly suffocate. Temperatures on Cape Cod have dipped to as low as 5 degrees in the past week.NOAA biologists, meanwhile, managed to save several sea turtles from cold temperatures in Texas. After an alert from fishermen in Christmas Bay near Galveston Island, NOAA biologists located a “cold-stunned” sea turtle and later found 17 others. All were brought to NOAA’s sea turtle hospital in Galveston for rehabilitation. They’re being fed veggies, squid and shrimp, according to a Facebook post. "

They called authorities after they found the word “Hi” and a drawing of two eyes in lipstick on the back sliding door, according to the Gainesville Sun.When investigators went to the house on Tuesday, the front door was barricaded and locked, and there were burn marks near the handle. One sheriff’s deputy kicked in the door, producing a large spark. Inside, the deputies found an elaborate rigging that included two chairs, a child’s high chair, a shower rod, blue tape, electrical cords, wiring and a car battery charger with clamps, the Sun reported.“This is one of the most bizarre domestic violence cases I have seen in my career,” said Flagler County Sheriff Rick Staly, according to WFTV. “Not only did this man plan to electrocute his wife, but he could have injured a deputy or any person attempting to enter this residence.” By the time deputies discovered the booby-trapped door, Michael Wilson had left the scene with a firearm allegedly stolen from Flositz, according to TheNewsTribune.com. Investigators noted that on Wednesday, Wilson changed his relationship status on Facebook to “widowed,” according to the Florida Times-Union.Wilson was found Thursday in Knoxville and taken into custody. He was later charged with two counts of attempted aggravated battery on a pregnant person and one count of grand theft of a firearm.Court records indicate that Wilson’s wife had filed for divorce on Dec. 6. She told investigators after her husband’s arrest that his behavior had changed following some health issue a few months ago. At the end of November, he was placed in a mental health facility under Florida’s Baker Act and hadn’t been home since then, she said, according to the Times-Union.The two attempted a reunion in Knoxville on Dec. 21, but he left early on Dec. 23 without explanation. Wilson later sent his wife text messages accusing her of cheating on him. She said she had calmed him down on Christmas Eve and let him know he was welcome back in Tennessee.Wilson is currently being housed in the Knox County Detention Facility in Tennessee on $150,000 bail and will be extradited to Flagler County in Florida.The investigation is ongoing and Wilson may be charged with other crimes.

But Trump could seek a last-minute Supreme Court intervention to stop the process.“It definitely seems like they aren’t going to the Supreme Court, but until we say ‘Happy New Year’ on Sunday night I’m not taking anything for granted,” Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, told Reuters. In July, Trump announced his intention to ban trans people from serving in the military. He claimed that transgender troops “burden” the armed services with “tremendous medical costs.” In fact, this is not true.Last week, two U.S. appeals courts refused an emergency request from the Trump administration to lift lower court orders that would allow the enlistment ban to continue after Jan. 1.Elijah Sellers, a trans soldier currently serving on the Navy’s USS Bataan, told HuffPost in October that he was “terrified” by Trump’s evident desire to rid the military of its transgender troops.“In the military, we judge people based off of their work ethic and their ability to get a job done and do it correctly and I feel like that’s the most important thing,” Sellers said. “And on the street, nobody would know I was transgender. So I really don’t think it’s as big of an issue as some people think it is.”"

During this time, Bradley was on the Boston Celtics, who were playing the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the Eastern Conference Finals. He was traded to the Pistons in July 2017. Bradley’s attorney, Brian Wolf, told TMZ his client did nothing wrong, and simply entered into the confidentiality agreement with the woman to “protect the reputation and privacy of Mr. Bradley and his family.” Wolf did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.TMZ did not report the final number of the settlement, but said negotiations went as high as $400,000.Confidentiality agreements are not unusual in cases of alleged sexual harassment and assault, especially in workplaces. After dozens of women came forward this year to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault, many people spoke out about how such agreements can silence victims and enable more abuse.Others believe a victim should have the right to choose to enter a confidentiality agreement if that person wishes, and say they can help victims get larger monetary awards.It’s not clear how Bradley’s case became public, despite his agreement."

United Nations human rights experts called the pardon an appalling “slap in the face” for his victims and a major setback for the rule of law.Fujimori, who remained in a hospital with blood pressure and heart problems on Thursday, governed Peru with an iron fist from 1990-2000 after being swept to power by a populist wave in 1990 elections. While many consider him a corrupt and ruthless dictator, others credit Fujimori with pulling Peru from economic ruin and quashing a leftist insurgency.On Thursday, Kuczynski said the pardon was fundamentally about forgiveness.“The country can’t remain divided by political struggles that only hold the country back from continuing to make progress,” Kuczynski’s office said in a statement.In Lima, the march was largely peaceful. But police fired tear gas at protesters who veered from the permitted route to march in front of Kuczynski’s house in the financial district.Four people were arrested, the interior ministry said. It declined to estimate the size of the protests, saying “we don’t want to get into that debate.”One of the groups that helped organize the protests said 60,000 took part in Lima.Protests were also held in other Peruvian cities and foreign capitals.The pardon has deepened the disgust that many Peruvians feel toward mainstream politics, after a graft scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht has ensnared two former presidents in the past year.Kuczynski and opposition leader Keiko Fujimori, Fujimori’s daughter, are also under investigation for their ties to Odebrecht. On Thursday, the two separately underwent questioning by prosecutors investigating Odebrecht’s partners in crime.Both deny any wrongdoing and have promised to cooperate with investigations."

Pattiz wrote in his resignation letter that he would be retiring as UC regent and chair of the Regents Oversight Committee and National Laboratories, effective Feb. 16, 2018, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.In the letter, Pattiz told Board of Regents Chairman George Kieffer that it was a privilege working for the University of California, but made no mention of the workplace misconduct accusations that have haunted him for over a year.Kieffer accepted Pattiz’s resignation in a follow-up letter the same day, thanking the media executive for his service. “After so many years you deserve a break,” Kieffer wrote to Pattiz.Pattiz, the founder of the PodcastOne studio, has been accused by former studio staffers of making sexually inappropriate remarks to female employees and brandishing a gun at at least one male employee.Pattiz has only admitted to misconduct in one case ― in which he was caught asking to hold comedian Heather McDonald’s breasts. The moment was recorded and published by McDonald in November 2016, forcing Pattiz to apologize publicly that year.McDonald quit PodcastOne shortly after the incident.Ji Min Park, a PodcastOne employee who left after a year because of Pattiz’s behavior, told the Los Angeles Times in 2016 that Pattiz had made her uncomfortable by commenting on her looks. She said that Pattiz once told her she could have her name on a recording studio if he left his wife for her. Speaking to the Times for the same 2016 story, Raymond Hernandez, a PodcastOne producer who was laid off after two years, said he witnessed Pattiz commenting on the bodies of other employees and, in one instance, asking employees if they wanted to see revealing photos of a female PodcastOne executive on his phone.Hernandez filed a lawsuit against Pattiz in September 2017, accusing Pattiz of pointing his gun at him when he declined his request to use false advertising statistics.California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, California Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson and UC Student Regent Paul Monge urged the University of California to address the accusations against Pattiz in a Nov. 29 letter.Two weeks before the letter was sent, University of California spokeswoman Dianne Klein told the Mercury News that she did not believe Pattiz had been the subject of an investigation by UC’s general counsel."

On Party Foul Radio with Pollo & Pearl, though, the producer and recording artist reflected on a time when musicians’ sexuality seemed to matter less. “When I was a kid, it was like Prince, David Bowie, all these people who were just allowed to be gay or straight,” recalled the multi-talented musician. “They were just men singing music whichever way they wanted,” he told Podomatic’s No. 1 LGBTQ podcast. “Now it’s like, if you’re a guy and you sing above a certain note and enjoy it, you must be gay.” As artists have become more free about their sexuality, Frank seems to suggest it demystifies artists too much. He reflected back to a time when the public knew less about the sexuality of favorite pop stars. “No one liked George Michael because he was gay or straight,” said Frank as an example. “They liked George Michael because he was fucking adorable — then he came out to be gay.” In generations gone by, Frank said, an “unspoken” privilege for artists was the “veil of creative androgyny.” Legends like Prince and Bowie aroused significant speculation, but many assumed it was part of the persona. LISTEN: Vincent Frank Discusses The Changing Record IndustryOthers, said Frank, might have assumed such artists were queer ― but it seemed to make little difference. The prevailing thought about such musicians, according to him, was it “comes with the territory” for those in the arts.“That’s why I have always been drawn to the gay community,” Frank offered. “Gay culture has really been enshrined in a bunch of positive attributes leaning in creative avenues.”The rise of the internet, he asserted, has changed things dramatically. “Everything is much more transparent; it’s more of an open conversation,” Frank said, describing how performers’ personal lives have now become public. “With David Bowie, he was trying to be post-gender, post-sexuality almost,” he explained. “It was an act, but you didn’t know where the act stopped and where the real person began. With the internet and just no privacy, you don’t have that with any celebrity or artist any more.”Of course, Frank has collaborated in the past with people who bravely shared their sexuality even in generations where it was far less acceptable. In 2011, he produced Tomorrow’s World, the 14th album by iconic British synth-pop act Erasure fronted by Andy Bell.“I’ve had some pretty candid conversations with him in the past, regarding the earlier times of his career,” said Frank of the singer, who opened up about his sexuality in 1986. “You can find videos on YouTube of him being booed onstage, because he did come out.“At the height of Erasure’s success, Bell once told Seventeen magazine: “I want to be known as a good performer, but it’s important to me to take a stance. If you’re doing music, you should use it for something and have substance. Being gay and open about it is my substance.”Himself a former guest on Party Foul Radio, Bell has since expressed frustration that Erasure — despite massive mainstream success — was later labeled a “gay act” or similar. Frank suggested this is a definite downside of artists being so open.WATCH: Frankmusik’s Latest Music Video“There are plenty of artists out there who have whatever their personal life is, and most of them you don’t know,” he continued. “You only care about the music of the art, as it were.” Bell is not only open about his sexuality. In 2004, the singer also came out as HIV-positive. It was a subject he discussed without reservation while recording with Frank years later. “It’s very disarming when someone is that vulnerable and open; I think it intimidates a lot of people,” he shared. Many respond to such “openness” defensively, “because they themselves know they can’t be this open,” Frank said. In turn, “to make themselves feel better,” they often “shun” those showing the bravery to discuss topics with which they are personally uncomfortable, he said. “You are weaker than that,” he concluded. “You aren’t strong enough to be that open, especially about such hard topics as HIV and coming out back in the late-‘80s.” Overall, said Frank, how others respond to such information “says more about us than it does” the individual sharing it. Where Bell, specifically, is concerned, he admits the honesty has perhaps taken a toll. “Someone like Andy, and this is so sad, the music matters less than his life choices,” concluded Frank. “And that’s depressing!” Follow Frankmusik on Twitter.Follow Party Foul Radio on Twitter.“Like” Party Foul Radio on Facebook.LISTEN: Frankmusik & Broadway Star Shoshana Bean Join Party Foul Radio"

It illustrates the wide fluctuations that occur from year to year, while the longer trend is warming.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a4666c121000018005f6421.png?ops=crop_1_0_927_591%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"It seems inevitable now that every big cold spell and snowfall in the United States will be followed by a tweet from Donald Trump to mock global climate change. He did it again this week as huge amounts of snow buried Erie, Pennsylvania, and a cold spell set records in northern states.“Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming,” Trump tweeted. Actually, we could use a lot fewer tweets that show the United States is led by a real estate developer who thinks he’s smarter than the world’s leading scientists.Many of those scientists probably regret that climate change was ever called “global warming.” The term is accurate enough. It expresses the reality that the average temperature of the Earth’s surface is warming. Actual measurements show it has been happening for more than a century.This is not to say the planet is warming everywhere and all the time, however. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration explains that while warming has not been uniform across the planet, the long-term temperature trend is upward. It’s the long-term patterns that distinguish climate change from short-term changes in weather.Over the 137 years that temperatures have been recorded, the surface of the Earth has warmed nearly 1.7 Fahrenheit. While that does not seem like much compared to the temperature shifts we see in the weather every day, the increase is more accurately compared to the effect that rising temperatures have on the human body. For the purposes of illustration, if the body’s normal temperature is 98.6 degrees, a 1.7 degree increase results in a temperature of more than 100 degrees, approaching a fever.Last month, the federal scientists that have so far survived the Trump administration’s purge of science experts issued a congressionally mandated report that projected an additional increase of 2.5 degrees of warming between 2021 and 2050 and as much as 7.3 degrees more in the second half of the century. To use the human analogy again, it would be as if the fever rose to 110 degrees.In short, climate change manifests as weird and extreme weather, like the record snowfalls and cold temperatures in parts of the U.S. right now. Those anomalies will continue.So will Trump’s uninformed tweets. It would be one thing if he were only embarrassing himself. Unfortunately, it’s one more way that he is embarrassing the United States in the eyes of the world."

Changing the makeup of federal advisory committee members is a common occurrence during Administration changes,” the statement read.Six members of the council had earlier resigned in June due to “a president who simply does not care,” according to one member in a Newsweek op-ed entitled “Trump doesn’t care about HIV. We’re outta here.”One source with knowledge of PACHA told the Washington Blade that “many council members were terminated even though additional time remained on their terms as advisers.”PACHA is a federal advisory committee created in 1995 with the goal of “providing information, advice, and recommendations to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding programs, policies, and research to promote effective treatment, prevention, and cure of HIV disease and AIDS.”As of September, President Donald Trump signed an executive order renewing PACHA for an additional year so the move to fire the current council without explanation seems brash. One of those members ― Gabriel Maldonado, CEO of the Riverside, Calif.-based LGBT and HIV/AIDS group Truevolution ― told the Washington Blade, however, that “it is common for appointees to be terminated and for folks to kind of want their own people in.” “I think where the discrepancy comes in is why a year later, No. 1? Two, many of us, our terms were over earlier this year and we were sworn back in, and three were stayed on nearly four months after an executive order was signed continuing the council,” he said.Also of note, during the Obama administration, nearly all of George W. Bush’s appointees were eliminated prior to new appointees being named.The current administration has not appointed a director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, a major reason contributing to the June resignation of the six members of PACHA. Additionally, the ONE Campaign released a report earlier this year on the potential impact of the White House’s proposed $800 million cut to HIV/AIDS efforts. The cut would slash the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief by 17 percent and gut global health programs by $2 billion, according to CBS News. The impact would be so great that AIDS experts and advocates predicted to the publication that it would “upend progress on curbing the epidemic.” On World AIDS Day, the Department of Health and Human Services published a notice in the Federal Register inviting nominations of members to serve on PACHA. The council can have up to 25 members and nominations are due no later than 5:00 p.m. (EST) on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2018. "

How about becoming a professional mermaid?The Weeki Wachee Springs State Park is holding auditions on Jan. 13 for people with the will, desire and lungs to work as professional mermaids.The park, about an hour north of Tampa, bills itself as “The Only City of Live Mermaids!” thanks to daily shows with women dressed as mermaids performing underwater.The current mermaid menagerie is 17 mermaids and three princes who perform two shows a day, 365 days a year.Park spokesman John Athanason expects at least 50 women will show up for the first part of the audition. It’s so grueling that he predicts a lot of them will wash out quickly.“It’s not easy what they do, and a lot of girls find that out” at the audition, Athanason told the Tampa Bay Times.The first test requires the maybe mermaids to complete a timed, 300-yard endurance swim and then show they can tread water for 10 to 15 minutes, according to The Associated Press.“It’s an inherently dangerous job, and you need to be able to not only save yourself, but save a colleague,” Athanason told the Tampa Bay Times.Then there’s another audition in which the aspiring mer-people must show they can do water ballet moves, like flips, without looking “panicky.”“It’s all about how comfortable they are,” Athanason said. “We encourage everyone, from every background.”Applicants must be at least 18 and available to work at least four days a week. But it’s not a job for people who want liquid assets: It pays only $10 an hour, according to AP. "

She was 97.Taylor’s brother, Robert Corbitt, told NBC News that she died in her sleep at a nursing facility in her hometown of Abbeville. Taylor, who is survived by Corbitt along with two sisters, a granddaughter and multiple great-grandchildren, would have been 98 on Sunday. Her daughter Joyce Lee Taylor tragically died in a car accident in 1967. Corbitt told NBC that his sister was “a brave woman and a fighter” who made sure her voice and story were heard. Taylor’s story made national news in 1944 when she was kidnapped at gunpoint and brutally raped by six white men. The then-24-year-old was walking home to her husband and young daughter after a late church service. After the men kidnapped Taylor and assaulted her for several hours, they left her blindfolded on the side of the road.“After they messed over and did what they were going to do me, they say, ‘We’re going to take you back. We’re going to put you out. But if you tell it, we’re going to kill you,’” Taylor told NPR in 2011. Despite the threats against her life, Taylor and her family immediately went to the police. Seven men abducted Taylor that night: Hugo Wilson, Billy Howerton, Herbert Lovett, Luther Lee, Robert Gamble, Joe Culpepper and Dillard York. Although six of the seven men raped her (only one man actually admitted to raping Taylor), an all-white, all-male jury decided to not indict the men.About a month after the attack, six of the men said they were willing to pay Taylor $100 each if she “would forget” about the gang rape. She declined the money. Her case was later taken up by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Rosa Parks, who was an advocate for black female victims of sexual violence at the time, was assigned to be the lead investigator on Taylor’s case. Parks herself had been a victim of an attempted rape by a white man in 1931 and began her career as an anti-rape activist. She took Taylor’s case 12 years before her iconic refusal to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama.Vigilantes firebombed Taylor’s house after she reported the assault. She and her family received dozens of death threats from white neighbors in her community. With Parks’ help, a second investigation was opened into the six assailants but another all-white, all-male grand jury declined to indict the men.In 2011, the Alabama legislature formally apologized to Taylor for not prosecuting her assailants. It was common for white men to racially-target and sexually assault black women as a part of the many brutal attacks on black people during the Jim Crow era. “Taylor’s rape was not an exceptional occurrence. It was part of a continuous campaign of terror that was just as much a threat to women as lynching was to black men,” The Undefeated’s Soraya Nadia McDonald wrote earlier this month. “The history of black women as victims of white terror has largely been ignored, silenced and minimized, even as their quest for safety fueled their pursuit of civil rights as far back as the 1890s.”Taylor’s story was in the headlines again earlier this month when a documentary about her experienced titled “The Rape of Recy Taylor” was released on Dec. 8. Her story was also featured in Danielle L. McGuire’s 2010 book At The Dark End Of The Street: Black Women, Rape And Resistance ― A New History Of The Civil Rights Movement From Rosa Parks To The Rise of Black Power. Much of what we know about Taylor comes from years of research gathered in McGuire’s book. Director Nancy Buirski (producer of “Loving,” the 2016 movie about interracial couple Richard and Mildred Loving) spoke to The Guardian earlier in December about the importance of remembering and amplifying Taylor’s story. “This is such an important time in this country’s path to recognize Recy Taylor,” Buirski said. “With women being singled out on Time magazine’s cover, as part of the #MeToo campaign, I really want to draw attention to the black women who spoke up when their lives were seriously in danger.”After hearing of Taylor’s passing on Thursday, Buirski reiterated to NBC the historical significance of black women like Taylor. “It is Recy Taylor and rare other black women like her who spoke up first when danger was greatest,” Buirski said. “It is these strong women’s voices of the ’40s and early ’50s and their efforts to take back their bodies that led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and other movements that followed, notably the one we are witnessing today.”This article has been updated to include Danielle L.

During the weeks of Jan. 8 to Feb. 26, Blue Apron subscribers will see two recipes from each weekly two-person menu marked “Whole30” recipes. If you’re not familiar with Whole30′s spiel, it’s an ultra-strict meal plan that emphasizes whole foods while banning sugar, alcohol, grains, legumes, soy and dairy. Basically, you’re left eating lean proteins and lots (and lots and lots) of veggies. As Whole30 veterans know, meal planning and food prep are two of the most time consuming, complicated and tedious parts of sticking to Whole30′s strict requirements. Blue Apron’s pre-portioned and pre-packed meal kits aim to change that with unique Whole30-approved recipes like seared steaks and warm lemon salsa verde with roasted broccoli and sweet potato and Mexican-spiced barramundi with kale, sweet potato and avocado salad.Blue Apron’s own chefs crafted the meals to help consumers keep their healthy eating New Year’s Resolutions. “These simple, satisfying recipes are designed to help customers kick off the new year with a clean plate,” according to a spokesperson with the brand. For Blue Apron novices, the services have two-person and four-person family plans to choose from, with options from two to four recipes per week, starting at $48 a week. From Blue Apron’s selection of weekly recipes (including vegetarian recipes) you choose which ones you want, and then everything you need for those meals is shipped to you in perfectly-proportioned packages with step-by-step instructions. For all of its ease, however, meal delivery kits do produce a lot of food and packaging waste (though the company has made significant steps to make its packaging recyclable and even returnable), and ― speaking from experience ― the meals can be a bit time consuming.But, for strict diets like Whole30, the ease of having a weekly supply of fresh, approved ingredients on-hand can certainly take the stress out of weeknight dinners and cut meal prep time that might be spent reading the ingredients list of everything in your pantry.Unfortunately, Blue Apron’s Whole30 partnership is only for a limited time, kicking off Jan. 8 and lasting through the week of Feb. 26, so ring in the new year with a clean plate while the program is available.

But George St. George says Shlesinger and the theater hosting her performance broke California state laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender by telling him and a male friend they couldn’t come in.St. George and his friend purchased tickets for Shlesinger’s performance for $30 and $25 respectively, according to the complaint, filed by attorney Alfred G. Rava. When they arrived at the Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles, California, for the show, the lawsuit says they were told they’d need to sit in the “back row of the Theater for the show because of their sex.”After the men left the theater and returned, the same employee said they actually couldn’t see the show at all, and refunded their money.St. George and his guest believe the injustices they endured were on par with those leading up to the civil rights movement. What happened was “akin to the Montgomery City Lines bus company in Montgomery, Alabama circa 1955 morphing into the Woolworth’s department store lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1960,” their lawsuit reads.(Jim Crow laws forced racial segregation on city busses in Alabama in the 1950s, prompting Rosa Parks to famously stand up for her right to sit where she wanted. Sit-ins at Woolworth’s department store ultimately led to the company removing its racial segregation policy.)The men want justice after being victims in Shlesinger’s “War On Men,” the complaint says.The complaint also says Shlesinger’s women-only show “repudiated hundreds of years of women’s struggles to be viewed as being equal to men and is typical of old-fashioned sexism that might also advise a young woman that her best chance for a happy life is to ace her home economics class and learn how to make a queso dip from Velveeta to catch a good man.”That’s a pretty drastic way to understand a women-only comedy show ... but sure! You can read the whole complaint below:St. George is asking for compensation for costs incurred as well as attorney fees and “damages in amounts to be proven at trial.” He is also asking for an injunction to keep the defendants from “engaging in unequal treatment of customers based on the consumers’ sex” and that Shlesinger undergo “sensitivity training regarding sex discrimination.” HuffPost has reached out to Shlesinger for comment."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at a House-Senate conference meeting on the Republican tax cut bill on Dec. 13, 2017.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a443ba61c00003b0068d7a3.jpeg?cache=X9BOJKNxPK&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) dismissed attempts to construe one of his recent comments as praise for the Republican tax legislation, declaring in a statement on Wednesday that the GOP law is “one of the worst pieces of legislation in the modern history of our country.”In an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, Sanders conceded that the tax cuts for middle-class families in the GOP tax bill were positive, before slamming the bill for specifying that they would expire in eight years.“Next year, 91 percent of middle-income Americans will receive a tax cut. Isn’t that a good thing?” host Jake Tapper asked Sanders.“Yeah, it is a very good thing,” Sanders responded. “And that’s why we should’ve made the tax cuts for the middle class permanent.”Some Republicans delighted in the idea that they had caught Sanders owning up to the bill’s perks. In an email blast to reporters, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens dubbed the Vermont progressive “Sanders Claus.” “Bernie has long supported massive tax increases on everyone – including the middle class – but this Christmas, even this Grinch’s heart has grown,” Ahrens wrote in a note that linked to Sanders’ CNN interview. “When Bernie comes back to town, he should pledge to vote with Republicans in ten years to make the tax cuts permanent for the middle class.”But Sanders maintained on Wednesday that the legislation’s modest middle-class benefits do not outweigh its problems. He lamented how much it privileges ultra-rich Americans “at a time of massive income and wealth inequality.”To keep the law within mandatory budget guidelines, Republicans stipulated that the provisions for individuals, including lower tax rates, will expire in 2025, even as they made the legislation’s massive corporate tax breaks permanent. As a result, by 2027, more than 82 percent of the law’s benefits will go to the top 1 percent of earners in the country.Sanders also fears that congressional Republicans will cite the $1.4 trillion the law is expected to add to the national debt as an excuse to pursue cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other social programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has said that slashing these programs is next on his agenda.Rather than do away with the tax law entirely, Sanders supports repealing the tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations to make the bill’s middle-class tax breaks permanent and expand upon them.“Let’s pass tax reform that permanently benefits all middle-income and working-class families without giving tax breaks to the top 1 percent,” he said. “Instead of providing huge tax breaks to the rich and large corporations that explode the deficit, which this bill does, millionaires, billionaires and large, profitable corporations must begin paying their fair share of taxes.”Sanders has ambitious domestic spending priorities, including a national, single-payer health care system that he and other boosters have dubbed “Medicare for all.” Sanders declared flatly at a Democratic presidential candidate forum in January 2016 that to fund these priorities, “We will raise taxes, yes we will.”He introduced new legislation in September laying out his vision for a universal public insurance plan that goes beyond even the benefits Medicare currently provides to seniors and people with disabilities. The bill, which attracted the support of over one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus, offers many potential revenue options for funding the new program. One of the ideas is a 4 percent income-based premium on all households ― in other words, a middle-class tax increase.However, Sanders insists that the single-payer program would still provide a significant boost in net income for middle-class Americans because of the money it would save them in premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. A family of four earning $50,000 would save $4,000 a year, according to estimates by Sanders’ staff. There is real evidence to suggest that centralizing insurers’ buying power in the hands of the federal government would provide the leverage needed to negotiate lower costs. Countries with health care systems that resemble the one Sanders envisions have per-capita health care costs that are a fraction of those of the United States.“Both Medicare for all and middle-class centered tax reform are about putting more money in the pockets of working families,” Josh Miller-Lewis, a Sanders spokesman, told HuffPost in an email."

The final judgment issued by Senior Judge A. Wallace Tashima after a two-week bench trial last summer caps a seven-year legal battle over conservative attempts to restrict what books could be used or subjects taught in Tucson’s majority-Latino schools.Conservative lawmakers led by then-Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne and then-state Sen. John Huppenthal, who later succeeded Horne, derided Tucson’s Mexican-American studies curriculum as an anti-American politicization of public school classrooms. To shut the classes down, they spearheaded the passage of a state law in 2010 that prohibited classes aimed at students of a specific ethnicity, that fostered racial discord or that encouraged the overthrow of the U.S. government.In Wednesday’s judgment, however, Tashima wrote that conservative lawmakers passed the ethnic studies restrictions “not for a legitimate educational purpose, but for an invidious discriminatory racial purpose and a politically partisan purpose.” (The senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit was sitting by assignment to hear the case in U.S. District Court.)No officials may carry out any part of the law, the judgment says. Tashima ruled in August that the law violates the students’ First Amendment rights by restricting information and the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause by targeting Latinos.Tashima’s judgment also sticks the state of Arizona with the bill for the plaintiff’s legal fees. The court has yet to determine the amount.The Arizona attorney general’s office did not immediately return a call requesting comment about whether the state plans to appeal the ruling.After seven years, the state can request that the permanent injunction be lifted, independent of the appeal process.Tucson’s school board voted in 2012 to abandon its Mexican-American studies program after Arizona officials threatened to withhold 10 percent of the district’s state funding. They plucked copies of seven books used in the canceled courses from classrooms, fueling complaints from educators across the country that the state was in effect banning books.Amid the legal controversy, several of the teachers in the program left Tucson or stopped working for the school district. But the publicity generated by the court battle spurred efforts in other states to create ethnic studies programs modeled on or influenced by the Tucson classes.CORRECTION: In a previous version of this article, Judge Tashima was misidentified as a U.S. district judge. He is a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, who was sitting by assignment to hear a district court case."
64,ENTERTAINMENT,People Aren't Happy With Bono's Tone-Deaf Remarks About 'Girly' Music,Carly Ledbetter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bono-music-rolling-stone_us_5a44054ae4b06d1621b6ba4a,The singer made the comment in an interview with Rolling Stone.,2017-12-28,"Bono waves as he arrives at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France on July 24. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a44f1bf1c00003b0068d86a.jpeg?cache=WMkPDIla2g&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During a recent interview with Rolling Stone, U2′s Bono lamented that “music has gotten very girly.” Unsurprisingly, readers were angry with the 57-year-old’s tone-deaf comments.The musician made the “girly” remark when he was explaining how his kids helped their dear old dad discover new music. “The band is always listening to music, and I have got my kids. Jordan is a music snob, an indie snob,” the 57-year-old said in a recent interview with Rolling Stone. “Eve is hip-hop. Elijah is in a band, and he has got very strong feelings about music, but he doesn’t make any distinction between, let’s say, the Who and the Killers. Or, you know, Nirvana and Royal Blood,” Bono said. “It is not generational for him. It is the sound and what he is experiencing. He believes that a rock & roll revolution is around the corner.” When the magazine asked whether Bono also believed rock ‘n’ roll was headed toward a revolution, the singer said this: I think music has gotten very girly. And there are some good things about that, but hip-hop is the only place for young male anger at the moment — and that’s not good.The musician didn’t elaborate on his belief that anger is strictly a “young male” emotion, nor why he believes it’s only present in hip-hop. It’s also unclear whether he intended “girly” as an insult or a marker of weakness. Perhaps he missed the ample excellent music released by female artists this year, or the many, many reasons women had to be angry — especially in 2017.“When I was 16, I had a lot of anger in me. You need to find a place for it and for guitars, whether it is with a drum machine — I don’t care,” Bono added. “The moment something becomes preserved, it is fucking over. You might as well put it in formaldehyde. In the end, what is rock & roll? Rage is at the heart of it.” Twitter users seemed amazed the musician would say something so incredibly out of touch (then again, this is the man that praised Vice President Mike Pence’s anti-AIDS work that might’ve led to an HIV spike in Indiana).We expect an apology coming in 3, 2, 1 ... Head over to Rolling Stone to read the rest of Bono’s interview. "
65,ARTS & CULTURE,Women-Only Art Shows Stood Out In 2017.

Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!!” she wrote, invoking Donald Trump’s by then famous characterization of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “Who’s interested???”An hour later, more than 300 women had responded, equally frustrated and appalled by the election of an accused sexual predator to the highest office in the country. They responded with such passion and excitement that Jackson and her co-organizer, curator Jessamyn Fiore, agreed they couldn’t turn anyone away from the show. Instead, the two resolved to exhibit all artworks submitted ― requiring only that the works measure under 12 inches in every direction.“The Nasty Women Art Show” opened in January, with work by 694 artists on view. The artworks were all priced under $100, with proceeds benefiting Planned Parenthood. In three days, the show sold out. It raised $42,500. The idea quickly spread beyond New York, with sanctioned “Nasty Women” art shows popping up around the world ― in Arizona and Tennessee and Belgium and London. The next show is scheduled for January 2018 in Washington, D.C., on the anniversary of Trump’s inauguration. The wild success of the “Nasty Women” art shows speaks to the climate of 2017, described by HuffPost’s Emma Gray as “the year women found their rage.” From the Women’s March in January, which New York magazine’s Jerry Saltz dubbed the “best art achievement of 2017,” to Time designating the “Silence Breakers” its person of the year in December, the past 360 or so days have been marked by a kind of collective outcry that’s been impossible to ignore. But it’s inaccurate to suggest that 2017 alone prompted women to raise hell, as though they hadn’t before. It’s true that many people, particularly white women, were shocked by Trump’s election and what it suggested about our country, and leaped into action in response. Yet for others, particularly women of color, the discrimination and oppression on naked display in the Trumpian era have always been part of the American experience. And people have been protesting it for just as long.This truth was fiercely demonstrated by two sprawling exhibitions that showcased the radical art of women of color. In April, New York’s Brooklyn Museum opened “We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women 1965-85,” which featured work from 40 artists, including Elizabeth Catlett, Loïs Mailou Jones, Lorraine O’Grady, Howardena Pindell and Faith Ringgold. The exhibition traced the rise of a distinctive African-American, feminist art movement in the 1960s, when artists like Emma Amos, Jae Jarrell and Barbara Jones-Hogu were among the few women represented in black artist circles. It followed the birth of all-women’s collectives like Where We At, which blended artistic practice with fundraising, community outreach, education and political action in 1971. The exhibition was housed near one of the Brooklyn Museum’s most prized possessions, Judy Chicago’s famous 1970s installation “The Dinner Party.” Chicago’s name is central to most discussions of radical feminist art, while the names of women of color are often pushed to the margins. “We Wanted a Revolution” attempted to give those women, and their work, their due. “Liberation of Aunt Jemima: Cocktail,” for example, reflects artist Betye Saar’s mission to transfigure racist imagery into talismans of power. And “Confessions for Myself,” a 1972 sculpture by Barbara Chase-Riboud, is a towering knot of black patinated bronze with wool cascading gently down ― part metal wreckage, part feminine robe, a visual amalgamation of softness and strength.The group show highlighted how mainstream feminism in the ’60s and ’70s was a movement composed primarily of ― and made to benefit ― white, middle-class women. The art associated with such a movement, celebrated today in many museums’ permanent collections, was often incompatible with black women’s histories, anxieties and desires. To truly understand the era of activism and art, the show implicitly argued, historians have to look beyond.“What do black women feel about Women’s Lib?” Toni Morrison wrote in 1971 for The New York Times. “Distrust. It is white, therefore suspect. They look at white women and see them as the enemy ― for they know that racism is not confined to white men, and that there are more white women than men in this country, and that 53 percent of the population sustained an eloquent silence during times of greatest stress.” (It’s not clear what the “53 percent” statistic refers to, but the number is eerily familiar: It’s the same percentage of white women who voted for Donald Trump.)Five months after “We Wanted a Revolution” opened, Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum debuted “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985,” a massive survey of work from more than 100 Latin American women artists from 15 countries. As with “We Wanted a Revolution,” most of the featured artists didn’t identify with feminism, a movement they considered “bourgeois and imperialistic.”Instead, the artists on view grappled with issues facing women ― maternity, eroticism, domesticity and gender-based violence ― through the lens of their respective countries. Cuban artist Marta María Pérez staged haunting portraits of her pregnant belly threatened by her own knife-wielding hand, a thinly veiled reference to Afro-Cuban superstitions that, along with the rest of her work, places Western myths about motherhood ― as immaculate and peaceful ― in stark relief. Also on view is Chilean artist Gloria Camiruaga’s 1984 film “Popsicles,” which shows her daughters chanting “Hail Mary” while licking ice pops with plastic soldiers in them. The piece considers the idea of childhood innocence against a backdrop of perpetual violence, the reality faced by kids growing up under Chile’s authoritarian military government.Several other all-women group exhibitions drew attention this year, including “NSFW: Female Gaze” at New York’s Museum of Sex, which focused on erotic work by younger artists, many of whom had never exhibited their work in a museum before. There was also a laundry list of overtly timely shows ― “She Inspires,” “Uprise/Angry Women,” “Secret Garden: The Female Gaze on Erotica” ― on view at New York’s Untitled Space.But critics praised both “We Wanted a Revolution” and “Radical Women” in particular, lauding them as overdue. Looking back, the shows stand out as two of the most rousing exhibitions of 2017. And they serve as interesting foils to shows like “Nasty Women,” which feature predominately young, white artists, underscoring how women of color have been making urgent, political artwork long before the Trump presidency.It’s ultimately heartening to see women-centric shows on view at wide-reaching institutions like the Hammer and the Brooklyn Museum, the latter of which dedicated an entire year to feminist programming. Given the archaic gender bias that still permeates the art world ― art by women typically sells for approximately half of what works by male artists fetch at auction ― these efforts are necessary. But they are not enough.Why? Because women artists account for fewer than a third of solo shows at major museums. And that imbalance has consequences. In a research paper published by Williams College, Paige Wilkinson found that a solo show opportunity at a major museum increases an artist’s auction sale prices, on average, from 7 to 13 percent, while a shot at a group museum show only yields a 1 to 2 percent increase. Likely, this has to do with exposure. A solo show sets one artist apart from the rest, elevating her stature in the process, while a group show lumps artists together, placing them on equal but often impersonal footing. They are grouped together because they are women, because they are black, because they are Latin American, and sometimes not much more.This kind of categorization, which can feel like siloing, exists outside the world of fine art as well. Earlier this month, musician Caroline Polachek expressed her frustration with the electronic festival Moogfest after she was placed in a lineup of female, trans and gender-nonconforming artists without her approval. “Gender is not a genre,” Polachek tweeted. “I don’t need a sympathy pedestal, esp[ecially] from a male curator. Take my name off this list and put me in the pit with the boys.” Polachek eventually dropped out of the festival altogether, because, she explained on Twitter, “I wanted to break the lane divisions and not be spotlighted for ‘historical underrepresentation.’”From the Inauguration Day march to “Nasty Women” exhibitions to a late sexual misconduct reckoning, 2017 will be remembered as the year women banded together. The momentum that erupts when women join forces, tell their stories and show their work deserves to be celebrated.But recognizing the accomplishments of women in groups runs the risk of reinforcing stereotypes that, among other things, cast women as competent collaborators who aren’t ready to stand on their own. For feminist artist collectives in the ’70s and ’80s, embracing “inherently conciliatory and cooperative” behavior provided opportunities for exposure and acclaim, turning a potential weakness into a source of strength. Yet at a certain point, we must challenge these tropes as much as we embrace them to our advantage.On top of praising “We Wanted a Revolution” and “Radical Women,” critics hailed a slew of solo shows from women artists ― including Carol Rama at the New Museum, Florine Stettheimer at the Jewish Museum and Agnes Martin at the Guggenheim ― most of whom are both white and dead. There were exceptions, including Belkis Ayón at the Fowler Museum and El Museo del Barrio and Toyin Ojih Odutola at the Whitney. But when it comes to emerging and established women artists of color, solo shows are still, disappointingly, deviations from the norm. Looking ahead, women both within and outside the art world deserve to be recognized more as individuals, as powerful, significant and worthy in and of themselves. All-women group shows are convenient in their ability to address sweeping, historic inequalities. But artists like Pérez, O’Grady, Camiruaga and Pindell deserve the same treatment as their male contemporaries. If women-only art shows stood out in 2017, let’s leave them there. Let’s look forward to bigger and better, more radical and revolutionary work in 2018."

Television pictures showed many of the injured suffered serious burns.President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman issued a statement calling the attack an “unpardonable” crime against humanity and pledging to destroy terrorist groups.Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement on Twitter denying involvement.The bloodshed follows an attack on a private television station in Kabul last month, which was also claimed by Islamic State.Backed by the heaviest U.S. air strikes since the height of the international combat mission in Afghanistan, Afghan forces have forced the Taliban back in many areas and prevented any major urban center from falling into the hands of insurgents.But high-profile attacks in the big cities have continued as militants have looked for other ways to make an impact and undermine confidence in security. Islamic State, which is opposed to both the Taliban and the Western-backed government, has claimed a growing share of such attacks.“This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan civilians,” rights group Amnesty International said in a statement from its South Asia Director, Biraj Patnaik. “In one of the deadliest years on record, journalists and other civilians continue to be ruthlessly targeted by armed groups.”According to a report this month by media freedom group Reporters without Borders, Afghanistan is among the world’s most dangerous countries for media workers with two journalists and five media assistants killed doing their jobs in 2017, before Thursday’s attack.According to Sayed Abbas Hussaini, a journalist at Afghan Voice, one reporter at the agency was killed in Thursday’s attack and two were wounded.This is a developing story.

Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead just hours before he was set to testify against former President Cristina Fernández in early 2015. His death, which triggered an avalanche of conspiracy theories, was initially labeled a suicide. But a federal judge ruled this week that Nisman was murdered.“The death of Prosecutor Nisman was not a suicide, and was brought about by a third party and in a painful manner,” said federal judge Julián Ercolini.Nisman had been leading the investigation into the attack on a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people and injured more than 300 in 1994. He was appointed to lead the terror probe in 2004, when few details in the case had been established.After more than a decade of investigation, Nisman accused Fernández in January 2015 of covering up Iran’s alleged involvement in the bombing in a suspected attempt to boost trade with Tehran. He was discovered dead in his apartment from a gunshot wound to the head days later.Judge Claudio Bonadio indicted Fernández earlier this month on treason charges stemming from Nisman’s probe, but she denies any wrongdoing. Now a senator, the former president has immunity from prosecution.Bonadio has requested that her immunity be lifted. But Fernandez’s local and regional allies say she is being targeted in a “media and judicial hunt.” Bonadio has for years been under investigation for alleged corruption crimes including money laundering.In his Tuesday ruling, Ercolini charged Diego Lagomarsino, Nisman’s former aide, with accessory to murder. Lagomarsino was the last person known to be in Nisman’s apartment at the time, and his gun was identified as the murder weapon.“I’m very nervous, very tense, but I believe that sooner or later this is going to be resolved,” Lagomarsino told reporters after the judge’s ruling, according to BBC. He has maintained his innocence, and claims Nisman had asked him for his gun out of fear for his safety on the night of his death.To date, no one has been convicted in the bombing."

A State Department rep had decried the Russian government’s “ongoing crackdown against independent voices, from journalists to civil society activists and opposition politicians,” according to a statement obtained by Business Insider.“We urge the government of Russia to hold genuine elections that are transparent, fair, and free and that guarantee the free expression of the will of the people, consistent with its international human rights obligations,” the State Department said.Zakharova suggested the U.S. was “meddling” in the Russian election by issuing such comments. “This statement by the U.S. Department of State, which I’m sure will not be the only one, is a direct interference into the electoral process and the state’s domestic affairs,” Zakharova wrote in a Facebook post.Several Russian news outlets, including the state-owned TASS news agency, reported Zakharova’s comments this week.Zakharova’s accusation comes amid an ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia’s own interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.The U.S. intelligence community has expressed “high confidence” that Putin’s government used “an influence campaign” during the election to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate [Democratic nominee Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.” Russia’s next presidential election is slated to take place in March. Putin, who officially announced this month that he would be seeking a fourth presidential term, is expected to win easily. His administration, however, has taken significant steps to ensure that Navalny, who submitted his documents to register as a presidential candidate on Sunday, is scrubbed completely from the minds of voters. The Central Election Commission ruled on Monday that Navalny would be barred from running against Putin, citing the activist’s earlier conviction for embezzlement. Navalny and his supporters argue the move was politically motivated. “We won’t have an election because Vladimir Putin is horribly afraid, he sees a threat in competing with me,” Navalny said in a video released after the decision. “He gave an instruction to his servants from the Central Electoral Commission to reject my registration.”According to The New York Times, Putin’s government has also threatened Navalny with legal action if he continues to call for a boycott of the election ― something he’s done repeatedly this week.

Instead, violators will be ordered to take police-instructed classes on “Islamic values,” while repeat offenders could still be subject to legal action, reported the Wall Street Journal.“Based on a society-oriented, educational approach, the police will not arrest those who don’t respect Islamic values,” said Brig. Gen. Hossein Rahimi, according to the country’s official Islamic Republic News Agency. “It will instead educate them.” For decades, Iranian women have been resisting a government ruling passed in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution that required women to wear headscarves in public. Iranian millennials have been especially defiant of the policy through social media protests and street marches.The decision marks another step toward social progress under Iran’s relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani, though some Iranians question just how large of a step it is.Masih Alinejad, an Iranian activist, accused the government of “avoiding a real solution” to the country’s strict dress code policy.“They should understand that in this day and age, how women dress is none of their business,” Alinejad wrote on Instagram. “This is a small victory but a victory nevertheless. But our true victory is when compulsory hijab is abolished.”Last year, Rahimi announced the deployment of over 7,000 undercover morality police focused on “confronting bad hijab and removal of veils inside cars,” along with curbing reckless driving, street parades, the harassment of women and noise pollution, according to the Agence France-Presse.And just last week, the city’s morality police arrested 230 people for drinking alcohol and dancing as they celebrated the winter solstice."

He said Roscosmos could confirm speculation that the mission had failed because the rocket was programmed with the wrong coordinates.According to Rogozin, the agency failed to update the launch location from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is in Kazakhstan, to its new Vostochny Cosmodrome in Siberia.“The rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from Baikonur,” Rogozin said, in comments translated into English by Reuters. “They didn’t get the coordinates right.”As a result, the rocket’s upper stage was unable to orient itself when it ignited. Instead of boosting its payload of 19 satellites from various international scientific, research and commercial companies into orbit, it accelerated downward into Earth’s atmosphere, destroying them.That was the second launch from the Vostochny facility, and the second failure. Cosmodrome officials faced a scolding from Russian President Vladimir Putin last year after its first attempted launch was aborted due to a technical glitch. (The rocket lifted off the next day without incident.)“Despite all its failings, Russia remains the world leader in the number of space launches,” Putin remarked at the time. “But the fact that we’re encountering a large number of failures is bad. There must be a timely and professional reaction.” "

Its owner, Percy Craig, advertises on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Booksy. Like his Facebook page, and you will find photos of fresh haircuts, “barbers wanted” ads and five-star reviews. Walk inside, and you will find Craig sitting across from his barbers, wearing a fitted cap with the brim low and texting on his phone.Craig, 34, from Bridgeport, doesn’t know much about repealing net neutrality at first, but his facial expression changes when he learns it means his internet service provider, Optimum, would be able to charge him extra to access social media.“I’m already paying for your services,” Craig said. “For the amount that y’all are getting paid, you shouldn’t be charging me any more.”The FCC repealed net neutrality rules on December 14, and entrepreneurs who market their products and services online are concerned about the possible increased cost of advertising on social media and accessing their websites.The internet has been a marketplace for a long time, and social media is a popular avenue for business owners to access customers they normally can’t reach. Around 34 percent of business owners surveyed by Square and Mercury Analytics sell through their own website and 40 percent rely on social media, giving them access to the 51 percent of Americans who shop online, per Big Commerce. Craig, who founded Chopping Block in January of 2014, said he started out passing around fliers, and he didn’t have many other options. In the Town of Stratford, you can post signs on your business, but you can’t leave commercial signs on town property, and Craig said he has seen a Stratford official “snatch up people’s signs” from street corners.He also said the town’s ordinances limited his outreach.“Every now and then you still get people who live in this area who say they don’t know there’s a barbershop here,” Craig said.Social media gave Craig free access to customers his business normally could not reach, but now the cost may change. In 2015, the Barack Obama’s approach to net neutrality shifted the internet under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, regulating it like a utility. This allowed consumers access to the internet without their service providers blocking or throttling content and it prohibited paid prioritization deals that forced consumers to pay for faster internet speed. Repealing these regulations would allow ISPs to charge customers for access to certain sites or block them the same way a cable provider can charge for certain channels.In November, Ajit Pai, Republican chairman of the FCC, argued for the repeal that “consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate.”Raymond J. Keating, chief economist for the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, praised Pai for his plan. He argued on the SBEC website that Congress never intended to regulate the internet the way Obama did during his presidency, and he agreed with Pai that the previous FCC regulations created “greater uncertainty, higher costs, and reduced investment.”Not everyone agrees with Pai or Keating. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Pai’s goal is “an all-out assault” on entrepreneurs that will “further stack the playing field in favor of the biggest bank account, chilling competition, hurting consumers and punishing entrepreneurs and small businesses.”Craig said if his service provider charges him for social media access, he would likely have to “suck it up.” Between 30 to 40 percent of his customers come from his social media marketing, and he can’t raise his prices because people have already complained about his $20 charge for a haircut.“In this area, you can only charge but so much,” Craig said. “[Raising prices more] is not a good look.”Craig is not the only business owner with concerns. Ava Diamond, 53, from Stratford, said a net neutrality repeal would complicate her online coaching because she mostly promotes on LinkedIn, meets 50 percent of her clients online and conducts sessions via VSee, Facetime or Skype. She also helps military service members free of charge. Diamond started a new website, The Revolution of Healing, with her business partner Kavvy Sonhos, and its services are 100 percent online. Sonhos was unavailable for comment, but Diamond, whose ISP is Frontier, said if net neutrality is repealed, she won’t be able to give away as much.“It takes away this opportunity to offer community service for people who need to heal from all kinds of emotional baggage,” Diamond said, “including our veterans…We want them to be able to access it.”Neither Craig nor Diamond see a positive outcome to repealing the regulations.More entrepreneurs against repealing net neutrality: Tiffany WilkersonLocation: Lovell, Wyoming.Vocation: Owner and head trainer of CrZyFiT.com.Thoughts: “This would make you go back to buying commercials.

Each of his movies features a downtrodden protagonist who finds a glimmer of hope in the offing: Laura Dern’s pregnant druggie in “Citizen Ruth,” Reese Witherspoon’s ruthless go-getter in “Election,” Jack Nicholson’s driftless retiree in “About Schmidt,” Paul Giamatti’s defeated wino in “Sideways,” George Clooney’s troubled workaholic in “The Descendants,” Bruce Dern’s stubborn boozehound in “Nebraska” and, now, Matt Damon’s begrudging bachelor in “Downsizing.” Usually, Payne’s movies stay relatively small in scale, but “Downsizing” is far larger, which is sort of ironic since it’s about people becoming small. Imagine an adult “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids” ― more on that below (spoiler: Payne doesn’t relish the reference) ― pitched as a fable about overpopulation and climate change. Scientists have concocted a procedure that shrinks humans to about five inches tall, after which they move to a miniaturized world. Damon, playing a spiritless office drone, elects to become little. He isn’t very happy with what happens afterward. But, of course, there’s a glimmer of hope somewhere in the distance ― maybe. The plot of “Downsizing” zigs and zags, requiring the most visual effects of Payne’s career, as well as the largest budget ($70 million).Before Christmas, I sat down with Payne at Paramount Pictures’ New York office, where we talked about casting lead roles, why “Election” is his most popular film and what he gets out of doctoring scripts like “Meet the Parents” and “Jurassic Park III.” In person, Payne is frosty, articulate and wry. He speaks with a screenwriter’s poise, as if his sentences have been scripted. There’s a sardonic edge to the way he comports himself, but, just like his characters, it doesn’t come without a morsel of optimism.We’ve spoken before, on the phone. I wrote an oral history of “Election” a few years ago.For whom?For HuffPost.Oh, right. That’s you? Whoa! I would have been happy to bring you, as a gift, the new Blu-ray of “Election.” It just came out a couple of days ago.It’s the Criterion Collection, right?Criterion, with a bunch of extras. I’m very proud it’s on Criterion.You said recently that “Election” is still the movie you’re most complimented on, and I started wondering why that is. I don’t know if you’ve read your own Wikipedia page ―Yeah, a while ago. It’s been a while. I don’t go there often.One of the bullet points is about the themes of your work, and a big part of that talks about how many men are at the center of the stories you tell. The term “crises of masculinity” is used. Yet your first two movies were about women. Strong, feisty women.And then you went in a different direction. What prompted that?It’s stuff I can look at only in hindsight, I think. But when conceiving a film, I’m just thinking, “What’s good story?” It was just the luck of the draw that “About Schmidt” came my way by way of an adaptation ― I was able to use a screenplay I’d written 10 years before. And then I got the unpublished book of “Sideways,” which was the biggest gift I’d had since getting the unpublished manuscript of “Election.” And then of course we wanted to do “Downsizing,” but that took forever to get made. Then I made “The Descendants.”I’m not consciously looking for the white male schnook. It’s just, “What’s a good story?” I certainly hate being pigeonholed. “Oh, you’re the chronicler of middle-aged white men.” I guess there’s a certain degree to which ― from Mr. McAllister [in “Election”] to Warren Schmidt to Miles Whatever His Name Is in “Sideways” ― there is this white male in crisis, but it’s kind of the luck of the draw. I mean, my career is a work in progress — just in slight slow motion.You know, after I wrote the oral history of “Election,” you sent me an email. You wanted me to add an exclamation mark at the end of, “You hear stolen spaghetti-Western music earlier than you do in any Tarantino film. I got there first.”[Nods and smiles] Well, he told me himself. I ran into Tarantino. One of the first times I met him, he said, “I’ve always wanted to use [composer Ennio] Morricone, but you beat me to it.”I wonder if you have a theory as to why “Election” is your most popular movie. You’ve had higher-grossing titles than that, and Reese Witherspoon wasn’t as big of a star then as she is now. I also get a lot of positive comments about “Sideways,” more from a bourgeois crowd — the wine crowd. That’s kind of a minor classic in another way. But I think “Election” has a ferocious cynical bite, which keeps it alive. Not only does it date the film, but it keeps it fresh. And also it’s the only film I’ve made which I feel isn’t too long. It has an extremely good, almost musical rhythm to it. It’s like a shark — it never stops moving forward. As far as high school movies go, it has a real verisimilitude to people’s actual high school experiences, in the casting and the lighting and the feel of the drab school. It has a lot of funny, ribald laughs in it. Pretty good music. And the novelty of multiple voice-over. It has an off-kilter, “Rashomon”-like structure to it.I have another theory: I think it also has a music-video quality. It’s made during a period in the late ’90s when the aesthetics of MTV were influencing movies. “Go” also came out in 1999, and Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo & Juliet” was a few years before. “Election” has a bit of that too, with the freeze frames and the surreal visuals.That had nothing to do with how I shot it. The visual style that most influenced “Election” was “Casino.” I loved the whole film, and particularly the first half. I was drunk with the elixir of the roving camera in “Casino.” “Goodfellas,” too, to a certain degree. But the way he distilled that style in the first half of “Casino” was important.Your actors have a very good track record with awards. Each movie since “About Schmidt” has earned at least one Oscar nomination for its acting. Here we are on the day of the SAG Award noms, and Hong Chau got a nomination for “Downsizing.” Do you consider yourself especially adept at directing actors?Well, that’s the most important job of a director in narrative cinema, is it not? To make sure the story is sound and well-told, and that the actors are good. Look, our favorite directors — often the greatest visual stylists — are the ones who are also most adept at getting good performances. Think of Kubrick with Ryan O’Neal. Perfect casting, perhaps the best performance he ever gave. Or those Peter Bogdanovich films, too. But when was John Wayne ever better than with John Ford? Or Toshiro Mifune than with Kurosawa?It’s up to directors to ensure that the performances are good, and I accept the compliment, and I thank you for the compliment of the question. There’s nothing more richly satisfying than discovering the perfect actor for an idiosyncratic part like this one, so you know the old pros — Matt Damon and Christoph Waltz and Kristen Wiig — will deliver the goods. You know that. But to find, as I say, exactly the right actor for that bizarre part of the one-legged Vietnamese monomaniacal dissident is richly satisfying.You’re someone who has consistently worked just left of Hollywood. Your movies do make money ―Not all of them.Not all of them, but you have some hits on your hands, especially for the types of movies you make.“The Descendants,” “Sideways” and “About Schmidt” opened pretty well.There was a big shift during the years between “The Descendants” and “Nebraska” in terms of franchises taking over Hollywood and movie stars’ box-office power declining. Do you think there’s been a big shift in what sort of casting is required for getting a project made?I don’t really know what to say about that. Are you asking me to observe the industry, or to talk about my own experiences?Your own experiences within a changing industry.My experience has not changed. “Downsizing,” just to pluck one example, was very standard trajectory of trying to get a film financed. It’s a sui generis film. The screenplay was called “too intelligent” by a couple of studio chiefs to merit the budget I was asking for, and I knew I needed a big star from a very short list of bankable stars. In his age range, I had only Matt Damon, and thank god he said yes. We also had Reese Witherspoon for a while, but she dropped out and Kristen Wiig took the part. So I did have to build in some insurance policy with stars, which is super old-school.And then similarly with “Nebraska,” I was able to cast exactly who I thought would be right for the part. No one’s going to run out and see a movie today simply because Bruce Dern and Will Forte are in it; they will know them and respect them, but it’s not a huge insurance policy for the studio. But that movie only cost $13 million — a lot by European standards, not by American studio standards. So I was able to get the film made.“The Descendants,” George Clooney, great. And then the rest of the financing just fell into place. And he’s right for the part. Even if I didn’t need a star, I feel Clooney was the right guy for that part. But I’m not sure that George Clooney today is as much of a selling point for a studio as he was in 2010, purely in terms of a movie’s opening-weekend potential. So you’re saying that film may not be made, or you’re saying I’d have to use a different star?Probably more the former. Or it would still get made, but it’s less likely to waltz its way to $83 million at the box office. People’s moviegoing habits have changed dramatically over the past seven years.Taking this discussion to a slightly larger tangent, I lament the disappearance of the adult drama with visual scope. All the quote-unquote adult intelligent films are given shrink-wrapped budgets. I don’t know what “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” cost, or what “Mudbound” cost, but they were as small as possible and they had to be shot in as few days as possible. Where is “The English Patient” today? Where is “Out of Africa” today? Can’t a studio spend $40 to $60 million on something that’s going to have a richly classical-movie feel? That’s what I miss.A-list movies now are all what used to be Roger Corman films. Rather than what you’re talking about — the change of stars in the last eight years or something — for me the bigger thing is how A-list and B-list have switched. “The Fast and the Furious” used to cost $300,000. Now it costs $200 million. And “Out of Africa” used to cost $50 million, and now you have to make it for $20 million. Anything adult, contemporary, literate is considered an indie, fourth-quarter release. They’re all making Roger Corman films now. “It” is considered an A-list film now.Do you think that trend will eventually reverse itself again?No.You don’t think Marvel will burn out eventually?I don’t know. That leads to the larger question, as you know — and I’m starting to say the obvious — that American movies are so expensive to make and then so expensive to distribute.And expensive to get into. For many people, $16 a ticket is a lot to ask.Look, it’s even $10 or $12 in India. Even in India, where they’re great moviegoers, it’s a little pricey to go. So all of that contributes to lowest-common-denominator, getting-butts-in-seats thinking. Where is the artist? Now, I hear the new “Star Wars” is very good and has artistry within it, but they have the insurance policy. They’re freed within the context. I mean, they needed some artistry after making some stinkers in the series.With “Downsizing,” the scale is larger than your previous movies, but it doesn’t announce itself as a huge movie. Your work tends to have a certain quirkiness, and given the premise about shrunken people, I expected more of an adult “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,” if you will.I won’t. But I’ve never even seen “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.”Have you gotten that reference a lot while doing press?Oh yeah, but I’ve never seen it.When you’re devising a parallel world, do you make a list of real-world analogues? Are you thinking, “Well, how does money work? How do neighborhoods work? How is labor divided?”Not consciously, not schematically like that. It just fell into place naturally when Jim Taylor and I were writing the script. It took a lot of time to write because of all the things we had to imagine, and delightfully so. The movie idea offers an endless chain reaction of what-ifs. What if this? Oh, then what if that? How would they [shrink people]? Oh, they’d have to take fillings out of the teeth. And what would money be? We thought about a lot of that, and of course you can’t get it all into the film because then the film becomes too much about that. You’ve got to have a story to tell.But the first part of your question was about the visual effects, and of course you have to fill in the production design as well because you build as much as you can afford to, and then do digital extension beyond that. I told both the productions designer and the visual-effects supervisor that I wanted the look of the film to be so real as to be banal. It needed to have the same texture of reality that all of my previous films have had, which are all shot on found locations and unchanged locations as much as possible. I wanted even this highly designed film ultimately to feel like that. And then with the overall visual texture of the film, I wanted it to feel like a movie made in about 1978.Does this inspire you get even bigger in scale going forward?It doesn’t matter. Every story’s different. Now I have the experience of doing this one, so I know what all the kids are talking about when they do visual effects and build large sets. This movie required it. My team and I did a pretty fair job, but no movie too big, no movie too small. I’d be delighted to make a $3 million movie next, or a $100 million movie. It really doesn’t matter. In general, though, I grow frustrated by the machinery of American filmmaking. I always wanted intimacy between myself, the camera and what’s being shot.Among the directors with whom you keep company, do others feel the same way?I don’t know. I think David Fincher does. I haven’t talked to a lot of directors about it, but I know Fincher’s always thinking about how to have at least less machinery on set. That’s all I know.I’m surprised by how much script doctoring you’ve done along the way. Not in a while.When you were revising “Meet the Parents” and “Jurassic Park III,” was that just because you needed a paycheck?Hell yes. And it’s fun.Those aren’t movies that seem like your wheelhouse.Well, “Meet the Parents” does.Yeah, I guess you’re right about that. I can see that as an Alexander Payne movie.We wrote the last draft of “Meet the Parents” uncredited, and we did such a good job, they felt, that they, meaning Universal, came to us with a “Jurassic Park III” rewrite, which doesn’t seem like a movie within our wheelhouse. But they needed help with the characters, not the dinosaurs. And then we did “I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,” we did a draft of “Baby Mama,” and we did something else that was never made. I may be blanking on something else we might have done. But it’s good to get a paycheck, and it’s also good to feel like a professional, rather than a struggling artist in a garret. The Coen brothers do it all the time. It’s nice to feel like, “Oh, we have these skills, and rather than stretching this out over six months, we have four weeks to do this, so let’s burn the midnight oil.” You feel like a professional.You’re not barking at someone’s door waiting for a yes.No, not just that — but, “Oh, what are we going to do? Does this feel right? is this good enough for us?” It’s like, no, you’ve just got to keep plowing forward. It gave us some skills to where we then wrote “Sideways’ in about 16 weeks, which was shorter than we’d written “Citizen Ruth” or “Election.” It’s good to go to boot camp once in a while.It’s funny how many ties you have to “Big Little Lies.”All my bitches! Four of my bitches be in that show: Reese, Shailene, Laura and now Hong. And I haven’t watched the show yet.Now you just have to put Nicole Kidman in something one of these days.Right. I hear she’s very good in it.It may be the best work she’s done, and that’s saying a lot for Nicole Kidman. That’s great.You do have a small company of players you’ve used in multiple movies: Laura Dern, June Squibb, Reese Witherspoon had she kept the “Downsizing” role.Phil Reeves. He plays the principal in “Election,” and he plays Kristen Wiig’s father in “Downsizing.” I love Phil Reeves. I wish I used this company more. It would be so delightful — like Fellini had Marcello Mastroianni, and Antonioni had Monica Vitti, and John Ford had John Wayne, and so forth — to have an alter ego. I haven’t had that yet.“Downsizing” is currently in theaters."
