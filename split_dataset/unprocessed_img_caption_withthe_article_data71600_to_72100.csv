""We're here to honor the work of Planned Parenthood. We're here to honor the work of the Colorado Springs Police Department and other first responders.

There, a moment of silence was held for the fallen, and officers could be seen crying as they walked off the court.An officer in tears was given a bear hug from the school's mascot.On Saturday evening, hundreds gathered at the university's Gallogy Events Center for a candlelight vigil in honor of Swasey, remembering him as a husband and a dad who dedicated much of his life to helping others.Police told The Huffington Post that the nine people injured in the shooting had been recovering at area hospitals, after bullets flew in and around the Planned Parenthood clinic on Friday. Several of the victims were released from the hospital Saturday afternoon. Two civilians and an officer were killed on Friday.Americans across the country have had to attend too many vigils for senseless shootings over the past few years.

2,SCIENCE,"Loneliness Is Bad For You, And This Study May Help Explain Why",Jacqueline Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/loneliness-bad-for-you_us_56548ffbe4b0258edb32fc88,Feeling lonely may trigger changes in our cells that could make us more susceptible to illness.,2015-11-28,"Loneliness can affect the production of white blood cells in our bodies, study shows.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5654a6f81700005300e1a74e.jpeg?cache=Dhq7BQrkXG&ops=crop_0_0_3866_2386%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists have long known that spending time with loved ones is good for our long-term health and may reduce our risk of cognitive decline, whereas loneliness is linked to high blood pressure, inflammation and a weakened immune system.But why exactly does loneliness have such bad effects on our health and well-being?One reason, according to a new study, may have to do with the way loneliness triggers cellular changes in our bodies that can make us more susceptible to viral infections.""Feeling lonely means you are not in a socially affine environment but rather in a relatively hostile environment,"" Dr. John Cacioppo, a professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the study, told The Huffington Post in an email.""In socially affine environments, protection against viral infections is especially important, whereas in hostile environments, protection against bacteria is important,"" Cacioppo wrote. ""The pattern of gene expression in the lonely [environment] decreases protection against viral infections and instead may increase protection against bacterial infections.""In other words, as Live Science notes, the cellular changes that result in a shift toward protection against bacteria may come at the cost of the ability to protect against viral infections.For the study, researchers analyzed the regulation of the leukocyte gene -- which is involved in protecting the body against both bacteria and viruses -- in 141 older adult humans over a five-year period, and in a separate group of rhesus macaque monkeys that displayed behavior indicative of social isolation.The researchers noticed increased activity in genes that produce inflammation in the body and less activity in genes that help to fight off illness in the adults who were lonely and in the monkeys, The Telegraph reported.In the monkeys, researchers also found that loneliness causes the body to produce ""fight-or-flight"" stress signals, which can impair the body's antiviral responses.For instance, when the researchers infected monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus, the virus grew faster in the monkeys that were classified as socially isolated than in monkeys that were not ""lonely,"" according to Live Science. This may be a result of the immune system releasing monocytes, a particular kind of immune cell linked to high levels of inflammatory proteins and low levels of antiviral proteins.The researchers concluded that inflammation and impaired antiviral responses contribute to the bad health effects of loneliness. The findings appear to support previous research suggesting that for older adults, feelings of social isolation may increase the risk of premature death by 14 percent.""This study specifically showed loneliness causes a physiological reaction in people,"" Dr. Matthew Lorber, acting director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the new research, told CBS News.""This is the first study I have seen that has actually gone into the details of showing loneliness leading to a decreased production of leukocytes (disease-fighting cells) and an increased production of immature monocytes,"" Lorber said. ""Leukocytes are what our body needs to fight infection. The fact that loneliness is leading to a decreased production of the leukocytes is really fascinating to me.""But to be clear, the research doesn't conclusively prove anything. The U.K.'s National Health Service pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday that ""this study has not proved that socially isolated humans are more likely to become ill or die earlier. ... Feelings of loneliness and social isolation can be complex emotions that may be influenced by many personal, health and life circumstances.""Still, the NHS went on, ""what is fairly apparent from this and previous research is that, whatever the biological mechanism(s) that may be behind it, loneliness and social isolation do seem to be associated in some way with disease and illness.""The researchers said that they plan to continue examining how loneliness leads to poor health outcomes, and how these effects can be prevented in older adults.The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.Also on HuffPost:"

You want to go above and beyond so that you're seen as someone highly valuable--someone the organization can't live without.,2015-11-28,2015-11-19-1447962445-2409286-HowToBlowYourBosssMindHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-11-19-1447962445-2409286-HowToBlowYourBosssMindHP-thumb.jpg,"We all want to get ahead. Still, even when it seems you're doing everything right--you're never late to work, rarely take a sick day, and always meet deadlines--promotions can be few and far between.You're putting the work in, so why aren't you getting rewarded? The answer is simple: you don't get promoted for fulfilling your boss's expectations.Your boss's expectations are the price of entry. Even if you're making a great effort and doing all that's asked of you, you won't stand out. You'll be seen as someone who completes the minimum requirements, and no one who builds a great career is seen this way.The trick to advancing your career and getting paid more is to add value by making certain your contributions are worth more than you're paid. You want to go above and beyond so that you're seen as someone highly valuable--someone the organization can't live without.You should aim to exceed your boss's expectations so much that he feels like he's the smartest guy in the world for hiring you.This isn't as hard as it sounds. In fact, you can blow your boss's mind in seven easy steps.Step 1: Beyond developing the skills you need for your job, learn about your company's industry, competitors, latest developments, and challenges. Professional development is important, but why stop there? If you really want to blow your boss's mind, soak up everything you can about your company and your industry. For example, if you're an IT developer, instead of simply learning the current best practices in coding, learn how those practices are being applied throughout your industry.Transferring your knowledge to the real-world context of your organization is a great way to add value. On top of knowing how to do your job, it shows that you know why you're doing it and why it matters.Step 2: Instead of always having the answer, pre-empt the question.It's a good feeling when you can answer your boss's questions on the spot, without shuffling through piles of paper or telling her that you'll have to get back to her. But if you really want to blow her mind, pre-empt the question. Anticipate what she wants to stay on top of, and send her regular updates. You'll save her time and energy, and she'll appreciate that just as much as your enthusiasm.Step 3: Instead of owning up to mistakes once they're discovered, bring them to light yourself.Accountability is a lost art. Too many people try to cover up their mistakes, fearing the repercussions of admitting fault. Show your boss that you're not afraid to own up to your mistakes, and he'll be amazed. When you make a mistake, just give your boss a simple heads-up, and have a solution ready. Even better, tell him the steps you've already taken to mitigate the problem.Everyone makes mistakes. You'll stand out by showing your boss that you're accountable, creative, and proactive when you inevitably make them.  Step 4: Instead of asking for training, do it on your own.Typical career advice is to ask your boss to send you to classes and workshops to improve your skills. But we're not talking about what's typical; we're talking about blowing your boss's mind. Pursue training yourself, on your own time. It doesn't have to be expensive; there are plenty of online courses available free or close to free. While everybody else is asking the boss to send them to training, you can tell her what you've already done, and your initiative will be rewarded. You'll save the company money and get ahead, and expand your skillset at the same time.Step 5: Instead of doing what you're told, be proactive.Anybody (well, almost anybody) can do what they're told. To blow your boss's mind, you have to be proactive. If you see a problem, fix it. If you see something that needs doing, do it. Put together a how-to guide for new hires, document your processes and figure out where you can streamline them, or do whatever else you can think of to make a difference.Bosses appreciate vision more than anything. They love it when you see what could be useful to the company over the long term--and don't forget to tell your boss about it. It's only ""kissing up"" if you do it manipulatively or with the intention of making your co-workers look bad. There's absolutely nothing wrong with owning your accomplishments.Step 6: Build relationships with other departments.It's practically guaranteed that, at some point, your department will need help or input from another area. An excellent way to blow your boss's mind is to build relationships throughout the company. Person-to-person interactions are almost always more effective than department-to-department exchanges. You can make your boss's day by saying, ""Why don't I take care of that for you? I know someone who can get that done for us right away.""Step 7: Be the calm one in a crisis.Few things get your boss's attention like your ability to weather a storm. Whether it's conflict between people, everyone freaking out over a rule change, or what have you, make certain that you're the one who remains calm, composed, and in control of your emotions. Your composure and ability to think clearly during a crisis demonstrates leadership potential, and leaders get promoted.Bringing It All TogetherThe people who achieve the most are those who add the most value. Business is, after all, about making a profit. You want your boss and the company to know that they're getting a great return on the time and money they're investing in you.What are some other great ways to blow your boss's mind? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

In fact, that is probably nearly impossible. This world is made up of so many different people, personalities and preferences that there could not possibly be a one-size solution to everyone's joy.This rings especially true around the holidays. If it wasn't, then our mailboxes wouldn't be full of dozens of different catalogs peddling everything from the latest gadgets to the hottest new toys to an almost embarrassing number of gift options available in baskets. Even the ""of the month"" clubs now include everything from makeup to whiskey to dog toys.This idea that there is any one way to create happiness in an entire population is insane. And it's precisely why, when I became a foster parent in 2006, I knew immediately that the answer to creating more happiness for these precious, delicate lives was not a singular one. There are over 400,000 children in foster care each year. Many of which have been in the foster care system for years. Many have moved multiple times and most, if not all, have not been able to fully experience the joy and wonder of childhood. And this is the time of year when the joy and wonder of childhood are most evident; Christmas lists, pictures with Santa, Hanukkah gifts and holiday parties. I am sure everyone reading this is planning to purchase a holiday gift for a child, your own or otherwise. Those of us with children know that there is nothing like watching your child's eyes light up as they realize they are opening that one gift they had been hoping for. It is simply magical.Well, I want every child to know that magic. It is really that simple. At a time of year when we are all trying to find the perfect gift for every person on our list there is another list I hope thousands of you will take note of. The wish list on One Simple Wish's website currently has over 900 individual requests from children in foster care all across the country. From California to New Jersey children who have seen some of the worst of what the world can do are hoping to see just a bit of the best. The requests are not outlandish and over the top. They are for doll houses and gift cards and bikes and art sets. I stand by the belief that it's impossible to make everyone happy with a single item, idea or message. It can't be done. Joy and happiness are personal. They are caused by a spark inside each of us that is ignited by so many different things. But I also stand behind the belief that we all deserve the happiness, especially the children. So this holiday season as you shop online and navigate your way through crowded stores, consider adding just one child to your list; just one child whose moment of happiness is just a click away.To see the children's wishes visit www.onesimplewish.org/grant"

Or will he agree only to deal with no legal force?",2015-11-28,"WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 24: President Obama hosts French President Hollande for a bilateral meeting following the Paris terrorist attacks at the White House on November 24, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Leigh Vogel/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb17e8c2200003501db54fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As President Obama flies to Paris this weekend for the opening of the latest international negotiation on climate change, diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic appear confused about what his position will be. Will he champion legally binding commitments by all nations including the U.S. to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions? Or will he agree only to deal with no legal force?The distinction is like the difference between a handshake and a contract. The first is a matter of honor; the second is a matter of law. No one believes a Paris agreement will be sufficient to keep global warming to acceptable levels, but only a legally binding commitment is likely to keep international momentum alive for more progress after Paris. For the sake of his legacy, President Obama should settle for nothing less. Here is how and why:How: On the eve of President Obama's departure, the deal that appeared to be taking shape would include some legally binding elements, but they would not apply to the most important objective: greenhouse gas reductions. The President is trying to stay away from an agreement that is called or that looks like a formal treaty. Everyone knows that a treaty would have to go to the Senate for approval, where it would die on arrival. But there other types of agreements that have legal standing without Congress's approval. They are called ""executive agreements"". They are the most common form of commitments between the United States and other nations. There have been 17,300 of them since 1939 compared to only 1,100 ratified treaties. It appears that specific U.S. commitments on greenhouse gas reductions could be included in an executive agreement.If the Obama Administration made the United States a party to such an agreement without Congress's concurrence, congressional leaders would mostly likely draw their swords and fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. They would argue that the President had overstepped his authority and abused the separation of powers. Under the circumstances, it is a fight worth fighting.President Obama can point out that global warming is acknowledged in 96 different U.S. statutes. Several of them include findings by past congresses that climate change is real and dangerous and requires an international solution. In several of them, Congress delegated powers to the Executive Branch to confront climate change. One example is the Clean Air Act, which establishes our obligation to prevent any air pollution that ""may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country."" In addition, making the United States party to a binding agreement would be consistent with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which the Senate approved and President George H.W. Bush ratified in 1992. If the current members of Congress do not agree with the findings, statutes and delegations of authority approved by previous congresses, they can repeal them. In the meantime, the President's constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws of the land.Insofar as precedent matters, President Obama could cite the ""stewardship theory"" of executive power. That was the interpretation of presidential authority that Republican President Theodore Roosevelt adopted based on the leadership of Republican President Abraham Lincoln. It holds that when there is a compelling national need and Congress fails to address it, the President of the United States has an obligation to act unless he or she is specifically prohibited by the Constitution or by law. The stewardship approach is justified today because Congress is acting contrary to the will of the American people on one of the most consequential and time-sensitive challenges in history. In a survey last October, the Yale Center for Climate Change Communication found that more than 70% of the American people say it is important to reach an agreement in Paris, including nearly two of every three Republicans. In addition, 64% of the survey's respondents said the United States should be doing more or much more to address global warming. Why: In reality, an agreement with legal force does not have much legal force because there are no hard sanctions for failing to carry out its obligations. There is no international climate court that can penalize a noncompliant nation. In this case, however, the symbolism of a strong agreement is important. It would give each nation greater confidence that the others will keep their promises. Ironically, it is Congress itself that has made a binding U.S. commitment necessary. Because of Senate opposition during the Clinton Administration, the U.S. became an international outlier by refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol. Republican leaders in the current Congress want to make sure that remains the case. They undertook a campaign earlier this year to persuade other countries that a climate commitment by President Obama cannot be trusted since the next president and Congress can undo it. An agreement with legal force is more likely to reassure other nations that the world's second largest source of greenhouse pollution will stand by its commitments.This is necessary in part because unlike the No. 1 and No. 3 largest emitters, China and the European Union respectively, the United States does not have a domestic requirement for economy-wide greenhouse gas reductions. The EU's commitment to cut its emissions 40% by 2030 is codified in a binding target approved by its leaders. China's commitment has its roots in its 12th five-year plan instituted by its command-and-control government. In our current political environment, a binding Paris deal is as close as we will come to a national commitment that is more concrete than aspirational goals.This makes a difference to the entire global effort against climate change because like it or not, the rest of the world looks to the U.S. for leadership. As the Council on Foreign Relations notes, ""The perceived lack of leadership by central players in the climate change debate - especially the United States - has elicited increasing concern about the long term prospects of the global climate change regime."" A binding international agreement also is critical for triggering the level of private investment necessary to meet the world's energy needs with clean resources like solar and wind power. The International Energy Agency, among others, estimates we will need a global investment of $1 trillion every year. That level of investment is not likely without a reliable commitment by the world's governments to mitigate climate change. Six of America's largest financial institutions recently issued a joint statement that underscored the importance of a strong Paris agreement. ""Expanded deployment of capital,"" they wrote, ""is critical, and clear, stable and long-term policy frameworks are needed to accelerate and further scale investments."" The Key: To avoid a losing battle in Congress, the U.S. commitment in Paris must be designed carefully so that it does not require new legislation. An analysis by Climate Action Tracker shows that the United States can achieve President Obama's goal (a 26% to 28% reduction in greenhouse gas pollution by 2025) by fully implementing his climate action plan. Nearly all of its elements are being done with the Executive Branch's existing authorities. The trickiest challenge in a legally binding agreement would be how to deal with financial commitments. Several are in play, including contributions to the UN's Green Climate Fund and compensation to developing nations that are already suffering significant climate-related damages. Any financial commitments that require new money should be shown as contingent upon appropriations. The Legacy: To his credit, President Obama and his team already have done more to confront climate change than any previous administration. His finest moment and crowning achievement should be his strong leadership on a climate deal with legal force. If he allows the flat earthers in Congress to tie his hands - if he chooses to avoid a battle at home by offering the world nothing more than a handshake -- his most important legacy will end not with a bang but a whimper."

This article is about finding the best sequence of steps in the process.The Importance of Equity In the Existing House: Whatever the reason for the planned exchange of houses, the amount of equity the owner has in the existing house is often critical. It may determine whether or not the exchange of houses is feasible, and if it is feasible, on the best way to sequence the two transactions. The equity available in existing houses for use in purchasing other houses peaked in mid-2006 with the onset of the financial crisis, dropped sharply over the next 6 years, and has since come back but not entirely. Data from CoreLogic indicate that about 10% of all mortgaged homes still have loan balances in excess of property value. This widely cited statistics on underwater loans actually understates the drag of inadequate equity on sale/purchase transactions because of the high cost of selling a home. More relevant is what might be termed ""useable equity"", which is the property value less the existing loan balance, and less the sales commission, transfer taxes and any other transaction costs. Minimizing Inconvenience Means Buying First: The least burdensome way to make the switch is to retain access to your existing home until such time as you move into the new one. If you vacate your existing home first, you have to find a place to live while you wait, and a place to store furniture and other effects. This can be a hassle. Whether or not you can successfully buy before you sell depends in good part on your financial situation.Enough Income and Cash: In the most favorable situation, you have enough income to carry two mortgages; and enough cash to meet the cash required to purchase the new house without having to use any of the equity you have in the old one. You would contract to buy your new house first, and arrange for the mortgage you need to effect the purchase. You then put your old house on the market, setting a closing date beyond the closing on the new house. That way, you can stay in your old house until you are ready to move into the new one.Enough Income, But Not Enough Cash: In a less favorable situation, you have enough income to carry two mortgages, but not enough cash to close on the new one. You need to cash-out some of the equity in your existing house.The simplest way to get it without selling your existing house is to take out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) on that house. Then, you have the same flexibility as in the first case. You can take whatever time you need to find the house you want to buy, following which you sell the old house and pay off both mortgages. Two articles on my website will tell you want you need to know about HELOCs: What Is a HELOC? and How Do You Shop For a HELOC?Warning! Take out the HELOC well in advance of your purchase, leaving all or most of the line unused until you need it, and before you put your existing house on the market. Lenders don't appreciate HELOC customers that pay off fully within a short period.An alternative to the HELOC, which is simpler and cheaper, is a short-term loan from a bank, called a ""bridge loan"", but it requires that you have an unconditional contract of sale on your existing home. The loan bridges the period between the closing on your new house purchase, and the closing on your existing home sale; it is repaid when you sell. The lender's requirements for a bridge loan are much the same as those imposed by the mortgage lender who finances the home purchase, as described below. Not Enough Income or Cash: In the least favorable case, you don't have enough income to carry two mortgages, or enough cash without the equity in your current house. This means that you must sell before you can buy, and the new lender will want conclusive evidence that this will happen before processing your application.The lender will want to see an unconditional contract of sale that has no escape clauses for the buyer, such as a mortgage contingency clause. Many lenders will also require a significant non-refundable deposit by the buyer. And the sale must be a done deal before the new mortgage will be closed. In this situation, the only way to avoid having no house in which to sleep is to close both transactions on the same day, with the sale transaction occurring first. That may or may not be feasible.For more information and unbiased advice on forward and reverse mortgages please visit my website The Mortgage Professor."

And one great refuge is the Hotel Casa del Mar in Santa Monica. Perfectly located before the sea just steps from the ocean, the hotel was first built in 1926 as a glamorous beach club. At the time, the $2 million price tag was shocking. But the pull-out-all-the-stops Italian Revival-Style club contained hand-painted ceilings, brass fixtures, Oriental rugs -- all the trimmings to make a very swanky place. After changing hands several times, the beachfront hotel underwent a colossal renovation and was restored to its original glory. The 129 guest rooms and suites now feel elegant, beachy and chic. Imagine a soothing blue and cream palate, ivory sateen drapes, crisp white linens and high ceilings. Many of the rooms have panoramic views of the Pacific coastline from Palos Verdes to Malibu. The decadent walnut four-poster beds and chenille throws add to the luxury. Not to be missed are the hotel's restaurants, Catch and Terrazza which face the sea. With dramatic floor-to-ceiling windows they are ideal for watching the sunset. In fact, noted designer Michael Smith, who worked with the Obamas to redecorate the Oval Office and their private quarters lent his magic to Terrazza and the Casa del Mar lobby. The Italian-inspired Terrazza is adorned with sage green and aqua tiles imported from Europe, rattan ceiling fans, fetching glass sconces, wicker chairs, turquoise printed cushions and hand-carved wood tables. And the lobby, which offers cozy indoor cabanas, is for lingering. While Terrazza serves scrumptious dishes made for sharing like pizzas, housemate pastas, charcuterie and hearty salads with ingredients sourced from local farmers, Catch is a modern American seafood restaurant.

A watch tower is seen in the currently closed Camp X-Ray which was the first detention facility to hold 'enemy combatants' at the U.S. Naval Station on June 27, 2013 in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, houses the American detention center for 'enemy combatants'. President Barack Obama has recently spoken again about closing the prison which has been used to hold prisoners from the invasion of Afghanistan and the war on terror since early 2002. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb923b53c000032000e0f40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Within the past month, we have seen the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, claim responsibility for blowing up a Soviet airliner in Egypt; killing 40+ people in Lebanon; and triggering the deadly attacks and killings in Paris, where at least 130 people died and 200 were injured. We have seen the threat of additional attacks cause the cancellation of a soccer match in Germany and, even more drastically, put Brussels on a three-day security lockdown. The U.S. Government recently issued a security alert amid increasing fears that ISIS will initiate a terrorist act here at home, in America. If ISIS does attack in the U.S., it is likely that we will capture some of the alleged assailants and their conspirators either here or in other countries. What will we do with them? Will we prosecute them as criminals, as we should? Or will we call them ""enemy combatants,"" and repeat what we did after the attacks on September 11, 2001 by imprisoning them in the detention center in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba?President Obama has said that he will not send any more people to Guantanamo. However, because of current events, would his position still hold? Might public opinion pressure him to act? And how will the new president react when he or she assumes office less than 14 months from now?Over the past seven years, the Witness to Guantanamo project (WtG) has filmed in-depth interviews with 136 people who have lived or worked in Guantanamo, including 50 former detainees. We have been to 20 countries. What we heard from people on both sides of the wire and across the political spectrum was that Guantanamo was a mistake. Guantanamo made things worse. These are five of the consequences of Guantanamo that we heard: 1. America's reputation at home and abroad has gravely suffered. Guantanamo has harmed our relationship with other countries. Our image as the beacon of human rights has faltered. As long as Guantanamo exists, we do not hold the moral high ground. As several government and military officials have said, Guantanamo is a black stain on America, and it must be removed. 2. To the extent we intended to treat the detainees justly and provide them rights under the rule of law, we failed. By circumventing the Geneva Conventions and the American Constitution in Guantanamo, we did not live up to our own rules and principles. Guantanamo was a place where the military and American officials could, and did, disregard the rule of law with impunity. Many of the detainees were held for years without charges, some over a decade. And, many were held, and are still being held, for years after being ""cleared for release.""3. Because the U.S. military focused solely on gathering intelligence to avert another attack, it did not concern itself with whether the evidence it collected was admissible in a court of law. Consequently, the military's harsh interrogation treatment hampered law enforcement's ""rapport-based"" interrogation policy to gather admissible evidence for prosecution of terrorists. 4. Guantanamo has adversely impacted U.S. security. It has become a flashpoint for radical Islam, and an ideal recruitment tool for terrorists. Not only have interviewees told us this, but other high-ranking government and international officials have made similar statements. 5. Noncombatant personnel who worked with detainees and participated in or observed mistreatment suffered PTSD as a result of their work in Guantanamo. That is, some of our very own military personnel suffered tremendously having to participate in the brutal, harsh and unlawful environment of Guantanamo.Many of the interviewees stressed that there is a need for principled policies that consider the long-term impact when it comes to capturing and detaining alleged terrorists and their conspirators. Guantanamo was not a considered and principled decision.As we face a terrorist threat from a new source, now is the time for the American people to remind both President Obama and all the candidates for the next election to reject Guantanamo as an answer. The politicians must not revert to a process that went terribly wrong by again sending terrorists and alleged terrorists to Guantanamo. Guantanamo has been a costly mistake that created more problems than it solved. We must not repeat it!

They have looked like a high-powered offense at times, especially when they put up 33 on their rival Cowboys, but have also looked eminently beatable, as Matthew Stafford threw for five TDs on Thanksgiving, one week after Jameis Winston did the same.With that, coach Chip Kelly has come under fire, with some saying he may be gone after the season is over. After back to back 10-6 seasons, the Eagles are 4-7 without showing much sign of improvement.The problem is Chip Kelly. He is his own worst enemy.Oh, there is no doubt he deserved his shot as an NFL coach. His success at Oregon was immense, and he was so well-respected that Bill Belichick and Pete Carroll had him consult with their football teams. His fast paced offense took the NCAA by storm, and became an instant success in the NFL.But, the Eagles did more than make him the head coach. They gave him full control over the 53 man roster, and that is when Chip Kelly got too creative for his own good. We talk a lot about offensive coordinators, which Chip Kelly once was, being too creative, or too ""cute"" with their playcalling. When a general manager gets that way, it can be devastating to a football team.Take the running back situation. Out goes LeSean McCoy and in come DeMarco Murray. On it's face, why not? Murray was the leading NFL rusher last season. But McCoy played well in the Chip Kelly system. He put up 1,600 yards in 2013, and 1,300 yards in 2014, adding 52 receptions over the two seasons. McCoy was the type of back Kelly needed. He is a scat back that could make a lot of plays with quick feet and speed. That is not the type of player DeMarco Murray is. All of his success in Dallas came from setting up seven yards behind the quarterback, and reading the blocking. The numbers were great, but that doesn't mean the player is a great fit.Players on a real NFL team cannot be shifted around like a fantasy roster.He also moved on from DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin. Granted, Jackson has been injured for much of 2015, but he and Maclin marked a deep threat that has not been replaced by Kelly. He needs fast weapons on the outside to keep his team moving, and keep the defense tired. They don't have that anymore, and that is Kelly's fault.Even changing the quarterback made very little sense. Nick Foles had a great year his first season under Kelly, throwing for 27 touchdowns versus only two interceptions. Last year, his ratio fell to 13:10, but he was still a winner, winning six out of eight starts. The exchange brings in Sam Bradford who has potential, but has trouble staying on the field due to injuries.Sometimes you have to leave well enough alone. Running an NFL team like a fantasy team simply doesn't work.Chip Kelly does not need to be removed as the head coach of the Eagles. His system has worked. When other well-respected coaches come to Chip Kelly to teach them, you know he has something inside him that is special. But being your own GM doesn't work anymore. It worked for guys like Bill Walsh and Bill Parcells because the game was different then. You didn't have the same team dynamics then that you do now.Chip Kelly needs a general manager to help put his team together. Without one, Chip Kelly is a victim of his own creativity. He is his own worst enemy."

The solution could be so simple that it almost seems stupid. The idea is biennial budgeting: Instead of trying to agree on a budget every year, Congress would pass a budget every two years.""We spend all of our summers doing nothing but appropriations bills,"" biennial budgeting proponent Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wis.) told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost politics podcast. ""What this would do is, you'd get your budget appropriations bills done in year one,"" Ribble said. ""And in year two you're able to actually do those committee hearings whereby you can actually do true oversight on how the agencies are managing the money you've appropriated to them."" Ribble's bill to change the budgeting process already has 229 co-sponsors in the House, and the Wisconsin lawmaker says it has majority support in the Senate. The Obama administration's Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, has also said he likes the idea. Critics of the concept say it would hamper lawmakers' ability to respond to changing economic conditions and would reduce oversight of federal spending.It just so happens Congress has been operating under two-year budgets since 2013, though the agreements have been hashed out behind closed doors with looming deadlines, rather than in the openness of a formal process. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) supported biennial budget reform as chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2014, but his office deferred to the current chairman when asked if biennial budgeting could get a look this year. Current Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-Ga.) said at a hearing earlier this month that Congress should be careful about upending its regular order (aspirational as that order may be). ""Were we to shift to biennial budgeting, it would fundamentally change how Congress operates,"" Price said.

It covers an area of about 120,000 square miles -- 60 times that of Hawaii's Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on Earth.“This volcano is a beast,” Jörg Geldmacher, a marine geophysicist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel in Germany, told Scientific American.While not particularly tall -- about 2.5 miles from base to summit -- Tamu Massif is enormously wide, with very gradual slopes. ""If you were standing on this thing, you would have a difficult time telling which way was downhill,"" Sager told Scientific American.In an effort to better understand how the mysterious volcano formed, Sager and his team set out on a 36-day expedition in early October to collect magnetic data, mapping nearly 400,000 square miles of the ocean floor. As National Geographic reports, magnetic field research suggests the mountain formed relatively quickly around 145 million years ago, when lava began flowing onto the sea floor from mid-ocean ridges. The central part of the peak, however, is like a big magnetic blob, suggesting a large eruption may have been involved in its formation.Ultimately, Sager said, studying Tamu Massif will help geologists better understand how the Earth's interior works.""The secrets revealed will be ongoing but worth the wait as we begin to understand how such a massive volcano can form the way it did and what it means to us in respect to the formation of the planet we call home,"" Suraida Nanez James at the Schmidt Ocean Institute wrote in an expedition update on Nov. 2.While Tamu Massif has earned the title of most massive volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Kea is considered both the tallest volcano and the tallest mountain. With a base about 19,685 feet below sea level and a summit about 13,796 feet above sea level, Mauna Kea is over 33,000 feet tall -- in other words, about six and a quarter miles. Ojos del Salado, a stratovolcano on the border of Chile and Argentina, has a summit that stands 22,615 feet above sea level -- the highest summit elevation of any volcano on Earth.Also on HuffPost:"

16,BUSINESS,The Walmart Black Friday Protest Ain't What It Used To Be,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/walmart-black-friday-protests_us_5658a6abe4b072e9d1c1ef6a,A labor union schism has given Walmart a lot less to worry about on the big day.,2015-11-27,Last year's Black Friday protests against the enormous retailer were much more dramatic.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5658a7b01700004b00e1aa0a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- On the morning of Black Friday, a D.C. cop stood along the brick facade of a downtown Walmart and pulled leisurely on a cigarette. There was an anti-Walmart protest happening on the sidewalk in front of him, but he didn't have much work to do in the way of crowd control.""Last year it was a lot bigger,"" the cop said of the demonstration. ""And a lot more aggressive.""Indeed, last year, well over 100 protesters blocked traffic at the same street corner and had to be dispersed by police; workers and activists entered the store and sat in the aisles in silent protest. But this Friday, just a few dozen stood at Walmart's doors, chanting slogans about living wages and handing out flyers to customers leaving with bags of groceries. A store manager politely asked demonstrators to keep the doors clear.The more subdued D.C. protest this year reflects changes at Walmart's longtime labor foe, the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Four years ago, the union launched OUR Walmart, a worker group agitating for higher pay and better working conditions at the world's largest retailer. The group went on to stage high-profile worker strikes that embarrassed Walmart and drew national headlines, creating a framework for the fast-food strikes that have fueled the minimum wage debate. But the Walmart campaign started by UFCW has essentially split, with workers caught in the middle. The UFCW has scaled back its aggressive and expensive organizing at Walmart, instead turning its resources more toward advertising and public relations campaigns that call out problems with the retailer. In the runup to Black Friday, the union aired television ads and hosted food drives for Walmart employees in need. Meanwhile, a contingent of OUR Walmart has left, taking the name with it, as it seeks new funding. Operating independently, the group hosted protests in D.C., New York, Chicago and other cities on Friday. Workers affiliated with the group also took part in a 15-day fast leading up to the protests.That means the D.C. protest happened without the formal backing of organized labor, and it showed. Fewer union members and activists showed up. And unlike in years past, there were no Walmart workers who had notified their employer they were on strike for the day. The sight of workers declaring a one-day walkout -- even if it was just one or a handful of them -- had lent the early Walmart protests much of their emotional power. Only one Walmart employee spoke to the crowd -- Cindy Murray, a founding member of OUR Walmart, who was calling for $15 per hour and full-time hours for those who want them. Murray told The Huffington Post that she was grateful for the support from UFCW in the past, and said she was confident OUR Walmart would forge ahead independently and make gains for Walmart workers. ""We can't stop now. It's not time to stop,"" said Murray, a 16-year Walmart veteran and resident of Hyattsville, Maryland, who works at a different store in suburban Washington. ""We're hoping they [UFCW] stand with us in the future, and we'll stand with them. Whatever they need, we'll be there.""Although UFCW played no role in Friday's protest, HuffPost encountered several former UFCW employees there, a sign of how dear the Walmart campaign is to those who worked on it. And there were other workers and organizers from like-minded campaigns, such as ROC United, a worker center seeking to raise the tipped minimum wage for restaurant servers.""We're out in solidarity,"" said Gaby Madriz, who directs the D.C. campaign of ROC United. ""It's the same fight, just different sectors. It's not possible to live off the current minimum wage in D.C.""Although Walmart dismissed the protests as union-orchestrated stunts, the OUR Walmart strikes of recent years clearly rattled the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retail giant. As recently chronicled in BusinessWeek, Walmart launched a counter-PR campaign aimed at minimizing the reputational damage of the protests. It even hired Lockheed Martin to keep tabs on activists. But without the UFCW pouring money into strikes and protests going forward, Walmart would appear to have much less to worry about on Black Friday.That doesn't mean Walmart's communications team wasn't on the ground in D.C. on Friday. HuffPost was handed a statement from company spokesman Brian Nick, who said the company was ""proud of the wages and benefits package we offer,"" including a matching 401(K) and quarterly cash bonuses. The company said D.C. employees earn $12.92 on average. A company spokeswoman offered HuffPost the opportunity to speak with one of the employees on duty in the store, though she insisted she be able to sit in on the interview. The employee, Tracy Lewis, said there was a lot to like about Walmart, particularly the flexible hours. The schedule allows her to take classes online and work full-time, often with overtime, she said. She declined to say how much she's paid, but she said she feels she's compensated fairly.""They opened a lot of doors and created a lot of jobs in D.C.,"" said Lewis, a 51-year-old Northeast D.C. resident.As Lewis took her break, the protest outside was winding down. Less than an hour after it began, most of the D.C. cops had driven away on their motorcycles or in their cruisers, leaving behind just a police van. Officers did not appear to have made any arrests."
17,SCIENCE,Get The Thrill Of A Safari Without Ever Leaving Home,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-africa-safari-thrill-from-home_us_5656eb0be4b08e945feb1b6a,"Twice a day, viewers can travel live to the bush from the comfort of their living room.",2015-11-27,"A WildEarth guide and cameraman film Karula, a female leopard, in the Djuma Game Reserve near Kruger National Park.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5656fccc2100004a005abb67.jpeg?cache=IKrKymgbjy&ops=crop_32_16_4469_2740%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 8,000 miles from New York City, a team of a few dozen goes on safari every day, films everything they encounter and broadcasts the results live on the internet. The three-hour show starts at 5 a.m. local time near South Africa's Kruger National Park -- 10 p.m. eastern -- and is repeated again in the afternoon.One morning, viewers may spot a leopard sleeping in a marula tree, paws dangling over either side of a branch. A few minutes later, that same leopard may chow on an early breakfast, gulping down the ribcage of an impala she hoisted up to keep away from hyenas.For the evening drive, that leopard may be gone, replaced by a herd of elephants, a termite mound or a southern masked weaver building its nest. Whatever the team at WildEarth stumble on that day, viewers see in realtime alongside commentary from experienced safari guides.The team, led by married couple Graham and Emily Wallington, has filmed from the Djuma Game Reserve, about 300 miles northeast of Johannesburg, for years. The reserve shares a border with Kruger -- South Africa's most famous national park -- and nearly all of the animals associated with a safari are there, including the Big Five.The plan to broadcast live content began with a camera screwed into a tree above a watering hole in 1998 that would take a still image every 30 seconds or so. That camera, now in full video, still operates nearly two decades later -- albeit in a different tree after one was downed by a storm, another an elephant. The first live safari was broadcast in 2007 and has been running ever since.Two guides venture out twice daily in Land Rovers outfitted with a camera rig on the back. Another is out often on foot for a bush walk. Antennas strapped to the back of the vehicles (or a cameraman, if it's a walk) transmit the signal back to a control room on site or in Johannesburg, where it's fed directly online with no more than a few seconds' delay.About a thousand viewers are tuned in at any time -- many diehard fans watch daily -- and anyone can ask questions via Twitter in real time. How many spots does a leopard have? Do elephants get wrinklier over time? Tweet the control room and within minutes the guides will turn towards the camera and answer for you, using years of guiding experience, to explain that those spots are actually rosettes and that it depends on the cat.As with any live broadcast things can go wrong -- and they do. If it's cloudy, the antennas may not be able to broadcast their signal and the feed will cut out. Microphones can stop transmitting and if it rains too strongly (which it seldom does as South Africa's in a hardcore drought), no safari.

18,SCIENCE,Get The Thrill Of A Safari Without Ever Leaving Home,Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-africa-safari-thrill-from-home_us_5656eb0be4b08e945feb1b6a,"Twice a day, viewers can travel live to the bush from the comfort of their living room.",2015-11-27,"Karula enjoys the remains of an impala, which she hoisted up into a tree.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565706ff1b0000810029ea98.jpeg?ops=crop_33_1487_3046_2330%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"More than 8,000 miles from New York City, a team of a few dozen goes on safari every day, films everything they encounter and broadcasts the results live on the internet. The three-hour show starts at 5 a.m. local time near South Africa's Kruger National Park -- 10 p.m. eastern -- and is repeated again in the afternoon.One morning, viewers may spot a leopard sleeping in a marula tree, paws dangling over either side of a branch. A few minutes later, that same leopard may chow on an early breakfast, gulping down the ribcage of an impala she hoisted up to keep away from hyenas.For the evening drive, that leopard may be gone, replaced by a herd of elephants, a termite mound or a southern masked weaver building its nest. Whatever the team at WildEarth stumble on that day, viewers see in realtime alongside commentary from experienced safari guides.The team, led by married couple Graham and Emily Wallington, has filmed from the Djuma Game Reserve, about 300 miles northeast of Johannesburg, for years. The reserve shares a border with Kruger -- South Africa's most famous national park -- and nearly all of the animals associated with a safari are there, including the Big Five.The plan to broadcast live content began with a camera screwed into a tree above a watering hole in 1998 that would take a still image every 30 seconds or so. That camera, now in full video, still operates nearly two decades later -- albeit in a different tree after one was downed by a storm, another an elephant. The first live safari was broadcast in 2007 and has been running ever since.Two guides venture out twice daily in Land Rovers outfitted with a camera rig on the back. Another is out often on foot for a bush walk. Antennas strapped to the back of the vehicles (or a cameraman, if it's a walk) transmit the signal back to a control room on site or in Johannesburg, where it's fed directly online with no more than a few seconds' delay.About a thousand viewers are tuned in at any time -- many diehard fans watch daily -- and anyone can ask questions via Twitter in real time. How many spots does a leopard have? Do elephants get wrinklier over time? Tweet the control room and within minutes the guides will turn towards the camera and answer for you, using years of guiding experience, to explain that those spots are actually rosettes and that it depends on the cat.As with any live broadcast things can go wrong -- and they do. If it's cloudy, the antennas may not be able to broadcast their signal and the feed will cut out. Microphones can stop transmitting and if it rains too strongly (which it seldom does as South Africa's in a hardcore drought), no safari. But the team expertly navigates many of these issues on the fly, and a guide on a bush walk can chat entertainingly for an hour about the different moths they stumble across should a vehicle get a thorn in a tire.All of this prep culminates the day after Thanksgiving, when WildEarth broadcasts its video feed directly to American homes on Nat Geo WILD, the exclusively animal cable affiliate of the magazine.

Reuters had previously reported the planned attack. The witness statement also described how Abaaoud had boasted about slipping into Europe with refugees fleeing Syria's civil war and then spending two months in France undetected prior to the Nov. 13 attacks.""France - zero,"" it quoted him as saying.On Friday, the Paris prosecutor's office said it would open a preliminary investigation into how the confidential police witness statement was leaked to the press.($1 = 0.9453 euros) (Reporting By Chine Labbé and John Irish; Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing by Andrew Heavens)"
