Currently, you can see Max as Bradley Cooper's son in American Sniper by Clint Eastwood. Photo By Lesley Bryce.Max Charles has a resume longer than his arm. This confident young man is not only adorable, but a pleasure to interview!Let's see - Max is in the recently released feature film American Sniper, just did an episode of the controversial TV series Constantine and oh, you may remember him as the young Peter Parker in The Amazing Spider-man movies.But wait! There's more! Read on to find out more about Max Charles!Tell us about Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas. What was your audition like?It was a fun movie to do, because I got to sing and that was cool. It was my first musical, and I really liked doing this so I hope I get to do another one. I also got to see how stop motion animation works and visit the studio. I was offered this role, so there wasn't an audition for me on this one.Who helps you decide which roles to audition for?I have an awesome team. We all talk about what projects are the best for me to work on for my career and which ones to pass on.You've done an episode of the TV series Constantine which has gained a lot of criticism for the main character not being true to the comic book character. Do things like this make you wonder if other super hero characters that we see on TV and film today are not like they were written in the comics? Who is your favorite super hero? My favorite super hero has always been Spiderman. I even dressed up as him for Halloween when I was three years old, so it was really cool to play young Spiderman. I like the super hero comic books and I like to see what the actors do creatively with the characters and how they bring these superheroes to life in the movies.When you went up for the role in The Amazing Spider-man 2, did you KNOW it was for the Spider-man movie or was the casting call very vague?When I first auditioned for The Amazing Spider-man, I didn't know that it was to play young Peter Parker or that it was for the movie The Amazing Spider-man the first couple of auditions. Then I found out what movie it was when I was going back for producers' sessions. Then I had a couple of meetings with Marc Webb and Avi Arad before I got the call that I got the role. I was also pretty excited, when I found out I was coming back for The Amazing Spider-man 2!Describe your audition for Spider-man.The first couple of auditions were with the casting director then I had a couple of callbacks with producers. Then I had a couple of meetings with Marc Webb and Avi Arad, before I was offered the role. I had to learn sides [pieces of script] for each audition, and then I met with Marc Webb a couple of times and he directed me to see how we worked together. Marc was awesome to work with and he's an amazing director. It was cool to work on this huge project as my first feature film. It was pretty cool to be the first person to ever play young Spider-man too.How does your schooling work?I'm in 5th grade, and I have a set teacher when I'm working on projects so I never really miss school. My favorite subject is math. When I finish my school work for the day I like to go play basketball, ride my bike or skateboard, play video games or go free running.How and when did you get started in show business?We were living in Tennessee and my brother Logan was starting to pursue his singing career. A producer saw his website and called him out to come do an audition in California when I was six years old. Me, my mom and my brother came out to California together and he did the audition then started doing more. I would always listen through the door at his auditions and beg my mom to let me do some auditions too. Amazing Spider-man was my first feature film audition so it was cool to book that. I also booked my first TV role and commercial then and that was True Blood and Mercedes Benz commercial. Besides acting, what activities do you enjoy?Besides acting I like free running, skate boarding, biking, basketball and I like to play Xbox One. My favorite games on Xbox are racing games mostly. I actually have a really cool skateboard that looks just like Peter Parker's because my brother Mason made it for me for my birthday two years ago.You play Bradley Cooper's son in American Sniper which came out December 2014. What did you do for the holidays?It was great to work with Bradley Cooper and Clint Eastwood on American Sniper and I'm excited for everyone to see this movie.I'll be home for a couple of weeks at Christmas and we'll just be hanging out with family and friends. We always go cut down our Christmas tree and we have a big turkey dinner, like we do at Thanksgiving.When did you join SAG-AFTRA?I think I joined SAG-AFTRA when I was six years old. I don't recall having any direct contact with any union representative on set, but I know we worked under their guidelines.You did the voice of Sherman in the 2014 film Mr. Peabody & Sherman. How do voice overs work? Did you ever see the original cartoons?After I booked the role of Sherman I watched some old episodes from the original series. It was cool to see the old Sherman. I worked in a studio at Dream Works in Los Angeles for this project and recorded for about 2-1/2 years. Most of the time in a voice over you record by yourself with just the director. Rob Minkoff was fun to work with and an amazing director. I got to do one recording session with Ty Burrell and that was the first time I met him. It was really fun because our first scene was the one where we had to yell at each other. When we were done with the scene, we said ""Hey, nice to meet you,"" and we just started laughing.Now that the world knows who you are, do you have any fear about being safe?I have an incredible support network, who always watch out for me and protect me.Are your friends supportive of your decision to be an actor?Everyone has been really supportive about my career so far. When I'm with friends, we just do normal kid things like video games or shoot hoops.Do you travel a lot for work? Where is your home base?I travel a lot to work on different projects, and my mom always comes with me. I was born in Dayton, Ohio and we live in Los Angeles, but it's fun to visit different places and meet new people.Any advice for actors your age?I would tell people my age to believe in your dreams and never give up!"

The U.S. and five other nations trying to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran are turning away from attempting to reach an agreement by deadline and have started internal discussions on extending the talks, diplomats said Sunday. (AP Photo/Ronald Zak, pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc143342400003300e480ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARIS -- The nuclear deadlock between Iran and the U.S., from the Iranian side, is a result of multiple deadlocks in which the regime has trapped itself. One is the consumerist nature of the Iranian economy, which is based on exporting Iran's natural resources and importing goods. This trap is not only destroying the productive sector of the economy, but also providing a golden opportunity for the military-financial mafia to siphon off most of the petrodollars that are earned by selling oil and gas through rent-seeking, which comprises a large part of the economy and places Iran as the 136th worst country for corruption. Such an opportunity is reinforced by the economic sanctions, which provide even more opportunity for corruption among the commanders of the Revolutionary Guards and their allies. This is why Poor Mohammadi, the regime's justice minister, stated that corruption and sanctions against the country act like the two blades of a pair of scissors. The nuclear deadlock is also a result of political deadlock, as various rigidities have emerged through personal relations and rivalry within the power structure of the regime. These struggles began under Khomeini but consolidated as the Revolutionary Guards became the main institution which Khamenei, the current supreme leader, relies on. Furthermore, Khamenei's physical weakness, caused by illness, has turned his office (Beit-e-Rahbari) into a place of rivalry and interference in government affairs. While many of the regime's elites have recently exaggerated Khamenei's status, (with the regime's ideologue, Mesbah Yazdi, stating that Iranians do not deserve to have such leader as him), this is only an attempt to disguise and exploit his weakening position.The third deadlock is located in the nation-state. This is because as much as the regime needs to expand its social base, it also needs to prevent the implementation of policies towards this end. For example, recognizing citizens' rights would mean that the supreme leader has to let go of the power which has been concentrated in him as a result of violating these rights. Expanding the social base of political power in Iran would undo the position of the supreme leader. This is the main reason for constant confrontation over the positions of the presidency and supreme leader, which began right after the revolution and has continued to the present day. This will not be solved unless the regime recognizes the rights of citizenship and of the people, hence abolishing the doctrine of ""velayate faqih"" (the rule of the Jurist) which has been the linchpin of the regime since Khomeini. It should be mentioned that in response to my protest against massive vote rigging during the first election of the parliament after the revolution, Khomeini told me in a private conversation that people have no vote whatsoever and that we only conduct such elections in order to close the mouths of Westerners. He openly stated this view when I used my constitutional right to call a referendum, at which point he stated: ""If everybody says yes, I say no."" Furthermore, Khomeini had openly described people as minors and orphans, and noted his position as the guardian of these minors. This notion dominates the regime's ideology to the present day.These deadlocks have led to another, at the regional level. Iran must figure out how to confront the alliances which have formed among Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt and the West while trying to continue its increasingly costly military interventions in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, no less also confronting Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The situation has gotten much worse as Saudi Arabia has systematically driven the price of oil down in order to punish Tehran and Moscow for their support of Assad's regime. This greatly benefits the Western economies but badly hurts the Russian and Iranian economies, thus reducing those regimes' ability to intervene in other countries.This situation exists despite the fact that Obama wants to bring Iran into the orbit of the U.S. in order prevent Israel and Saudi Arabia from dominating the politics of the Middle East. However, and despite the regime's clandestine collaboration with the U.S., it can't publicly ally itself with America. The reason for this can be found in the formation of the regime and the way that the ruling elites monopolized power soon after the 1979 Iranian revolution.Since the regime is largely legitimated by its opposition to the U.S., any open thawing and normalizing of relations will create an identity crisis for supporters of the regime within and outside Iran. This is why Khamenei, despite his dire need to end the sanctions and bring the nuclear issue to an end, does not want to normalize relations with the U.S. Any agreement with Iran over the nuclear issue also has to be able to resist, at least politically, a counter attack by the neo-conservatives and Israeli, Saudi Arabian and other despotic regimes in the Persian Gulf. These make it impossible for Obama to give more than he has offered in order to solve the nuclear issue. Therefore, although Khamenei has no option but to drink the poison chalice of submission, he lacks Khomeini's charisma and courage and is thus not able to do so. As a result, just on economic terms, according to the Iranian government's estimate, in the last 10 years, the damage to the country's economy has been $480 billion (a figure which is grossly underestimated) What's next?It seems that there are three ways to move forward. The first takes place within power politics, in which Iran submits to all of the U.S.'s demands over the nuclear issue and, in return, the U.S. will open up the deadlock in the region and to a large extent globally. For the regime, this would end its isolation and allow the sanctions to be lifted. The second way, which would bring fast and long lasting results, is for the regime to recognize the right of Iranian citizenship, end its policy of repression and suppression, and through this the domination of a military-financial mafia over Iran's economy. The last way is the people's way, which Iranians have taken many times before. This would mean entering the political scene by establishing a republic of citizens through a non-violent mass movement. The domestic, regional and international effects of such change cannot be overestimated."

The legislature is extending its special session after the Senate narrowly rejected a bill to cut funding for K-12 schools and Department of Economic Security social programs. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea2f626000036008141c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Public schools in Tucson, Arizona, illegally promote ethnic solidarity and the overthrow of the U.S. government by teaching Mexican history, Rage Against the Machine lyrics and an explanation of hip hop by rapper KRS-One, the outgoing head of the state Education Department said in a letter released Friday. The letter to the Tucson school district was the final act in office for John Huppenthal, a conservative former state senator who in 2010 helped pass a law later used to ban a controversial Mexican-American studies program from Tucson schools, arguing that the courses had bred resentment against whites. Huppenthal, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction since 2012, oversaw the program’s elimination. He now says “culturally relevant courses” that a federal court ordered Tucson to offer as part of an agreement to resolve a decades-long desegregation lawsuit also violate the state law. Huppenthal's letter says a U.S. history class taught from the Mexican-American perspective violates the ethnic studies law’s restrictions against advocating ethnic solidarity because it “includes substantial Mexican history.” The letter cites the course description as evidence: In this class we will study the history and culture of Chicano, Mexicano and indigenous people throughout the United States and Mexico. This class is intended to get students to become critically conscious about the society that we live in and the history that has made it what it is today.A separate course on U.S. history from the Mexican-American perspective violates the law’s ban on promoting the overthrow of the U.S. government by teaching the Rage Against the Machine song “Take the Power Back,” the letter says. Ironically, the song is an anthem to the cause of ethnic studies. The lyrics, penned by the band’s Chicano frontman Zack de la Rocha, read in part:The present curriculum I put my fist in ‘em Eurocentric, every last one of ‘em See right through the red, white and blue disguise With lecture I puncture the structure of liesArizona officials' complaints with Tucson schools over the last five years have focused on classes taught from the Mexican-American perspective. But Huppenthal’s Jan. 2 letter says a course taught from the African-American perspective also violates state law by teaching a “An Introduction to Hip Hop Presented by Master Teacher, KRS-One.” The manifesto is published on the rapper’s website. “Hip Hop is defined as the artistic response to oppression,” KRS-One's essay reads. Huppenthal says the essay violates the law's ban on courses that advocate ethnic solidarity. “I think we’re getting a really clear view into the paranoia of the leadership of this state,” Curtis Acosta, a former teacher of Tucson’s prohibited Mexican-American studies courses, told The Huffington Post.Acosta said the Huppenthal's letter recalled the way state officials dismantled the Mexican-American studies program he and his colleagues built, by emphasizing statements taken out of context rather than focusing on the way material is taught.“They pulled out these inflammatory quotes to scare people,” Acosta said. “The same thing’s happening here, where you’re seeing a picking apart of novels or books or unit plans to build a case rather than to see it in its holistic environment.” Acosta noted that in college he studied Mein Kampf  by Adolf Hitler, and The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and asked whether Arizona law leavess room for a critical reading of such texts. The Arizona Education Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The state education department demands that Tucson public schools remove the material from its curricula by March 4, or face the loss of up to 10 percent of its state funding.Tucson school administrators, however, aren’t budging. They said they'll work on a solution with Huppenthal’s replacement, Diane Douglas, a Republican who was inaugurated Monday. Tucson Superintendent H.T. Sanchez accused Huppenthal of repeatedly trying to meddle in his district’s plans to create culturally relevant courses, as mandated by court order in the segregation case. “This threatened enforcement proceeding is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent the federal court orders denying the state’s intervention,” Tucson Superintendent H.T. Sanchez said Friday in a statement. Stefanie Boe, communications director for the Tucson Unified School District, told HuffPost that for now, the classes will continue. The wrangling over Tucson’s culturally relevant courses comes as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit prepares to hear a challenge to the Arizona ethnic studies law brought by students and teachers of the prohibited classes. Tony Diaz, the host of the Latino literature radio show “Nuestra Palabra” and leader of a group formed to protest Arizona’s attacks on Mexican-American studies called “Librotraficante” -- Spanish for “book smuggler” -- called Huppenthal’s letter “mindboggling.” “It’s the epitome of petty,” Diaz told The Huffington Post. “He’s just picking on particular lesson plans and bullying teachers.” He also looked on the bright side. “I think Huppenthal’s giving us the soundtrack for revolution,” Diaz said. “We’ll be playing Rage Against the Machine on our show, along with KRS-One.”"

These Apple Pie loving and God fearing escape artists will always free themselves from their failure to prevent 9/11; despite the chains of broken lives, debt, and counterinsurgency wars that followed the terror attacks under their watch. Like a skilled illusionist, the GOP's sleight of hand will remove the colossal blunders of Bush, Cheney, Rice, and company, while at the same time placing Benghazi in your line of sight. The result is that according to Gallup, 55% of Americans believe the GOP will keep them safer from terrorism, even though bin-Laden was killed under Obama's tenure and the Twin Towers fell while George Bush was reading a children's book. I'm not the biggest Hillary Clinton fan, but fair is fair. If you blame Hillary for Benghazi, then don't forget to assign blame to Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld for 9/11. As stated in a Washington Post article titled Two Months Before 9/11, an Urgent Warning to Rice, Bush's then National Security Advisor could have done far more to protect this country from 19 hijackers:On July 10, 2001, two months before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, then-CIA Director George J. Tenet met with his counterterrorism chief, J. Cofer Black, at CIA headquarters to review the latest on Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda terrorist organization. Black laid out the case, consisting of communications intercepts and other top-secret intelligence showing the increasing likelihood that al-Qaeda would soon attack the United States. So, Condoleezza Rice was ""in a different place"" with a different set of priorities than defending our nation from al-Qaeda. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld thought the warnings were possibly a ""grand deception"" and like Rice, had different priorities before the attacks. If their names were Clinton and Kerry, or Hagel and Susan Rice, what would Rush Limbaugh have said about their failure to protect America? Moving on to more evidence in the blame game, let's look at others who ignored intelligence reports that could have saved the lives of 3,000 Americans. In a New York Times article titled The Deafness Before the Storm, the evidence shows President Bush was given ample opportunity to defend the country from al-Qaeda:On Aug. 6, 2001, President George W. Bush received a classified review of the threats posed by Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda. That morning's ""presidential daily brief"" -- the top-secret document prepared by America's intelligence agencies -- featured the now-infamous heading: ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S."" A few weeks later, on 9/11, Al Qaeda accomplished that goal.A bit too obscure of a message, you might say? Only if Sarah Palin were reading the warning, perhaps, but then again she doesn't read much. However, when an American president reads the words, ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.,"" then it's safe to say he was warned about an impending attack.  Then of course there's a Bush official who pulls zero punches when it comes to blaming the president for ""ignoring"" various warnings about impending danger. In a 2004 CNN article, Richard Clarke explains the frustration and anger associated with a president who simply wouldn't take intelligence reports seriously:""Frankly, I find it outrageous that the president is running for re-election on the grounds that he's done such great things about terrorism,"" Richard Clarke told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in an interview Sunday night. ""He ignored it. He ignored terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11. Maybe. We'll never know.""Imagine if 9/11 had taken place under President Obama. Imagine Richard Clarke saying President Obama ""ignored"" terrorism. Can you hear Ann Coulter now in your mind? Can you hear the fabricated outrage from chicken hawks like Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly? Finally, there's the transcript from Condoleezza Rice's 9/11 Commission testimony. While few have noticed the following testimony as contradictory to the facts, let's analyze her words in relation to Hillary's Clinton's involvement with Benghazi:RICE: Well, Mr. Chairman, I took an oath of office on the day that I took this job to protect and defend. And like most government officials, I take it very seriously. And so, as you might imagine, I've asked myself a thousand times what more we could have done.Rice states, ""had we thought"" attacks were imminent, they would have done everything possible to prevent the disaster. But what about Richard Clarke's stated ""outrage""? What about the memo titled ""Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.""? What about CIA Director Tenet's meetings and warnings to Rice about al-Qaeda? You'll hear Benghazi thousands of more times from now until 2016. If indeed Hillary Clinton failed to act in a responsible manner to prevent this catastrophe, then it's true, she deserves blame for the loss of American lives. However, if the standard by which Hillary Clinton is judged coincides with her involvement in Benghazi, then Jeb Bush should answer for his brother's lack of reading comprehension. The GOP should answer for its inability to protect this nation from the deadliest terror attack in American history. Bush's National Security Advisor and Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and other officials in his cabinet should also be judged by the devastation and loss of life linked to September 11, 2001. Whenever a liberal hears Benghazi, the correct rebuttal is 9/11. The conservative foreign policy séance should end once and for all, especially when 9/11 happened under their watch. From now on, Americans should judge scandal for scandal, terror attack for terror attack, and decide based on the facts who keeps this nation safer from catastrophe. I'll take Bill Clinton's sex life over Watergate, The Iran-Contra Affair, 9/11, the outing of a CIA agent, two counterinsurgency wars advocated by neoconservatives who never served in the military, a torture fiasco, the 2008 financial crisis, and an ISIS threat that should never have evolved after we brought democracy to Iraq. Hillary Clinton isn't perfect, but at least she's not George Bush and company."
