Apparently the effort wasn't enough to save either player; Barkley has since been traded to the Arizona Cardinals.USA Today blames the cut on Tebow's inconsistent performance in the preseason, despite his much-ballyhooed reworked throwing motion.The former Heisman Trophy winner and 2010 first-round draft pick last appeared on an NFL roster in 2013, when the Patriots signed, then cut him -- also in the preseason. Last year, he started working as an analyst for ESPN while continuing to train for the NFL."

Climate Change Will Make It Worse.,Peter Mellgard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/migrant-crisis-climate-change_us_55e9ed2de4b03784e275d514,"Hundreds of thousands of migrants are seeking refuge in Europe, but millions more will be displaced as the climate warms.",2015-09-05,"<p>2-year-old Aliou Seyni Diallo eats dry couscous given to him by a neighbor, after he collapsed in tears of hunger in the village of Goudoude Diobe, in the Matam region of northeastern Senegal, Tuesday, May 1, 2012.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe or dying on the way to its shores could be a harbinger of things to come, researchers and policymakers warn, because a potentially greater driver of displacement looms on the horizon: climate change.As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned at a recent State Department-led conference on climate change in the Arctic, the scenes of chaos and heartbreak in Europe will be repeated globally unless the world acts to mitigate climate change.""Wait until you see what happens when there's an absence of water, an absence of food, or one tribe fighting against another for mere survival,"" Kerry said.World leaders have long warned that natural disasters and degraded environments linked to climate change could -- indeed, have already started to -- drive people from their homes. UN High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres declared in 2009 that climate change will create millions of refugees and internally displaced populations. ""Not only states, but cultures and identities will be drowned,"" Guterres said.Displacement is already happening in some parts of the world. Almost 28 million people on average were displaced by environmental disasters every year between 2008 and 2013, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center -- roughly three times as many as were forced from their homes by conflict and violence.It's difficult to predict exactly how many more may be displaced as climate change progresses. ""When global warming takes hold there could be as many as 200 million people overtaken"" by the consequences, professor Norman Myers of Oxford University argued in a 2005 paper. For comparison’s sake, 350,000 migrants sought entry into the European Union in 2014, the International Organization for Migration estimated.Few countries or international organizations are prepared to deal with environmentally displaced people. As a 2011 report from the European Parliament's Directorate-General for Internal Policies detailed, there is no specific legal protection for ""environmentally displaced individuals"" beyond temporary measures that would prove insufficient if the environmental damage to their homeland endured. The UN has a non-binding agreement on internal displacement from 1998 that includes provisions for people fleeing natural disasters, but it is not obligatory and includes no penalties for countries that ignore it, as Roger Zetter, a professor emeritus in refugee studies at Oxford, told The Huffington Post. The portions addressing natural disasters focus on storms, not the more complex and slow-onset effects of climate change.Myers’ sensational prediction of hundreds of millions of climate change refugees has come under fire in the years since its 2005 publication. ""It’s a very contentious overestimate,"" Zetter said. ""It’s a back-of-the-envelope figure."" It’s difficult, if not impossible, to get data on the number of current migrants who left their homes primarily because of climate change. For most, environmental degradation is one factor among many, Zetter and other experts cautioned. Nevertheless, climate change-related environmental impacts will present ""very significant challenges,"" Zetter said.“What climate change and displacement do is present developmental problems for countries that are already struggling,"" he explained. ""If you’ve got to start spending more and more money on flood relief channels or earthquake-proof buildings or increasing huge water transfer programs to cope with depleting aquifers, there’s no question that it will add a huge additional financial burden and make planning and development strategies more difficult.” And for some countries, climate change poses an immediate and very real threat -- countries like the small island states threatened by rising seas. ""If there's no land, they’ll have to leave,"" Zetter said.That includes places like Kiribati, a country made up of 33 islands in the remote South Pacific. Kiribati will be among the first countries to vanish beneath the rising ocean, possibly as soon as the end of this century. But long before then, its atolls and reef islands will be uninhabitable for their 103,000 residents if a violent storm comes crashing through, or if the ocean seeps into their already inadequate supply of fresh groundwater. Half of the country's citizens live on the Tarawa Atoll, a crescent of white sand two-thirds of a mile across whose highest point is just 10 feet above the ocean.Operating on the unfortunate assumption that the sea will swallow the country, the government of Kiribati purchased 6,000 acres of land in Fiji last year, in case they need to uproot an entire people and put them somewhere else.Major storms and flooding already cause tremendous displacement -- almost 28 million per year on average, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. Many more are affected, but not necessarily displaced -- an average of 140 million people yearly, the International Panel on Climate Change reports. Scientists expect climate change to make violent storms like Typhoon Haiyan, which forced a million people to flee their homes in the Philippines in 2013, stronger and more frequent.Typhoons and monsoon floods hit people hard and fast, forcing them to literally flee for their lives. Scientists call those rapid-onset climate events. But there are also slow-onset climate events like drought, desertification and sea level rise. These slow-moving changes are ""much more difficult to relate to mobility patterns,"" Albert Kraler, a program manager for research at the International Center for Migration Policy Development in Vienna, told HuffPost. Often, environmental changes are just ""one of the factors informing people’s migration choices.""Despite the difficulty in determining exact numbers, the United Nations Environment Program concluded in a 2011 study on the Sahel, a semi-arid belt across northern Africa, that ""migration occurs when livelihoods cannot be maintained, especially when agriculture or herding is severely affected by environmental degradation or extreme events.""The changes in the Sahel are perhaps the most obvious example of slow-onset events. The UN dubbed the region ""ground zero"" for climate change ""due to its extreme climatic conditions and highly vulnerable population."" Its arid climate and infrequent rain are getting worse, and scientists blame climate change. The rain is less predictable than it used to be -- sometimes there is too much and sometimes nowhere near enough. For almost everyone in the Sahel, food has become more expensive and scarcer. As a result, 30 percent of households in Burkina Faso, in the heart of the Sahel, have relocated in the last 20 years because they could no longer survive, The Guardian reported in 2013.People have always migrated across this region. But these days, ""the traditional temporary and seasonal migration patterns of many farmers, herders and fishermen in the region are increasingly being replaced by a more permanent shift southward and to urban areas,"" UNEP reports. ""Nearly half of the West African population now lives in largely overcrowded coastal cities, including 12 townships of over one million inhabitants along the coastline from Senegal to Nigeria.""The population of the Sahel region is expected to skyrocket over the next few decades. Competition between tribes and ethnic groups, pastoralists, farmers and fishermen over ever-scarcer natural resources, which has existed for as long as people have lived there, is becoming intense. And then there's Boko Haram. Its fighters have set up camps on islands emerging out of Lake Chad, a once-majestic expanse of fresh water that in the past supported millions of people in the heart of the Sahel. But the lake has lost 90 percent of its area since the 1960s. Now, there’s a militant Muslim fundamentalist insurgency taking hold amid an ongoing environmental disaster.Climate change is also a factor in the worsening storms and environmental degradation of coastal South Asia -- factors that, when combined with mismanagement and political dysfunction, are putting millions of people at risk. Some have already started to migrate because their ways of living are becoming impossible. In the Indus delta in Pakistan, entire villages have been wiped off the map. Bangladeshis and Indians in the Sundarbans, a vast mangrove forest where the Ganges meets the sea, are heading inland, away from the rising ocean and the increasingly saline farmland.Bangladesh is expected to be the largest single source of climate refugees, with up to 30 million people at risk. Many end up in slums in cities like Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital and the world’s fastest-growing megacity. Some 70 percent of Dhaka’s slum dwellers moved there because of environmental degradation, according to the International Organization for Migration.Migrants and refugees across the world, driven by rapid-onset natural disasters or by a complex combination of the more slow-moving effects of a changing climate, are already putting immense strain on the countries and cities they end up in. A lot of the time locals aren’t happy to see them, and many governments have been caught unprepared and unwilling to take them in.Already, migrants and refugees across the world are already putting immense strain on the countries and cities where they end up.In Europe, Hungary is putting up a fence to keep migrants and refugees out. ""We don't want to [live together with Muslims],” Hungary’s prime minister Victor Orban said on Thursday, ""and I think we have a right to decide that we do not want a large number of Muslim people in our country.""For the past two years, Australia has deployed its navy to force migrants and asylum-seekers away. The government allegedly bribed one captain more than $30,000 to take his boatload of migrants to Indonesia. Other migrants are being held in detention centers on tiny islands like Nauru, where, according to an Australian Senate committee report, children are sexually abused and guards offer weed in exchange for sex.As for America, when residents of Kivalina, a Native village in northwestern Alaska that is rapidly disappearing into the ocean, tried to get the government to lend a hand, the response they received was that ""there's no agency set up to address those questions.""Europe's handling of the current refugee situation doesn’t bode well for a future in which vulnerable populations fleeing the effects of climate change are again knocking at their doors. Nor does it seem likely that Western countries will embark on the expensive and challenging task of helping at-risk countries prepare, as John Kerry warned we must do. The Western world is facing a lot of tough questions, Zetter said.""We've not faced up to the challenge that we obviously are the emitters, that we are creating climate change, that we are creating this additional pressure on the developmental trajectories that many countries face,"" he said.

3,THE WORLDPOST,Why China's Economic Woes Are Causing Alarm in Africa,Charlotte Alfred,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-economic-problems-africa_us_55e76780e4b0c818f61a81ef,Will the crisis be a wake-up call for African governments to speed up reform?,2015-09-05,"<p>A mine supervisor overlooks Metorox's Chibuluma copper mine, near Kitwe, Zambia, on Feb. 7, 2008. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55eb0e2e1d0000d101146e21.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we speak with Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution.Recent economic turmoil in China -- the world's second-largest economy -- has rocked markets from the U.S. to Asia and Europe, and Africa has not been spared the upheaval.China’s plunging stock markets and surprise currency devaluation last month have increased fears that the country's rapid economic growth may be slowing down for good. Many African nations are now concerned that Chinese demand for its oil and other resources could dry up. Chinese resource extraction in Africa, while controversial, has helped fuel economic growth, job creation and investment in African infrastructure. China is the continent’s largest bilateral trading partner -- in 2013, Beijing’s trade with Africa was double that of the U.S.The Chinese crisis comes at a bad time for many of Africa’s largest economies, already contending with the collapse of oil prices over the past year. Now, experts warn that economic growth may be slowing in Africa’s biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria.Amadou Sy, director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, explained to The WorldPost why China's economic woes are causing problems in Africa, and how African nations should respond.What impact has China’s market turmoil and yuan devaluation already had on African economies?They have had two impacts. First, they have unnerved global financial markets and led to higher short-term volatility in currency, bond and stock markets as well as commodity markets. Second, and more importantly, they have led market participants to reassess the likelihood and severity of a slowdown of the Chinese economy.These impacts have had ripple effects on African economies, and in particular on countries that are most dependent on exports to China, mainly commodity-producing countries such as South Africa (gold and wine), Angola (oil) and Zambia (copper).Have they had any positive side effects?In theory, the yuan devaluation could help African countries like Ethiopia and Kenya that import Chinese goods such as heavy machinery. It could also help African retailers and consumers, as Chinese imports become cheaper. But the scale of the yuan devaluation was really not that large when compared to recent movements in other currencies. In fact, African currencies have been depreciating against the U.S. dollar for a while. For instance, the South African rand has dropped about 12 percent against the U.S. dollar this year.To me, the major positive side effect is that questions about a Chinese slowdown should push African governments to realize that they need to speed up the implementation of the continent’s agenda of economic transformation, and make their economies more resilient to external shocks. It is like an alarm bell ringing and telling us that the window of opportunity to reform our economies is shrinking.You wrote that China’s currency devaluation is not the real problem, as the much more troubling question for Africa is whether China’s economic growth is slowing down more permanently.If this is the case, how big an impact would it have on economic growth in Africa?A sharper than expected slowdown of China’s economic growth is one of the big external risks to Africa’s growth forecast. Other risks include a further decline in oil prices and a sudden deterioration in global liquidity. Earlier this year, the World Bank put 2015 growth for sub-Saharan Africa (SAA) at about 4 percent. If China’s growth falls below the 6-7 percent range, then one should expect SAA growth to go below 4 percent. The effect of the slowdown will come through fewer exports from Africa to China, but also indirectly through lower commodities prices, which in turn would affect African commodity exporters.We are working on a model to isolate the impact of external shocks to Africa’s growth, but International Monetary Fund economists Paulo Drummond and Estelle Liu, focusing on the impact of changes in China’s investment growth on sub-Saharan African exports, find that a 1 percentage point decline in China’s investment growth is associated with an average 0.6 percentage point decline in sub-Saharan Africa’s export growth.Which African countries are most vulnerable to economic slowdown in China?Countries that export the most to China -- predominantly resource-rich economies such as Zambia -- will bear the brunt of such a shock. Countries that receive a lot of direct investment from China such as Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, could also experience reduced investment flows.But ultimately, a more-severe-than-expected Chinese slowdown would be a shock to the global economy, and if the European Union is affected, that would have a negative slowdown on Africa, as the EU is SSA’s largest trading partner (China is the region's largest bilateral partner).What steps should these countries take to minimize the impact, and do you see any signs they are starting already?At the moment, African countries are trying to manage the effects of the fall in commodity prices and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar using macroeconomic policies. Governments will have to make difficult choices in the use of the policy tools at their disposal, and these choices require strong political will. These tough policies include exchange rate, fiscal and monetary policies.For instance, letting your currency depreciate can help absorb the shocks but it may make imports costlier and lead to higher inflation. However, using administrative exchange controls to prevent a depreciation may not work as they can be circumvented. Further, reducing oil subsidies and increasing the value-added tax rate can be painful measures politically, especially in an election year.At the end of the day, governments will need to take tough measures but think about alleviating the impact on the poorest segment of the population. For instance, removing oil subsidies should be done together with measures that are well-targeted to help the poor.But what I would insist on is the necessity to accelerate the pace of measures that have a long-term impact. African countries need to redouble their efforts to address the infrastructure gap, especially when it comes to the energy sector.Of course, public investment needs to be done in the most efficient manner. They need to improve productivity in the agriculture sector, which will alleviate poverty and can spur the agribusiness and manufacturing sectors. At the moment, the services sector is driving most of domestic growth, and it is not clear how sustainable this process is.All these policies need financing and domestic revenue mobilization should be the priority and countries. But for domestic revenue mobilization to work, taxpayers need to see the value of their money.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Also on HuffPost:"

Countries that receive a lot of direct investment from China such as Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, could also experience reduced investment flows.But ultimately, a more-severe-than-expected Chinese slowdown would be a shock to the global economy, and if the European Union is affected, that would have a negative slowdown on Africa, as the EU is SSA’s largest trading partner (China is the region's largest bilateral partner).What steps should these countries take to minimize the impact, and do you see any signs they are starting already?At the moment, African countries are trying to manage the effects of the fall in commodity prices and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar using macroeconomic policies. Governments will have to make difficult choices in the use of the policy tools at their disposal, and these choices require strong political will. These tough policies include exchange rate, fiscal and monetary policies.For instance, letting your currency depreciate can help absorb the shocks but it may make imports costlier and lead to higher inflation. However, using administrative exchange controls to prevent a depreciation may not work as they can be circumvented. Further, reducing oil subsidies and increasing the value-added tax rate can be painful measures politically, especially in an election year.At the end of the day, governments will need to take tough measures but think about alleviating the impact on the poorest segment of the population. For instance, removing oil subsidies should be done together with measures that are well-targeted to help the poor.But what I would insist on is the necessity to accelerate the pace of measures that have a long-term impact. African countries need to redouble their efforts to address the infrastructure gap, especially when it comes to the energy sector.Of course, public investment needs to be done in the most efficient manner. They need to improve productivity in the agriculture sector, which will alleviate poverty and can spur the agribusiness and manufacturing sectors. At the moment, the services sector is driving most of domestic growth, and it is not clear how sustainable this process is.All these policies need financing and domestic revenue mobilization should be the priority and countries. But for domestic revenue mobilization to work, taxpayers need to see the value of their money.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Also on HuffPost:"

The UAE has played a key role in a Saudi-led Arab coalition fighting the Houthis after they pushed Yemen’s President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile and took over much of the country.UAE forces assisted fighters loyal to Hadi in driving out Houthis and their allies from the southern port city of Aden, in a key victory for the coalition.In Aden, a government official said the police resumed their duties on Saturday with the help of the UAE after their work was suspended for more than five months due to the war.In Sanaa, residents said the Houthi-controlled Defence Ministry building and the command of the special security forces were among the targets hit in further strikes by Saudi-led forces overnight.The bodies of the Emirati soldiers killed in the attack on their base in Marib were taken to Abu Dhabi aboard an air force transport plane. Funerals were being held on Saturday. The UAE government has announced a three-day mourning period.Bahraini officials said the five soldiers killed in the attack were also being buried on Saturday.UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Al Arabiya that the troops were killed when a surface-to-surface missile struck a weapons storage facility at the Marib base.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have reported several deaths of soldiers in Yemen since March, but the total death toll for the coalition was not clear. ""HORRIFIC EXPLOSIONS""More than 4,000 Yemenis have died in the same period.Abu Dhabi shares Riyadh's view that the Houthis are proxies of Shi'ite power Iran, accusing it of trying to expand its influence in Arab lands in Yemen, Syria and Iraq. The Houthis, who belong to the Zaydi branch of Shi'ite Islam, deny acting on behalf of Tehran and say they revolted against corruption.Hadi loyalists, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, had been massing troops and weapons in Marib in preparation for an assault on the capital, which the Houthis seized in September last year.""The incident itself does not change the balance that is there,"" Gargash said in an interview with Al Arabiya TV. ""Marib will fall to the coalition,"" he added.Residents in Sanaa fear the coalition will step up its raids even further to retaliate for the attack.""I was close to the raid that hit the command of the special security forces, the explosions were horrific, I felt that the ground was shaking beneath me and people were running away out of fear,"" said Shawqi, a taxi driver.Also on HuffPost:"

He's traveled to more than 40 states as labor secretary and expects to hit the remaining ones in the coming months. Being a roving ambassador is typically part of a labor secretary's job, but Perez has embraced the role with particular gusto. Those around him say the Buffalo native feels unproductive if he sits still too long. Washington being a great place to feel useless these days, Perez prefers to hit the road, often fueled by Diet Coke, to meet with unions and business owners, and have one-on-one lunches with workers.

In another time, Perez's influence may have been relegated mostly to the bully pulpit, but over the past two years, the Labor Department has played an unusually central role in White House policy-making. Much of that is due to the gridlock over on Capitol Hill.With Democrats unable to accomplish much in a GOP-controlled Congress, the White House has let loose a flurry of economic policies that it can enact unilaterally. Most of those rules and regulations have gone through Perez's agency. That includes a $10.10 minimum wage for federal contractors, new labor protections for home care workers, tighter regulations on 401(k)s, and, most notably, a more generous standard for who's eligible for overtime pay under federal law. In general, the measures have driven business lobbies batty.There's plenty still to be done by his agency in order to please progressives. For instance, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which falls under the Labor Department, has proposed but not enacted a long-awaited, life-saving rule that would limit silica dust on worksites. The rule has been decades in the making, and its holdup has workplace safety advocates worried. But overall, the White House and Labor Department have become far more aggressive compared to the early days of the Obama administration.""I think for a while they fell for the bait, 'Oh, you're regulating too much,'"" Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO union federation, told HuffPost. ""Now they're starting to look at things and say, 'That needs to be done.' I wish it had happened earlier, but I'm happy that it's happening.""The overtime rule that Perez's Labor Department came up with -- in the face of heavy industry lobbying -- would extend time-and-a-half pay to millions more salaried workers when they work more than 40 hours in a week. The changes should bring those workers either more pay or a shorter workweek. Retail trade groups continue to fight it aggressively, saying it will reduce workers' flexibility.The overtime expansion is arguably the most significant economic reform undertaken by the Obama White House without congressional approval.""I don't think there's ever been a better time, in my life, to have the privilege of serving as the labor secretary,"" Perez said. ""We work on so many of the issues that people are talking about at night after the kids go to sleep.""One of the privileges Perez has not seen is presiding over an increase to the federal minimum wage, which remains $7.25 per hour and hasn't budged since 2009. The White House first called for boosting the wage floor in 2013, but Democratic proposals to do so have gone nowhere in the Republican Congress. With just a year and a half left in office, it's quite possible Obama could become the first president of either party since Ronald Reagan not to sign an increase to the minimum wage.Perez has served as the White House's top surrogate on the issue. With legislation not moving in Washington, much of his work has involved traveling to cities and states to encourage the passage of local minimum wage laws. He visited Seattle on April 1 to mark the day that city's minimum wage began its gradual climb to $15. Los Angeles and San Francisco passed similar $15 wage laws, though most other state and local laws have been far more modest.Perez said he finds the minimum wage debate in Washington ""colossally frustrating."" A strong majority of Americans, including many self-identified Republicans, favor a higher minimum wage, he noted.""What people tell me all the time is, 'I don't want to rely on food stamps to feed my family, I don't want to be on Medicaid.

""You look at South Dakota, you look at Nebraska, you look at Arkansas, Alaska -- four [red] states that had referendums, and by the way they all passed overwhelmingly. This issue should not be a partisan issue.""The same goes for paid leave, according to Perez. The idea of a mandate on large businesses to provide workers with sick days has languished in Congress. And the United States' laissez-faire attitude on parental leave is an aberration from most developed economies, Perez noted. In polls, most Americans support requirements for paid leave, a benefit from which low-wage workers are disproportionately excluded.""The thing about paid leave that is remarkable to me -- once again, only in the U.S. has paid leave become a partisan issue,"" Perez said. After his meeting with workers at the church, Perez had a one-on-one lunch with Mya Hill, who works at a Checkers and is helping lead the Fight for 15 in Detroit.

After that, it was on to a meeting with the editorial board of the Detroit News, a dinner with Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, and then a red-eye flight to Oregon, which recently passed a sick leave law.As for what may come after his stint as labor secretary, Perez declined to speculate. For now, he's too busy checking each state off his itinerary.""I see way too many people who take jobs like this and use too much time figuring out where they take it next,"" he said.

8,SCIENCE,Depression Might Literally Color The Way We See The World (UPDATE),Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/depression-color-perception-research_us_55e86ba0e4b0aec9f35657f6,It's possible that feeling sad can make the world appear more gray.,2015-09-05,Researchers have found that depression may affect the visual perception of color.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e86edd1d0000d301146b60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATE: The authors of the study covered in this article voluntarily retracted their study from Psychological Science in November 2015 after noticing errors in their methodology. They told the journal they “remain confident in the proposition that sadness impairs color perception” but would conduct revised experiments to “acquire clearer evidence” supporting their conclusion.Previously:Our moods can, quite literally, color our world ― particularly in the case of depression. New research published last week in the journal Psychological Science finds that sadness can affect our vision, making the world appear more gray, by impairing the neural processes involved in color perception.As it turns out, there’s a reason we use colors as a metaphor for emotion, with expressions like “feeling blue” or having a “gray day.”“It was interesting that we have so many metaphors that link emotion and color perception,” Christopher Thorstenson, a psychology researcher at the University of Rochester and the study’s lead author, told The Huffington Post in an email. “We were curious whether there really was a link between sadness and how people see color.”To answer this question, the researchers asked 127 undergraduates to watch either a sad or funny video. Then, the students viewed 48 color swatches ― which were desaturated to the point of being almost gray ― and tried to identify them as red, yellow, green or blue. Those who had watched the sad clip were less accurate in identifying colors than the students who watched the funny clip, suggesting that they were perceiving less of the color. The findings build on previous research that investigated the link between mood and perception. Other studies found that when people have a goal to reach or an object to attain ― such as the finish line of a race ― they may perceive that object to be larger than it really is. People experiencing fear, on the other hand, may perceive certain things in their environment ― such as faces with negative expressions ― as more threatening than they actually are.This is because our emotions carry information about the value of objects, and that information is incorporated into the visual perception of our environment. The brain’s emotional and perceptual systems don’t seem to be completely distinct from one another, as was previously believed, but instead engage in a dynamic interplay. “Psychologists have tacitly viewed perception, cognition, emotion, and other basic processes as separable phenomena to be studied in isolation,” psychologists Jonathan Zadra and Gerald Clore wrote in a 2011 review of studies on emotion and perception. “Increasingly, however, we are coming to see relevant areas of the brain and the processes they support as highly interactive.”"

He had been treated in Nepal, the Daily Mirror reported, but traveled to American Samoa for an appearance. He was rushed to the hospital there after his symptoms worsened.

Dangi had managed to escape international notice for most of his life before Guinness investigated his case in 2012 and confirmed that he was 2 inches shorter than Junrey Balawing of the Philippines, who was then considered the shortest living man.Balawing, age 22, now returns to the top spot.In a statement on Thursday, Guinness World Records said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the news of Dangi's death.""GWR would like to express its sincere and heartfelt condolences to Mr. Dangi's family in this difficult time,"" the statement read. ""He will be remembered forever as an iconic and extraordinary record holder."" Last year, Dangi traveled to London, where he met with the world's tallest living man, 8-foot-3-inch Sultan Kösen of Turkey.""It's been a lifelong dream to travel and becoming a Guinness World Records title holder has enabled me to do that,"" Dangi told The Telegraph. ""I'm honoured to be in London, I've always wanted to visit and the fact I get to meet Sultan is special. It makes me extremely proud to represent Nepal all around the world. I'm extremely humbled by the support I receive.""Dangi had a condition known as primordial dwarfism, which means, unlike with many other forms of dwarfism, his bones and organs were proportionally smaller than those of an average-height person. While many primordial dwarfs suffer from health issues, Dangi was described as ""unusually fit.""Family friend Sujit Dilip, owner of India's well-known Rambo Circus, told the Daily Mirror, ""Today, our circus is flooded with tears at the loss of the world's smallest man ... whom we lovingly called Prince Chandra.""Also on HuffPost:"
13,FIFTY,A Reality Check For Donald Trump's Supporters,"Joe Seldner, ContributorJournalist/Producer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supporters_b_8055186.html,"I don't get angry about immigration, legal or otherwise, or about women in power, or about people with Asian or Spanish accents trying to make lives for themselves or their families in the United States.This is, old angry people, the future of America.

They have been enraptured as Donald Trump tells respected TV anchorman Jorge Ramos to ""go back to Univision"" and suggests that a woman who dares ask him a tough question had ""blood coming out of her wherever."" (You do have to admire Trump's ability to hold back just a little -- ""Go back to Univision"" was perilously close to ""go back to Mexico,"" though even that would not have harmed him, and would likely have caused gleeful paroxysms among his supporters.) But the bad news for this crowd: it is your last hurrah. I am old and white (well, not old, but old enough to squirm in embarrassment when Hillary Clinton, perhaps the unhippest human in public life, makes reference to Snapchat). And I get angry now and then.But I don't get angry about immigration, legal or otherwise, or about women in power, or about people with Asian or Spanish accents trying to make lives for themselves or their families in the United States.This is, old angry people, the future of America. You can rage against it and try to build fences and you may win in the very short run. But in the long run, you will lose. The numbers tell the story, and even if a fence could be built (it can't) or Donald says he can round up 11 million people and put them on buses headed south (he can't), the country is changing. Whether that is for the better or worse, it is an unstoppable development.So fight it and be seen as the xenophobes you may well be, or embrace it -- or at least accept it -- and participate in the change.The angry white man who told Jorge Ramos to ""get out of my country"" after Ramos was briefly removed from Trump's ""news conference"" didn't appear to be Native American, so one has to assume that at some point in this nation's history, someone told his great, or great-great grandparents, to get out of their country.When I look at the people in back of Trump when he takes the podium, I wonder: Is it by design that there are so few non-white folks in his audience? Would including such people send a message to Trump supporters that he doesn't want to send?Every pundit -- most of whom dismissed Trump at first -- has concluded that he has ""touched a nerve."" Maybe. But even as Trump's support hovers around 30 percent of Republicans, remember that is 30 percent of roughly 40 percent of people who describe themselves as Republican, or about 12 percent of the general population. (Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are touching that same anti-Washington nerve, but their base does in fact include a broader demographic.)But yes, he has touched that nerve and made it scream a loud, ugly scream.I don't discount the pain these mostly older and mostly white angry people feel. It is real. They do believe they are losing or have lost their country, and they do want to ""take it back"" and ""make America great again."" But take it back from whom? Who has actually ""taken"" their country?I don't doubt they are hurting. They may feel they have lost jobs or opportunities to the immigrant population, or that their children or grandchildren will. Those are hard facts to accept. But that is the new reality, and yelling at people to go back to where they came from or hatching absurd schemes to send 11 million people packing won't change that.I have two beautiful grandchildren who are half Hispanic, and if my son and his girlfriend's plans materialize, I may have half black grandchildren in the near future (or Jew-maican, as they have dubbed them).I may have lost out on jobs and opportunities to women, minorities and certainly, to younger people. But I am not angry about that. It is the history of our country that people come for a better life and face ignorant hatred along the path. I choose not to be part of that ignorance, that hatred.So enjoy your summer of Trump. Or maybe fall and winter of Trump. But it will end soon. The world and the country are changing, and no amount of anger will hold that back.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

I was told he's a ""boy"", like that was supposed to make sense. Then in college, I was repeatedly passed over for leadership positions for the ""boy"" even though my resume completely outshined any of theirs. I was told that to be happy I needed to focus on my looks and ""find a man"". Over and over I learned that being a ""girl"" was a disadvantage. I was pretty angry.Fast forward a bunch of decades and I now serve in the Missouri state legislature where women are subjected to continual sexual harassment scandals and policies pushed by the GOP designed to punish and shame women. Pay equity, reproductive justice, keeping domestic abusers from guns and our voting rights are issues we fight for every year, where it's clear that particularly in Missouri, it remains a liability to be a woman. I am still angry.I want my next President to fight for me, my daughter and my granddaughters. I want someone smart, worldly and experienced. I want someone who believes that ""Women's Rights are Human Rights"" is not ""playing the gender card"" or merely a meme. I want someone who believes at their core we must stop senseless gun violence, that automatic voter registration and a strengthened Voter Rights Act is urgently needed and the protection of a woman's access and legal right to birth control and abortion is a must. I want a President who cares and is deeply vested in the quality of women's lives. I need a President to work in tandem with me for equality and justice in my state, not flagrantly pander to the evangelicals who work against women, families and workers. If that candidate just happened to be a woman who would be the first woman in history elected to the White House ---OMG ---that would be like the best cream cheese icing on the biggest chocolate fudge cupcake ever.Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly exceedingly fits my requirements. I want and need her as my next president. There is not another candidate in the field of wanna bees who comes even close. I'm sick of those in power turning a blind eye to people barely scraping by on minimum and unequal wages and children in certain zip codes sentenced to poverty and subservient education. Hillary Clinton has long been a champion for those families and advocates paid family leave, childcare assistance and equality protections for all, regardless of sexual identity or preference. She is smarter than the entire field of candidates put together in recognizing that astronomical student debt must be addressed. I want my daughter and her friends to succeed in their fields when they finish their college paths without years and years of college loans to pay back. I want girls and boys to be able to afford their dreams and someday, their own families, regardless of their ethnicity or where they were born. So does Hillary Clinton.Economic injustice, racial inequalities, ugly attacks against immigrants and violence in our communities is real. I want Hillary Clinton as our next U. S. President to take charge with her vast experience, tenacity and lifelong commitment to these very issues. We have serious problems which require serious policy by a serious leader like herself who has been enormously respected around the world for years. And ongoing threats of nuclear and national security? Hillary Clinton has already been on the front lines of international threats as our Secretary of State. She's been there. Protected us. Faced it. Done it. But most of all, I want Hillary Clinton in the White House because after repeatedly being told most of her life what girls couldn't do, like be an astronaut (like NASA told her) or become President of the United States, she ""gets"" it. She gets the attitudes, discrimination and even the violence that many of us women experience because of our gender. Even though she herself faces continual sexist attacks and media/Congressional interrogations based on no evidence, Hillary has consistently proven her entire life that she will fight with every breath to protect the rest of us from injustice, repression and the right to choose if and when we have children.The media keeps stressing ""like-ability"". Really? We're not electing our next bestie friend but someone who knows how to run the country. I don't care what her hair looks like or what she's wearing or if she laughs too joyously. Neither should anyone else.Besides showing my granddaughters and other young girls that the world can be their oyster, the trickle down effect of gender equity will be amazing. By putting the smartest and most capable candidate in the White House who just happens to be a woman, Hillary Clinton's presidency will foster women leaders in all areas of government, business and the military where they have long been absent. It will also catch us up to those other countries who are light years ahead of us with  22 currently elected female women leaders.So, I enthusiastically endorse Hillary Clinton to be my next President. I will continue working with all my might to push those vital women voters to show up with me on Election Day 2016. If my efforts require a Wonder Woman attitude or Rosie the Riveter coveralls, I'm all in.Join me in destroying that cracked Oval Office glass ceiling for good and declare to women of all ages and the men who love them, that being the fiercest, most experienced and best resume ""girl"" officially rules."
18,WORLDPOST,The Youthful Protest Movement in Lebanon Gets International Attention,"Raghida Dergham, ContributorColumnist and Senior Diplomatic Correspondent, Al Hayat",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-youthful-protest-move_b_8092310.html,"The youthful civil movement's call for international intervention is aimed at putting international pressure on regional countries influential in Lebanon to reach accords on many levels, starting with the waste and electricity issues, and not ending with the presidential election.",2015-09-05,"Mueen Shreif, a Lebanese singer, is hoisted on the shoulders during a demonstration, organized by 'You Stink' campaign, to protest against the ongoing country's trash crisis on August 23, 2015 in the capital Beirut. Protesters headed back to central Beirut in the morning, joining those who had spent the night there in tents after evening protests spiralled into clashes with security forces. AFP PHOTO / ANWAR AMRO (Photo credit should read ANWAR AMRO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d98b9a280000d0376ff808.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The major powers' disregard for Lebanese affairs has allowed regional powers influential in Lebanon to neglect Lebanon, its state, constitution, people and independence. The youth movement that started with the slogan You Stink has sought to rouse the international community from its slumber to force the ruling political class to change, and stop ignoring the constitution and ordinary people's rights, from having a president to collecting waste.The youthful civil movement's call for international intervention is aimed at putting international pressure on regional countries influential in Lebanon to reach accords on many levels, starting with the waste and electricity issues, and not ending with the presidential election and the protection of this tiny country against being drawn into civil war, proxy wars, or spillover of battles between Hezbollah, and al-Nusra Front or ISIS from Syria. The attention thus turned immediately to the United States because it is the most able to influence the key players, Saudi Arabia and Iran, especially in this critical period.The Saudi king is preparing to visit Washington this week, which constitutes a good opportunity to tackle the Lebanese issue. Washington, in the meantime, can now influence Tehran, since Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani need Congress to approve the nuclear deal, which would lift sanctions on Iran. As deliberations are set to start in Congress soon, there is an opportunity to use US influence with the Iranian player, which in turn can influence Lebanon through its ally Hezbollah to end its obstructionist policy.The timing of the popular movement is right. However, the goals were focused only momentarily, before they scattered. The protests were also infiltrated, before the organizers regrouped, though haphazardly. This is to be expected at the start of such a movement; however it still poses a threat.The most important achievement of the movement is that it dealt a sharp blow to the political class, which had assumed its grip would dissuade anyone from daring to protest. The other key achievement is that the movement has overcome the dichotomy between the March 8 and March 14 camps, calling for accountability for corrupt leaders on both sides.Diverse, naturally beautiful, and inhabited by an educated and cultured people, Lebanon can be described as a breathtaking place. However, its huge religious and ethnic diversity means that, because minorities usually live in fear, its fate has been left in the hands of the leaders of these minorities in a country with no amajority.These political leaders decided to deal with their constituents as a flock or a tribe. The leaders have discarded citizenship-based politics and resorted to mobilizing people. Thus, a type of Lebanese emerged who are sectarian, bigoted, and dependent on such leaders, against a type seeking citizenship and equality, who have now risen up in this important protest movement.It will not suffice to call for dialogue between party leaders because the lack of confidence in them and in such dialogues has reached saturation point, as the country is being deliberately hemorrhaged. What is needed is for lawmakers to do the job they are paid to do, and elect a president. Otherwise, they are nothing more than administrators of deliberate chaos.The political class has been caught off guard by the protest movement, which is calling for this class to be abolished beyond the issues of waste and electricity. The political class assumed that the young protesters were just venting and could be safely ignored, and that there is enough infiltration of the movement to turn it into a casual act of protest.Some veteran politicians quickly resorted to sectarianism, a weapon that is always primed to shoot at any aspirations by a civil movement, even though it was the same weapon that tormented Lebanon in a sectarian war that continues to haunt the generations that experienced it. It is an effective weapon that often subdues even the smartest and bravest of the Lebanese.Certainly, the majority of party leaders have primed their supporters and their minority siege mentality to take revenge and instigate sedition. The civil youth movement that crossed sectarian boundaries rallied all rival politicians together against them, for undermining them.The You Stink street protests, disgusted by refuse and corruption, have exposed the political class and its followers, and have shed light on corruption that led to the loss of public property and services. They dared to speak in the language of citizenship and sought accountability for the rulers who have installed themselves above all and gave themselves special privileges.These youths deserve support and counsel. They have crossed the red lines of party leaders, namely, that the ""street"" belongs to them to obstruct and mobilize on a sectarian basis, and intimidate those afraid of another civil war.Mistakes are inevitable for an emerging movement that dared to ignore sectarian divisions and the division by default between March 8 and March 14. Both camps have undermined all-inclusive citizenship and institutionalized division in a populist way to serve narrow interests. In the end, both March 8 and March 14 lost support of the serious public opinion.But avoiding mistakes is necessary. One mistake could hit a sectarian chord and trigger civil strife, or reinforce vacuum that some political forces already favor. The leaders of the movement must avoid such mistakes.There is no need, for instance, for a sit-in in the Environment Ministry building to pressure the minister to resign. The organizers must be aware of the pitfalls and have political awareness. Otherwise, polarization will weaken the movement.The movement should target vacuum in institutions, not empty government institutions selectively. Indeed, this could lead to chaos in the country that would be hard to rein in.It could lead to demands for the entire government to resign, but the slogan of ""the people want the downfall of the regime"" that some protesters have chanted is both juvenile and suspicious. Calling for the ouster of the government is also politically naïve, because it serves the advocates of vacuum.The game of polarization that most Lebanese television and media outlets engaged in and their attempts to infiltrate the youth movement is an insult to the young men and women and exposes these outlets' lack of credibility. This is an assault on journalism and only serves the political class. These media outlets must know that they are not above accountability either.Linking local protests to the international arena is not arbitrary. Lebanon is already an arena for regional and international interactions. The first step to revive international interest in Lebanese developments was made by Sigrid Kaag, representative of the UN secretary general, who briefed the Security Council in a session that culminated with a collective position by the council. While this was neither a binding resolution nor a presidential statement, it remains important that the youth protests caught the attention of the council, which had previously ignored Lebanon as too small compared to the Syrian issue.The council sent out a collective letter calling for Lebanon to quickly elect president to end constitutional instability. The council said it is closely following the situation in Lebanon in support of its unity, sovereignty and independence. The council also affirmed support for the government of Lebanon and Prime Minister Tammam Salam.During the closed session, Sigrid Kaag warned that anger against the government could grow if no solution is found for political issues and public services. She said the main issue in Lebanon is the political deadlock and loss of public trust in the government.Kaag called on Lebanese politicians to engage with civil society groups, saying that the current events carry positive developments, including reviving discussions on outstanding political issues and the possibility of the emergence of a secular, cross-sectarian civil society. Kaag also called for an end to presidential vacuum by electing a new president without any delay.Sigrid Kaag's message is important for having alerted the international community to the key demands that must remain the priority of the civil movement. Kaag also helped Security Council envoys to brief their capitals and support the efforts of ambassadors to Lebanon, who are trying to raise the attention of their governments towards the situation in Beirut. The timing is also useful on the eve of the US-Saudi summit in Washington. The summit must tackle Lebanon given the Saudi influence there, even if Saudi Arabia is preoccupied in Yemen and the Obama administration ignores the Lebanese issue for being preoccupied with the nuclear deal with Iran.The angry anti-corruption protest movement has caught Washington's attention. The diplomatic advice being given to Obama's administration is that the Lebanese issues is bigger than Lebanon, and that the radical solutions lie in the Saudi-Iranian relationship. Obama can put this to his advantage, and help the civil movement, not through direct intervention but by testing Iranian and Saudi intentions and mediating a rapprochement between them through Lebanon.

Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michael-rowe-on-early-win_b_8092268.html,"No film explores that more deeply, and darkly, than Michael Rowe's Early Winter, screening in the Venice Days program.",2015-09-05,2015-09-05-1441436560-1993541-20772Early_Winter_2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-05-1441436560-1993541-20772Early_Winter_2-thumb.jpg,"This year's Venice Film Festival (La Biennale di Venezia) shines the spotlight on romance. But it's not about your typical, run of the mill love stories, more like passion with a twist. Whether it is a group's love of mountain climbing, as in Everest, or the devotion child soldiers bestow on their commandant in Beasts of No Nation, or even a futuristic view of attraction as a virus in Equals, love always seems to come at a price here on the Lido. No film explores that more deeply, and darkly, than Michael Rowe's Early Winter, screening in the Venice Days program. Rowe's lead characters are two functioning people, complete with their own flaws and very human set of mistakes, yet when David (Paul Doucet) and Maya (Suzanne Clément) come together, they bring out the worst in each other, and themselves. Or perhaps that's just how all couples are, once the fairy tale of romance wears off and day to day life sets in...Discovering the filmmaker behind the work is what I love most about what I do. In person, Rowe is a kind, honest and thoughtful man. In fact, I expected someone different, darker perhaps, more angry. But that's the thing about human beings, we're not just one thing, one personality throughout; we are a blend of many moods, many thoughts and conflicting ideas. It is what makes life, and cinema, so interesting. I'll preface this by saying that I watched it when I was five but your film reminds me of Scenes from a Marriage, by Ingmar Bergman... That film has always stayed with me, my parents made me watch it.Michael Rowe: I hadn't thought of Bergman, I love Bergman. That's a wonderful film, terrifying.Your film is terrifying too. Two people who need each other but are so damaging to one another. Who have been your filmmaking influences?Rowe: Influences in general are Bergman, of course, and Cassavetes, Roy Andersson, Catherine Breillat, there are others but those are my main ones. And in literature Raymond Carver is a big influence.What is your background?Rowe: I'm from a small town two hours from Melbourne, in Southern Australia. In filmmaking terms I consider myself Mexican, I don't consider myself Australian. I've lived in Mexico for twenty-two years. Filmmakers like Carlos Reygadas, Amat Escalante, who is a good friend, Fernando Eimbcke, I think we influence each other in our work. And Michel Franco.How did you direct in French?Rowe: I do have some notions, I can understand the language, I studied four years of French, years ago. I wrote the dialogue in English and then sat down with the actors and with their help, translated it into French.Why did you make your female character, Maya so unlikable, she's quite a horrible person. Why not make him that way? Rowe: Because that's the way she was. I don't think about politics when I'm writing, it comes from somewhere else. And I think that if you have two people in a film, it's about those two people it's not about all women all men. I think we undergo a tyranny in the world of culture, this pseudo sociological analysis and criticism that we're subjected to. Everything has to be able to be analyzed and be politically correct from a Marxists, feminist, socialist POV. No, I mean, people are bad -- men and women -- and people are good -- men and women -- and most of us are good and bad, in different contexts. It is also about the situation. She's trapped in a way...Rowe: Yeah, she has a horrible life, she's with this guy who is not the love of her life, and she's got these kids and she lives a long way from home. She does her best, and she doesn't have a particularly easy personality -- it's real life.Was she difficult to write?Rowe: All writing is difficult for me. It's the part I hate. Because you are on your own, you're completely in the dark, you're six months away from knowing if it works or not. You can't ask advice of anyone because no one knows. It's a difficult and lonely process. I don't like it but it's the only process that's important. The most creative process by a hundred percent, compared to directing which is also nice, it's much nicer you have people around you. It's much more social, I love it. Writing I suffer through it a lot but want to tell my version of truth. I want to be honest in what I film and I can't be honest if I'm filming something that I didn't write. It's very important to me to really be the creator. I think the heavy creative work is in the writing. How did you find your two lead actors?Rowe: I cast Paul [Doucet] and he brought tears to my eyes in the casting, in a scene with no dialogue. He's awesome. I knew he was in. There was another actress attached to the film and she couldn't confirm dates. First of all we had to push the whole shoot by ten months because she was having a baby, and said a month after the birth she would be ready to shoot. We waited and after those ten months when she couldn't confirm dates again I thought, we're not going to use her. I sat down with Paul, we create together, when I film it's just the actors and me, and I said, ""who do we have in Canada that could pull off this role?"" And Paul said Suzanne Clément and I said, ""totally!"" as soon as he said it, I thought it would be amazing. I think that sometimes things happen the way they're meant to happen. We had to wait ten months in order to get Suzanne, that's fine. That's what we had to do. I would have waited two years. She's the best possible actress for the role. How do you feel about cinema as a means to help us understand the world?Rowe: I believe it should. I like to try to do that in my films. How to understand ourselves, how to understand the world, I think it has that potential and I think that's always what I'm aiming for. Although you say you're not into being politically correct, what are some themes or subjects you won't touch in your films? Rowe: I don't like violence and I won't do that kind of a film.So you won't be making the next Transformers?Rowe: No, I don't know...You would make a very different Transformers, it would be a bit Kafka-esque. Rowe: It would be so interesting! If they would give me Transformers I would do something really cool. But yeah, I don't like violence. Sometimes I'd like to do comedy just because I would be so much nicer to myself during the six months of writing. It would have to be a very serious comedy. What I'm interested in is finding out how we can live our lives in the best way possible. Trying to get light moments in there, but I don't think I can do that in a comedy. And I don't know if my natural temper is that way.The world isn't much of a comedy these days...Rowe: That's the thing, it's a little heavy and it's not gonna get much better in the next twenty years... It's not a moment for that. Comedies distract you and make life a bit more bearable but I don't like looking away from problems. Comedies don't teach. You laugh and then you go home and the problems are still there.Is there a film you remember watching as a child?Rowe: I remember seeing E.T. in a cinema when I was about 11 or 12 and I remember thinking that was the best imaginable possible film ever. Three words that describe you?Rowe: What a difficult question! Gentle, I wanna say, and if I reduce it to a single word it will lose -- someone-who-feels-other-people's-pain-very-intensely -- ""empathetic"" is the actual word but it's not the same thing...

But it's not about your typical, run of the mill love stories, more like passion with a twist. Whether it is a group's love of mountain climbing, as in Everest, or the devotion child soldiers bestow on their commandant in Beasts of No Nation, or even a futuristic view of attraction as a virus in Equals, love always seems to come at a price here on the Lido. No film explores that more deeply, and darkly, than Michael Rowe's Early Winter, screening in the Venice Days program. Rowe's lead characters are two functioning people, complete with their own flaws and very human set of mistakes, yet when David (Paul Doucet) and Maya (Suzanne Clément) come together, they bring out the worst in each other, and themselves.

How does something like that even happen?",2015-09-05,2015-09-05-1441413249-7217263-LakeIsabellaPanorama.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-05-1441413249-7217263-LakeIsabellaPanorama-thumb.jpg,"What happens when you travel to your Labor Day adventure destination, and you discover that it's no longer there? How does something like that even happen?I stumbled upon this story entirely by accident, on my day off (even typing those words as a travel writer makes me feel like an oxymoron). Driving from a shoot at Mt. Whitney to the opposite side of Sequoia National Park, I chose the scenic route which passes adjacent to Lake Isabella, one of California's largest recreational reservoirs. This is Lake Isabella: Lake Isabella wasn't my destination, it was simply a California landmark I'd never seen. Thinking it would be a picturesque Labor Day weekend destination, I decided to drive around it on my way to the National Park. Without knowing anything about the lake, seeing it only from Google's directions, I was anxious to take some photos.  My first stop, just ahead of the arrow in the above map, was Paradise Cove:  I drove up to the end of the boat launch for the lake. So, um, yea.... Where did Lake Isabella go?The answer isn't as cut and dry as a person might hope for. Locals and visitors can easily blame the California mega-drought, water over-usage, faults in the dam, the deity of your choice, and/or climate change. An over-simplistic, but oddly encompassing, explanation that I'll use to serve as the basis for this discussion of our changing world, and it's effects on how we travel, goes like this:Mother Nature redistributed the water elsewhere. When I say Mother Nature (for the geekier among us), I'm referring to the biology, chemistry, and physics which govern our planet's natural state. Mother Nature doesn't care if you planned a Labor Day vacation to Lake Isabella, but thousands of other people (mostly locals) very much do.  The arguments for or against actions to, at the very least, adjust our society, to the ramifications of the changing climate often revolve within a universe of economics. Think about the financial impact of the image above. A completely deserted, unkept recreation area on the last great vacation weekend of the summer, doesn't inspire economic excitement.  It's not simply a far away government agency that suffers when a lake dries up. Think about the tours, rental agencies, and recreational sporting facilities -- boat docks, restaurants, and hotels -- transportation, real estate, and social services -- all the local towns -- basically everyone.  Folks who want to go fishing have a shrinking set of opportunities. This image was taken standing inside where the lake used to be.  The 2015 Kern River rafting season was canceled this year. There were no rapids.  The boat dock (for the boats that are left) continuously has to move its position to keep the remaining boats from being unintentionally dry-docked.  A single boat sits in the last remaining navigable portion of the lake.  Lake Isabella was created by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1953 through the damming of the Kern River to create a reservoir of 11,000 acres. The local businesses that thrived from the lake's potential set up shop under the rules of a 20th century climate. Manmade lakes have been created from careful calculations based on years of study; the predictable nature of Mother Nature. If the local enviornment isn't conducive to a large infrastructure project, the project doesn't happen (imagine damming the creek in your backyard to make your own reservoir). It seems simple enough, but it's all based on an underlying supposition: the cycles of the natural world won't change. The world won't change.If the same dam project were to be commissioned today, it may very well have been rejected as non-viable.  So what happens if the natural world does start changing? How can someone plan a vacation based on information of the past if that information is no longer accurate?  As with all things the first step to solving a problem is admitting that we have one. Societally, we need to begin the adjustment process to what the world is going to become as Mother Nature redistributes solar energy around the entire planet. We, as a species, dug up gigatons of carbon (that had been physically separated from the planet's carbon cycle for millions of years), and burned it into the atmosphere. The Earth is now readjusting itself, and the flow of solar energy absorbed each day, to compensate for this change -- to reach a new equilibrium. Everything will be affected, because everything is connected.  Once you admit that the world isn't the same place it used to be, you can plan your future trips with more accurate forethought (including having a realistic empathy for the businesses that have suffered through these changes). Think about how weather patterns may have changed, and how travel ""seasons"" may not be the specific months they used to be. Don't assume the charts and graphs in older travel books will be accurate. Always e-mail outdoor activity businesses to ask pertinent questions about the local conditions, and how they may have changed. The more you learn about your destination before you set out, the more likely you'll be to understand how changes in their local climate may have affected the experiences there.

A little more sophisticated food market, and lunch place, is the Old Market Hall, Vanha Kauppahalli, right next door the Market Square, but their prices are also higher.

29,IMPACT,Five Ways to Honor the American Worker this Labor Day,"Carla Javits, ContributorREDF President and CEO",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/five-ways-to-honor-the-am_b_8091560.html,"The essence of this special day is about acknowledging the strength, skill, persistence and even artistry demonstrated every time any job is done well. It's something we too readily forget in a world that seems to be more and more dominated by fame, fortune and reality television.",2015-09-05,2015-09-04-1441404885-3726337-CarlaJavitsPhotoBlog.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-04-1441404885-3726337-CarlaJavitsPhotoBlog-thumb.jpg," While parades, picnics and political speeches are the order of the day, Labor Day is really about celebrating the achievements of the American worker. Peter McGuire, a founder of the American Federation of Labor, who some say originated the holiday, once said it was to honor those ""who from rude nature have delved and carved all the grandeur we behold.""The essence of this special day is about acknowledging the strength, skill, persistence and even artistry demonstrated every time any job is done well. It's something we too readily forget in a world that seems to be more and more dominated by fame, fortune and reality television.So for this Labor Day I'd like to suggest the top five ways to celebrate the ""delving and carving"" while remembering where the ""grandeur we behold"" really comes from.1. Show a little respect. While many communities are raising the minimum wage, there has been little discussion of respect and civility. How about greater gratitude for those ""delving and carving"" the turkey sandwich you're eating and removing the mess from our wastebaskets every evening? More than 2 million people work as janitors, and more than 2 million people are waiters and waitresses in the United States. Being treated with respect results in a stronger work ethic. And respect generates a greater will to work and to provide better pay and working conditions. Why work in - food services or cleaning - if people fail to recognize and appreciate the need that every job is fulfilling, and the stepping stone it provides. Show a little respect.2. Create jobs, not just wealth. Living in the Bay Area is a lesson in how great wealth flows from low labor costs. It's hard to imagine a time or place when more wealth was created by fewer people. Think about an app created by two guys in a garage that makes them gazillions. But work is essential to a decent life and to feeling part of society. And if we don't have jobs for people, people will do other things to get by and won't feel part of our communities. This is a call to the brilliant entrepreneurs and investors - figure out how to create more and better jobs - not just generate great wealth for some. 3. Demand action to match the rhetoric. Jobs, jobs, jobs. That is the central, core issue. Challenge people running for office: What will they do to get out of the way or provide the incentives to create more jobs, better jobs? How will they help people who need work, but are outside of the workforce, to get in? Don't buy the rhetoric. Probe. Push. Vote. 4. Make it possible for people to work.  Although the unemployment rate is falling, the percentage of the adult population working has been steadily declining for years and now stands at about 63 percent. The right focuses on work ethic - cut entitlements so that people have to work. The left focuses on increasing wages and broadening entitlements - those who fall out of the workplace or never get in need somewhere to land. We have to encourage work and make it possible for people who face challenges to enter the workforce. We lose the $60 billion or so of productivity from roughly 1.5 million people each year, for example, because their history of incarceration is a barrier to entering the workforce. Companies can play an important role here by hiring people who have demonstrated they deserve a second chance, and consumers should reward those companies that do. Reach out to someone who needs work and help figure out how to get them connected.5. Make work pay.  The market is not always able to pay enough, even with the minimum wage boosts that some cities have enacted. We should support work incentives that don't force people into ""either/or"" choices like total disability or 100% work income. Eliminate the ""benefits cliffs"" that make working less the rational choice. California's legislature and governor just did something right when it became the 26th state to enact a state-level Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in 2015. People on both sides of the aisle agree on the power of the EITC to move people out of poverty. And while the federal EITC is only for workers with children, California also added in childless workers (who oftentimes are part of family systems that need their incomes). So don't just kick back this Labor Day - demonstrate with hearts, minds and action that we respect the American worker: the janitor and waitress, the building manager and the copy shop operator - the people who delve and carve - and do all you can to make sure that everyone has the chance to be included in that circle of respect. President Theodore Roosevelt put it this way, ""Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing."""

It communicates with a smartphone app, and Samsung claims it will keep track of your heart rate, breathing and movement during sleep with 97 percent accuracy.There are already quite a few products that do similar things. But SleepSense has a couple of interesting other features: The device will give you advice tailored by Dr. Christos Mantzoros, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and it also includes a handy function that lets you spy on the sleep habits of your loved ones.You read that correctly. Samsung doesn't refer to it as such in its press materials, but the device does have a dedicated function that lets you monitor the sleep habits of someone you care about. You can put it in your aging mom's bed and use a built-in ""family care"" option to get updates about her sleep sent directly to your email. Or, flip the equation: A worried dad could put a SleepSense in his high school student's bed to make sure the kid's actually getting quality shut-eye.SleepSense will also communicate with other ""smart"" devices in your home: It can turn your TV off when it learns that you've fallen asleep, for example. Not that you were looking at a sleep-wrecking screen before bedtime, of course.A representative for Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Huffington Post about the device's release date and price. In the meantime, our very own Arianna Huffington has a few ideas about how you can get better sleep -- check 'em out.H/T VentureBeat"
31,SPORTS,Why The 'Deflategate' Ruling Could Finally Limit Roger Goodell's Power,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deflategate-roger-goodell_us_55e8bd2fe4b03784e2755a03,"A federal judge on Thursday dealt a ""very big blow"" to the NFL commissioner's disciplinary authority.",2015-09-04,"<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, left, is seen with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Feb. 1, 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e8bddb170000430156973f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal judge delivered a strong rebuke to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell on Thursday when he vacated the four-game suspension issued to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for Brady’s alleged role in the “Deflategate” scandal.Judge Richard Berman ruled that Brady’s suspension was ""premised on several legal deficiencies"" that did not adhere to the league’s collective bargaining agreement, or CBA, with its players. Notably, Berman found, the NFL did not provide sufficient notice to Brady that he could be suspended for being ""generally aware"" of another person's supposed misconduct. The judge also found that Goodell, in his role as “independent” arbitrator when Brady initially appealed the decision, failed to provide the quarterback with a fair hearing.For Goodell, Berman’s decision amounts to another loss in a major case involving player discipline. In the past year, judges have vacated suspensions that Goodell handed to former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson under the league’s new domestic violence and child abuse policies. The Brady decision could also rival the New Orleans Saints “Bountygate” case -- in which former league Commissioner Paul Tagliabue vacated suspensions Goodell had handed to four players -- as Goodell's biggest loss on a disciplinary issue, particularly as it comes from a judge in the Manhattan courtroom the league hand-picked. The NFL quickly announced plans to appeal Berman’s ruling. But for now, at least, Goodell is 0-for-4 in the major disciplinary cases of his tenure as commissioner. And if the Brady decision is upheld, the cumulative effect of those losses could be a defining moment that finally reduces Goodell's powers, sports labor experts and NFL Players Association officials said Thursday. Yes, after a year of cases involving domestic violence and child abuse, a federal judge's particularly harsh decision in a dispute over deflated footballs could prove to be the breaking point.Courts and arbitrators have spent decades eroding commissioners’ once-unquestioned power to handle disciplinary issues as they see fit, but the NFL’s top official has retained more powers than his counterparts in the NBA, NHL and MLB. Goodell has served with full authority in NFL conduct cases thanks to a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that grants him the power both to issue fines and suspensions and to serve as a “neutral” arbiter when players appeal. But the Brady case, along with the other losses Goodell has suffered, may signal a change in the overall power dynamic, said Ed Edmonds, a University of Notre Dame professor who specializes in sports law.“It’s a very big blow,” Edmonds said. “This is another step in the weakening of the commissioner’s unilateral, strong powers to render disciplinary decisions.”Berman ruled that Goodell could not discipline Brady under a clause in the collective bargaining agreement that prohibits players from engaging in conduct that is ""detrimental to the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of professional football.” Nor could Goodell rely on the collectively bargained policy on performance-enhancing drugs as a standard for the four-game punishment. The NFL’s argument that Brady was “generally aware” of the deflated footballs, Berman ruled, was inadequate, as the league had never used that standard to discipline players.The reasoning has been different in each one of Goodell’s major losses, but at bottom, all of them, including the one involving Brady, have stemmed from judges or arbitrators ruling that Goodell overstepped his disciplinary authority under the league’s collective bargaining agreement in one way or another. The NFL Players Association highlighted that point Thursday in a statement after the ruling.""This decision should prove, once and for all, that our Collective Bargaining Agreement does not grant this Commissioner the authority to be unfair, arbitrary and misleading,” said DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFLPA, in the statement. “While the CBA grants the person who occupies the position of Commissioner the ability to judiciously and fairly exercise the designated power of that position, the union did not agree to attempts to unfairly, illegally exercise that power, contrary to what the NFL has repeatedly and wrongfully claimed.”The NFLPA has repeatedly criticized Goodell’s handling of disciplinary issues, including the way he has exercised his authority to serve as a ""neutral"" arbitrator in such cases. It sought independent arbitration to no avail in the Brady case, and it has called for a fully neutral arbitration process in the past.The recent decisions, together with a long-brewing mistrust for the commissioner among players -- some of whom celebrated Berman’s decision -- could lead the union to seek changes to the league’s disciplinary policies in the next round of bargaining talks, said George Atallah, the NFLPA’s assistant executive director for external affairs.“There are only two options moving forward,” Atallah told The Huffington Post. “Either the commissioner and league office respect the parameters of our CBA, or we work together to improve the system.”But even if the problems between players and the league don't result in new standards through bargaining, the Deflategate episode could lead to changes in how Goodell and the players approach disciplinary cases.It's still too early to judge the aftermath of the Brady case, especially with the NFL planning to appeal. But the combined effects of repeated defeats could force Goodell to be “much more careful in the process of determining discipline,” said Tom Dewey, a litigator and arbitration law expert at New York’s Dewey Pegno & Kramarsky.Edmonds said the Brady decision signals that “players really only need to fear what is actually in the collective bargaining agreement.”“If the collective bargaining agreement doesn’t provide for these kind of sanctions,"" Edmonds said, ""the commissioner really doesn’t have the power to go beyond that and do whatever he thinks is appropriate.""Another problem facing Goodell may be an erosion of trust among an important constituency: his bosses.NFL owners stood behind Goodell during the previous scandals, and several urged him to stand firm this time as Berman pushed both sides toward a settlement. It seems unlikely that the Brady episode could cost the commissioner his job if the Rice case did not, but at least one owner reportedly wasn’t pleased with Goodell’s handling of the Brady case. In an interview with Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman last month, that owner signaled an openness to renewed discussions about the league’s disciplinary policies.“This entire episode,” the unnamed owner told Bleacher Report, “is embarrassing our sport.”"

So it’s really not all that surprising that in the wake of his outrageous remarks, anti-Trump-themed novelty items have been selling like hotcakes. First there were piñatas made in Trump’s likeness. Then Trump-themed butt plugs. Now Mexican mobile game developer Karaokulta has created Trumpéalo, a mobile game that allows users to beat and humiliate Trump with the touch of a finger.Trumpéalo, a play on the Spanish word “golpear,” which means “to beat up,” allows users to dress a digital Trump in ridiculous costumes and throw everything from soccer balls to cacti at the presidential hopeful as he delivers a speech on stage. Users can also opt to shower Trump with money and flowers, but doing so will end the game. Karaokulta’s CEO, Jorge Suarez, tells Vanguardia the game is meant to be a “playful and fun way” for users to express how they feel about the billionaire. ""Video games are art, they are a form of interactive expression,” Suarez explains. “We want to make games with different situations, and though they might be delicate, we're Mexicans. If we laugh ourselves to death, why not? This is how the idea came about. It turns out people loved it.""Trumpéalo is expected to go live within the next two to three weeks and will be available on iOS and Android.H/T Vice.comAlso on HuffPost:"
