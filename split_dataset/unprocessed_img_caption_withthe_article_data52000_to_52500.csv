1,BLACK VOICES,"Even In Dallas, You Can Be Pro-Cop And Believe Black Lives Matter",Andy Campbell and Sebastian Murdock,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dallas-pro-cop-black-lives-matter_us_57812634e4b0344d514f8993,"Despite deep divisions, people are starting to realize the terms aren't mutually exclusive.",2016-07-09,A man stands at an impromptu memorial set up outside the Dallas Police Department on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/578136781b00002600f6cf67.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DALLAS, T.X. ― Everywhere you turn, you can see the divide.An invisible yet very real wall separates those who support the Black Lives Matter movement and those who support police. Parts of the county feel embroiled in conflict ― people are killing one another, after all.In the past week, police officers have killed black men on video; tense protests have swept the nation and officers have been gunned down on American streets.But in Dallas, where the latest tragedy happened, that invisible wall ― the one that forces people into declaring themselves pro-BLM or pro-police, has been partially torn down. Vigils have replaced protests. Officers and civilians embraced one another and love has ― generally ― conquered anger and fear.Keeping those sentiments alive and helping them spread beyond a city struck by tragedy will be the hard part.“What are we going to do when the reporters leave and the attention fades?” Michael Walton, the president of the Dallas Fraternal Order of Police ― a chapter of the country’s largest police union ― said on Saturday. “This thing that happened with the 12 officers is such a traumatic event, not just for police but for citizens, too, because it shocks the conscience, of everything that we believe is right.”“We have to communicate,” he told The Huffington Post. “If we don’t communicate we’re not going to do any better.” He stood outside the Dallas Police Department building downtown alongside officers and mourners, in front of a police car covered in flowers, notes from the community and stuffed animals.One of those officers was dressed as the Hulk.Dallas Police Sgt. Ed Trevino, a 22-year veteran of the force, was off duty on Saturday. But he donned his superhero costume for the Heroes, Cops and Kids community campaign.He and local police have been working for decades to foster a better relationship with the community.“We try to solve bigger problems than day-to-day ― we get the community involved, we get out there as police and ask, ‘What are you concerned about? What are your issues and what can we do to address those concerns?’” “The vast majority of people out here are good people,” Trevino said. “We’re all out here to do the right thing. We have to band together. The biggest issue for me is to make sure we communicate and have facts before we decide who’s right and wrong in any of these situations.”Sympathy for police is real here ― but so is frustration.On Friday night, an MC at a DJ set near downtown Dallas wore a shirt that read, “Police Murder People.” Below her offstage, locals danced and cheered as she shouted, “Dallas is strong! Dallas is united! We will get through this!”One woman in the audience said she’s been mourning every tragedy ― and she’s still pissed off.“We will heal, but everyone has to do it together,” said Kayla Washington, 24. “This happens too often, and we always cry, and we’re always angry. How much longer do we have to do this before we realize we’re in it together? I cried on 9/11; did officers cry when Eric Garner and Michael Brown died? We need to cry together, and then do something together.”Despite plentiful fringe assertions that the Black Lives Matter movement invited the shooting in Dallas, nobody wanted this. The movement’s co-founder Alicia Garza told Chris Hayes on Friday:Black Lives Matter has never, ever called for the murder of police officers. What we have said over and over again is that it is time in this country for policing to be accountable, transparent and responsible. That’s not rhetoric. That is what communities in the United States want to see from the people who protect and serve them. Reggie Holt, a black retired Marine and former police officer, said de-escalation tactics need to improve among police forces.“Cops are just as scared of the civilians they stop all the time,” Holt said. “But that does not give them the right to treat people differently based on sex, race, creed or gender.”Holt came to the vigil for police because he’s one of them. His heart goes out to those officers, he said. It also goes out to the black men and women unjustly killed by police.“It seems you’re either pro-police or pro-BLM,” Holt said. “Can’t we just be both?”Holt said that, as an older black man, he feels police treat him with more respect. Young men, not so much.“I tell young black men this all the time ― you get stopped by the cops, put your hands on the steering wheel, say ‘yes sir’ and if he gives you a ticket, take the ticket and deal with it later,” he said. “That way that cop respects you. But not all cops respect you when you get stopped.”It’s a common piece of advice black men hear ― but it’s no guarantee. Philando Castile wasn’t respected when he was shot dead after appearing to cooperate with the policeman who pulled him over. Holt said that reliance on force needs to change.“I know it’s dangerous as hell out here, man, but not all the answers are at the end of a nine millimeter.”"
2,ENTERTAINMENT,Notes From A Time When Every Day Was Record Store Day,"Michael Vazquez, ContributorBlogging here since '07",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/notes-from-a-time-when-every-day-was-record-store-day_us_57813fafe4b05b4c02fcb5fe,"Herewith, one man’s idiosyncratic anecdotes about the people, places and things that made a few record stores what they",2016-07-09,"<strong>The Birdman of 1st Avenue, Rainbow Music shop</strong>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57813fe71a000019006f96c5.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Herewith, one man’s idiosyncratic anecdotes about the people, places and things that made a few record stores what they uniquely were to him, during another time in New York City.When it comes to self-medication by vinyl therapy, every record junkie has her or his own favorite spots and ritual walks; I used the same stealthy route, fearful that interrupting my trusted routine would create a parallel universe, wherein some other punter beats me to an existence-justifying score.Despite the fact that I go to fewer shops these days, record stores have given my pathetic life meaning; from my first experience of Pop-perfection, through my anguished, post-adolescence, to my present continuation of same – or, as the always timely, now most lamentably late David Bowie put it: “It’s strange to be 19 forever.” Maybe, wise Uncle Davie, gone to us at age 69, but it beats living for “Just these twenty years” and dying “For the fifty more”...can I get an “Aaaaaawal night!?” You can watch “Legends: David Bowie” a documentary I co-wrote for VH1 HEREIn my primary terrain for record safaris – downtown Manhattan, specifically The Village and East Village – I’ve seen a lot of record stores come and go. Some losses hit harder than others, like some deaths. Some deaths you don’t see coming, some are long slow painful deaths, with the decimated store on life support, like the once-relishable St. Mark’s Sounds, where I snapped this chronicle of a death foretold on a day in February 2014.It looked like a shop ready to do business, yet, it was completely empty; “stock” was negligible: bins once LP-jammed , now trifled by space-holding filler CDs. Seeing all the hallmarks, yet none of the former vitality was like seeing an old friend after she’d or he’d had a stroke. Sounds died two months later.ST. MARK’S SOUNDS20 St. Mark’s PlaceEst. 1979Died. 2014In the 80s and 90s, Sounds on good ole’ St. Mark’s Place boasted some of the savviest vinyl cut-outs buyers in the biz. Cut-outs – which you don’t see too often these days, since vinyl is generally pressed in limited runs – are surplus or returned albums, uglified by literally cutting corners and/or punching a hole in the barcode, then re-sold at a cut-rate (as it were). I always considered Sounds a kind way station, vouchsafing a little good karma in the chain of supply and The Man, by way of rescue and adoption of maimed future classics and classic sleepers which are given a forever home by us consumers, who for once, got haggle-free discounts on new, shrink-wrapped records and some terrific promos that we felt cool for being privy to, and could lie about the origins of, to impress friends.This is where I built my beloved collection of cutout-shmutout Brian Eno records, making for many a musical launchpad (literally, on the Apollo recordings), some intense meditations, and better sleep. And since Eno, I think, owned EG Records, I didn’t feel like he was losing any royalties. And if you’re an atists whose cut-out I bought, take heart. Viewed from the present, Sounds seems one of the very best (small) shops for those last days when, in a way, we were all on the same (non-web) page, pre-Internet. I say this with no ingratitude towards our digital present.I recall paydays when, after (hopefully) buying a few worthwhile albums, I would (this is before I stopped eating all animals) get a whole chicken and a bag of fries from BBQ or more likely a knockwurst and knish from Katz’s on East Houston, where I would proudly speak Spanish with the guys at the grill, who would give me an extra knockwurst and slices of rye for free, writing-up only one knockwurst and knish on my ticket. I would fill up and tightly lid a paper coffee cup full of sauerkraut from the self-serve steam table and they would ply me with free drafts, recruited into the restaurant’s small water fountain glasses, from which I would usually quaff down two, maybe three beers, and tip them a buck. It was our routine, and this boho’s idea of a happy hour.And if I were lucky enough to be in possession of an extra $10, and to have scored a dime bag of weed on 2nd Avenue & 9th street, or the bodega-fronted cheeba house on East Houston, or the Reggae record store on Eldridge that is now a Domino’s, I’d be pretty set for the weekend, as I walked back to my $575 ground-floor L.E.S. studio-with-a-loft on Norfolk St., nicely buzzed, the hyper-alive Friday night sounds of the last of a dying Lower East side, circa 1987 – ‘92 profoundly reminding me of where I was, where I’d come from.And that maybe, now that I was done with college, it wasn’t so bad to live an anarcho-individualistic life of dedicating myself to bad writing in solitude, alternated with meeting some fascinating European babes at the uber-cool rock poster-slash-gallery-slash-postcard museums I managed on St. Mark’s and on Bleecker street, and guiding them out of the East Village and through the semi-dangerous and thrilling (for a down tourist, and a native New Yorker) Alphabet City, where we would hear the words “Works, Works” (as in heroin needle works; oddly I’ve never tried this drug) bringing them back to my rooftop from which we would gaze at the Twin Towers, scary close, enigmatically reminding us of a world, a way of being we were tainted by, yet inchoately trying to opt out of, or at least forestall joining, as we retreated into each other’s company, both of us already aware that these nights were fated to become merely and legendarily some of the loveliest youthful memories in our soon-to-be-irrevocably-adult lives, and thusly we determined to make these times memorable. And we did, even if names and faces are long-forgotten.I also recall, as things began to change, the night my usual after-work walk from St. Mark’s to Avenue A was detoured by police, as tanks (well, a tank) rolled in the East Village, when the battle between squatters and police for Tompkins Square and a few occupied buildings began, and though I was a party to neither camp (though I’d spent a lovely night in a squat with an Australian artists who painted bras) I knew who’d already won, and that we’d all lose.I’d forgotten about Sounds for a long time, and now, facing the entrance one final time, I savored the slide of my sullen steps softly sandpapering Sounds’ stairs; the store’s entrance, elevated above the heart of St. Mark’s, made every arrival and exit noteworthy, and the floor-to-ceiling outward opening windows tendered up to pedestrians a view right into the store, making it for a time, a kind of living diorama of late 20th century subcultural lifeforms buying physical music in the old that fishbowl known as St. Mark’s.And so, half a lifetime later, my heart both fuller and emptier than I ever expected it to be at this age, I walked the empty aisles of Sounds and looked at the empty bins, in a state of bewilderment perhaps akin to that of an animal trying to comprehend the death of its human companion. I took my time, knowing that when I left this store, I would never come back, and I wondered when, how soon, it would die, and what the space would become, and how much older I might be, or feel, if/when I found myself in the new establishment reminiscing about how I used to buy records here, and about my fun job across the street, at French Kisses.I hit the street, took a quick look around, fixed my gaze hard on the pavement and walked away, crying a little, behind my shades.BLEECKER BOB’S118 West 3rd StreetEst. 1967Died. 2013 Haggling goes a variety of ways; on any given Sunday, one of the selectors on opposing sides of the cash register will determine if the customer or the house is going to get or give up the better deal, during the studied yet improvised establishment of an equitable wax-to-dollar ratio.I recall arguing with Bleecker Bob’s stalwart Chris, after deciding not to trade a William Burroughs CD, even though he’d given me my price. He was right to be annoyed, and I was used to the occasional combatant energy of horse-traders, but he went off on me a little too much that day, and I bitchily told him that just because he was still working there and would be his entire life, he didn’t have to be so grouchy, and I left. I felt really bad for saying this.Surprisingly, the next time I walked in to the store, we were instantly and totally cool with each other, and it felt healthy to have said snotty things that in a way, bonded us (though I was not a regular regular). Interestingly, though not related, he told me offhandedly that he needed to, and was spending more time with his girlfriend on the west coast – or did he say it was the Bleecker Bob’s store on west coast he was spending more time at? In any case, he seemed a lot less stressed, and though unlikely, I like to think I contributed in a small popcorn way, to his liberation.Walking by after it closed, I noticed a The The button that was left just at the entrance, and put it in my pocket; another consecrated object from my old NYC, and maybe the very last transaction ever conducted here. Although my sentimentality compelled me to take the button, I also considered how, since someone else would eventually take it, I might as well, subsequently realizing that in a macro-micro sense, this same reasoning is what raises rents. I should have left it there; a recursive double-adverb negating presumption, and a gloriously impotent token against the succumbing to greed.ROCKS IN YOUR HEAD157 Prince StreetEst. 1978Died. 2006The last time I visited this store, I was trading a Gerard Malanga CD, and when I was leaving, the dude I had been speaking with gave me a 45 (well, technically, a 7” 33 1/3) from his band, Love Is All, whose confetti goofiness dually belies and authenticates their immediacy. This was the last I time I ever saw the store alive, the last time I and this store)spoke, until the day my best friend emailed me to let me know that some record bins were being given away on CL. She told me the address, and I didn’t register it. When I got there, I felt like a paramedic, or more aptly, a coroner, responding to a call, only to arrive at the house of an old friend who had just died.There they were: seemingly lying in state at their own wake in the starkly empty, Hopper-still SoHo space, the black, coffin-long record bins, finally unburdened from sound payloads, completely empty atop their formerly hip, now somber black columns. As soon as I have enough space to take my records out of storage, I plan to put those bins to work again, and enjoy the benefits of not having to bend to the floor to dig, mid-mix.Living up to its name, Rocks In Your Head’s space was to be converted into, interestingly – and again, by way of real-world(ly) cruel poetics – drumroll...anti-climax: a real estate office! Which is an even greater statistical inevitability than a sushi joint, though not as likely as a nail salon.The guy from the real estate office and I begin to talk, as he helps me carry out the bins, and he tells me that his cousin is Taki 183, and though I would normally find this fascinating, I blankly engage in rote conversation; I am trying to avoid actually telling myself what this dead store symbolizes from my youth.And so, after surviving the high-fatality Rock and Roll age of 27, at 28 years old, this store – where Sonic Youth posted an ad for, and found their drummer, and which The Gothamist team credit for buying their Morrissey catalog, the proceeds of which helped support their founding of the website – wasn’t able to pay its Manhattan rent...and so it moved to Brooklyn.GENERATION RECORDS210 Thompson StreetEst. 1992 (still open)Just two streets over from Bleecker Bob’s, relative newcomer Generation Records on Thompson has, over the past twenty-five years, become the go-to spot that Bleecker Bob’s once was, for dedicated sets of varyingly uniformed tribes from the boroughs and burbs, keen to get their sub-culture on IRL.Featuring an upstairs and downstairs, there are a always a few good vinyl bargains to be found here, the last record store in the immediate Washington Square area east of Sixth avenue, west of Broadway, below the arches and above Houston. The book store on LaGuardia has some records, but it’s a quick dig (albeit, worth it for a few haggleable soundtracks) and the other record store on Bleecker Street seems straight mercenary and never seems to hold my attention very long.And so, long lives the tradition of exuberant overbuys from enthralled arrivals, just off the W 4th stop or from the PATH on 8th street or the LIRR at Penn station, feeling rewarded, heartened by this oasis, far from their native subdivisions sprawling on the fringes of the city in geometric order...SECOND COMING RECORDS235 Sullivan StreetEst. 1984Died. 2006Second Coming Records was always a personal favorite for me; perhaps because it occupied a sweet spot in a Village walk that might take me through the acquisition of hopefully a book, some vintage threads, a few hits of mescaline, and a bag of weed and maybe more records at another spot, usually Rocks In Your Head.The epic music discovery connotations its name lauds, and their movie marquee outside seemed to prime one for a robust, fruitful dig. And it was here that I found Jandek’s “Six And Six”, which was one of many life-dig highlights; one man’s Found Art bootleg of his ad-libbing ID, pressed on wax, slipped into a thick cardboard sleeve, affixed with a grainy B&W photobooth portrait; it was pure No-Fi DIY homegrown, and it sounded as starkly subversive as the Hip Hop 12”s of my youth in the late 70s and early 80s. He just had the nervy, bootleg rawness.And so, I was shocked to hear that Second Coming had been raided by Secret Service and FBI for allegedly selling bootlegs and counterfeits (not of Jandek, whose production value would likely have been upgraded by a knock-off). Within the relativism of my subterranean calculus, a store satisfying demand for fanatics and completists making ‘Village pilgrimages was less egregious than selling purple food-color-dyed pastini to unsuspecting kids visiting Washington Square Park to buy mesc. That said, counterfeting is different from selling bootlegs because bootleg audio and videos are one of the things that made, and continue to make (albeit, less so in the age of youtube) many stores unique.Anyhoo, they survived getting nailed, faced judgment day (as it were), did time, and even opened another store, but the, well, second coming of Second Coming was not a resurrection, and so they closed.FAT BEATS406 6th AvenueEst. 1993Died. 2010Like that The The street-button at Bleecker Bob’s, I also found, placed at the former entrance to the old site of Fat Beats. a copy of a CD by the gravel-coated-with-honey-throated rapper Sensational, whose stilted, free-range I always enjoyed. And this quiet sidewalk heirloom reminded me of how, back in the day, cats would be outside of the store hitting passersby off with the old, “Here, check out my mixtape” trick, forcing their wares onto folks, asking for a “donation”, and then reclaiming their property, eliciting, to a varying degree, bemusement, call-outs or acquiescence.More often than not, it was sage to pay attention to whom was self-promoting, given how many future legends passed through that unique arena, just around the corner from the (also now-gone) Washington Square cyphers of the early 90s. Anyway, breaking it down SAT-style, Fat Beats is to retail what Stretch and Bobbito’s show was to radio: a discerning and dedicated cultural hub, particle-accelerator and essential live forum that established legends and also-rans, one bar, one zigga-zigga at a time.Opened in 1994, the shop quickly expanded to Tokyo, Atlanta and Los Angeles, in addition to its NYC flagship. Fat Beats lived to see its quinceñera, closing in 2010. These days, it’s a label that also does distro. At their website, one can also find new cassettes, like this “Radio That Changed Lives: Stretch and Bobbito” mix from ’95 for $9.99.Fat Beats are presently looking for interns to help with everything from shipping to A&R, and though they’re requiring that applicants be enrolled in college, if you see this as a life-opportunity because it’s where your heart is, then you must email them a piece of your heart and make your case heard. Or start your own whatever, if you haven’t already.REBEL REBEL319 West Bleecker StreetEst. 1988Died. 2016Monikered after Bowie’s three-minute piece of teen psychology-cum-sociology that might as well be a manifesto by way of an invite to a night out (and about which the late Tony Wilson was, I believe, incorrect in reductively citing the Smiths’ brilliant “Hand In Glove” as fully derivative of) this sole proprietorship is not just a juvenile success, though it was nonetheless, perhaps too cool to live to see thirty years on dull old West Bleecker.Nor did it ever see Bowie glide through its portals, gangsta lean on the cash register and ask for his licensing fee for use of the song title, however: you can bet that, he no doubt ― indeed by way of existential statistical inevitability ― must have taken heart in the existence of this store, in moments both measurable and not.During the final days of writing this piece, I call and ask if they are closing or relocating; I know the answer, but I guess I don’t want to acknowledge the reality by expressing it, without a contingency to lessen the drop.“The first one”, says the owner, not speaking directly of the reality, either. The voice surprisingly, is instantly familiar, from a time when every day really was like Sunday, and shops like this made Sundays musical. For this consumer of the Post-Punk and Post-Modern Folk that made the Eighties great, I could always find import singles here early. It’s also where I built my entire cherished Chameleons collection.As these sounds became mainstream, Rebel Rebel was nicely positioned for the “Alternative” boom of the ‘90s, and also knew from dance music 12”s and compilations, advising clientele during the home-bedroom DJ boom of the 90s. They’d also play any record you asked them to, hence the not necessarily virginal condition of their vinyl; they were apt at spinning new arrivals that people in varying degrees of embarrassment (why?) about having to ask, would buy on the spot; the owner was kind of a less hyphy version of the record store chameleonesque sales clerk who would Zelig with genre-tribal DJ clientele, affirming how “wiiiikid” a Jungle track was, how raw a Hip-Hop joint, or how deep a House cut was, in the 90s flick Human Traffic.I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with this store, being an occasional haggler that I am, however, I appreciated the promo items that were all for sale, in addition to months-old music mags that were deeply discounted, and so one could absorb a lot from the leftover copies of NME, The Face, Q, Melody Maker, et, al. I never bought “expired” mags, cuz it just seemed uncool, though that was probably dumb of me. I did acquire one extra curricular item: a Pet Shop Boys “Introspective” plastic shopping bag.I gotta say, as I was writing this, something occurred to me – and no sooner than you could say: “How the fuck is this spot still in business?”, it was announced (no, really, as I was writing all of this) that Rebel Rebel was a goner goner.“Will that be happening soon?” I’m still not saying he word closing.“Uh, more like a week from today.” He doesn’t say the final date.I do the math: 6/25. My ex girlfriend’s birthday. And like a counterweight snapping me from the present and sending me through a cortex vortex à la The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, I am, in a parallel universe, making my most recent purchase here: It’s the holidays, and I’m running around town with that pre-celebration energy, looking for the Marie Antoinette soundtrack, which I really wanted to give as a gift for the now-lost love of my life. Rebel was my last chance, and they came through for me.And I very clearly remember saying to him when I picked it up – and I’m paraphrasing (albeit with near-total accuracy):“Thanks for always being here all this time and being the kind of store that I know I can call and find something like this at.”This store was, for a time, a signature store in my late teens and early twenties, even though I no longer shopped there with any regularity. Thanks again, man, for keeping around a copy of the soundtrack, which is the most devastatingly personal musical memory I have of my ex. I daresay our relationship’s early days and also some lovely beach days and nights enjoyed a certain sustained level of ebullience with this on repeat, with her skipping over certain songs, or playing a song twice.Post-our-break-up, I found the Marie Antoinette soundtrack CD I bought her in a box of my stuff...in my new apartment; it had somehow returned to my possession, and (perhaps due to territorial male tendencies) the thought of her no longer having the physical CD I gave her – a thought to which I’ll add a redundancy: in her possession anymore was, and is mildly devastating.I barely entertain and certainly don’t meditate on the idea that she returned it to me; ‘too painful. I am sufficiently pained by the reality that this actual physical CD is no longer with her, because it is, within the rapidly eroding half-life of memory, a permanent step removed from our prior reality, like the once-lovers in The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind I endure inchoate pangs, bittersweet half-truths, and lost certainties, lost human company, lost LOVE. We’ll always have the playlist of our time together, won’t we? Quien Sabe.And so, she may one day play this soundtrack on her iPod or share it with someone, and no longer remember (and thus, no longer care) where this playlist ever even came from, or how she got this music, and the existential facticty of who, what, when, where, and how it was brought it to her life.By way of self-comfort, I posit a question that answers itself: is not the best love a selfless love? And a selfless love is that amidst which one is most grateful for having given, irrespective of reward or enduring credit, and even with the possibility of being, well, forgotten?After all, I now have many records that I don’t remember where I bought them. And I thought I would never forget such things that were once so important to me.HOUSE OF OLDIES30 Carmine StreetEst. 1969 (47 years and counting)Established in 1969, this little store that could (and still does) may not be on anybody’s “Ten Best Record Stores in New York” lists, because it’s kind of easy to take such a stalwart for granted, especially on Carmine Street where there once were, what? Four, five stores, including Techno OGs’ Heart, Bones and X’s Sonic Groove, Three Bean Records, Rockit Scientist, and the great Evergreen Video store, relocated to little West 12th, before shuttering a few years ago, creating a major disturbance in The Force.By definition, vintage stock this deep makes House of Oldies a wax museum, given the rich time-capsule experiences that a dig through the crates of old Soul, Rock and Roll, Rockabilly and Jazz LPs and 45s (and 78s) makes for. In-the-know overseas visitors beeline it here to plunk down their ducats, irrespective of the exchange rate. My entire collection of Phillies 45s (some re-issues, some originals) came from here; they’ve never let me down. Again.ACADEMY RECORDS12 West 18th St. & 415 Est 12th St.Est. 1977 (still open)I remember Academy when it was more of a book shop that I first stopped into after dropping off my typewritten story (an interview-slash-mini-oral-history with CBGB soundman Norm; alas, Legs McNeil lost the original and only copy) at SPIN magazine. It’s maybe 1987 and I’m twenty-one and I’m home from school and back in the city, with a vengeance, talking my way into interviewing Bret Ellis, Johnny Marr, and I would soon meet this cool singer from Iceland at a club called The World and we’d keep in touch and team-up to bring over the first wave of bands fro Iceland after The Sugarcubes: Bless Reptile and HAM. One of these musos became the mayor of Rekyavik twenty years later.Anyway, I leave SPIN and stop in the street, reading the magazine, after which I pop into a book store that, long story short, would soon move next door, be bought out entirely by one of the partners, a goatee-sporting OG Beatnik (now-)septegenarian who rode out the good and bad times, and now owns three wisely located, genuinely appreciated and reliably stocked stores. Thanks to a steady (erm) stream of Classical, Jazz, Opera and Show Tunes purchases by Julliard students, as well as moderate but steady DVD (yes, DVD) sales this spot on 18th St. funded the opening of two locations, creating a veritable (relativism prevailing) Starbuck’s, albeit with different wares and clientele at each store.SECOND HAND ROSE48 East 12th St.Est. 1969 (still open)Footlights Records, a mecca for soundtracks is gone; however, this soundtrack, Folk and Jazz-heavy store near Flight Cub, the Strand and gives lit-nerds, sneakerheads and sample-hunters another good reason to stop. After watching Lost Horizon (the original and the remake) during Hurricane Sandy, I came here seeking, but not expecting to find the soundtrack, and instead, this elusive barely noticeable vinyl-haven shangri-la on East 12th Street had two copies – one brand new. ‘Nice one. Spend some time here, and it will be impossible to not find something you want to buy.RAINBOW MUSIC130 1st. AvenueEst. 1998Died. 2015As vacant as Sounds had become, Rainbow Music was equally orgiastic in its teetering stockpiles of major label CDs, box sets/re-issues. A patient person could save a lot, haggling with “The Birdman”, a true character who was literally up to his neck in music, whilst playing the market as a day trader. The loss of this store is really about one less quirk in the East Village, gone the way of the bagpiping ‘Nam vet who drove us all mad, then scared us shitless when confronted, holding his reed like a M16, and making eerie beatboxer-accurate shooting sounds with his mouth, or the suit and tie wearing skateboarder and his girlfriend, who would bring me their change after he’d jump over a dozen garbage cans in Washington Square, nailing the landing on a second skateboard; or the guy with his own dog pack of about fifteen (rumored to be inbred) behemoths that followed him through the streets.Thankfully, the very old, monkishly silent Chinese gentleman walking around in wrinkled garbage bags and newspaper hats (no doubt copied by SoHo haberdashers) is still alive and thriving, in his own mystic way. He actually spoke to me on a day when I most needed heartening from this universe, as I removed my things, including thousands of albums, from our apartment, when my girlfriend and I split up. Thanks, man, I really needed that. Safe travels.The Colony1618 BroadwayEst. 1948 (64 years)Died. 2012In this store’s final home, The Brill building, many a Pop record was writ, including, “I Got You Babe”, which boasted a line about makin’ the rent, that could be The Colony’s epithet. This shop sold a lot of sheet music ― which might sound square, but it actually made for a fascinating mix of customers, all entering temporarily disoriented by the midtown mayhem outside: Metal guitarists, Jazz musos, chin-scratchers , Show Tune lovers alike, buying sheet music; as well as tourists from the midwest to the Pyrenees. They win the award for the best record store bag, with a poodle-skirted, sweatered and scarved women exclaiming: “I found it at the Colony!”The Colony closed after 64 years, just before it would have been old enough to get social security. There would be no more of their famous in-store karaoke, as the last musical element to The Brill Building exits the stage.The WizSome stores, like some people, are so magical, you wonder if they ever really existed at all. For me The Wiz is such a shop. I’m not talking about the Gloria Estefan-fronted “Nobody beats The Wiz” jungles as seen on TV, when it was a major electronics seller; I’m talking about a single store in the Bronx, where you would tell ‘em what you wanted, or sing, or mimic a break you heard, and they would know exactly what you were looking for on the wall of tautly shrink-wrapped 12”s, and like a carneys at Coney, give you your prize. I can’t think of a store I was keener to rush through the doors of in my life. I had to rush, since my twelve year-old self would visit this store at the conclusion of rare visits to my father post-divorce, who would gimme a twenty spot (which got me four to six records) and wait in his car outside.The initial anti-climax of the usually ultra-plain, no-frills labels and monochromatic sleeves (that had, albeit bigger, holes in them like 45s sleeves, whoa!) was an early challenge to my young and filigree-expectant consumerist mindset, my first experience with DIY. Of course, there was design-rich packaging on some 12” labels: Sugar Hill Records’ Candyland-esque, logo and design, in addition to being one of my first experiences with Con Art was to my young mind, still familiar with that simple board game and the delight it brought my young family-member self, now experiencing its aesthetic in my less certain, less family-oriented early adolescence-slash-wonder years, on a subversive par with The Grateful Dead’s sublime Trippy Teddy Bear.Sugar Hill’s logo also seemed to churn and chug along like some whatchamahoozit straight outta Dr. Seuss, or better yet, like tracks for the chugging Sooooooooooooul Train of Solaris Records. T.K. Disco’s beach-view sleeves and banana colored labels always made me think of percussion and remains one of the most recognized logos of the disco era, as do Casablanca’s; Prelude’s sleeves which, though black, were, like the black painted walls of a club, perfectly offset by the actual label’s up-lit dancefloor graphic that just put you on the decks in the disco; Jellybean Benitez-produced Mantis release of “Dance (Freestyle Rhythm)” featured an achingly gorgeous dream-babe in stereo whose image was as poignant as pictures of Lily, cuz you knew she just got to be somebody’s baby, but she sure wasn’t yours.For me the most subversively lo-fi (both metaphorically and literally), powerfully branded labels were on the mix-medley records. I mean, you knew one when you saw one, and you always bought it, sometimes even if you already had a copy. Those labels had the nano-second branding impact/recognition of finding money on the street; I cannot impart to you how radical the idea of DJ mixes (albeit, of varying quality and skill) on vinyl was in the 70s.RANDOM HEAD SHOPSouth Bronx, circa 1972You never forget your first. Mine was on Ogden Avenue in the Bronx, in my neighborhood, but not on my block (big difference, requiring a new level of courage). And like a benign prostitute who, amidst a rough and tumble demimonde, kens your innocence, the lady clerk at this store which primarily sold weed, but also had records, blacklights and posters, was bemused by, and gracious to, a lil’ kid buying his very first album. Anyway, I remember they had a poster that was emblematic of the times, and an update to Duchamp’s R. Mutt and its challenge to the processes and mindsets that confer meaning, identity and validity, by way of Women’s Lib: a pissoir with a longhaired dude, a business man, and a woman hitching up her skirt, pissing upright, whilst the businessman gawks. This was my first experience of the commercial frontline and the potential for polemics within the Pop Cult: the record store. And one of my last experiences of the fading 60s (my Vietnam POW/MIA bracelet notwithstanding).EPILOGUE: All Sales Vinyl?What the survival of some, thriving of others and death of many more record shops perhaps makes manifest, albeit, not obvious, is that there is no Extinction-Level Event, and community endures, and the “fractured marketplace” is just another evolution of sorts, and provides ample opportunity to satisfy the timeless need for peer groups, real-world validation and places we consecrate with our individuals and collective quests for, well, beauty and intellectual, sub-cultural empathy.(Not much more) simply put, I daresay the enduring and inherent personal satisfaction and, well, life-value that finding and celebrating the work of another, apexed in physical form IRL for one to meditate on, as the sound frequencies enable one’s escape into the world, will like water, always find its level.SCIENCE & ETYMOLOGY OF VINYL−CH=CH 2 Vinyl derives from vinum from Latin for wine.

Jordan has responded to the the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile with a powerful Instagram post, writing that he ― or any black person ― could have easily been in their position. The actor has used his platform in the past to call attention to issues of race and social justice. In the 2013 biographical drama “Fruitvale Station,” he played Oscar Grant, a young man who was killed by police in Oakland, California, in 2009. His post conveyed an acute awareness that the pattern of black deaths hasn’t changed much since those years.“The fact is Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were not unfortunate accidents,” he wrote underneath an empty black square. “These are just a few of the countless incidents of the violent neglect, poor training, and lack of accountability that clearly illustrate one thing: Black people are being [disproportionately] dehumanized and murdered, this must stop!”In his post, Jordan described how the string of police violence resonates with him personally. “This hits close to home,” he wrote. “It could have easily been myself, my little brother, my dad, one of my friends, or any of us. When one of us is murdered because a police officer is ‘afraid for their life,’ it pains us- we feel it. In the wake of these senseless murders, our homes are forever broken...”Following the attack on the Dallas police force late Thursday night, he also made sure to emphasize that “violence is not the answer,” explaining that he cares about “the safety of my black brothers and sisters and my blue ones too”“This is the time to unify; our communities, our churches and our homes,” Jordan continued. “My mission is to channel my anger and energy - along with my love and hope for the future into actively finding solutions.

The highly publicized trial in 2005 resulted in Jackson’s acquittal on all fourteen counts. The problem is that the police documents in question and the list of items seized from Neverland are not “new” or “recently unearthed” documents, as some media outlets have mistakenly claimed in an effort to bolster salacious headlines.These were all items that were entered in court back in 2005 ― items that were well known to both the prosecution and defense and were presented before both Judge Melville and the jury. None of the items seized from Neverland fit the legal definition of child pornography, and in fact many of the items that are currently creating the most media hysteria were not pornographic at all. They were legal art books; a few of them containing some examples of adult erotica, but again, these were not titles that could be in any way deemed as pornographic or even obscene. This isn’t to say that Jackson didn’t own any pornography at all. The truth was that a sizable amount of adult heterosexual pornography had been confiscated in the raid, but Jackson was a grown man and this type of pornography is not illegal to own. In the absence of any hardcore “smoking gun” evidence against Jackson, the prosecution tried desperately to make a case for several legal art books which Jackson owned as part of an extensive library, one that contained over ten thousand titles on art and photography (subjects that were of interest to him as inspiration for his own lyrics and films). These art books, as they were written up and described in the original police reports, were clearly stated as not being pornographic in nature but as items that could “possibly” be used as part of a “grooming” process (however, it is important to note that this was not a claim the prosecution was able to successfully prove in court). Secondly, it has been confirmed via a statement issued by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department that several pages of the document ― which originated with the publication Radar Online-appeared to have been falsified, with images that were never part of the original documents, claiming those images “appeared to have been taken from internet sources.” Since this story spread like proverbial wildfire through the tabloid media ― and even to legit mainstream media who apparently never bothered to fact check either the origin or contents of these documents ― we really must pause to consider how the media operates in spreading such hoax stories on celebrities. We also must ask some hard questions about why better laws are not in place to protect deceased persons-famous or not-from this kind of libel. But first, let’s start by busting some of the distorted myths and outright lies that are circulating currently. I have been a dedicated Michael Jackson researcher for seven years. I have thoroughly studied the ins and outs of the 2005 case brought against him as well as the 1993 Jordan Chandler settlement. The first thing we must address is that the information and descriptions in these reports are NOT new or “recently unearthed” reports ― this is all information that both the prosecution and defense were well aware of in 2004 when the indictment and grand jury process began. In fact, a lot of the current information being touted now was leaked then and circulated in the press after the grand jury hearings, prompting a statement to the media from Jackson’s attorney, which was signed off not only by Mesereau but also the prosecution and Judge Melville, fully acknowledging that no child pornography had been found. This was followed up by an official statement from Jackson himself, in which he specifically addressed the information that had been leaked to the media from the grand jury proceedings. It is worth keeping in mind that the grand jury hearings are a process in which the prosecution is able to present their case in its entirety without the benefit of cross examination, and includes the process of discovery whereby all potential evidentiary items are presented and discussed. Eventually, many of these books were discarded as inadmissible evidence because they were commercially available art books that anyone can purchase legally. Of the titles that were entered as admissible evidence, it was not because they were pornographic but, rather, because the prosecution felt that they might potentially bolster an argument that Jackson “could have” used the books as grooming material and in an attempt to prove some sort of predilection on Jackson’s part for males (since a few of the titles featured artsy photographs of nude males; however, these were generally titles that featured adult erotica of both sexes). The “sadomasochism” books were adult books featuring adult subjects ( Madonna’s “Sex,” for example, was a book that he was known to have shopped for in the early 1990s) and because none of these materials fit the legal definition of child pornography. This left the prosecution in the rather embarrassing situation of having to build a case on Jackson’s adult legal porn collection, which was-let’s just say-healthy, but not that unusual for a single guy. Let’s remember, these people invaded his private quarters, after all. The full list of Jackson’s adult porn that was confiscated in the Neverland raid has been widely available for many years, and consisted of over 1800 images of nude adult women. You can find the full list here. But essentially, this left the prosecution in the rather embarrassing position of trying to build a case of child molestation against a man for whom the only “evidence” they had was issues of Hustler, Playboy, Penthouse, Barely Legal, and the like ― along with, well, a lot of art books. The thing you have to keep in mind is that the prosecution never had one shred of what we might call “smoking gun” evidence ― the kind that usually leads to an easy, “case closed” conviction in cases like this. There were no explicit love letters written to any child, no photos of himself or children engaged in sexual acts, no video tapes of himself with children in lewd acts, no taped phone conversations, no online “sex chats” ― in other words, none of the things that can usually lead to an easy conviction in such cases. You have to remember that Jackson was under constant FBI surveillance for over ten years. The reports eventually concluded nothing to be found. A search of over sixteen computer hard drives seized in the 2003 raid revealed nothing except that he occasionally visited a few adult legal porn sites where he liked to log in as “Dr. Black” and “Marcel Jackson.” Juicy gossip fodder, yes. Illegal; no.In the lack of any such hard evidence, the case essentially boiled down to accuser Gavin Arvizo’s word against Jackson’s. From that point forward, the only hope that district attorneys Tom Sneddon and Ron Zonen had was to construct their prosecution as a character assassination. In their desperate attempt to make “evidence” out of no evidence, the art books were argued (unsuccessfully) as books that “could” fit the definition of what a casebook pedophile would own, and the legal porn was argued to be “grooming material” (an argument that likewise did not persuade the jury, especially after Star Arvizo, brother of Gavin Arvizo, admitted under cross examination that a magazine he had earlier claimed to have been shown by Jackson was an issue that, in fact, wasn’t even published until five months after the date of the alleged incident!). The problem is that, in the absence of any truly hardcore evidence, it becomes increasingly difficult to try to convince a jury of what someone’s “intentions” are with a particular photo or art book. You can’t second guess what is in someone’s head, or if they are using certain materials ― legal or otherwise ― for sexual gratification. That is getting into the realm of “reasonable doubt” and is not something that can be proven. The only thing a judge and jury can do is to look at a certain piece of exhibited evidence and ask: Is this pornography or is it not? And if it is pornographic, is it legal? Keep in mind that anything that isn’t, strictly speaking, child pornography cannot be held as admissible evidence because it is not criminal ― at least certainly not in the United States ― to own art books or adult legal sex books, no matter how “graphic” the imagery (much of which, also, is being grossly exaggerated in the media reports, but one thing at a time).The original Radar Online story that ran on June 20th did, in fact, acknowledge that these reports were from 2003 and are not new information, but they slanted their story in such a way that made it seem as though this was somehow “newly leaked” information or as if this was “newly discovered” evidence that somehow ― for whatever unearthly reason ― was never brought to light during the trial. This is simply not true, as all official court documents related to the 2005 case clearly show that these items were well known to both the prosecution and defense. Many of these items were discussed and exhibited before the jury in what came to be known as the infamous “Porn Day” at trial (a day for which Jackson’s very religious mother Katherine chose to sit out). What was left out was simply because it was deemed not pornographic in nature and therefore, inadmissible evidence. Let’s not forget, Michael Jackson was subjected to one of the most overzealous cases of prosecution that an individual could be put through. He had a district attorney who had made it his personal life’s ambition to put him behind bars ― or drive him permanently from Santa Barbara County, which he eventually succeeded in doing. This was a prosecution effort that combed the globe in search of “victims,” evidence, and any witnesses willing to come forth, regardless of credibility, and that spent millions in taxpayer dollars in the process. Granted, Sneddon and Zonen may have had their moments of ineptitude, but one thing they could never be accused of was being unthorough or of committing a half-assed investigation that would have left evidence of actual child pornography overlooked. Indeed, nothing in these reports was overlooked, nor was it withheld. It simply wasn’t child pornography, then or now.This is an important fact to establish because I think the impression many are getting, from the slanted media reports, is that these items being discussed are some “shocking new bombshell” revelation that has just come to light. That simply isn’t true. This is all old news from a decade ago, and there is absolutely nothing in those reports that hasn’t already had its day in court ― that is, of the items that even made it past the discovery stage. The media is trying to slant the story that way because it makes for more salacious headlines and click bait, but if you read the fine print, most have to own up at some point that these are, in fact, old documents dating to 2003 when the discovery process for the trial was underway. So, nothing new here and nothing that the attorneys, as well as the judge and jury, were not well aware of when Jackson was tried and acquitted in 2005. So the salacious and “creepy kiddy porn” of Michael Jackson’s that is currently being touted all over the media actually consists of nothing more than a few art photography books (all of which can be legally purchased through Amazon). Some of them do fall into the category of adult erotica; however, they are not pornographic and certainly not illegal for an adult to own. They include titles by award winning photographers and authors like Anne Rice, who even wrote the introduction for one of the books (Underworld) that is currently the subject of much of the media fodder. So the next question…why now? Well, that goes back to the close ties between Radar Online (formerly headed up by The National Enquirer’s Dylan Howard) and the attorneys of Wade Robson and Jimmy Safechuck, as well as a certain traitorous “friend” to the Jackson family, Stacy Brown, who has made a career off of peddling smut to the tabloids. Robson and Safechuck both have civil cases pending against the Michael Jackson estate, and Radar Online has become their ally and willing mouthpiece. We know from the statement released by the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department that the documents Radar Online obtained did not come from an official source. Here is the statement as it was released to Vanity Fair and reported in various news outlets, yet everyone who reported on this story seemed to ignore what was most damning in this statement: Some of the documents appear to be copies of reports that were authored by Sheriff’s Office personnel as well as evidentiary photographs taken by Sheriff’s Office personnel interspersed with content that appears to be obtained off the Internet or through unknown sources. The Sheriff’s Office did not release any of the documents and/or photographs to the media. The Sheriff’s Office released all of its reports and the photographs as part of the required discovery process to the prosecution and the defense.Many of the media outlets who copied the original story have now updated their information to include this statement. That is at least a step in the right direction, I suppose, but still doesn’t take into account their apparent willingness to run a story that has been blatantly identified by the very authorities who investigated the case as false information.Let’s look again at that official statement released by the Santa Barbara Sheriff’s Department with the most crucial passages emphasized:interspersed with content that appears to be obtained off the Internet or through unknown sources...The statement also makes it clear that someone other than an official source is responsible for feeding this information to Radar Online ― someone (or someones) who timed this malicious smear campaign just in time to coincide with the remembrances and celebrations of Jackson’s death anniversary ― a time when the emotions of his family, friends, and fans are most vulnerable.Most damaging to the hoax perpetrators has been the statement issued from Ron Zonen himself, one of the prosecuting attorneys who certainly would have moved heaven and earth to have the “evidence” against Michael Jackson he so desperately craved. Yet even Zonen released an official statement citing the lack of child pornography found in the investigation. As reported by People:Let’s go back to the most important statements given in Zonen’s statement: “There was no child pornography. There were no videos involving children.”So what, then, is all the hoopla about? You might be shocked and surprised to know! If one truly examines and dissects the materials and images being discussed, it turns out that not only are all of them from legal sources (art books and such) but that most of the more erotic images are of adults! So…what’s the deal here? It actually seems that a huge media storm is being created over Michael Jackson’s tastes in art and adult erotica. Like I said before: Gossip fodder? Yes, maybe. Evidence of criminal behavior? No.And Radar Online (or maybe we should say whoever was responsible for “leaking” those documents to them) also purposely tampered with many of those images to make them “appear” more explicit than they actually are, as per this example. On the right is the image as Radar online posted it. On the left is the original image from the book Bidgood by James Bidgood, which is a legal book of adult male photography. On the left is the original image in Bidgood’s book. On the right is the image as it was then “doctored” in the falsified documents. As you can see, Radar Online (or someone) purposely blocked out the crotches so as to make it appear as if the young men in Bidgood’s photo were naked, when in fact they were actually clothed in shorts. But it gets even better!A few days later, Canadian artist Jonathan Hobin, author of In The Playroom, spoke out to both the Canadian press and social media about how his work had been similarly used by Radar Online to help falsify the Jackson documents. Hobin’s “American Idol” photo, featured as part of his In The Playroom collection, was a photo featuring a JonBenet Ramsey lookalike dressed in beauty pageant regalia with a noose tied around her neck.It was a photo that Radar Online ― as well as every other media outlet who picked up the story ― had a virtual field day with as “evidence” of Jackson’s “stockpile of “creepy” and “gory kiddie porn pictures featuring torture of children.” As it turned out, there were three major problems with this screaming headline: 1. The image is part of a legit art collection ― one that has been featured in many of the same media outlets that are now mocking Jackson, including The Huffington Post who ran a very positive feature on Hobin’s work in 2013. But it gets even better (or worse, depending on whether you are a “glass is half-full or half-empty” kind of person). 2: In The Playroom was a book published in 2008, which means even if it is legitimate art (and it is!) it is not a book that Jackson could have possibly owned in 2003 at the time Neverland was raided. Which leads us to 3: This image, then, was never part of the original 2003 police reports, and the fact that it was at first included within the original 88-page document released by Radar Online is evidence of the kind of tampering that the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Department was referring to.But the forgery doesn’t end there. The original police reports contained no images at all but only verbal descriptions of the books’ contents.Here is the original police report of items seized at Neverland.And here is the Radar Online version of the documents which originally ran with their 6/20 story.This means that those images placed into the original 88-page report that Radar Online ran were either planted there by Radar Online or by the persons who submitted those documents. It appears that many of the images inserted, like Hobin’s photo among others, were not even from the titles being claimed in the report but, rather, from related titles of books Jackson did not even own. This would indicate that whoever submitted those reports conducted a sloppy Google search to acquire those images, without bothering to check if the images legitimately came from the titles in question. For example, it has since come to light that several of the more graphic photos that Radar Online claimed to have come from The Fourth Sex: Adolescent Extremes (an art book Jackson did own) were, in fact, from a list of favorite books by art photographer and “Dazed” editor Isabella Burley, who included the book on a list of her five favorite books (the images, it turns out, were taken from those other titles on her list, none of which were books that Jackson owned). You can read more about how that forgery was framed here. This would indicate that whoever was responsible for “leaking” these decade old documents to Radar Online not only were aware that no such images existed in the original documents but that, also, they were either extremely inept with use of the Google search engine or else were on a deliberate and malicious campaign to falsify those documents with purposely chosen salacious images that would then appear even more salacious when taken out of context.Interestingly, the persons responsible for this “leak” left an intriguing clue to their identity, which many sharp-eyed Jackson fans were quick to note: Cryptic notes left on Page 25 (which also were not part of the original police report documents) stating that “Zonen is retired and will talk” and listing a current phone number for Gordon Auchincloss (Ron Zonen and Gordon Auchincloss were both prosecuting attorneys for the 2005 Jackson case). These are current notes that have obviously been recently added (Zonen is retired now, but obviously was not back in 2003-04 when these documents were first drawn up). For many Jackson fans, this lends credibility to the idea that this latest smear campaign must have originated with the attorneys of Wade Robson and Jimmy Safechuck, two young men who both have civil cases pending against the Michael Jackson estate. It is also worth noting that as soon as Jonathan Hobin spoke out to the media, Radar Online’s original 88-page report shrunk by twenty-seven pages to a mere 61-page-report! Clearly, haste was made to scrub the documents clean of those faked photos. And it was only within days of the mysterious vanishing act of those twenty-seven missing pages that a new “distraction” story was planted by long time Jackson family “frenemy” Stacy Brown regarding false and slanderous allegations about Jackson’s nephews. That was an allegation first raised by the prosecution when some “questionable” photos were seized of Jackson and three of his nephews ― Taj, Terryl, and TJ Jackson of the pop group 3T. However, as it turned out, those “photos” in question were actually part of a professional album shoot for 3T’s debut album, Brotherhood, an album Michael Jackson produced. More specifically, as stated, the photos in question were part of the photo shoot for the single “Why” which featured Michael Jackson in a “guest vocalist” capacity. This was a professional photo shoot that was conducted by celebrity photographer Jonathan Exley, and according to Jackson’s makeup artist Karen Faye, who was present for the shoot, was carried out in the full company of hundreds of witnesses who were also present for the shoot. The photos in question are sexy, and undeniably, the intent was to play up the “beefcake” appeal to the group’s mostly young female fanbase. In any case, the concept for the album photo shoot was not Jackson’s. And the fact that the prosecution tried so desperately to even construe an album photo shoot as “evidence” against Jackson should tell you something. It also should tell you a lot about what is happening now, with many of these same items that were so obviously twisted out of context a decade ago now being recycled to provide fresh media fodder.This was not the only incident in which the prosecution had attempted to misconstrue and misappropriate elements of Jackson’s art as “evidence.” On page 73 of the original Radar Online documents, a Polaroid photo depicting two boys from a Hollywood movie set is described as having the inscription “Are You Scared Yet?” and “Ha Ha!” across the bottom. A handwritten note scribbled between the lines of the official report (not present in the original report, and interestingly in what appears to be the same handwriting as the added note on Page 25 above) states that this is a “Code message equating safety to sex-frighten child and get them in bed.” Except there is a huge problem with this theory: As any diehard Jackson fan knows, “Are you scared yet?” is the famous tagline from Jackson’s 1997 film Ghosts. To attempt to construe this as being anything “other” than a harmless reference to Ghosts is pure speculation. But it is typical of the manner in which the prosecution attempted to build its case against Jackson.However, these additional notes which were obviously added to the original reports before they were handed over to Radar Online, as were the inserted internet images and several pages of inserted articles relating the drug Percocet to sex addiction. Percocet, a prescription painkiller that gained notoriety following the recent investigation into Prince’s death, was found on the premises during the 2003 raid; however, the original documents make no such claim as attempting to link the drug to sex addiction. Curiously, many of the added pages all bear one thing in common ― the date 1/10/16 ― which would appear to date the time of the forgery to approximately five months prior to the orchestrated timing of their “release” on June 20th. Unfortunately, the media has become an all too willing participant, creating a skewered picture in which tabloid sensationalism and spotty fact checking are allowed to stand. What’s more, it seems even the words of the actual authorities involved in the 2003-2005 case against Jackson are being ignored beneath an onslaught of “click bait” headlines and grossly exaggerated reporting. Some unscrupulous reporters have even gone so far as to suggest Jackson could have molested his own children ― an utterly absurd and ridiculous claim that has no basis in actual fact, and what’s more, is a particularly cruel and malicious slander against a man for whom his children have never expressed anything other than loving adoration. It is also an inexcusable exercise in emotional cruelty towards Jackson’s children, one of whom is still a minor child and one who has already attempted suicide due to her emotionally fragile state since her father’s passing. I find it even more disturbing that no one has thought to raise the question of ethical media or moral responsibility in all of this. To accuse someone of the possession of child pornography is to accuse someone of a criminal offense ― one that, if the accused person were alive, would be an accusation worthy of a criminal conviction and the permanent label of a sex offender. But a living person can at least take action against such media libel. They can sue for defamation. They can refute the claims. They can defend themselves. The dead have no such redress, and there is something inherently wrong with the idea of bringing such serious accusations against a man who is not here to defend himself-one who had his day in court eleven years ago, and what’s worse, to attempt to retry him in the court of public opinion based on the same circumstantial “evidence” with which the prosecution tried-and failed-to convict him back in 2005. Where does the insanity end? Seven years ago, we lost an amazing artist, man, and humanitarian. Recently, in the wake of the tragic shooting in Orlando, people gathered en masse for a candlelight vigil and sang Jackson’s “Heal The World.” From Ferguson, Missouri and Black Lives Matter to recent events in Paris and Orlando, Jackson’s music remains our call to awakening, reminding us of the need to be brought together as a global family. No doubt, with even more recent tragic events that have ignited our nation’s racial divide this week, people will once again turn to Jackson’s music, as they always have, for its power to heal and unite.Frankly, if the world spent a lot more time listening to the words Michael Jackson wrote, rather than obsessing over what he had in his bedroom, we would be the better off. Jackson’s personal life has already been well dissected. He was put through a grueling and publicly humiliating trial that left nothing to the imagination-his inner sanctity completely ransacked, his most private possessions put up for public inspection; even his own body violated.Charles Thomson’s excellent 2013 article “One Of The Most Shameful Episodes In Journalistic History,” is a harrowing account of that trial’s media coverage and the toll it took on Jackson. Sadly, nothing has changed. My point is that there is nothing new here to see. All of this “evidence” was hashed out in court a decade ago. So why is Radar Online so gleefully jumping on this fabricated smear campaign, regurgitating decades old information for which Michael Jackson has long been tried for, and acquitted? Why the need to bait a gullible public into believing that a list of items that was reviewed and dismissed as “evidence” twelve years ago is somehow front page burning news in 2016?Strangely, perhaps, the first thing I thought of when this story hit was the recently renewed controversy over the Confederate flag. President Obama said that the Confederate flag needs to be retired permanently to a museum, where it can be remembered and viewed as a part of history, but should not be flown as an act of defiance for an ideal that no longer exists. I feel the same way about all of this regurgitated information from Michael Jackson’s trial. Those documents (the real ones, that is) have resided in the Santa Barbara County records’ department for over a decade. They are a part of history, but no longer relevant. The trial ended in acquittal on all fourteen counts on June 13th, 2005, and Michael Jackson died on June 25th, 2009.But just as there are some individuals who will never accept that the Civil War ended in 1865, so, too, is a faction who will never accept that Michael Jackson was fully exonerated by a court of law in 2005. To this end, they will continue to lie, to rehash and sensationalize old stories, to distort truth and yes, even to fabricate new “evidence” where none exists. I can only see this as a thinly veiled attempt to keep an old battle going that has already long been fought ― and won.If you read this and agree that we need better laws to protect the deceased against this kind of slander, please sign this petition for the Anti-Defamation Legacy Law Advocates. It is an initiative that, if passed into law, will enable the heirs of deceased persons the same laws and protection against libel in the media as living persons currently have. UPDATE 7/13/16: Since this article was first posted, many have been asking about the exact titles of the books in question. As I mentioned in the comments below, I have been doing an ongoing series on the contents of the original 2004 police documents of the items seized from Neverland, and all of the titles are listed and described in the original police report linked to above. But to give an “at glance” summation of the books in question, here is a list of the art books that were seized from Neverland back in 2003. These are all legal titles; as I mentioned before. All with the exception of two are available on Amazon; one that is not is nevertheless available at Cornell University Library.All are cataloged in the Library of Congress. None fit the legal definition of pornography, much less child pornography. While some of the titles do contain nudity, they are nevertheless works that would qualify as art rather than as obscene or pornographic. A few of the titles, at best, seem to qualify as adult erotica photography; at least one (The Art of Dave Nestler: Wicked Intentions) appears to be a book of softcore bondage (adult females). Of all the below titles, Simen Johan’s Room To Play has probably been most responsible for many of the more salacious media headlines, as Johan’s style (like that of Jonathan Hobin) often features photographs of children in what appear to be extreme or neglectful conditions. The “morphing” photographs in Johan’s book-where children’s faces appeared to be superimposed over adult bodies (and vice versa)-are clearly part of an artistic statement about the loss of childhood and what happens when children are forced too soon into the turmoil and pain of adulthood-a subject that Jackson spoke of, and sang about, quite often as a result of his own traumatic childhood. With songs like the gothic “Little Susie,” in which a little girl is murdered”and “Do You Know Where Your Children Are?” in which he sang about the plight of childhood runaways to “Hollywood Nights” which is a tale of a teenage girl who sells herself to make it into the movies, it was clear that Jackson deeply identified with these darker aspects of childhood-it was this pain and darkness that also inspired his vision for a better world in songs like “Heal The World.” The Fourth Sex: Adolescent Extremes by Jake ChapmanCronos by Pere FormigueraUnderworld by Kelly Klein (this was the title with the introduction from author Anne Rice)Room To Play by Simen JohanDrew and Jimmy by John Patrick SalisburyDressup Playacts and Fantasies of Childhood by Starr OckengaCamp Cove Photos: Sydney Men by Rod McRaeScenes D’ Interieur by Alexandra DupouyThe Art of Dave Nestler: Wicked IntentionsGynoids: Genetically Manipulated by Hajime SorayamaBidgood by James BidgoodNaked as a Jaybird by Dian HansonBeach Portraits by Rineke DijkstraPoo-chi by Mayumi LakeTaorimina by Wilheim Von GloedenThe Chop Suey Club by Bruce WeberRobert Maxwell PhotographsBob and Rod by Tom BianchiBefore The Hand of Man by Roy DeanThe Golden Age of Neglect by Ed TempletonSexual Study of a Man by Larry Stevens (not on Amazon, but available in Cornell University Library!). So now that you have the list, let’s address what these titles actually meant in terms of a prosecution attempting to build a case. Remember, I had stated earlier that a hefty amount of adult legal, heterosexual pornography had also been confiscated-some of which did become admissible evidence in court-but the above art books, in particular, were isolated out of a library of thousands of titles (Jackson, always an avid reader, was once said to have owned an estimated ten thousand books) and for only one reason: Either because they featured nudity (which could potentially be part of a grooming process, according to the prosecution) or because they possibly could be argued to show a predilection for males, which they believed would make the testimony of their witness more credible. Jackson was truly in a no-win situation-his straight porn and erotica was argued by the prosecution as “grooming material” while any books featuring male nudity (actually only a very small percentage of the titles he owned as compared to his vast collection of straight porn) were argued to be somehow indicative of his tastes (as if being gay in and of itself would automatically qualify one as a pedophile-but this was exactly the argument the prosecution was trying to make!).This might give you some idea of just why the People Vs. Jackson trial in 2005 was indeed so convoluted. Here was a case built on no hardcore evidence whatsoever, in which even the prosecution had been forced to admit that no child pornography had ever been found, and which seemed to be founded solely on the word of a family who had abruptly only decided that Jackson had molested their son after having received their walking papers from Neverland (the Arvizo family had been guests on the property while Gavin recovered from cancer, but soon developed a sense of entitlement according to many witnesses, running up expensive tabs on Jackson’s credit cards and vandalizing the property). The accusers, however, could provide no actual evidence of wrongdoing; later, the raid of Neverland produced no actual evidence, either. But that did not stop the prosecution from confiscating anything and everything that they thought could possibly be used against him. In this goal, they failed miserably-but it certainly wasn’t for lack of effort. Although many fans had issues with the recent Jackson biography The Genius of Michael Jackson by Steve Knopper, Knopper did provide this very enlightening statement about the Jackson trial. It may be worth remembering that Knopper, a past contributing editor for Rolling Stone, did not go into his project as a “fan,” per se, but as a neutral journalist with an interest in Jackson’s story Like many such journalists, his stance on Jackson’s guilt or innocence has been mostly neutral but even an impartial writer like Knopper could not ignore the confusing spectacle that the prosecution made of Jackson’s private life:The prosecution also played up the sexually explicit websites, briefcases full of nudie magazines, and centerfold cutouts...[B]ut the strategy backfired. It made Michael Jackson seem like a heterosexual male-Knopper 290-291This was exactly what I meant above when I said this was a trial that left literally nothing to imagination. The jury in 2005 had every opportunity to see what Jackson possessed, as well as what he did not. People may form their own conclusions about his tastes in art, or even if they are prudent enough, his tastes in adult erotica. But let’s keep something in perspective: What was the man put on trial for? His tastes in art and erotica, his character, or to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether a crime had been committed?The campaign to “re-try” Michael Jackson in the court of public opinion is obviously, as I said before, one that has been quite carefully orchestrated as well as quite deliberately and maliciously planned. But the degree to which this particular lie was perpetuated is beyond reprehensible, and should serve as a wake-up call to media everywhere that fact checking must go before sensationalism. . ,"

She somehow gets her subjects eyes to sparkle, every time.But that's just on the outside. Once you delve into Brooke's work, you'll find that she's crafted intriguing stories through the use of photographs.(The above being said, if you've read my past articles, you'll have noticed that I can never let an opportunity pass by when there's a connection to my 1980's television show ""V"" ... so what's the connection with Brooke Mason and ""V""? Actress Jane Badler lives in Australia! [It's only far fetched if you don't know me.])Brooke! You distracted me with the whole Australia thing! By the way, I noticed you like black and white, like me.Oh. Brooke's had some amazing shows this year that you can Google info on, in case you missed them. Be sure to check out her most recent one called AWAKEN: the female voice.You grew up in Sydney, Australia and later moved to California. How old were you at the time? Where'd you live? How'd you make ends meet while you were getting settled in the United States?I left Sydney for NYC when I was 19 and fell in love with the US. While getting my Graduate degree at The Neighborhood Playhouse I made my way working nights as a receptionist at a rehearsal studio. I commuted from Astoria, Queens where I shared a small apartment with several students. Four years later I made my stop in LA and it was a big culture shock, or should I say ""lack of culture"" shock. In Los Angeles I modeled, acted, did make-up and hair to make ends meet. I then started a successful dessert business (I love to cook), sold in Whole Foods called Marsha's Tasty Treats; named after my Mother Marsha. In the years I've lived in LA it's been nice to see a progression of culture and art, I'm proud to call LA my home.How were you introduced to your mentor, art critic and curator, Peter Frank?I met Peter Frank in Los Angeles in 2013 with my series ""La Haute Main"". It was the first time I felt that someone actually got what I was doing. He saw past the sexuality that others were gluing onto and was able to see where I'm truly coming from. I love our ""tea with light conversation"" afternoon chats, though honestly there is nothing light about the talks we get into. He has been an amazing mentor for me with my most recent curatorial debuts.In your early photography years, you actually developed film in a dark room. What was that process like compared to today's digital world?I will always have a soft spot for using a film camera, and if it wasn't for this rat wheel paced life, I would still be photographing on film. Even today, I rarely go over thirty frames in one set-up because of habits I developed early on. Back in my film days I was experimenting with retouching and composting imagery through different creative ways of exposing film onto photo paper. It was an exciting time!One bonus about working digital is I never have days where a roll won't develop. You know what's happening as you shoot. There's a positive and ""negative"" to both. Hah! Please excuse the pun.Who was your FIRST celebrity shoot? How'd you get that job?Early on photographing a celebrity is such a boost for a photographer's career, we almost never get paid. My first celebrity I photographed is my good friend Ken Davitian (most famous for the film Borat). I asked him to pose for me as King Henry VIII and as Marquis de Sade. I still chuckle at the shoot... it's on my website.What drew you to the female body for your photography?In my commercial life I photograph about 50/50 men and women, but as a fine art photographer I'm currently interested in expressing the female form in her most beautiful and powerful way. The men are often used as a part of the story and not the main attraction. As a feminist I highlight struggles and sexism, often tell personal stories from my own life experiences. I'm not drawn to photographing landscapes or objects because they don't feed my sociological concerns.Did you ever take photography courses or are you self-taught?I'm a self-taught photographer. My art is about telling stories. Although I believe in always learning my main objective to telling these stories through my work and not getting caught up in the technicalities. What hobbies do you have?I'm a bit of a workaholic and I do understand the idea of trying to balance my life although I fail miserably most of the time. When I do take a little time out I'll go to art exhibits, museums and lectures about art. I love taking my large fluffy Barbet to run at the beach, I'm a huge animal lover. Plus I have this crazy addiction to Amy Schumer. [NOTE FROM ILANA - Hey Brooke! I saw Amy Schumer live at Madison Square Garden when she opened for Madonna's last tour! Amy was her usual bit of awesome!]Where do you shop for clothes / shoes?Now you're talking my language! I love to find a bargain. I will scout designer second stores for finds and sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and pay full price on some ""must have"" designer item. I believe it's important to feel proud in what you're wearing, it's your statement to the world.What do you think about as you're falling asleep?I usually try not to think before I go to sleep... that's really my biggest challenge. But I do keep a note pad next to my bed and before a shoot day I will start thinking about compositions and how they tell my story. So I draw these silly stick figures of where the models will be and I'll bring that to set with me. Of course, no one can translate it but me.Anything else you'd like to say?I'm a core team member of an amazing empowering group called Women Manifest. We put on some incredible events for Women's History Month in March in West Hollywood and the greater Los Angeles Area. We have some other events coming up throughout the year."

Our city, our country, is better than that.”By many accounts, the Dallas Police Department is a national example for other cities looking to work with protesters and the larger community to reduce violence.After the department began training officers in de-escalation tactics, excessive-force complaints plummeted from 147 in 2009 to 53 in 2014. Along with that, notes BuzzFeed News, the city’s overall rate of arrests has declined, along with the murder rate, which hit an 80-year low in 2014.Prior to Thursday’s violence, Dallas police officers were posing for pictures with the protesters. “We’ve had this kind of impact basically through training, community policing and holding officers accountable,” Brown told The Dallas Morning News in 2015, explaining the substantial shift. “This is the most dramatic development in policing anywhere in the country.”Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings echoed that sentiment on Friday, telling reporters that Dallas has fewer police-involved shootings than any other large American city.“This police department trained in de-escalation far before cities across America did it,” Rawlings said. “We are one of the premier community policing cities in the country. We are working hard to improve, and there’s always room for improvement. But we are best in class we feel.”Perhaps the most telling expression of this ethos comes from Maj. Max Geron, a security studies scholar who heads up the Dallas Police Department’s media relations department. Following the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, Geron told The Washington Post the “ideal police response to a protest is no response at all,” citing research he completed for his master’s thesis.“Most protesters will meet, protest, and go home when they feel they’ve made their point. If they aren’t breaking any laws, they can be left to express themselves,” Geron explained.“When you establish arbitrary rules that have no basis in law, the police then feel they have to enforce those rules or they look illegitimate. They can set these rules with the best of intentions, but they just end up creating more problems for themselves,” he added. “You want to let people exercise their constitutional rights without interference.”In addition to reconfigured police training, Brown has also emphasized transparency.After the July 2012 shooting of an unarmed black man sparked outrage, Brown credited an honest, open news conference for helping to calm tensions. “We answered every question from reporters,” he told The Dallas Morning News at the time. “The community returned to calm. The city calmed down.”“Trust is hard to earn and easy to lose,” he added. This spring, the force announced it would join a small group of other departments across the country and begin tracking and publicly releasing data for all officer-involved shootings, with the goal of building trust.“We try our best to be transparent — and I can tell you that not all cops like it,” Brown said. “It does open us up to criticism, threats and exposure of every mistake we make. But it’s the right thing to do.”This story was updated after a post on social media was deleted by the user.READ MORE ON THE DALLAS POLICE MASSACRESniper Attack Leaves 5 Police Officers Dead, 7 InjuredWhat We Know About The Police Officers Slain In The Dallas Sniper AttackObama Says Dallas Police Shooting ‘Despicable,’ Highlights Need For Gun ControlMicah Johnson Identified As Dallas Shooting SuspectEyewitness Captures Moment Dallas Protest Turned From Calm To ChaosWitnesses Record Horror Of Dallas AttackA Dallas Cop Saved This Man’s Life As ‘The War Began’Former NYPD Detective Gets Emotional Over Dallas ShootingWoman Who Filmed Dallas Shooting Was ‘Terrified’ And ‘Confused’In The Face Of Violence, Dallas Police Vow To Continue De-Escalation TacticsPretty Much Anyone In Texas Can Openly Carry A Weapon Of War"

In April 2015, after an Instagram post on the incident, Anthony was spotted with protestors in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody from a spinal injury. In Anthony’s opinion, what he’s done is not enough, and neither is the work of other athletes who’ve spoken up against police violence. He also condemned acts of violence against police officers as solution, writing, “Shooting 11 cops and killing 5 WILL NOT work.” Though Anthony admitted most people, including himself, do not have a solution, he knows it starts with us all “com[ing] together more than anything at this time.”Hopefully this is the start of a new era for professional athletes, one where there is no longer a reluctancy to speak up on social issues out of fear of lost endorsements or, as Anthony put it, whether people will be “look[ing] at us crazy.” "

I’ve tried that. A couple social media post/tweet [sic] doesn’t work,” he wrote in his post, drawing on his own activist experiences over the past few years. In April 2015, after an Instagram post on the incident, Anthony was spotted with protestors in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody from a spinal injury. In Anthony’s opinion, what he’s done is not enough, and neither is the work of other athletes who’ve spoken up against police violence. He also condemned acts of violence against police officers as solution, writing, “Shooting 11 cops and killing 5 WILL NOT work.” Though Anthony admitted most people, including himself, do not have a solution, he knows it starts with us all “com[ing] together more than anything at this time.”Hopefully this is the start of a new era for professional athletes, one where there is no longer a reluctancy to speak up on social issues out of fear of lost endorsements or, as Anthony put it, whether people will be “look[ing] at us crazy.” "

Revealingly, Ginsburg seemed to signal that she’d rather have Hillary Clinton shape the makeup of the Supreme Court, where as many as four seats ― including her own ― could be in play.“It’s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make,” Ginsburg said.At 83, the matriarch on the nation’s high court hasn’t been shy about the need for a fully functioning bench. In May, she said at a conference that having eight justices “is not a good number” for the Supreme Court.This suggests Ginsburg is keenly aware of the political battle over the Scalia seat, which has found Senate Republicans entrenched in an unprecedented blockade of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s choice for the post.Justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy ― each of them instrumental in recent landmark rulings on abortion and affirmative action ― are also on the verge of turning 80, and thus possibly near retirement, which underscores Ginsburg’s comment that the high court is indeed “up for grabs” this election cycle.The presumptive nominees for both parties seem to be on notice. In January, Clinton suggested in an op-ed that a Republican president would “break” the Supreme Court, while Trump has tried to allay fears that he’s not fit to nominate conservative justices by offering up a list of potential candidates."
14,TECH,Dallas Police's 'Bomb Robot' Raises Sticky Questions,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dallas-police-bomb-robot_us_577fbed9e4b0c590f7e8fc62,"""What does ‘objectively reasonable’ lethal robotic force look like?""",2016-07-08,"Last year, Dallas Police used this robot to access an armored van that they believed was rigged with explosives.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577fc7561b00002600f6cc51.jpeg?cache=FLZPgYa62H&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For perhaps the first time, police in the United States used a remote-controlled robot to engage and kill a suspect Thursday following a tense standoff in Dallas, Texas.The robot deployed in Dallas is normally used to disarm explosives, Mashable reported, but police outfitted it with a bomb that was delivered to the suspect and detonated.“We saw no other option but to use our bomb robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was,” Dallas Police Chief David Brown told the outlet. Both the Dallas County Sheriff and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas use a type of robot called Marcbot-IV, according to a database operated by Bard College. These devices are explicitly created to dispose of explosives.They look like this: The Dallas Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for more details from The Huffington Post. Meanwhile, a report from Popular Science indicated that the Dallas Police Department used a different type of bomb disposal robot, called a “Remotec,” to access an armored van during a standoff last year. Over 90 percent of police bomb squad units use Remotecs, a spokesman for Northrop Grumman, the military technology company behind the robot, told Vice last year.Northrop Grumman declined to comment when reached by HuffPost.Whether the robot in this case was a Marcbot-IV or Remotec, it’s worth reiterating a couple of things: The robot wasn’t a drone, wasn’t autonomous and wasn’t originally designed to kill anyone. You could think of it like a really big, really complex Tyco R/C car.As Quartz Technology Reporter Mike Murphy put it:Still, the fact remains that the police deployed a robot with the intent to kill a suspect, which some say sets a worrying precedent about lethal force that’s completely separate from the ethical considerations of shooting a gun.“The legal framework for police use of force assumes human decision-making about immediate human threats,” Elizabeth Joh, a professor of law specializing in policing and technology at the University of California Davis, told HuffPost. “What does that mean when the police are far away from a suspect posing a threat? What does ‘objectively reasonable’ lethal robotic force look like?”Joh recognizes that this wasn’t a complex killing machine, but she argues its deployment indicates how easy it would be for police to launch more advanced weaponry without oversight. After all, they transformed a bomb disposal robot into a bomb delivery robot.“This seems to be a jury-rigged robot. What happens when a police department buys the first AI police robot capable of lethal force? No clear answers, but the future’s already here,” Joh said.Some have made the case that robots with the capacity to kill could actually help save lives. In an interview with HuffPost last month, noted robotics expert Ronald Arkin said these autonomous weapons could theoretically be used to protect people in certain situations.“The hope is that if these systems can be designed appropriately and used in situations where they will be used appropriately; that they can reduce collateral damage significantly,” Arkin told HuffPost at the time."
15,POLITICS,This Could Be The Beginning Of The End For Super PACs,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/super-pacs-end-speechnow_us_577eb62be4b0344d514e83ab,A legal dream team is going to work. Dun dun dun.,2016-07-08,They're challenging the court decision that launched a thousand super PACs.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577eb8841a00002700dd015a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― The super PAC money swamping the American election system is generally, and rightly, blamed on the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling. But a lower court decision that relied on Citizens United ultimately opened the floodgates.Now a team of high-powered lawyers is seeking to overturn that lower court decision and upend the legal basis for super PACs.They filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday on behalf of a bipartisan group of congressmen, congressional candidates and advocacy groups. It’s the first step in what will likely be a multiyear legal effort challenging SpeechNow.org v. FEC, ending up before the justices. “For years, campaign finance defenders have been on the defensive in court,” Ron Fein, a member of the legal team, said at a Capitol Hill press conference on Thursday. “Today that changes.”Fein works for the anti-Citizens United advocacy group Free Speech for People, which is also a party to the case. Beside Fein, the attorneys taking on super PACs include Norm Eisen, the former ethics czar and ambassador to the Czech Republic under President Barack Obama; Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe; University of Minnesota law professor Richard Painter, a former ethics czar under President George W. Bush; University of Chicago law professor Albert Alschuler; John Bonifaz, president of Free Speech for People; and Anne Weismann, executive director of the nonprofit Citizens for Accountability, which is another party to the case.The target of their complaint is a 2010 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. SpeechNow.org v. FEC provides the legal underpinning for independent expenditure-only political committees, more commonly known as super PACs.The key characteristic of super PACs is that they can accept unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions and other political action committees. They were recognized by the FEC after the appeals court in SpeechNow.org ruled that political committees could accept unlimited contributions if they spent money only on independent expenditures and did not donate to candidate campaigns.SpeechNow.org was decided just two months after the Citizens United ruling. In holding that corporations and unions could spend unlimited sums of their own money on electoral efforts not coordinated with candidates and political parties, Justice Anthony Kennedy declared in Citizens United that such independent expenditures “do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Decades of court rulings had already established that the only permissible reason to limit campaign money is if those restrictions would combat government corruption or the appearance thereof.According to the D.C. Circuit, Kennedy’s assertion also served to resolve the question of whether the FEC could apply contribution limits to groups like SpeechNow.org.“In light of the [Supreme] Court’s holding as a matter of law that independent expenditures do not corrupt or create the appearance of quid pro quo corruption, contributions to groups that make only independent expenditures also cannot corrupt or create the appearance of corruption,” the appeals court said.The D.C. Circuit’s ruling never went up to the high court. The Justice Department declined to seek Supreme Court review because, according to then-Attorney General Eric Holder, “the particularly limited nature of SpeechNow’s contribution and expenditure practices means that the court of appeals’ decision will affect only a small subset of federally regulated contributions.” (Talk about famous last words.)The complaint challenging SpeechNow.org is aimed at pushing the courts, in particular the Supreme Court, to reconsider that decision in light of how it has actually impacted elections.The legal team argues that the SpeechNow.org ruling incorrectly extended the Citizens United decision, which concerned independent spending on electoral efforts, to the realm of contributions to political committees. They contend that federal contribution limits should still apply to super PACs.It’s hard to argue that many super PACs are truly engaging in independent electoral efforts. Legally, they’re not allowed to coordinate with candidates, but in practice a symbiotic relationship has developed between the two groups. Almost all major spending by super PACs comes from those committees that are connected to the candidates themselves or that act as arms of party leadership. High-level staffers routinely decamp from candidate campaigns to run supportive super PACs. Candidates can raise funds for those super PACs, so long as they do not directly ask for a contribution above $5,400 (that’s the current limit). These fundraising events can be as cozy as the candidate and just one or two donors. And campaigns regularly post video and photos of their candidate on the internet for their favored super PACs to use.As to the question of whether super PAC contributions can corrupt or create the appearance of corruption, Fein pointed out that while candidates cannot technically speak to supportive super PACs about how to spend all that money, they can speak to the donors who make super PAC contributions. Last year’s indictment of Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) indicates that the Justice Department sees this the possibility for quid pro quo corruption here. Menendez was indicted for allegedly pressuring executive branch officials to intervene on behalf of a donor in exchange for the donor making monetary contributions ― which included $600,000 to a super PAC supporting the senator.“The complaint that we’re filing today shows that large super PACs do create at least the appearance of corruption,” Alschuler said at the press conference.The FEC complaint targets 10 super PACs that have spent or are expected to spend large sums of money in congressional races against particular candidates. The individual plaintiffs in the case are Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Reps. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) and Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), and congressional candidates Zephyr Teachout (D-N.Y.), John Howe (R-Minn.) and Michael Wager (D-Ohio). All of them either have faced attacks by super PACs financed by six- or seven-figure contributions, or expect to face them.“I look forward to a rational court overturning the SpeechNow decision,” said Lieu, who has been hit by two super PACs with big-money donors.Jones, who was attacked by a Republican super PAC funded by multiple million-dollar donations in his 2014 primary campaign, noted that he is the only Republican House member to co-sponsor legislation to override the Citizens United decision and to create a system of public financing for congressional candidates. He said that joining this case is “probably the greatest honor I have had since being in Congress for 20 years.”Jones hopes the SpeechNow.org challenge can help “return the power to the people.”There is some justification for such hope. For several decades now, sympathetic courts have generally sided with conservative proponents of eliminating campaign finance restrictions. But the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a strong opponent of campaign finance limits, leaves an opening on the Supreme Court, and there’s a reasonable chance that vacancy will be filled by a Democratic president’s nominee. By the time this case could reach the Supreme Court, it might be a much more inviting place for reformers."
16,QUEER VOICES,George Takei Isn't Happy With His 'Star Trek' Character Being Gay,Curtis M.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577f1fae1a000024006f9246.jpeg?cache=OfjGZnICau&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Star Trek Beyond” actor John Cho revealed in a Thursday interview that he and the new movie’s creative team have depicted one of the series’ most iconic characters, Hikaru Sulu, as a gay man in honor of George Takei, who originated the role onscreen 50 years ago.Only there’s one problem: Takei isn’t exactly thrilled by the nod. The 79-year-old actor and outspoken LGBT rights activist told The Hollywood Reporter Thursday that he thinks Sulu being in a same-sex relationship goes against what “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry intended. “I’m delighted that there’s a gay character,” Takei, who came out in 2005, said. “Unfortunately, it’s a twisting of Gene’s creation, to which he put in so much thought. I think it’s really unfortunate.” Takei said Cho, who plays Sulu, called him a year ago to tell him the character would not only be gay, but also raising a daughter in“Star Trek Beyond,” which hits theaters July 22. During that call, Takei said he asked Cho to persuade screenwriter Simon Pegg and director Justin Lin to create an entirely new character who would identify as gay instead. “I told him, ‘Be imaginative and create a character who has a history of being gay, rather than Sulu, who had been straight all this time, suddenly being revealed as being closeted,’” Takei said. A later call from Lin wasn’t enough to sway Takei’s opinion. Although Takei said the conversation with Lin left him feeling like a new gay character would, in fact, be created, he received an email from Cho confirming that wasn’t going to be the case a month ago. While news of Sulu’s sexuality is certainly drumming up buzz for “Star Trek Beyond,” Takei said he remains disappointed. “I really tried to work with these people when at long last the issue of gay equality was going to be addressed,” he said. Takei’s response may comes as a bit of a surprise to fans, given the actor’s devotion to LGBT advocacy in recent years. He has expressed interest in making the “Star Trek” universe more inclusive in the past. In 2015, he told Time magazine that he’d once asked Roddenberry why the franchise, which depicted biracial relationships and tackled other civil rights issues, didn’t include any LGBT characters.According to Takei, Roddenberry told him, “If I dealt with that issue I wouldn’t be able to deal with any issue because I would be canceled.”As The Hollywood Reporter writer Seth Abramovitch pointed out in an article Thursday, the decision to depict Sulu as a gay man is somewhat anachronistic. Part of a reboot trilogy, “Star Trek Beyond” is supposed to take place before the action of the original series. In the “Star Trek” universe, that means that Sulu would’ve been in a same-sex relationship years before deciding to go into the closet. Yikes. Meanwhile, Cho told Australia’s Herald Sun on Thursday that he “liked the approach” to his character’s sexuality in “Star Trek Beyond” in that the film doesn’t make “a big thing” out of it. So here’s to hoping the plot point is handled in good taste. "
17,POLITICS,Why This Congresswoman Thinks Kids Will Lead The Food Waste Revolution,Krithika Varagur,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chellie-pingree-food-waste-interview_us_577d04eae4b09b4c43c1a243,Rep. Chellie Pingree is heading the legislative fight against food waste.,2016-07-08,"Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) introduced the Food Recovery Act, the first-ever proposed federal legislation on food waste, in 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577d052d1800002400fa41e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the congresswoman leading the fight for better laws around food waste, using up leftovers was just a way of life.“I come from New England, home of Yankee thrift,” Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) told The Huffington Post. “Wasting food wasn’t even a concept. But I realized, once I grew up, that this wasn’t the case for most Americans.”In December, Pingree introduced the Food Recovery Act and the Food Date Labeling Act in the House ― the first-ever congressional bills on the issue. The legislation takes an expansive view of food waste, with provisions on everything from farm waste to imperfect produce to more extensive USDA research. Pingree gave HuffPost an inside look at her campaign during a phone interview that touched on how food waste intersects with cultural values, climate change and education.How did you first become interested in food waste as a target of legislation?It first came to my attention at The New York Times’ Food for Tomorrow conference in 2014. That opened up my awareness of how much we’re throwing away: about 40 percent of all the food produced each year! It sounded so massive that I wondered how we’d possibly go about tackling this. I also heard Jonathan Bloom [the author of American Wasteland] speak, and I realized that this isn’t just a matter of ideology: it’s a real, tangible problem that the government can impact positively. What is your personal background with regard to food waste?I come from New England, so we had that Yankee notion that nothing should be wasted, ever. I’ve lived on a farm for much of my life and even have one today [Turner Farm in North Haven, Maine], so I’ve never thought twice about keeping a can on the countertop for food scraps or compost, or reusing food as animal feed. But I realized that America has really lost a generation of people who know how to use leftovers or freeze their food. Many people, for example, never knew it was OK to keep a compost bucket on their countertop!Is this a bipartisan issue?Absolutely. The chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. [Mike] Conaway of Texas, is a Republican and has been a great partner on this: he organized a hearing with experts in food waste and industry stakeholders. I see it as an issue that doesn’t have a lot of organized opposition. And even in the corporate sphere, our bill has received endorsements from Campbell, Nestle and other huge food companies. Do you think any legislation will pass before the August recess? If not, what’s your realistic timeline?Let’s face it, it takes a long time to get things through Congress. Our bill is very comprehensive, and especially this year, an election year, we may not get it all done. But we’re going to try and tack on some pieces ― like expiration date labeling, or funding for waste research ― as appropriations on other bills. What are some facts about food waste that would surprise most Americans?First, there’s the mind-blowing fact about 40 percent of our food supply is wasted annually. And against that backdrop, 15 percent of Americans still go hungry or are food insecure. Also, food waste is also a huge source of pollution: when it breaks down in landfills, for instance, it produces methane, a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.On a personal or household level, what can people do to reduce their food waste? For instance, you mention your own “Yankee thrift,” but many other cultures or families value abundance, or overabundance, which is hard to shake.It’s true that there are some cultural incentives to waste food, but I actually think an equally strong impulse is that nobody wants to contribute to greenhouse gases and global warming. Of course, this requires that people know that wasting food has this effect, so public education is very important. Another powerful connection is that less wasted food means assisting folks who are going hungry. It shouldn’t be a value to have too much food and waste it. Maybe we can change our idea of hospitality so that we brag to our guests that, for instance, we were going to throw away bread but turned it into bread pudding. A culture shift is not impossible. In the restaurant world, food waste was hardly a popular issue when Dan Barber spent almost a month turning unsightly vegetables into meals. But he got everyone talking!I also think, on the values front, kids will be leaders in the food waste effort. Think about recycling: elementary school kids took the lead on that. They started by sorting waste in schools, and kids brought that knowledge home, and “translated” the practice for their parents.The Food Recovery Act is quite comprehensive, but what would you single out as a key provision?One of the pieces we think has the highest cost-benefit ratio is date labeling: making food labels more specific. It should be very clear to the customer if the date is a sell-by, eat-by or throwaway date. That confusion probably causes a significant portion of food waste at home.Another section of your bill references new research. What kind of research do you suggest the USDA conduct into food waste technology? We definitely need more data about different products’ shelf lives. We have to run on conservative estimates unless research proves otherwise. We also need more research on waste allocation: where the food gets wasted, and what institutions are the biggest sources of waste. The USDA used to have a designated position to oversee exactly this type of research, but it was eliminated in the Clinton administration. We hope it can be reinstated. In the meantime, the organization ReFED produces a really wonderful report with great data on date labeling. Are there any countries or places in America that legislate food waste better than our country as a whole?Vermont has set a date by which there can be no more organic matter in landfills. San Francisco is moving towards mandatory composting. In Portland, Maine, there are now two different companies that do curbside compost pickup. Based on this, I think it will be important for Congress to offer assistance to municipal waste facilities ― big changes can happen on a municipal level, but not every city has the same resources. Looking abroad, the U.K. has done a lot to reduce grocery store food waste across the board. And France recently took the great step of mandating that grocery stores donate, rather than throw out, their unsold food. What’s a realistic target for reducing our food waste levels? You’ve said that we waste about 40 percent of all food in the U.S. Is the target eventually zero percent? The ideal, of course, is zero percent, and I still believe that should be the ultimate goal. Particularly because of the climate change implications, we have to be ambitious. The USDA’s goal is “Zero by 2030.” But the timeline is within our control. A state can just ban organic matter tomorrow. Our proposed bills are a guide, not a mandate. It’s up to the stakeholders ― and there are many ― to work together to eliminate food waste.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More stories like this: We Waste An Insane Amount Of Food.

18,MEDIA,Newt Gingrich Hopes People Dislike The Media Enough To Vote For Donald Trump,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newt-gingrich-trump-media_us_577ede79e4b01edea78d3d13,So does this mean even more swipes at Chuck Todd?,2016-07-08,Newt Gingrich wants the 2016 election to be a referendum on the press.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577edec31a000023006f91a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Newt Gingrich has a message for the American people: If you don’t like the media, vote for Donald Trump. Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker and potential Trump running mate, suggested to CNN Thursday that the campaign hoped to make the 2016 election a referendum on the press. “A substantial part of the campaign is going to be ― if you think the news media is honest and fair and totally neutral, then you ought to vote for Hillary [Clinton],” Gingrich said. “But if you think the news media is biased, then join me.”Gingrich echoed that strategy in an Thursday evening interview with The Washington Post. Trump “has concluded that you guys in the media will kill him unless he destroys your credibility,” Gingrich said. “Guaranteeing that the media is not believable is a significant building block of this campaign, as important as showing that Hillary Clinton is corrupt.”Trump, a reality TV star who’s cultivated relationships with media executives and journalists spanning decades, benefited from excessive press coverage during the Republican primary. At the same time, Trump’s campaign has placed significant restrictions on journalists at events and denied numerous outlets press access to them. He’ll hit the morning TV shows by day, while calling out “disgusting” journalists at evening rallies ― all to the delight of his hardcore supporters. Now Trump has found a kindred spirit in Gingrich, who similarly seems to relish being in front of the camera, while knowing how, and when, to smash the lens for maximum effect. During his 2012 run for president, Gingrich drew ravenous applause from the Republican faithful when he blasted CNN moderator John King for asking a “despicable” question about whether he once sought an open marriage. He won the South Carolina primary two days later, but eventually lost the nomination to Mitt Romney.Gingrich recalled that broadside against King, and those against other cable news moderators that election cycle, during a March appearance on HuffPost’s “Candidate Confidential” podcast. “There’s this whole market on the right that says, ‘I am so sick of these people, and I’m so glad you stood up to them,’” Gingrich said. He’s right, at least about the right. Mocking the “liberal media,” pompous TV anchors and The New York Times makes for easy applause among Trump fans who line up hours in advance to see him. Still, it’s hard to see how such attacks broaden Trump’s base in a general election. Sure, polls show Americans increasingly distrusting the news media, but will swipes at “Sleepy Eyes” Chuck Todd actually convince an undecided voter to pull the lever for Trump?Bumper stickers urging voters to “Annoy the Media: Re-elect Bush” couldn’t lead President George H.W. Bush to victory over Bill Clinton in 1992. Sarah Palin regularly assailed the media through the fall of 2008, as the GOP’s vice presidential nominee, but Republicans decisively lost that election. But Gingrich indicated Thursday that the Trump campaign will try to make an anti-media campaign work in 2016 regardless. While flying back from their Cincinnati appearance the previous night, Gingrich told the Post about how the pair considered ways to target the media. The result was a bizarre tweet that helped reignite a controversy brewing since Saturday, when Trump tweeted an anti-Semitic image that had circulated among white supremacists online. Trump now says he regrets having removed the tweet, which featured an image depicting Clinton as corrupt, complete with a Star of David and background of cash. The presumptive Republican nominee has since claimed the star could have been a “sheriff’s star,” and after Wednesday’s rally, tweeted a photo of a Disney “Frozen” book featuring a six-sided star. The “Frozen” image, too, had previously appeared in a forum that included anti-Semitic posts.Gingrich seemed satisfied Thursday with keeping the controversy over the star alive, though his two interviews showed the limits of taking an “us or them” approach with the media. He got word out about this strategy by speaking to a TV network Trump claims to no longer watch and a newspaper that is currently barred from the candidate’s events. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Farmer arrived, Ray allegedly aimed a shotgun at him, according to local NBC station WRAL. Farmer managed to grab the barrel of the gun and push Ray back, but the potentially deadly encounter wasn’t over. “The man says, ‘I got something for you’ and reached in his pocket and came back with a pistol,” Wake County sheriff Donnie Harrison told the station. As the two scuffled over the handgun, it went off.Harrison told WTVD, the local ABC station, that the deputy could “almost feel the bullet going by him.” No one was injured, and the deputy disarmed Ray.“As a deputy, you don’t ever know what to expect when you’re approaching something like that, so your training kicks in,” Harrison told local CBS station WNCN. “And of course when the gun came up, it was automatic to him to get that gun away from him, and he did exactly what he was supposed to.”Police said Ray had been drinking. He was charged with assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm, but prosecutors told WTVD those charges could be upgraded to attempted murder.“I applaud the deputy for what he did. He did a great job. His training kicked in and he did exactly what he was supposed to,” Harrison told WTVD. “Nobody got hurt and that’s a good thing.”(h/t Raw Story)"

Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). “I’ve known Loretta Sanchez forever,” he said. “And she’s going to make a great senator.”Sanchez, who has served in Congress for two decades, has positioned herself as a moderate alternative to Harris. As the Washington Post reports, she’s looking to build an unusual coalition of Latino voters ― who make up roughly a third of the state’s electorate ― and Republicans, who don’t have a candidate of their own to support in the race.Appearing on Hewitt’s program Thursday, the congresswoman highlighted her personal background ― both of her parents are Mexican immigrants ― as well as her foreign policy chops and her history of working with Republicans in Congress.“I am an independent thinker, and that’s one of the things that the establishment of the Democratic Party up in San Francisco doesn’t like about me, is that I don’t necessarily vote party line, that I actually look at the issue, that I actually work across the aisle, that I have been elected 10 times in Republican Orange County, and that I have needed those Republican votes in order to be elected,” she said.“Most Republicans I know are all in for her, because she’s center-left,” Hewitt said of Sanchez. “She’ll at least take the meeting, right? We’ll be able to get in and say, ‘We’d like you to consider this position.’” Hewitt explained that his choice is a pragmatic one, noting that while they may have significant differences in opinion on policy, he has more in common with Sanchez than he does with Harris. “You need Republican votes to win, and that’s why I’m glad to endorse you,” he said. “You and I are not going to agree a lot, but occasionally, we’re going to agree on armed services and some defense appropriation issues. I’m not going to agree with your opponent ever.” Listen to Hewitt’s interview with Sanchez here.Sanchez has also been backed by former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican.“Loretta knows how to work with Democrats, Republicans, and Independents,” he said in a statement last month.Harris, meanwhile, has a strong lead in the polls, and has earned the support of prominent liberals like California Gov. Jerry Brown, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. "

23,POLITICS,Thousands Of Guns Have Been Sold To Domestic Abusers Thanks To This Loophole,Melissa Jeltsen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/guns-domestic-violence-charleston-loophole_us_577e8cd8e4b0c590f7e85388,Keeping firearms away from people convicted of domestic violence should be a national priority.,2016-07-08,"Firearm dealers sold almost 7,000 guns to domestic abusers before the FBI had time to complete their background checks.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e8d321a000023006f9010.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A loophole in the federal background check system has allowed gun dealers to sell thousands of firearms to domestic abusers before their background checks were completed, according to a new study published by the Government Accountability Office.Normally, when a person attempts to buy a gun from a licensed dealer, their name is submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to make sure they’re eligible to buy one. Under federal law, individuals convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor or subject to a qualifying protective order are barred from purchasing a firearm. The FBI has only three business days to complete the background check and clear or deny a purchase. But if the gun dealer doesn’t receive a response in that time, they’re allowed to sell the gun anyway. This gap in the background check system was recently dubbed the “Charleston loophole” after accused Charleston shooter Dylann Roof legally purchased a gun before his background check was completed, despite an arrest for possession of narcotics and evidence that he was an unlawful drug user.While the vast majority of background checks are completed quickly, checks involving domestic violence histories often take longer, as they can involve intensive state-level research.“If we are looking at all background checks, 90 percent happen within three days,” said Gretta L. Goodwin, acting director of the Government Accountability Office. “But when we tease out the domestic violence records, only 70 percent of denials were happening within three business days.”Between 2006 and 2015, she said, the three-day deadline for background checks resulted in gun dealers selling around 6,700 guns to domestic abusers who were later found to be ineligible to purchase a firearm.Given what we know about domestic violence and guns, keeping firearms away from prohibited domestic abusers should be a no-brainer. There’s plenty of research showing that domestic violence and firearms are a deadly combination. Experts say that if an abuser has access to a gun, victims are five times more likely to be killed. Over half of all women killed by intimate partners between 2001 to 2012 were killed using a gun, according to the Center for American Progress.Goodwin noted that in cases where background checks take longer than three days, the FBI continues to investigate even after the gun dealer has sold the individual a firearm. If the FBI ultimately determines that the person is prohibited from possessing firearms, the case is referred to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives so the gun can be retrieved. In 2003, a full third of all cases referred for firearm retrieval involved individuals with domestic violence histories. There have been some efforts at the federal level to close the Charleston loophole. Last year, Senate Democrats unveiled legislation that would require that a background check be completed before any gun sale proceeds.“No check, no sale must be the rule — enacted as law — to close a gaping loophole spreading the epidemic of gun violence,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in a statement. “Despite the distortion and dishonesty of single-issue groups like the NRA, the vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, believe in background checks and want the system to work well.”A similar bill was introduced in the House. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has vowed to push Congress to close the loophole, calling it dangerous and deadly on her website.Lindsay Nichols, senior attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said a number of states have already passed legislation to close the loophole, the most recent being Delaware.“Dealers in Delaware will soon be required to wait 25 days (instead of 3 days) before transferring a gun if the person hasn’t passed a background check,” she said.Kim Gandy, CEO of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, said she was troubled by the findings of the GAO study.“With an average of three women being murdered every day by an intimate partner, the majority of them with firearms, it is shocking that thousands of abusers are buying prohibited weapons,” she said. “The culprit is an arbitrary 3-day limit for background checks, as though the lives of domestic violence victims are not worth an extra day or two of delay. What a chilling message this sends to victims – that the guns are more important than their lives.”______"
