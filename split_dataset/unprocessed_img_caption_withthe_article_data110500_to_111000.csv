Currently, I am appreciating seeing fanny packs adorn the waist bans of the most fashionable. With all the horror occurring in the world, I figured an article about fanny packs couldn't come at a more appropriate moment. I also want some good old validation. It's been an exhausting two years, desperately trying to convince my friends that fanny packs are ""in."" I've put up with cackles and criticisms from these fashion bullies. Gone are the days where fanny packs are only being worn by overachieving triathletes, Canadian tourists and bohemian inspired attendees of music festivals. No. no. no. Fanny packs are being seen on the high fashion streets of New York, London, Paris and Milan. Luxury designers like Hermes, Prada and Chanel are selling Fanny Packs, one for over $4,000. This is a moment in fashion, where we all need to appreciate and take note. Rarely in the world of high fashion does a trend have both a utilitarian and stylish component. Our love of fashion has caused us to wear seven inch razor heels, even knowing the unfortunate future of our feet and lower backs. Our passion for style can be selfish. We all know 7-inch heels slow down a night, because you are walking at the pace of a snail, and a taxi won't drive less then 10 blocks. But in our self centered love of fashion and art, we suffer and so do those around us. In doing research on the aforementioned latest fashion obsession, I learned that the ""fanny pack"" was actually named because it was intended to sit on the fanny. But the fanny pack was not worn on the rear when it gained popularity, because no one wants to make it easy for a pick-pocket. And in other countries ""fanny"" means ""vulva,"" so for obvious reasons, another term is used. Personally, I have re-branded fanny packs, and from this day forward I will only call them ""vulva packs"" -- please join me in this movement. This accessory has quite the reputation, and not such a ""hip"" or ""high fashion"" one. This is why the resurgence of the fanny pack has been re-born with an intentional metamorphosis, created by fashion industry insiders. This re-branding has given life to new names for the fanny pack, such as ""hands-free bag"" or ""belt bag."" Many of you not in the thrust of the fashion scene are unaware that fanny packs have been slowly and calculatingly re-entering high fashion since 2012. The ""major"" designers (do I sound all Rachel Zoe?) strutted models down the runway sporting these bad boys. Now, two years later, the mainstream is getting a taste. And finally my friends will believe me!The fanny pack will benefit all of us who fall below, above, or somewhere in between the fashion spectrum, and this is why:Men itchy from a bad case of jock itch? No problem. Wear that fanny pack and keep looking for your keys.Bloated? No problem. A fanny pack will hide your tummy.Been slacking on those Brazilian butt lift videos? No Problem. Wear a fanny pack backward, it will give the illusion that you ARE Brazilian.Camel Toe? No problem. Throw on a fanny pack, and your secret won't be exposed. Not in bikini shape? No problem. Fanny packs come in large sizes. Throw that baby on with your bikini, and you will look like a high stylin' beach babe, all while concealing a jiggly tummy.Are you a man? Do you need a place to put your phone, wallet, keys... maybe some chapstick? You can actually wear a fanny pack, and not look like a total douchebag. *Men who are not fashionably inclined, please ask for help from your stylish friends. And when in doubt, always wear the fanny pack backwards. Muffin Top? No problem. Wear that fanny pack to the side, or find a fanny pack that has two side pockets for the full conceal. Don't appreciate close contact? No problem. The fanny pack creates a tangible boundary with anyone who likes to ""hug it out.""Always looking for mints or gum? No problem. a fanny pack gives you direct access.Don't want to look like a hunchback? No problem. A fanny pack will rid you of your heavy weight bearing bag, and you won't need to slouch.Tired of holding your mans wallet? No problem. His wallet won't fit in your stylin' fanny pack, and like I mentioned, he can get his own fanny pack.Sex Change not entirely complete? No problem. Wear that fanny pack low, and no one will notice.Plumber's Butt? No problem. A well-fitting fanny pack will avoid any future butt-crack situations.Emergency bathroom situation and long line at public restroom? No problem. Conceal that fanny pack under your shirt, pregnant women can skip the line.Have lots of cash? No problem. Chanel, Gucci, Prada and hipper designers that charge even more, are all creating gorgeous fanny packs, at sky rocketing prices.Strapped for cash? No problem. Etsy, eBay, Urban Outfitters, etc., have cool and reasonably priced fanny packs for all the stylish people. Love to Juggle? (well, who doesn't?) No problem. Those balls will fit in your fanny pack, a long with some other magic tricks -- which of course will make YOU the life of the party.Want to shake your booty on the dance floor? The fanny pack comes in handy two-fold in this scenario. One, keep all your essentials with you, including chapstick for those parched lips. Stolen wallet? -- Won't happen. Two: Keep those cheese balls from getting close on the dance floor ""fanny pack"" distance away. I think I've given you many, many reasons to run out and purchase a fanny pack. And be warned, it's unusual to see a trend that has such a cool reputation on the streets, but is still worn by those who have no idea the fanny pack was ever out of style, don't let those people stop you from making a well thought out fashion decision... believe me when I tell you, fanny packs are COOL!

(AP Photo/U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Jonathan Sunderman/HO) EDITORIAL USE ONLY",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d1c240000030a51ad36.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Adds Chinese reaction)By Nobuhiro KuboTOKYO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Japan and the United States are exploring the possibility of Tokyo acquiring offensive weapons that would allow Japan to project power far beyond its borders, Japanese officials said, a move that would likely infuriate China.While Japan's intensifying rivalry with China dominates the headlines, Tokyo's focus would be the ability to take out North Korean missile bases, said three Japanese officials involved in the process.They said Tokyo was holding the informal, previously undisclosed talks with Washington about capabilities that would mark an enhancement of military might for a country that has not fired a shot in anger since its defeat in World War Two.The talks on what Japan regards as a ""strike capability"" are preliminary and do not cover specific hardware at this stage, the Japanese officials told Reuters.Defense experts say an offensive capability would require a change in Japan's purely defensive military doctrine, which could open the door to billions of dollars worth of offensive missile systems and other hardware. These could take various forms, such as submarine-fired cruise missiles similar to the U.S. Tomahawk.U.S. officials said there were no formal discussions on the matter but did not rule out the possibility that informal contacts on the issue had taken place. One U.S. official said Japan had approached American officials informally last year about the matter.Japan's military is already robust but is constrained by a pacifist Constitution. The Self Defense Forces have dozens of naval surface ships, 16 submarines and three helicopter carriers, with more vessels under construction. Japan is also buying 42 advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets.Reshaping the military into a more assertive force is a core policy of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He has reversed a decade of military spending cuts, ended a ban on Japanese troops fighting abroad and eased curbs on arms exports. RILING CHINATokyo had dropped a request to discuss offensive capabilities during high-profile talks on revising guidelines for the U.S.-Japan security alliance which are expected to be finished by year-end, the Japanese officials said. Instead, the sensitive issue was ""being discussed on a separate track"", said one official with direct knowledge of the matter.But any deal with Washington is years away and the obstacles are significant - from the costs to the heavily indebted Japanese government to concerns about ties with Asian neighbors such as China and sensitivities within the alliance itself.The Japanese officials said their U.S. counterparts were cautious to the idea, partly because it could outrage China, which accuses Abe of reviving wartime militarism.The officials declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the closed-door deliberations. A Japanese Defense Ministry spokesman said he could not comment on negotiations with Washington.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Asian countries had a right to be concerned about any moves to strengthen Japan's military considering the country's past and recent ""mistaken"" words and actions about its history.""We again urge Japan to earnestly reflect on and learn the lessons of history, respect the security concerns of countries in the region and go down the path of peaceful development,"" Hua told a daily news briefing in Beijing.Japan would need U.S. backing for any shift in military doctrine because it would change the framework of the alliance, often described as America supplying the ""sword"" of forward-based troops and nuclear deterrence while Japan holds the defensive ""shield"".Washington did not have a position on upgrading Japan's offensive capabilities, ""in part because the Japanese have not developed a specific concept or come to us with a specific request"", said another U.S. official.""We're not there yet - and they're not there yet,"" the official said. ""We're prepared to have that conversation when they're ready.""NORTH KOREAN MISSILESNorth Korea lies less than 600 km (370 miles) from Japan at the closest point.Pyongyang, which regularly fires short-range rockets into the sea separating the Koreas from Japan, has improved its ballistic missile capabilities and conducted three nuclear weapons tests, its most recent in February 2013.In April, North Korea said that in the event of war on the Korean Peninsula, Japan would be ""consumed in nuclear flames"".Part of Japan's motivation for upgrading its capabilities is a nagging suspicion that the United States, with some 28,000 troops in South Korea as well as 38,000 in Japan, might hesitate to attack the North in a crisis, Japanese experts said.U.S. forces might hold off in some situations, such as if South Korea wanted to prevent an escalation, said Narushige Michishita, a national security adviser to the Japanese government from 2004-2006.""We might want to maintain some kind of limited strike capability in order to be able to initiate a strike, so that we can tell the Americans, 'unless you do the job for us, we will have to do it on our own,'"" said Michishita, a security expert at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.Reflecting Japan's concerns, Abe told parliament in May 2013 that it was vital ""not to give the mistaken impression that the American sword would not be used"" in an emergency.""At this moment is it really acceptable for Japan to have to plead with the U.S. to attack a missile threatening to attack Japan?"" Abe said.Under current security guidelines, in the event of a ballistic missile attack, ""U.S. forces will provide Japan with necessary intelligence and consider, as necessary, the use of forces providing additional strike power"". SHROUDED IN EUPHEMISMThe informal discussions on offensive capabilities cover all options, from Japan continuing to rely completely on Washington to getting the full panoply of weaponry itself.Japan would like to reach a conclusion in about five years, and then start acquiring hardware, one Japanese official said.Tokyo had wanted the discussions included in the review of the Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines that are expected to cover areas such as logistical support and cybersecurity. Those talks, which formally kicked off last October, are the first in 17 years.But the United States was keen to keep discussions on offensive capabilities separate to avoid riling China and South Korea, another Japanese official said. Beijing and Seoul each have territorial disputes with Tokyo and accuse Abe of failing to atone for Japan's wartime aggression.Reflecting the sensitivities of the issue even in Japan, any talk of an upgraded offensive capability is shrouded in euphemism.Itsunori Onodera, who stepped down last week as defense minister in a broad cabinet reshuffle, a year ago described it as ""the capability to attack enemies' military bases and strategic bases for the sake of self-defense"".Defense guidelines compiled by the government in December watered this down to a ""potential form of response capability to address the means of ballistic-missile launches and related facilities"".

That makes Baghdad, strategically, an adversary.",2014-09-10,2014-09-09-MajorGeneralQassimSuleimanirightconsultwithanotherseniorIRGCofficer.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-09-MajorGeneralQassimSuleimanirightconsultwithanotherseniorIRGCofficer-thumb.jpg,"A viable policy in Iraq must achieve clear and achievable goals and allow America to stand down as the Iraqi people stand up. Because of the lack of a Status of Forces Agreement between Iraq and the United States, the U.S. Armed Forces have been treading a legal tightrope as they balance what's needed to bomb ISIL, or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant with the political situation. All of this is being done in line with international law. So why is the US working with Iran's Qods Force, a designated terrorist organization?Besides being completely illegal, working with Iran's paramilitary arm is not strategically sound. Qods commits unspeakable atrocities, kills women and children, and has been implicated in backing sectarian death squads in Syria, Lebanon, and even Afghanistan. IRGC-QF, as it's known in military and intelligence circles, is also singularly responsible for using the deadliest explosives and even assassinations against the U.S. military  and American diplomats. The military gains of both Iran's proxies and ISIL should be blunted to curb the sectarian bloodshed outside Irbil sure to follow. The international coalition Secretary Kerry and President Obama cobbled together, acting in concert with the United States, should take more aggressive actions to prevent advances by Shi'a militia.The primary objective in Iraq should be to secure Irbil, pull back all American diplomatic and military presence to behind Iraqi Kurdistan's borders, and pit ISIL and Iran against each other. Iran's Shi'a militia proxies effectively control Baghdad and exercise significant control on Iraqi military operations. They should be allowed to fight ISIL to the last man. Some proponents of working with Iran invoke the plight of the Kurdish and Yazidi people in Northern Iraq. Ironically enough, Iran has also already begun subversive efforts to destabilize Kurdistan. University of Maryland researcher Phillip Smyth, who follows Shi'a Islamist movements, has tracked Iranian activities in Iraq for years and recently stated Iran views the current crisis as ""their moment"" in Iraq. It was curious, then, when commentators floated the idea the US had ""only one potential strategic partner left: Iran."" Iran is not a viable partner, and has repeatedly expressed its desire to carve a so-called 'Shia crescent' out of the existing Middle East. The world can no longer allow the Iraqi military and police to function as an extension of Iran's military, especially while the outcome of nuclear negotiations with Tehran remain tenuous. Failure to arrest Iran's momentum in Iraq could lead to Iran having not one but three large standing armies and nuclear weapons. To counter the tactical advantage held by ISIL and the Shi'a militias, the Kurdish peshmerga, already an effective fighting force, should be armed and trained by the Joint Special Operations Command. The enemy's usage of urban fortification and human shields ensures airstrikes will result in civilian casualties and efforts to locate ISIL fighters requires human sources as well as aircraft provided to Sunni and Kurdish groups by NATO. Adversarial networks are slippery by nature, but Iran's global network of proxies are especially adept at strategic deception and regularly outfox our Central Intelligence Agency. Iran's intelligence services famously lured the CIAs entire network of informants to a Pizza Hut in Lebanon, where they were promptly shipped off for a talk over chai.  Their fate is, well, still unknown.Syrian, Iranian, and Iraqi Kurds are needed to collect vital intelligence against Iranian special groups in Iraq and Syria and combat Iranian influence. Prominent Kurdish citizens have already begun to publicly rebuff Iran's advances. Additionally, the coalition should commit to maintaining a presence in Iraq through the provincial elections in 2017. The United States should abandon efforts to unify a national government. Iran cannot be considered a credible--or desirable--partner in Iraq, and they control Baghdad. That makes Baghdad, strategically, an adversary. Iraq is plagued by long-term problems, and the military action taken recently is just the first step in a long slog that will last years, if not decades. Failure by NATO and the United States to support sensible policies will ensure the dissipation of influence in the region.Our friends need us more than ever. Let's hold Iran and its terrorist organizations accountable."

5,BUSINESS,Brand x Artist: The Miranda July and Miu Miu Collaboration,"Naz Riahi, ContributorFounder and Marketer in Chief at Run River",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brand-x-artist-the-mirand_b_5794194.html,"A recent collaboration between fashion house, Miu Miu, and artist, Miranda July was the perfect embodiment of how to execute a spectacular artist/brand partnership and why it's important to do so.",2014-09-10,2014-09-09-mirandajulyandmuimuilaunchsomebodyapp.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-09-mirandajulyandmuimuilaunchsomebodyapp-thumb.jpg,"Artist and brand collaborations are a tricky business. Sometimes the brand wants its name and logo all over the project, which can make the artist feel her work is compromised and sometimes, the brand is afraid that its core users won't ""get"" an artistic endeavor or that the work might be controversial.But I've always believed that aside from just a mere sponsor logo, or an all-out brand takeover, brands can have incredibly meaningful collaborations with artists that offer their community (you may know them as consumers) a valuable experience and point of connection.But, in order to have a successful collaboration, a brand has to choose an artist it connects with and let go of its fear of failure or criticism, allowing the artist to do her work, un-compromised. The artist has to appreciate that without the brand's support--both financial and social--her work may never have come to life and consider the brand not just as the wallet, but as an investor and a partner.A recent collaboration between fashion house, Miu Miu, and artist, Miranda July was the perfect embodiment of how to execute a spectacular artist/brand partnership and why it's important to do so.Miu Miu has a spectacular video series, Miu Miu Women's Tales, in which they commission women directors to tell the story of women. So far they've released 8 short films (including July's--scroll down to watch), all featuring women, in different states of being, often wearing Miu Miu clothes, but the films remain the pure vision and story of the directors and not the brand. Some are more experimental, others are narrative, all are stunning and capture the beauty and the strength of their subjects.But, the most recent collaboration with July went beyond film and was centered around an App called Somebody, which was created by the artist and allows users to send a message to a friend and have it delivered, in person by a stranger who is geographically near the recipient.The app launched at the Venice Film Festival in conjunction with July's short film and includes institutional partners around the world, including LACMA, The New Museum, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, The Walker Art Center, Museo Jumex and others.I should disclose that being on July's mailing list, I was one of the first handfuls of people to download and use the app, zealously running all over Brooklyn and Manhattan to act out and deliver messages to strangers. The experience was exhilarating. I had to find a person I'd never met and give them a message from a friend, often far away. It was a whole new way of communication and connection.One of the most interesting parts of the experience was that, for days, I didn't know the app was sponsored by Miu Miu. There is no Miu Miu branding within the app or on the project's website. Just three discrete mentions of the brand including ""The project was created with support from Miu Miu, along with a companion film--part of Miu Miu's Women's Tales series."" As for Miu Miu, they've supported the project with a number of digital media buys, including a banner on The New York Times, which clicked through to a sponsored post about the project.The beauty of a brand confident enough to bring a project of this scale to life and then step back and let it live for what it is made me love Miu Miu even more than I did before. In fact, the last few days I've been scouring my favorite shops for a new pair of Miu Miu shoes. I am willing to drop some serious cash--money that my credit card company will happily add to the tab--because the fact that this brand brought to life such a beautiful project and didn't have to shout about it, meant so much (side note, I also have a shopping problem, but you know what I mean).Additionally I want to applaud Miu Miu for giving such diverse directors (Palestinian, Italian, American, Iranian, Korean etc.) a voice and a platform to tell the story of women, as we see ourselves, not as victims, but as complex beings.Aa artist and brand collaboration well-done.From the Miu Miu Post on The New York Times:""July's contribution to Miu Miu Women's Tales adds a vital new dimension to this evolving cinematic universe. Each short film so far has been distinctive, but all address certain timeless questions: how do women appear to themselves? How do they appear to one another? Isn't there sensuality in politics, and intellectuality in pleasure? How, ultimately, should a woman be?"

It has more to do with the anxious way you relate to people and events than with the events themselves.",2014-09-09,2014-09-04-psychological_stress_edited1credits_editedfinal.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-04-psychological_stress_edited1credits_editedfinal-thumb.jpg,"If you take a close look at stress over the course of a busy week, you're likely to discover that stress is happening in you far more than to you. It has more to do with the anxious way you relate to people and events than with the events themselves.  ""We humans generate all sorts of stressful events purely in our heads ... linked to mere thoughts,"" states Robert Sapolsky, one of the world's leading stress researchers. It's the way worried, pessimistic, stress-provoking thoughts ignite upsetting emotions that generate a sense of threat, when a real threat isn't verifiably present. It's called psychological stress and it can flood your system with adrenaline and cortisol, sending your mind and body into an uproar. If these kinds of stress reactions become chronic, it will gradually wear out your body, depress your mood and could contribute to killing you. And it all begins with the stress provoking thoughts we think.Recall the last time an email caused your mind to race with anxious thoughts, painting you mentally into a tight corner. This tight corner makes the world appear threatening, and we believe the threat our mind imagines is real. But it isn't real; it's the mind making up emergencies that the primitive brain assumes must be happening simply because you imagined it. The primitive brain possesses the intelligence of a two-year old, and when it senses any kind of danger, real or imagined, it sets off a fight, flight, or freeze reaction.For the last 500 years, we've been quoting the great French statesman Michel de Montaigne, who said, ""My life has been full of terrible misfortunes, most of which never happened."" There's now a study to back up Montaigne. This study found that 85 percent of what we worry about never happens, and that the 15 percent that does happen turns out better than we expect. We laugh at Montaigne's comment because we see ourselves in it, but we often miss the message.  So here's the message: most of our stress is a form of mental suffering we inflict on ourselves by believing thoughts that aren't even true.I knew a lawyer who was in litigation over a dispute between two large corporations. There was a lot at stake and this lawyer, who I'll call William, thought he was losing the case. He blamed it on the opposing litigator, who he described as unscrupulous and crooked. William was stressed about the case and he was becoming increasingly difficult for his legal team to work with. He was taking the case home at night. He thought about it incessantly, lost sleep over it, and as his stress level increased, he began to lose his edge and make bad decisions. By the time I ran into him he was exhausted.Biologically, where there's stress, there's fear, so I asked William, ""What are you afraid of?"" ""Losing the case, of course,"" he said glaring at me as if I'd asked a stupid question.""And if you lose the case, what are you afraid of?"" I asked. ""Looking like a fool,"" he said nervously.""And what's the fear of looking like a fool?"" I asked. ""I'll lose my reputation,"" he said, and I could see terror flash in his eyes.""So what's the fear of losing your reputation?""""Well ... I'll lose my clients ... and my job ... and my livelihood."" All at once, he looked like a deer caught in headlights. When I asked him what he was feeling, he said, ""I see myself pushing a shopping cart down Main Street."" You can see in his last statement how far the mind can travel when we are afraid and really stressed. This was the story running in the back of William's mind, and the more stressed he became the more he believed the story. So, I asked William, ""Have you lost the case yet?""""No,"" he said, ""it's still on-going.""""Any chance you might turn things around and win?"" I asked.""Well, yes,"" he said. ""I suppose there's an outside chance. You never know what a jury might do.""Next I asked, ""Do you really think people see you as a fool?"" ""No,"" he said somewhat self-consciously. ""People respect me."" ""If you lose this case will you really be in jeopardy of losing your clients?""""No, it's not very likely,"" he said. ""Everyone knows you win some, you lose some."" He began to breathe easier and the lines on his forehead began to relax.""Will you really be asked to leave the firm if you lose the case?"" ""No,"" he laughed. ""They're making me a partner."" It was the first he'd smiled in some time. ""So,"" I said, ""It's safe to say that you won't be pushing a shopping cart down Main Street any time soon, right?"" ""Right,"" he laughed. So I asked William: ""Who would you be without these fearful thoughts?"" ""I'd be calm,"" he said. ""My mind would be clear. I'd sleep better. My decision-making would be a lot smarter. And I'd be nicer to my team.""  This had a happy ending: When William went back to work on the case, he was at the top of his game. He wasn't undermining himself with stress-provoking thoughts.A better life is as near to us as our own thoughts. In the last twenty years, biology has established that the vast biochemical environment that constitutes our brain and body is shaped by our mental state. So, become keenly aware of stress-provoking thoughts and tell yourself, these thoughts are in me, not in reality. Then choose not to believe them. If you don't believe a stressful thought, it doesn't turn into stress and anxiety. The ticket to the health, wealth, and love we seek is cultivating a mental state that every day brings a little more peace into our experience, a little more empathy into our heart, and a little more gratitude into our attitude.

They greedily snatched his quip about having ""no strategy"" for dealing with ISIS out of context and finger pointed this as further proof that Obama has been a miserable failure in dealing with any Middle East issue. It's, of course, bunk. A quick glance at the checklist of Obama's foreign policy moves and positions shows that he's launched measured but effective strikes against ISIS in Iraq, a similar strike against the top leadership of a terrorist group in Somalia, and has backed every sanction imposed by the European Union on Russia for its assault on the Ukraine. His most deft move, and the one that perennially gives ammunition to Obama's chronic foes, is his refusal to do what Bush disastrously did and send in the troops -- anywhere. This didn't work with Bush and it wouldn't work with him if he tried. There's absolutely no realistic alternative to the Middle East warfare and Russia's Ukraine assault then to develop a policy that's based on regional cooperation and coalition building in Europe and the Middle East. Obama has done that through continued open line talks, negotiations, defense pacts and treaties with NATO, and strategic aid to the Ukraine and moderate religious groups in Syria and Iraq. The cease fire the U.S. and the EU brokered between Russia and the Ukraine is the first payoff of Obama's coalition approach to dealing with foreign policy issues.Still, it will take time and patience before the gains of this sane approach to foreign policy can be measured. It's not necessary to engage in bellicose chest thumping and saber rattling to get the point across that the U.S. will play a strong role in trying to contain Russian expansion and the entrenchment of a terrorist state in Iraq and Syria. This hot air approach would do just the opposite and only pour more fuel on the fire. The ultimate proof of this is Bush. After pouring in tens of thousands of troops, tens of millions of dollars and weaponry, and wasting several thousand American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives, he admitted in a rare moment of candor that Muslim strife could not be solved by the U.S. but by Muslims themselves. A decade after the mass of American forces pulled out of Iraq, that Bush epiphany has never been more obvious. The hit on Obama as a foreign policy disaster has nothing to do with his alleged foreign policy failures but the GOP's eternal political sale job on Obama as a hopelessly greenhorn, novice on foreign policy matters. A novice who would the first time a crisis arose jeopardize America's security and put Americans in harm's way. GOP presidents Reagan, Bush Sr., and especially George W. Bush in 2004 in his reelection fight with Democratic presidential foe Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, used this ploy masterfully against their Democratic opponents.The GOP strategists believed that the soft-on-terrorism, rank amateur on foreign policy smear would work even better on Obama. He was a liberal Democrat, untested in foreign policy matters, had made conciliatory remarks about Islam, was a staunch opponent of the Iraq War, and unstated, he was African-American. This supposedly made him vulnerable to the sneaky and borderline racial suspicions among many that question the patriotism of blacks. The smear didn't work. Obama knew the history of how the GOP used the soft-on-terrorism ploy to discredit Democrats. He moved quickly to counter the fable and his many successes during the past years for a time forced GOP leaders into pained silence. He stood as a Democratic president that got results in the war against terrorism, and more galling consistently got high marks from European, Chinese and Russian leaders for his tact and diplomacy. But the GOP had not forgotten, nor forgave, his Cairo University speech in 2009 in which he extended the hand of cooperation and alliance to the Arab world. They saw his cautious support of the Arab Spring as fraught with potential peril, and took every opportunity to hammer hard on his alleged hostility to Israel, and pro-Palestinian tilt, and for not taking a neo-Cold War line in dealing with the Russians. None of this marked Obama even remotely as a president whose foreign policy initiatives were adrift, and who was setting America up for a fall, since his foreign policy successes spoke for themselves and satisfied a majority of the public. ISIS, let alone Russia, can be defeated with American troops, tanks and missiles on the ground and in the air. The GOP knows that. But with Obama's approval numbers plunge, and the mid-term elections looming big, the rise of ISIS and Russia's grab at the Ukraine, the timing is seemingly perfect for it to try and again tar Obama and his foreign policy initiatives as weak and dangerous no matter the truth.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

A new Kansas poll finds incumbent Pat Roberts vulnerable. And the year's primary cycle is nearly at a close. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, September 9, 2014.AMERICANS WORRIED BY ISIS - Mark Preston: ""Americans are increasingly concerned that ISIS represents a direct terror threat, fearful that ISIS agents are living in the United States, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll. Most now support military action against the terrorist group. Seven in 10 Americans believe ISIS has the resources to launch an attack against the United States, just days before President Barack Obama plans to address the nation on the subject….The poll released Monday shows that Americans favor [a]dditional airstrikes against ISIS….[m]ilitary aid to forces fighting ISIS…[p]roviding humanitarian aid to people fleeing ISIS...But a majority of Americans, 61%-38%, oppose placing U.S. soldiers on the ground in Iraq and Syria to combat the terrorist group."" [CNN]SUPPORT FOR AIR STRIKES, LOW RATINGS FOR OBAMA - Dan Balz and Peyton M. Craighill: ""Americans overwhelmingly view Islamic State terrorists as a serious threat to vital U.S. interests and, in a significant shift, widely support airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. The nation’s increasingly hawkish mood will form part of the backdrop for a speech by President Obama on Wednesday, when he will outline his thinking on how to confront the threat from the Islamic State. Obama’s remarks will come a day after he confers with congressional leaders at the White House about the administration’s planning. Obama’s speech also comes at a critical moment in his presidency. He will address the nation at a time of record or ­near-record lows in public assessments of his performance….His overall foreign policy ratings are his lowest yet in a Post-ABC News poll."" [WashPost]Why is Obama's foreign policy rating so low? - HuffPollster: ""Americans agree with most of the Obama administration's specific policies for taking on ISIS, but that isn't translating to strong approval ratings for the president on foreign policy….This discrepancy has been playing out in response to foreign policy conflicts throughout the year: In April, YouGov polling found that Americans were nearly twice as likely to support sanctions against Ukraine as they were to approve of Obama's actions after he imposed them….In the absence of extensive knowledge of U.S. military actions, many end up relying on other cues, like partisanship...Even among his base, though, the recent string of foreign policy crises may present something of a no-win situation."" [HuffPost]A NEAR TIE IN KANSAS - HuffPollster: ""Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) is running dead even against independent challenger Greg Orman, according to the first Kansas Senate poll since the Democratic nominee announced last week that he was withdrawing from the race. The SurveyUSA poll, conducted for KSN News, gave Orman 37 percent of the vote to Roberts' 36 percent (a difference within the poll's margin of error). Democrat Chad Taylor, whose name will remain on the ballot pending a lawsuit, took 10 percent, with libertarian Randall Batson winning 6 percent and the remainder undecided. [HuffPost]Pollsters used 'informed' ballot question - Before asking Kansas voters about their choice for Senate, the poll informed them about the race's complicated dynamics, stating that ""Democrat Chad Taylor's name still appeared on the ballot even though he no longer wants to run."" It also asked two questions before the vote probing awareness of recent events, finding 71 percent aware that Democrat Taylor ""has asked to have his name taken off the ballot,"" and 58 percent who know that ""Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, who is a Republican, has refused to take Taylor's name off the ballot?"" As HuffPollster reported on Friday, not all pollsters agree on the best way to survey on the Kansas race, with some saying last week that they would ask voters for their candidate preference first without noting that Taylor didn't wish to compete. Others expected that most Kansans would understand the situation by Election Day.

The survey calls landline and cell phones using professional interviewers, and features a sample drawn from the official list of registered voters in Iowa. An earlier Loras College poll in May gave Republican Ernst a four point lead. Three out of the last four Iowa surveys conducted since mid-August give Braley a nominal edge. The new poll help lifts the Democrat's margin slightly on HuffPost Pollster's poll tracking model (to 44 to 40 percent advantage, as of this writing), but the race is still very much a toss-up, with the polling indicating just a 57 percent chance that the Democrat will win in November. [Loras College, Pollster chart]-National forecast - The sum of all Senate polling nationwide continues to point to a near tossup. The probability of a Republican majority ticked down from 52 to 51 percent on Monday, partly because the new Iowa data.

And former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) is trying to return to the chamber to represent New Hampshire, where he could end the state's all-female congressional delegation.

[HuffPost]HANDICAPPER PREDICTS GOP WAVE ELECTION - Stu Rothenberg: ""While the current Rothenberg Political Report ratings don’t show it, I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats. But I wouldn’t be shocked by a larger gain….My newsletter has the most likely outcome of the midterms at Republican gains of 5 to 8 seats, with the GOP slightly more likely than not to net the six seats it needs to win Senate control….But I’ve witnessed 17 general elections from my perch in D.C., including eight midterms, and I sometimes develop a sense of where the cycle is going before survey data lead me there. Since my expectations constitute little more than an informed guess, I generally keep them to myself. This year is different. I am sharing them with you….Right now, this cycle looks much like 2010, when Democrats with reasonable profiles got crushed in Republican-leaning and swing states."" [Roll Call]Charlie Cook finds no wave, still bets on GOP - In a column published on Friday, before Rothenberg issued his prediction, fellow handicapper Charlie Cook pondered the apparent lack of a Republican wave: ""Now that Labor Day is behind us, the most remarkable thing about this midterm election is how little has changed since Memorial Day...One question has become more pressing as Election Day nears: Where is the Republican wave? For Democrats, the good news is that there doesn't appear to be an overwhelming Republican tide this year; the bad news is that Democrats could well lose the Senate even without such a wave. Six of the most competitive races are Democratic-held seats in states that Mitt Romney carried by 14 points or more. With a map like that, Republicans don't need to dominate the country; they just have to win some select states...[Senate contests feature] no fewer than nine very close races, at least half of them headed toward photo finishes. But three Democratic-held seats are already gone, and party strategists see seven more teetering on the edge, compared with just two for Republicans.

Every day that the White House does not act, more than 1,000 people are torn from their worksites, their families and their communities, driving down wages and standards in the process.It was immigrant workers who educated me about how the threat of deportation is used as a weapon by exploitative employers who want to keep their workforce captive, compliant and cheap. Their stories and their courage convinced me of the need to call for executive action, and it is imperative that the president also hear directly from those whose future is in his hands. We join the calls for the president to meet with members of the communities most deeply affected by our dysfunctional immigration system before political insiders further erode his resolve to act.The time to act on immigration was more than a year ago, when the Senate passed a comprehensive, bipartisan framework for real reform. House Republicans refused to do their job and put the compromise bill up for a vote, and the Obama administration has not yet used it as a blueprint for executive action. The fate of millions of workers continues to hang in the balance, and the president should use his authority to grant the broadest possible temporary relief.We renew our call for the executive branch to provide work authorization to all those who would be on a pathway to citizenship now if House Republicans had allowed a vote on the bipartisan Senate bill. Only broad executive action will shore up the floor of employment practices in this country. More than 8 million immigrants -- a full 5 percent of the labor market -- are working today without the protection of law. We know all too well that unscrupulous employers exploit these hardworking women and men to force down labor costs, suppressing wages for all workers. Without adequately addressing the scope of this problem, administrative action will have limited impact on overall labor standards.I urge the president to look into the eyes of immigrant workers, as I have, and let their stories be his guide in this critical decision. What would the president say to Ramon Mendez, a union roofer who was picked up by immigration authorities after filing a health and safety claim? When burns caused by a lack of adequate safety gear landed Mendez in the hospital for several days, his employer provided no workers' compensation and told him that if he complained he would be fired and reported to immigration authorities. Indeed, less than two weeks after the National Labor Relations Board ruled on Mendez's case, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrived at his home.Sadly, Mendez's case is far from an isolated example. Francisco Ruiz was picked up by immigration agents while trying to testify at an arbitration session ordered by the federal government. Ruiz filed a civil complaint for unpaid wages and overtime after working for months for a homeowner who refused to honor a contractual agreement. When he arrived at the court-ordered mediation, ICE was there waiting and put him into deportation proceedings.Like other workers brave enough to come forward to report employer abuse, Mendez and Ruiz deserve protective status for speaking up. Employers must no longer be able to use the threat of deportation as a weapon to keep workers from asserting their rights or enforcing standards on the job. In addition to broad affirmative relief, the administration should create a process through which workers engaged in protected activity, such as forming or joining a union, or filing a health and safety violation claim, would be safe from retaliation based on their immigration status.The ability to exploit any worker lowers standards for all workers, and the data tells the story of the impact all too clearly. Immigrant workers, particularly the Latino workforce, face the highest rates of wage theft, sexual harassment, death and injury on the job. Our entire workforce suffers when we allow standards to erode as millions of workers struggle to support their families without the status to assert their basic rights.Standards for all workers will improve only when we fix our unjust immigration system in a way that requires fair employment practices, ensures access to justice, and promotes a unified national workforce by affording a broad and inclusive pathway to citizenship. Many will seek to disguise corporate giveaways and racist voter-suppression efforts as comprehensive immigration reform, but we know the difference. Only meaningful legislative efforts that seek to lift the boats of all working people will enjoy the support of the labor movement.The deafness in Washington to the real needs of workers inspires us to redouble our efforts to strengthen our movement from the ground up. We will continue to demand reforms at all levels of government that will help build a stronger economic future for our nation, and support the basic civil rights and dignity of all workers.The AFL-CIO will not rest until all workers have a voice on the job and in their communities. Like the labor movement, grassroots immigrant groups are organized for collective voice and representation. And believe me, unions know that the best negotiators are the people who know the real situation -- the people with skin in the game.The president can and should take executive action broad enough to address the scope of the current crisis. As he continues to weigh his options, he needs to meet with and hear directly from the people who will be most affected by his decisions. Workers are the heart of this movement, and workers' voices should be ringing in the president's ear when he finally makes the decision so vital to their future."

As they noted in their most recent janky, low budget video (I'm pretty sure the only thing these jokers love more than being assholes is being assholes while whipping up a janky, low budget video or Vine in their basement):""His majesty the devil has completely energized this fag juggernaut known as news and entertainment media to cast aside every standard of God and what better way to do that than to legitimize a sin so filthy that the lord God calls it an abomination...I'm not exactly sure what being ""energized"" by ""his majesty the devil"" entails or what a ""fag juggernaut"" is (aside from what I'm going to name my metal band if I ever start one) but it all sounds really hot, doesn't it? It reminds me of the first time I heard about the anti-queer church. I was in college and a folk singer friend (and before you judge me, let's be honest and admit if there's ever time to have a folk singer friend, it's college, right?) wrote a song about Matthew Shepard's murder that included the line, ""A woman held up a sign at his funeral that said / 'Matt's in hell and fags doom nations.'"" I was repulsed by the thought of these people terrorizing that sweet dead boy's family and friends (and by extension, all of us, really), but I was also mesmerized by and drawn to the notion that fags -- me! -- could ruin an entire country with just our faggotry. Who knew we had that kind of power? But, then again, I guess somewhere inside of me I suspected as much all along. And ever since then all I've really ever wanted was to doom a nation, preferably America.A few years later I ended up getting the word ""DOOM"" tattooed on my knuckles as a reminder of both the wickedness in the world and just how much queer people can accomplish if we put our heads and hearts and crotches to work.Those reminders are only two of the gifts that the Westboro Baptist Church has given me. They've also reminded me that while queers have made breathtaking progress over the past 20 years -- from gay marriage sweeping the country to trans activist and icon Laverne Cox smiling from the cover of Time magazine -- we still have a lot of work left to do. Every time WBC puts out a press release or threatens to protest at another soldier's funeral or Kesha concert, I remember that we can pass all the laws we want but if we don't change the fundamental beliefs that people have about us -- beliefs that in many cases and places aren't that different, though perhaps less concentrated, than Westboro's -- nothing will ever truly get better.But beyond that, WBC has also done a lot of good for our community. No, really. As my friend and colleague Paul Raushenbush has noted, ""their very existence offers the most convincing testimony for progressive, non-literal, rational, pluralistic and compassionate religious expressions."" In short, when people see how awful Westboro is, they scramble to get out of their shadow so as not to be confused with them or their hate. Despite their best intentions, the church is actually pushing people to get on the right side of history.What's more, while we've made it our editorial policy to no longer cover Westboro protests (aka don't feed the crazies!), we happily cover the extraordinary responses to their disgusting activities. From hundreds of students coming together to create a ""human shield"" to The Equality House -- a pro-queer non-profit organization housed in a rainbow building that sits directly across the street from the Westboro compound -- raising thousands of dollars for charity with counter-protests, these are often the stories I am most thrilled to have the opportunity to feature on The Huffington Post.And in the spirit of and solidarity with those who have fought back against Westboro, if they do show up in front of our offices to protest us this week, we'll be ready for them. We're not scared of a handful of sad people with access to school supplies and a few nasty slogans. We're ready to celebrate how far we've come in spite of them.

Cross-posted with TomDispatch.comOn August 26, Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) both accepted a ceasefire agreement after a 50-day Israeli assault on Gaza that left 2,100 Palestinians dead and vast landscapes of destruction behind. The agreement calls for an end to military action by both Israel and Hamas, as well as an easing of the Israeli siege that has strangled Gaza for many years.This is, however, just the most recent of a series of ceasefire agreements reached after each of Israel's periodic escalations of its unremitting assault on Gaza. Throughout this period, the terms of these agreements remain essentially the same. The regular pattern is for Israel, then, to disregard whatever agreement is in place, while Hamas observes it -- as Israel has officially recognized -- until a sharp increase in Israeli violence elicits a Hamas response, followed by even fiercer brutality. These escalations, which amount to shooting fish in a pond, are called ""mowing the lawn"" in Israeli parlance. The most recent was more accurately described as ""removing the topsoil"" by a senior U.S. military officer, appalled by the practices of the self-described ""most moral army in the world.""The first of this series was the Agreement on Movement and Access Between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in November 2005. It called for ""a crossing between Gaza and Egypt at Rafah for the export of goods and the transit of people, continuous operation of crossings between Israel and Gaza for the import/export of goods, and the transit of people, reduction of obstacles to movement within the West Bank, bus and truck convoys between the West Bank and Gaza, the building of a seaport in Gaza, [and the] re-opening of the airport in Gaza"" that Israeli bombing had demolished.That agreement was reached shortly after Israel withdrew its settlers and military forces from Gaza. The motive for the disengagement was explained by Dov Weissglass, a confidant of then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who was in charge of negotiating and implementing it. ""The significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process,"" Weissglass informed the Israeli press. ""And when you freeze that process, you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders, and Jerusalem. Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from our agenda. And all this with authority and permission. All with a [U.S.] presidential blessing and the ratification of both houses of Congress."" True enough.""The disengagement is actually formaldehyde,"" Weissglass added. ""It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians."" Israeli hawks also recognized that instead of investing substantial resources in maintaining a few thousand settlers in illegal communities in devastated Gaza, it made more sense to transfer them to illegal subsidized communities in areas of the West Bank that Israel intended to keep.The disengagement was depicted as a noble effort to pursue peace, but the reality was quite different. Israel never relinquished control of Gaza and is, accordingly, recognized as the occupying power by the United Nations, the U.S., and other states (Israel apart, of course). In their comprehensive history of Israeli settlement in the occupied territories, Israeli scholars Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar describe what actually happened when that country disengaged: the ruined territory was not released ""for even a single day from Israel's military grip or from the price of the occupation that the inhabitants pay every day."" After the disengagement, ""Israel left behind scorched earth, devastated services, and people with neither a present nor a future. The settlements were destroyed in an ungenerous move by an unenlightened occupier, which in fact continues to control the territory and kill and harass its inhabitants by means of its formidable military might.""Operations Cast Lead and Pillar of Defense Israel soon had a pretext for violating the November Agreement more severely. In January 2006, the Palestinians committed a serious crime. They voted ""the wrong way"" in carefully monitored free elections, placing the parliament in the hands of Hamas. Israel and the United States immediately imposed harsh sanctions, telling the world very clearly what they mean by ""democracy promotion."" Europe, to its shame, went along as well.The U.S. and Israel soon began planning a military coup to overthrow the unacceptable elected government, a familiar procedure. When Hamas pre-empted the coup in 2007, the siege of Gaza became far more severe, along with regular Israeli military attacks. Voting the wrong way in a free election was bad enough, but preempting a U.S.-planned military coup proved to be an unpardonable offense.A new ceasefire agreement was reached in June 2008. It again called for opening the border crossings to ""allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza."" Israel formally agreed to this, but immediately announced that it would not abide by the agreement and open the borders until Hamas released Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held by Hamas.Israel itself has a long history of kidnapping civilians in Lebanon and on the high seas and holding them for lengthy periods without credible charge, sometimes as hostages. Of course, imprisoning civilians on dubious charges, or none, is a regular practice in the territories Israel controls. But the standard western distinction between people and ""unpeople"" (in Orwell's useful phrase) renders all this insignificant.Israel not only maintained the siege in violation of the June 2008 ceasefire agreement but did so with extreme rigor, even preventing the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which cares for the huge number of official refugees in Gaza, from replenishing its stocks.On November 4th, while the media were focused on the U.S. presidential election, Israeli troops entered Gaza and killed half a dozen Hamas militants. That elicited a Hamas missile response and an exchange of fire. (All the deaths were Palestinian.) In late December, Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire. Israel considered the offer, but rejected it, preferring instead to launch Operation Cast Lead, a three-week incursion of the full power of the Israeli military into the Gaza strip, resulting in shocking atrocities well documented by international and Israeli human rights organizations.On January 8, 2009, while Cast Lead was in full fury, the U.N. Security Council passed a unanimous resolution (with the U.S. abstaining) calling for ""an immediate ceasefire leading to a full Israeli withdrawal, unimpeded provision through Gaza of food, fuel, and medical treatment, and intensified international arrangements to prevent arms and ammunition smuggling.""A new ceasefire agreement was indeed reached, but the terms, similar to the previous ones, were again never observed and broke down completely with the next major mowing-the-lawn episode in November 2012, Operation Pillar of Defense. What happened in the interim can be illustrated by the casualty figures from January 2012 to the launching of that operation: one Israeli was killed by fire from Gaza while 78 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire.The first act of Operation Pillar of Defense was the murder of Ahmed Jabari, a high official of the military wing of Hamas. Aluf Benn, editor-in-chief of Israel's leading newspaper Haaretz, described Jabari as Israel's ""subcontractor"" in Gaza, who enforced relative quiet there for more than five years. As always, there was a pretext for the assassination, but the likely reason was provided by Israeli peace activist Gershon Baskin. He had been involved in direct negotiations with Jabari for years and reported that, hours before he was assassinated, Jabari ""received the draft of a permanent truce agreement with Israel, which included mechanisms for maintaining the ceasefire in the case of a flare-up between Israel and the factions in the Gaza Strip.""There is a long record of Israeli actions designed to deter the threat of a diplomatic settlement. After this exercise of mowing the lawn, a ceasefire agreement was reached yet again. Repeating the now-standard terms, it called for a cessation of military action by both sides and the effective ending of the siege of Gaza with Israel ""opening the crossings and facilitating the movements of people and transfer of goods, and refraining from restricting residents' free movements and targeting residents in border areas.""What happened next was reviewed by Nathan Thrall, senior Middle East analyst of the International Crisis Group. Israeli intelligence recognized that Hamas was observing the terms of the ceasefire. ""Israel,” Thrall wrote, “therefore saw little incentive in upholding its end of the deal. In the three months following the ceasefire, its forces made regular incursions into Gaza, strafed Palestinian farmers and those collecting scrap and rubble across the border, and fired at boats, preventing fishermen from accessing the majority of Gaza's waters."" In other words, the siege never ended. ""Crossings were repeatedly shut. So-called buffer zones inside Gaza [from which Palestinians are barred, and which include a third or more of the strip’s limited arable land] were reinstated. Imports declined, exports were blocked, and fewer Gazans were given exit permits to Israel and the West Bank.""Operation Protective Edge So matters continued until April 2014, when an important event took place. The two major Palestinian groupings, Gaza-based Hamas and the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority in the West Bank signed a unity agreement. Hamas made major concessions. The unity government contained none of its members or allies. In substantial measure, as Nathan Thrall observes, Hamas turned over governance of Gaza to the PA. Several thousand PA security forces were sent there and the PA placed its guards at borders and crossings, with no reciprocal positions for Hamas in the West Bank security apparatus. Finally, the unity government accepted the three conditions that Washington and the European Union had long demanded: non-violence, adherence to past agreements, and the recognition of Israel.Israel was infuriated. Its government declared at once that it would refuse to deal with the unity government and cancelled negotiations. Its fury mounted when the U.S., along with most of the world, signaled support for the unity government.There are good reasons why Israel opposes the unification of Palestinians. One is that the Hamas-Fatah conflict has provided a useful pretext for refusing to engage in serious negotiations. How can one negotiate with a divided entity? More significantly, for more than 20 years, Israel has been committed to separating Gaza from the West Bank in violation of the Oslo Accords it signed in 1993, which declare Gaza and the West Bank to be an inseparable territorial unity.A look at a map explains the rationale. Separated from Gaza, any West Bank enclaves left to Palestinians have no access to the outside world. They are contained by two hostile powers, Israel and Jordan, both close U.S. allies -- and contrary to illusions, the U.S. is very far from a neutral ""honest broker.""Furthermore, Israel has been systematically taking over the Jordan Valley, driving out Palestinians, establishing settlements, sinking wells, and otherwise ensuring that the region -- about one-third of the West Bank, with much of its arable land -- will ultimately be integrated into Israel along with the other regions that country is taking over. Hence remaining Palestinian cantons will be completely imprisoned. Unification with Gaza would interfere with these plans, which trace back to the early days of the occupation and have had steady support from the major political blocs, including figures usually portrayed as doves like former president Shimon Peres, who was one of the architects of settlement deep in the West Bank.As usual, a pretext was needed to move on to the next escalation. Such an occasion arose when three Israeli boys from the settler community in the West Bank were brutally murdered. The Israeli government evidently quickly realized that they were dead, but pretended otherwise, which provided the opportunity to launch a ""rescue operation"" -- actually a rampage primarily targeting Hamas. The Netanyahu government has claimed from the start that it knew Hamas was responsible, but has made no effort to present evidence.One of Israel's leading authorities on Hamas, Shlomi Eldar, reported almost at once that the killers very likely came from a dissident clan in Hebron that has long been a thorn in the side of the Hamas leadership. He added, ""I'm sure they didn't get any green light from the leadership of Hamas, they just thought it was the right time to act.""The Israeli police have since been searching for and arresting members of the clan, still claiming, without evidence, that they are ""Hamas terrorists."" On September 2nd, Haaretz reported that, after very intensive interrogations, the Israeli security services concluded the abduction of the teenagers ""was carried out by an independent cell"" with no known direct links to Hamas.The 18-day rampage by the Israeli Defense Forces succeeded in undermining the feared unity government. According to Israeli military sources, its soldiers arrested 419 Palestinians, including 335 affiliated with Hamas, and killed six, while searching thousands of locations and confiscating $350,000. Israel also conducted dozens of attacks in Gaza, killing five Hamas members on July 7th.Hamas finally reacted with its first rockets in 18 months, Israeli officials reported, providing Israel with the pretext to launch Operation Protective Edge on July 8th. The 50-day assault proved the most extreme exercise in mowing the lawn -- so far.Operation [Still to Be Named]Israel is in a fine position today to reverse its decades-old policy of separating Gaza from the West Bank in violation of its solemn agreements and to observe a major ceasefire agreement for the first time. At least temporarily, the threat of democracy in neighboring Egypt has been diminished, and the brutal Egyptian military dictatorship of General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi is a welcome ally for Israel in maintaining control over Gaza.The Palestinian unity government, as noted earlier, is placing the U.S.-trained forces of the Palestinian Authority in control of Gaza’s borders, and governance may be shifting into the hands of the PA, which depends on Israel for its survival, as well as for its finances. Israel might feel that its takeover of Palestinian territory in the West Bank has proceeded so far that there is little to fear from some limited form of autonomy for the enclaves that remain to Palestinians.There is also some truth to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's observation: ""Many elements in the region understand today that, in the struggle in which they are threatened, Israel is not an enemy but a partner."" Akiva Eldar, Israel's leading diplomatic correspondent, adds, however, that ""all those ‘many elements in the region’ also understand that there is no brave and comprehensive diplomatic move on the horizon without an agreement on the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders and a just, agreed-upon solution to the refugee problem."" That is not on Israel's agenda, he points out, and is in fact in direct conflict with the 1999 electoral program of the governing Likud coalition, never rescinded, which ""flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river.""Some knowledgeable Israeli commentators, notably columnist Danny Rubinstein, believe that Israel is poised to reverse course and relax its stranglehold on Gaza.We'll see.The record of these past years suggests otherwise and the first signs are not auspicious. As Operation Protective Edge ended, Israel announced its largest appropriation of West Bank land in 30 years, almost 1,000 acres. Israel Radio reported that the takeover was in response to the killing of the three Jewish teenagers by ""Hamas militants."" A Palestinian boy was burned to death in retaliation for the murder, but no Israeli land was handed to Palestinians, nor was there any reaction when an Israeli soldier murdered 10-year-old Khalil Anati on a quiet street in a refugee camp near Hebron on August 10th, while the most moral army in the world was smashing Gaza to bits, and then drove away in his jeep as the child bled to death.Anati was one the 23 Palestinians (including three children) killed by Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank during the Gaza onslaught, according to U.N. statistics, along with more than 2,000 wounded, 38% by live fire. ""None of those killed were endangering soldiers' lives,"" Israeli journalist Gideon Levy reported. To none of this is there any reaction, just as there was no reaction while Israel killed, on average, more than two Palestinian children a week for the past 14 years. Unpeople, after all.It is commonly claimed on all sides that, if the two-state settlement is dead as a result of Israel's takeover of Palestinian lands, then the outcome will be one state West of the Jordan. Some Palestinians welcome this outcome, anticipating that they can then conduct a civil rights struggle for equal rights on the model of South Africa under apartheid. Many Israeli commentators warn that the resulting ""demographic problem"" of more Arab than Jewish births and diminishing Jewish immigration will undermine their hope for a ""democratic Jewish state.""But these widespread beliefs are dubious.The realistic alternative to a two-state settlement is that Israel will continue to carry forward the plans it has been implementing for years, taking over whatever is of value to it in the West Bank, while avoiding Palestinian population concentrations and removing Palestinians from the areas it is integrating into Israel. That should avoid the dreaded ""demographic problem.""The areas being integrated into Israel include a vastly expanded Greater Jerusalem, the area within the illegal ""Separation Wall,"" corridors cutting through the regions to the East, and will probably also encompass the Jordan Valley. Gaza will likely remain under its usual harsh siege, separated from the West Bank. And the Syrian Golan Heights -- like Jerusalem, annexed in violation of Security Council orders -- will quietly become part of Greater Israel. In the meantime, West Bank Palestinians will be contained in unviable cantons, with special accommodation for elites in standard neocolonial style.These basic policies have been underway since the 1967 conquest, following a principle enunciated by then-Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, one of the Israeli leaders most sympathetic to the Palestinians. He informed his cabinet colleagues that they should tell Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, ""We have no solution, you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes may leave, and we will see where this process leads.""The suggestion was natural within the overriding conception articulated in 1972 by future president Haim Herzog: ""I do not deny the Palestinians a place or stand or opinion on every matter... But certainly I am not prepared to consider them as partners in any respect in a land that has been consecrated in the hands of our nation for thousands of years. For the Jews of this land there cannot be any partner."" Dayan also called for Israel’s ""permanent rule"" (""memshelet keva"") over the occupied territories. When Netanyahu expresses the same stand today, he is not breaking new ground.Like other states, Israel pleads ""security"" as justification for its aggressive and violent actions. But knowledgeable Israelis know better. Their recognition of reality was articulated clearly in 1972 by Air Force Commander (and later president) Ezer Weizmann. He explained that there would be no security problem if Israel were to accept the international call to withdraw from the territories it conquered in 1967, but the country would not then be able to ""exist according to the scale, spirit, and quality she now embodies.""For a century, the Zionist colonization of Palestine has proceeded primarily on the pragmatic principle of the quiet establishment of facts on the ground, which the world was to ultimately come to accept. It has been a highly successful policy. There is every reason to expect it to persist as long as the United States provides the necessary military, economic, diplomatic, and ideological support. For those concerned with the rights of the brutalized Palestinians, there can be no higher priority than working to change U.S. policies, not an idle dream by any means.Noam Chomsky is Institute Professor emeritus in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Police say 14 people were known to have died in the bombing of an outdoor World Cup viewing center in a northeast Nigerian city. The suicide bomber detonated a tricycle taxi packed with explosives Tuesday night. Police Assistant Superintendent Nathan Cheghan said Wednesday that 14 people were killed and 26 were wounded in the attack in Damaturu, capital of Yobe state. There was no immediate claim for the blast but Boko Haram was suspected. Boko Haram wants to enforce an Islamic state in Nigeria, Africaâs biggest oil producer with a population almost equally divided between Christians and Muslims. (AP Photo/Adamu Adamu)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d152400003500229423.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Isaac AbrakGOMBE, Nigeria, Sept 9 (Reuters) - First comes the killing, then the preaching.Islamist Boko Haram militants carrying automatic rifles and machetes roar into northeast Nigerian towns or hamlets in columns of pickup trucks and motorbikes and fire at all adult men they see. They often finish them off with knives.When they have hoisted their black flag inscribed with Koranic verses over government offices or the local emir's palace, they tell the surviving women they will marry them and ""live in peace"", according to survivors who escaped from the town of Gwoza, seized by Boko Haram last month.Escapees from other seized northeast towns, such as Madagali, say the Islamists also torch churches, and force Christian women to convert to Islam under pain of death.Slaughtering and preaching a ""better life under Islamic rule"", the jihadist group has taken over a string of locations in recent weeks in Nigeria's remote northeast, in what looks like a plan to seize and hold a ""Muslim territory"" or caliphate, apparently inspired by the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria.In Gwoza last month, near the Cameroon border, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau declared such an Islamic-ruled enclave. He made the proclamation in a video showing his fighters running amok, firing in all directions and killing captives. They rode in pick-up trucks and captured army vehicles, including at least one armored car.The conquests are a departure from Boko Haram's usual hit-and-run tactics. Shekau is believed to be mimicking the IS proclamation of its caliphate which caused alarm in the Middle East and West amid fears of an upsurge in jihadist attacks.With memories still present of the 1967-70 Biafra secession war, Nigeria's armed forces have vowed to resist any takeover of territory in Africa's No. 1 oil producer by Boko Haram, whose advances have even threatened the Borno state capital Maiduguri.But refugees often speak of soldiers fleeing with them from the assaults by the militants' mobile columns, which can consist of hundreds of well-armed fanatical fighters.When they appear, the killing often seems indiscriminate.Gwoza schoolgirl Indiyanatu Musa, 16, who witnessed the Aug 5 attack on the town with her school friends, said the raiders started shooting as soon as they arrived at a local park.""They said 'Shekau sent us. You are condemned to death be you Christian or Muslim,'"" she told Reuters at Gombe in the neighboring state of the same name, to where she had fled with her sisters after escaping from Gwoza in Borno state.""Within a short time, the whole park was filled with bodies just lying everywhere. I was screaming and so were my schoolmates and the rest of the women around,"" said Musa. ADULT MALES KILLEDResidents from Gamborou-Ngala, also taken over by the group last month, have spoken of similar widespread slaughter.Often, the survivors say, the killing goes on for days, with the ""Boko Haram boys"" going from house to house, hunting for males aged 18 or over and dragging them out to be shot.""I saw several boys who had been hiding in the ceilings of their parents' houses brought out and shot,"" Musa said.Males over 18 were targeted because Boko Haram believed they were members of a pro-government vigilante organization, the Civilian JTF, which Shekau has threatened. ""We warn the vigilante, called Civilian JTF ... while you are shouting for mercy, we will strike, smash your heads and kill you all,"" he said in a video released Aug. 24 claiming Gwoza's takeover.Women were spared. ""They told us that they would not harm us, but that they are only killing our men because our men form vigilantes to fight them,"" said Aisha Abubakar, who managed to escape from Gwoza with her four children and husband.The fighters who took the town also pillaged shops and stores, Musa said.When the killing had ended, remaining inhabitants were expected to attend Islamic prayers. ""Each morning, they go around the houses knocking and calling on us to go for morning prayers and a sermon in the mosque,"" Musa said.In scenes reported elsewhere too, Gwoza residents say they saw black flags flying over the Emir's palace carrying inscriptions in Arabic and the local Hausa language which read ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Great).At Gamborou-Ngala, which is also on the border with Cameroon, Boko Haram fighters had occupied the immigration and customs office, opening fire if threatened, said Alice Adejuwon, one of hundreds of Nigerians who fled over the frontier. ""LIKE A CONVENTIONAL ARMY""Boko Haram's seizure of northeast towns and territory outside of its Sambisa forest and Mandara Mountains hideouts has alarmed both Nigerians and the country's western allies. The top U.S. diplomat for Africa, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, last week called the group's recent gains a ""sober reality check"".""Unless swift action is taken, Nigeria could be facing a rapid takeover of a large area of its territory reminiscent of ISIS's lightning advances in Iraq,"" the Nigeria Security Network said in a Sept 2 report. The Network groups Nigerian and international experts working on that country's security issues.""They are beginning to operate like a conventional army ... They are reported to be using armored vehicles, including tanks, and heavy weapons,"" the Network reported.Boko Haram has killed thousands since it launched its anti-government insurgency in 2009, mostly in the poor northeast. Under Shekau's leadership it has appeared to become increasingly violent, carrying out shootings and bombings across the north, and even, sporadically, in the central federal capital Abuja.Stung by the northeast losses, Nigeria's armed forces have counter-attacked with warplanes. They halted the group's advance at Bama southeast of Maiduguri, and are also fighting to block a Boko Haram push into neighboring Adamawa state.At Gwoza last month, government soldiers escaped to the rocky hills around the town along with the fleeing civilians.""I saw three soldiers in the hills, there was one who called his superior for reinforcement, they told him that they should just look for a way to escape,"" said Bukar Bulama, 26, a Gwoza market trader who escaped with a friend Mohammed Usman, 23.""I also saw the Emir of Gwoza, he was in the hills too,"" said Bulama. THE NEW EMIRBack in the Emir's palace, Shekau had installed himself, promising ""a better life under Islamic rule,"" said Musa.Abubakar said, before she managed to escape, she was among a group of Gwoza women initially taken to see him to ask for the killings to stop. ""We went to the Emir's palace and saw a man sitting in the Emir's seat dressed in our Emir's royal clothes with a turban. He said he was Shekau"".He told them they would not be hurt. With their men folk dead, militants would marry them, ""we will all live in peace"".""He also said: 'We have installed an Islamic Caliphate in Gwoza so every one of you must comply or be killed,"" she said.Counter-terrorism experts say some links exist between Boko Haram and other Islamist groups, such as al Qaeda's North African franchise and Somalia's al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab, but there is little evidence so far of close extensive cooperation.In a national vote due in February, Nigeria's president, southerner Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to seek re-election. Many believe political tensions stemming from the historic rivalry between Nigeria's mostly Muslim north and largely Christian south are also stoking the Boko Haram insurgency.Thousands of northeast residents have fled southwards before the marauding militant columns, fearful of being caught in the group's rolling campaign of killing and preaching Islamic rule.""Better to submit to Allah before it becomes too late,"" Shekau said in last month's video.
