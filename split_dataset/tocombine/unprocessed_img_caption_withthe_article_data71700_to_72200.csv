Tens of thousands of people lined his route into the city in the biggest crowds of the trip so far.Addressing Musevini and diplomats at State House, Francis spoke of the world refugee crisis and said how the world handles it will be ""a test of our humanity, our respect for human dignity and above all our solidarity with our brothers and sisters in need.""The high point of the pope's third day on the continent came earlier in Nairobi, where he scrapped a prepared script to address a packed stadium with the down-to-earth and spontaneous style that has endeared him to Catholics and others around the world.""The spirit of evil takes us to a lack of unity. It takes to tribalism, corruption and drugs. It takes us to destruction out of fanaticism,"" the pope said, urging young people not to give in to these vices.""Let's hold hands together, let's stand up as a sign against bad tribalism,"" he said, grasping the hands of two young people on stage.Tribal loyalties often trump political allegiances in Kenya, and some other African nations, sometimes sparking violence.After being welcomed into the stadium with rapturous singing and dancing, including by President Uhuru Kenyatta, the first lady and clergy, the pope was cheered throughout his speech.The president reshuffled his cabinet this week after several ministers were embroiled in corruption allegations.Corruption ""is like sugar, sweet, we like, it's easy,"" Francis said. ""Also in the Vatican there are cases of corruption.""Please, don't develop that taste for that sugar which is called corruption.""In Kenya, the target of a spate of deadly attacks by Islamist militants, the pope has called for inter-faith dialog, said God's name can never be invoked to justify violence, and urged world leaders to tackle climate change.Lack of education and work was a ""social danger,"" pushing some to radical ideologies.""God is much stronger than any recruitment campaign,"" he said, adding youths should help potential victims by bringing them into groups or even asking them ""to come and watch some football ... Don't allow them to remain on their own.""Earlier he addressed resident of a Nairobi slum of potholed roads, open sewers and rough shacks.He told slum dwellers, charity workers and clergy in a small church their situation was one of the ""wounds inflicted by minorities who cling to power and wealth, who selfishly squander while a growing majority is forced to flee to abandoned, filthy and run-down peripheries.""Francis will stay in Uganda until Sunday, when he is due to travel to the war-torn Central African Republic - his final stop in Africa.(Writing by Philip Pullella and Edmund Blair; additional reporting by Edith Honan and Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)"

Multiple news outlets these week proclaimed that a company called Humai is developing methods that will get previously dead people up and walking within 30 years. But experts in the field say there's no way Humai's plan is feasible, and there's some evidence the whole thing may be a hoax.Humai founder and CEO Josh Bocanegra says the company will rely on advances in artificial technology, nanotechnology and cryonics -- and some advanced planning from future dead people while they are still alive.""We'll first collect extensive data on our members for years prior to their death via various apps we're developing. After death, we'll freeze the brain using cryonics technology,"" he told PopSci.com.""When the technology is fully developed we'll implant the brain into an artificial body.""Bocanegra says the company's biggest challenge ""will be connecting a human brain to a bionic body that functions with your thoughts,"" he told The Huffington Post in an email. ""For that, we have to do research with neurosurgeons/neuroscientists (among others) and work closely in the field of nanotechnology and biotechnology.""Humai's website is basically only a launch page with a request for emails while New Age music plays in the background. Michael Maven, a British-based business consultant who has developed software that helps retain customers based on previous purchases, told HuffPost that Bocanegra's idea is ""damn near impossible.""Maven is skeptical because Bocanegra claims he can do -- with only five employees, only two of whom are researchers -- what scientists have been trying to do for years, and with no venture capital.Then there's the sticky issue of bringing a brain back to life.""How will he connect it to a machine? You don't just simply plug it in via USB. Nanotechnology is not an answer, it's a buzzword,"" Maven said via email. ""The technology which could extract legible thoughts and ideas out of an organ made of living tissue is nowhere near anything we have yet.""Andrea Riposati, an artificial intelligence expert formerly employed at Amazon, said Bocanegra's plan is both a hoax and could be ""a very effective way to rob people.""""Everyone will tell you that the technology is not ready. No reason to believe it will be ready in 30 years,"" Riposati told HuffPost by email. ""But this is an amazing business model for Humai. They can collect monthly/yearly payments from their customers promising something in the future.""However, there's no evidence that Bocanegra is actually asking anyone for cash, and some evidence suggests his plan may not be dead serious. The 25-year-old's primary business experience isn't in tech, but in creating beats for hip-hop artists, according to Forbes. And Bocanegra has a history of Internet ventures of dubious reality. He came to the world's attention in 2013 when he created ""LoveRoom,"" a sort of Airbnb home rental system for people who wanted to rent a place where the other guests would be attractive. The idea got a lot of media attention, but Forbes noted that the business didn't actually exist. Bocanegra then told Forbes that LoveRoom was a ""thought that I would work on if there was interest. But it was really more of a joke because I didn’t think people would really be interested.”But he now maintains that both projects are for real. He told HuffPost that LoveRoom has over 16,000 members and a reality show in the works, and that the media just misunderstood him when he previously suggested it was fake. And as for Humai?“Humai is a legit project,” he wrote. “Yes, it's super ambitious, but that's the reason why I'm excited to work on it. As an innovator, big ideas have always been my core motivation. Humai is obviously not monetary incentive - at least not anytime soon. This is a project I care deeply about and I only hope to contribute to making an impact on humanity.”This article has been updated with comments from Josh Bocanegra.Also on HuffPost:"

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4d5b42600002d018278e8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In a recent interview with George Stephanopoulos, Donald Trump said he would ""absolutely bring back"" waterboarding, which he described as ""peanuts compared to what [America's enemies] do to us."" Not to be outdone, Ben Carson followed by equating opposition to the practice with political correctness in the face of ""an enemy who wants to destroy you."" He then declined, in his own interview with Stephanopoulos, to tell ""the enemy what we're going to do and what we're not going to do.""  These were not off the cuff remarks, hastily made in the wake of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. In early August, both candidates took pro-waterboarding positions, offering the same defenses as they're giving now. ""When you see the other side chopping off heads,"" Trump told ABC News' Jon Karl then, ""waterboarding doesn't sound very severe."" Carson, when asked about waterboarding during the first Republican debate, said he ""wouldn't necessarily be broadcasting what we're going to do"" and denied that there is any ""such thing as a politically correct war.""  This is bad news for opponents of torture. Trump and Carson are among the Republican Party's leading candidates for president. Both have proven themselves able, through the alchemical power of their words, to alter the agenda of the other Republican candidates. Jeb Bush, for instance, staked out his own pro-waterboarding position soon after Trump and Carson originally offered theirs.  But a close look at what Trump and Carson have said about waterboarding should give critics of torture reason for optimism. When talking about the practice, both candidates have relied on stock defenses. Since the Abu Ghraib scandal broke in the spring of 2004, Republicans have downplayed, as Trump has, the severity, illegality and immorality of U.S. torture by favorably comparing the country's practices to the atrocities of our enemies. Carson's position, on the other hand, is just a reboot of Mitt Romney's. During the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Romney supported ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques while refusing to ""lay out a list of what is specifically referred to as torture."" All that Carson has added to Romney's position is the flourish of ""political correctness.""  Both Trump and Carson owe their popularity among Republicans to their rhetorical extremes. Trump inexplicably jump-started his campaign by calling immigrants from Mexico rapists. Carson has said he would not ""advocate"" for or ""agree"" with the country electing a Muslim president. Yet neither has transformed the debate about waterboarding, preferring instead relatively safe and tested justifications of the practice.  More importantly, neither Trump nor Carson actually admits that waterboarding is torture and defends it as such. As nearly all advocates of ""enhanced interrogation"" do, both candidates sidestep this issue. They also overlook evidence, such as the cables quoted in the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA interrogation, that shows just how cruel waterboarding and other ""enhanced"" techniques are.  America's torture advocates, it seems, have few moves left. The most brazen of them are not brazen enough to offer anything but well-worn defenses. None dares admit that they believe U.S. security requires us to commit acts of extreme brutality.  Amid campaigns in which nothing is off limits, torture remains beyond the pale."
5,IMPACT,Start Peace in Syria With Ceasefire and Food,"William Lambers, ContributorAuthor, 'Ending World Hunger' Feeding America Blogger Council,...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/start-peace-in-syria-with_b_8544974.html,There is nothing to be gained from continued fighting in Syria. There won't be anything left in the country.

The civil war there has allowed ISIS (Daesh) to grow and thrive, setting the stage for their attacks in Paris and elsewhere. Ending the war in Syria is crucial toward eliminating the terrorists. A nationwide ceasefire in Syria is a first step. There is a ray of hope. Last month four towns in war-torn Syria received a miracle of sorts. It was something none of them had seen in months or even years: food and peace.A ceasefire agreement between the Syrian government and opposition forces was reached with the help of the United Nations.The agreement allowed humanitarian aid to reach the towns of Zabadani and Madaya in rural Damascus. In addition, aid was delivered to Foah and Kafraya in Idleb governorate. These are towns that had previously been denied aid because of the fighting.  Rural Damascus, Syria. ICRC team members discuss final preparations before moving a humanitarian aid convoy into the town of Zabadani. (CC BY-NC-ND / ICRC / P. Krzysiek)It happened after sunset on October 18, when trucks from the United Nations, the International Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent rolled into the towns. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) was part of the convoy. Hussam Al Saleh of WFP Syria says they ""delivered monthly food rations for almost 30,000 civilians in four Syrian besieged towns as part of the cease-fire agreement."" The war has destroyed basic services and left 12 million Syrians, over half of the population, in need of humanitarian aid. But the fighting often blocks relief agencies from reaching those in need. For at least this moment, the guns of Syria's war were silenced and people could eat, the most basic human right. The WFP food ration for the four towns included bulgur, rice, sugar, chickpeas, pasta, canned pulses and vegetable oil. Each family's ration can feed five people for one month. If the ceasefire can hold, more food for the hungry can arrive. Hussam adds, ""Arrangements are underway to deliver additional supplies to all four locations."" A nationwide ceasefire would allow more WFP food to reach the hungry. (file photo courtesy WFP/Laure_Chadraoui)Everyone knows these ceasefires are fragile. But we all need hope that the war in Syria will end soon. And just maybe we are seeing the first steps. Let's expand this into a ""nationwide ceasefire"" in Syria. Foreign ministers from around the globe called for such a ceasefire last month during talks in Vienna. It's part of the roadmap to peace in Syria, a political process that will put in place a new government that respects human rights for all. Following the tragedy in Paris, world leaders are now quickly stepping up efforts to end the war in Syria. For if the government and opposition groups keep fighting, that will provide the chaos Daesh needs to survive in Syria. That must not be allowed. By ending the civil conflict, focus can be turned solely to eliminating the terrorists. As U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said, ""we also know that Daesh cannot be defeated in the end without de-escalating the underlying conflict in Syria, which attracts fighters to this battlefield... this political process has to be accompanied by a ceasefire that will help to end the bloodshed as quickly as possible."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, who is tasked with seeking a peaceful resolution of the ongoing conflict in Syria. (photo courtesy of the Mission of the United States Geneva) There is nothing to be gained from continued fighting in Syria. There won't be anything left in the country. For right now Syrians cannot even do the basics like growing food. Millions of Syrians have fled the war and sought refuge across the Middle East and Europe. These Syrians are hungry, tired and poor. The WFP and other relief agencies do not have enough funding to feed them. We cannot ignore their plight. No peace process is going to succeed without coming to the aid of all Syrian war victims. As the Vienna Communique states, ""Humanitarian access will be ensured throughout the territory of Syria, and the participants will increase support for internally displaced persons, refugees and their host countries.""International security depends on achieving peace in Syria and eliminating terrorism. The international community can and must support the Syrian people in starting on that road to peace."

And you don't suddenly become a leader once you reach a certain pay grade.A true leader influences others to be their best. Leadership is about social influence, not positional power.If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader. -- John Quincy Adams You don't even need to have people reporting to you to be a leader. A janitor can influence people and lead just as a CEO can.Likewise, anyone can become a follower, even while holding a leadership position.If you're a slave to the status quo, lack vision, or don't motivate everyone around you to be their absolute best, then you're a follower. Even if you happen to have a leadership title, people won't follow you when they see those behaviors present.A senior executive who creates unnecessary bureaucracy, locks himself in his office, and fails to interact with others in any meaningful way is no more a leader than an antisocial software engineer who refuses to do anything but write code.Of course, the real question is--are you a leader or a follower?To find out, you need to ask yourself some very important questions. Think carefully as you respond to each one, and you'll soon know for certain.Do you go above and beyond? Followers do their jobs, and that's it. No matter how good they may be at those jobs, it rarely occurs to them to go beyond their basic functions. Leaders, on the other hand, see their job descriptions as the bare minimum--the foundation upon which they build greatness. Leaders see their real role as adding value, and they add it whenever and wherever they see an opportunity.Are you confident? Followers see the talents and accomplishments of other people as a threat. Leaders see those same talents and accomplishments as an asset. Leaders want to make things better, and they'll take help anywhere they can find it. Leaders are true team players. They aren't afraid to admit that they need other people to be strong where they're weak.Are you optimistic? Followers see the limitations inherent in any given situation; leaders see the possibilities. When things go wrong, leaders don't dwell on how bad things are. They're too busy trying to make things better.Are you open to change? Followers are content to stick with the safety of the status quo. They see change as frightening and troublesome. Leaders are maximizers who see opportunity in change. Because leaders want constant improvement, they're never afraid to ask, ""What's next?""Are you decisive? Followers often hesitate to act, out of fear that they'll do the wrong thing. Leaders aren't afraid to make a call, even when they're not sure if it's the right one. They'd rather make a decision and be wrong than suffer from the paralysis of indecision.Leaders would rather make a decision and be wrong than suffer from the paralysis of indecision. Are you accountable? When mistakes are made, followers are quick to blame circumstances and other people. Leaders, on the other hand, are quick to accept accountability for their actions. They don't worry that admitting fault might make them look bad, because they know that shifting the blame would just make them look worse.Are you unflappable? Followers often let obstacles and mishaps throw them off course. When something goes wrong, they assume the whole project is doomed. Leaders expect obstacles and love being challenged. They know that even the best-laid plans can run into unexpected problems, so they take problems in stride and stay the course.Are you humble? Followers are always chasing glory. Leaders are humble. They don't allow any authority they may have to make them feel that they are better than anyone else. As such, they don't hesitate to jump in and do the dirty work when needed, and they won't ask anyone to do anything they wouldn't be willing to do themselves.Are you passionate? Followers are trapped in the daily grind. They go to work and complete their tasks so that they can go home at the end of the day and resume their real lives. Leaders love what they do and see their work as an important part of--not a weak substitute for--real life. Their job isn't just what they do; it's an important part of who they are.Are you motivated from within? Followers are only motivated by external factors: the next title, the next raise, the next gain in status. Leaders are internally motivated. They don't work for status or possessions. They are motivated to excel because it's who they are. True leaders keep pushing forward even when there's no carrot dangling in front of them.  True leaders keep pushing forward even when there's no carrot dangling in front of them. Do you focus on titles? Followers care a lot about titles, both their own and those of the people they work with. They're very conscious of who outranks whom, because they lack the skill and motivation to create leadership from within. Leaders, on the other hand, focus on what each individual brings to the table, regardless of what's printed on a business card.Are you focused on people? Followers focus on what they can achieve individually. Leaders are team players, because they know that greatness is a collective feat. A leader is only as good as what he or she can achieve through other people.A leader is only as good as what he or she can achieve through other people. Are you willing to learn? Leaders, while confident, know that they're neither superhuman nor infallible. They're not afraid to admit when they don't know something, and they're willing to learn from anyone who can teach them, whether that person is a subordinate, a peer, or a superior. Followers are too busy trying to prove they're competent to learn anything from anyone else.Bringing It All TogetherTake another quick look at the questions above. There's not a single one about title, position, or place on the org chart. That's because you can have the title and position without being a leader.You may have worked for someone who fits that description. And you probably have colleagues who serve in leadership roles without a title.Leadership and followership are mindsets. They're completely different ways of looking at the world. One is reactive, and the other is proactive. One is pessimistic; the other is optimistic. Where one sees a to-do list, the other sees possibilities. So don't wait for the title. Leadership isn't something that anyone can give you--you have to earn it and claim it for yourself........And please, share your thoughts on the topic in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

As Christie reflects on his former presidency of the Ventura charter's infamous motorcycle club, active members are claiming many of his stories are more than exaggeration, but downright fiction. Such palpable attempts at legacy-building include events where they assert George wasn't present, or occurred years before he joined the club.Ya gotta hand it to memory. And imagination. Believe me, I get how this can happen. Truly I do. I love to share the story about how I jumped from the deck of the Titanic, heroically rescued six people, swam to a remote island without the aid of a life-vest, and was crowned queen -- only to be rescued a week ago Sunday by an acrobat and two jugglers from a traveling circus. But hey, the history channel just won't return my calls.   So, why do I care about Christie's historical revision? First a disclosure: I'm not a groupie of the club. It's just not who I am. In reality, I'm an inspirational writer. Yep, I'm a bona fide, church goin' girl. But here's why I care: For over 35 years, I've been close friends with Sonny Barger. I know. Sometimes life is stranger than fiction. Although we're from entirely different worlds, Sonny, and his club brothers have consistently treated me with kindness and respect. I would honestly trust this man with my life. Sadly, there are times I wish my fellow Christians displayed the level of loyalty I see manifested within the parameters of this club.Enter jealousy: While the organization is world-wide (each charter is autonomous- with its own president and voting structure) to many people, Sonny is more than a founding member; he's a legend. Sonny is everything, it seems, Christie ever wanted to be. Unfortunately, for George, there just isn't enough room on the planet for two Sonny Bargers. Christie's implied he left the club in 2011, because the lifestyle was no longer a good fit. However, a growing number of active members have publicly denied George's version of the story. In addition, the contents of a 2011 letter, penned by an Oakland member and addressed to Christie, has recently resurfaced. The correspondence told George, in no uncertain terms, it was time to resign his membership. Why? There was growing suspicion that Christie was sharing incriminating information with authorities about his club brothers, in exchange for personal leniency in an ongoing investigation. And lo and behold, shortly after that letter was sent, Christie walked into the Ventura clubhouse and offered up his resignation. Within a few days, the club voted to change George's status to ""Out-Bad/No Contact."" (Out-Bad"" is a term similar to a dishonorable discharge. And ""No contact"" means just that: No contact allowed from any member to George Christie . Ever. ).That decision did not occur because Christie resigned. Nor did it occur because Sonny influenced the vote (as Christie claims). The decision was made because, by this time, multiple members were convinced George was an informant -- throwing them under the bus, in order to save himself. When I asked Sonny about the conflicting stories, he leaned forward and said, ""I'm willing to take a polygraph about this issue. The question is: Will George?"" And why do I believe the club's version? While I've never claimed to be a math whiz, and my head spins at the mere thought of a word problem: (""If a car is traveling from San Diego to Los Angeles at 70 MPH, and the headwinds are 10 MPH, what did the driver have for lunch?"") even I can figure out the following equation...In December of 2011, George was indicted for conspiracy to firebomb two Ventura tattoo parlors. Then, just a few days into his 2013 trial -- while looking at a cumulative sentence of 60 years plus life -- a plea was granted giving Christie just a year at La Tuna, a minimum security correctional center.That's 60 years, plus Life, reduced to a year. In a low security institution. The final kicker? His plea agreement was sealed by the judge. Go ahead. Do the math. It's just not that complicated.The bottom line is: Betrayal never comes from a known enemy. Nor does it show-up via a stranger. Betrayal always lands on our doorstep, delivered by a Judas whom we trust deeply. Someone in our inner circle: A family member. A close friend. And in this case, many believe, a club brother. The anger over Christie's series, perhaps better titled, Out-Bad Chronicles: Fantasy from Hell, is not about a quasi-documentary of supposed club events. It's about betrayal.Plain and simple.Candy Chand lives in Cave Creek, AZ. She's an author of 7 books and numerous newspaper and magazine articles.

9,SCIENCE,The Mystery Of Alaska's Sea Otter Deaths Continue To Baffle Scientists,Dominique Mosbergen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sea-otter-deaths-alaska_us_565695f7e4b08e945feb1817,"""It’s scary to know there’s something out there in the wild that we may or may not be able to do anything about.""",2015-11-26,More than 250 dead or dying sea otters have washed ashore in the Kachemak Bay area in Alaska this year.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An unusually high number of sick or dying sea otters has washed onto the shores of Alaska’s southern coast this year. But despite the efforts of many baffled scientists to find an answer, the exact cause of the die-off remains unknown.More than 250 sick or dead sea otters have turned up on beaches in the Kachemak Bay region this year. Joel Garlich-Miller, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told Hakai Magazine that this number is more than double 2014’s -- which had already been a “higher than average” figure.Based on the symptoms of the otters that have been found, scientists believe something peculiar may be plaguing the animals. Preliminary tests suggest that toxins from harmful algal blooms and infections caused by bacteria might be contributing to the otter deaths; but given the spike in morbidity, another as-yet-unknown factor is also suspected.“Something is hitting them harder and faster, in addition to the disease that we’re familiar with seeing, something else seems to be involved,” Marc Webber of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told Alaska Public Media last month. “That’s just speculation, we don’t have any evidence yet, but that’s what we’re seeing on the beach.”Compounding this mystery, reports say that while some dead otters were found emaciated, indicative of a long illness; some of them appear to have died suddenly at a healthy weight, which is “even more curious,”Alaska SeaLife Center veterinarian Carrie Goertz told Hakai Magazine. These seemingly healthy otters act paralyzed, or “seize” up just before death, reports Homer News.Kachemak Bay is home to about 6,000 sea otters. Since the marine mammals play a critical role in their ecosystems, experts say the mass die-off is likely a sign that the entire ecosystem is being impacted by something harmful.In October, the Alaska SeaLife Center and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in a press release that a team of experts had launched an investigation into the spike in otter deaths in the area.So far, scientists say they have a few ideas as to what’s causing the animals to fall sick; but nothing concrete has been determined.Kathy Burek, a veterinary pathologist, told Hakai Magazine that she believes the bacterium Streptococcus infantarius subspecies coli may be one of the culprits. However, as the bacterium is quite typical in this population of otters, she suspects “there may be something else going on that’s making these infections more deadly.”“Any time you have a disease process occurring at an unusual rate, even if it’s a known disease process, you want to figure out what’s different, what’s causing it to increase so much,” Burek said.Burek suspects that a mystery virus may be to blame. She said, however that is could take “weeks or months” to figure out if this is true.Halley Werner, a supervisor at the Alaska SeaLife Center, told KTVA.com in October that the spate of the sea otter deaths has unnerved her. “It’s scary to know there’s something out there in the wild that we may or may not be able to do anything about,” she said."

Viewers were outraged by how much the footage conflicted with the police department's initial account of the shooting, which claimed that McDonald was acting strangely and lunged at police before shots were fired.The video, which Emanuel's administration and the state's attorney's office have long fought to keep from being publicly released, instead shows 17-year-old McDonald carrying a small knife and walking away from officers before Van Dyke opens fire from about 10 feet away. After McDonald falls, Van Dyke continues to shoot for at least 15 seconds. Punishing Van Dyke, who has been out on paid leave since the shooting and has 18 previous complaints against him, is not enough to address the incident, activists say.The Rev. Jesse Jackson told The Huffington Post that he met with a cross-section of leaders Wednesday who want Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy ousted and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez, whose office knew of the video two weeks after the shooting, off the case. In addition, he believes Emanuel must answer for the video's delayed release and the troubled state of police-civilian relations in Chicago.""He must be [held accountable],"" Jackson said. ""Clearly the mayor and the police chief … saw the tape and determined they should not release it.""Emanuel holds he did not see the video until it was released publicly, but critics point out that he called the video ""hideous"" the day before. The mayor's office did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment on when he first saw the video or on other concerns raised by activists in this article. The shooting, Jackson noted, took place just a month before Emanuel was up for re-election. Chicago Tribune reporter John Kass also raised the coincidence of that timing in a column Tuesday calling on people to hold the mayor accountable.""If the video had come out during the election campaign, Rahm Emanuel would not be mayor today,"" he wrote. Jackson doesn't entirely buy arguments that releasing the tape would have unfairly prejudiced the case against police.""Their argument is that it might incite the public,"" he said. ""But one might argue that it's also covering up valuable information in this day of cameras on police cars. ... The whole idea of the cameras is to protect the public.""While many Chicagoans began using the hashtag #RecallRahm after the video's release, Veronica Morris Moore, a member of the organization Fearless Leading by the Youth, told HuffPost that she's seen the black community's ""growing frustration"" with him for some time.""Mayor Rahm Emanuel needs to step down and hang up his political belt,"" she said. ""It’s obscene that he would act like he’s happy about punishing this officer when he waited to punish him for so long. And I know the only thing that motivated him to punish this officer is that it now became a very public issue and case. ... He is insulting people, and nobody’s buying it.""Emanuel also drew ire last month for lending credence to ""the Ferguson effect,"" a statistically unsupported idea that the Black Lives Matter movement's demands for more police accountability has scared cops away from proactive policing, leading to a surge in crime. ""That was a miscalculation,"" Jackson said of Emanuel's comments. ""Police are not being suppressed.""Moore said the mayor's suggestion the ""Ferguson effect"" is at play is an insult to the ""very alive and well-organized community"" that's been rallying around police issues in Chicago for years. Ultimately, both Jackson and Moore argue, the root of the problem is the mayor's high police spending.""All the focus is on police and containment. There’s no focus on development,"" Jackson said. ""The amount of money spent on police is money that could be spent on sustaining teachers and schools without libraries and schools without books.""Also on HuffPost: "

Others are from Awamiya, a largely Shi'ite town in the oil-producing Eastern Province where the government has suppressed demonstrations for equal rights.Diplomats in Riyadh say their governments have been assured Saudi Arabia will not execute Shi'ites convicted after protests.Awamiya residents responded to the news by closing off roads leading into the city with burning debris, local activists said.The alleged al Qaeda militants stand accused of attempts to overthrow the government and carry out attacks using small weapons, explosives and surface-to-air missiles, Okaz said.One prisoner was accused of trying to buy nuclear material in Yemen worth $1.5 million for use inside Saudi Arabia.The charges against the Awamiya residents include sedition, attacks on security officials and interference in neighboring Bahrain, which has also experienced unrest since 2011.Saudi Arabia has already executed over 150 people this year, mostly by public beheading, the most in 20 years, rights group Amnesty International said this month.The Saudi monarchy has in recent years sentenced to death dozens of people convicted of taking part in al Qaeda attacks in Saudi Arabia from 2003-06 and again in 2009.Islamic State sympathizers have killed dozens in Saudi Arabia over the past 12 months with a string of mosque bombings and shootings aimed at members of the Shi'ite Muslim minority as well as security officers and Western expatriates.The Syria and Iraq-based militant group has called on its followers in Saudi Arabia to stay home and conduct attacks there instead of traveling to join the caliphate it declared in 2014.Saudi police have detained hundreds of the group's suspected sympathizers and have joined an international coalition carrying out air strikes against it in Syria. Riyadh has also deployed state-affiliated clergy to denounce jihadist ideology.Saudi courts have also to death this year seven Shi'ite men convicted of sedition, for taking part in pro-democracy protests and attacks on police during demonstrations over discrimination from 2011-13.Two of those men were minors at the time of the protests. Sentencing them to death to having bodies publicly displayed prompted an international outcry.The last time Saudi Arabia carried out mass executions for security offenses was after a group of Islamist militants seized Mecca's Grand Mosque in 1979.The only people executed so far for al Qaeda attacks in the kingdom in the last decade, which have killed hundreds, were two men from Chad earlier this year.Also on HuffPost:"

Security analysts say they could be collaborating.A source close to the investigation said the suspects had been brought in for interrogation, based on information found in one of the attacker's mobile phones.One of them had been regularly in touch with one of the gunmen since August while another sent telephone credit to an attacker, he said.""It's only after questioning that we will find out if the second suspect sells phone credit or is an accomplice,"" said the source, requesting anonymity.The attack comes amid deteriorating security in the country just two years after a French-led military operation to scatter Islamist militants who briefly occupied the desert north.French troops and a 10,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force (MINUSMA) are struggling to stabilize the former French colony and strikes on both Malian and Western targets have spread further south and far beyond traditional militant strongholds.The U.S. embassy in Bamako has warned of the possibility of ""further terrorist activity in the capital"" and advised its citizens to avoid bars, restaurants and shopping centers.Since the Radisson hotel attack, Malian forces have begun night patrols alongside U.N. forces and searched several private residences as part of a package of emergency measures.Christophe Monbelli-Valloir, deputy police commissioner for MINUSMA, said on Thursday a team from the FBI had arrived to help the Malian-led investigation.Germany has said it is willing to send up to 650 soldiers to bolster the U.N. force which has yet to reach its full strength of 12,680 men. It was not clear if the additional troops would expand the scope of the mission or help fill the current gap.

The United States is leading an international coalition fighting the group in Syria and Iraq.Since the Paris attacks, Americans now identify terrorism as the most important problem facing the country, Reuters-Ipsos polling shows.The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to suspend the refugee plan and intensify refugee screening measures before lawmakers left Washington for the Thanksgiving break. Several Republican candidates for the November 2016 presidential election have also said the refugees pose a risk.""People should remember that no refugee can enter our borders until they undergo the highest security checks of anyone traveling to the United States,"" Obama said in his address.Obama has vowed to veto the House refugee bill. But the White House has said it is open to working with lawmakers on tighter security measures for visitors from 38 countries who do not need a visa for short visits to the United States.In his address, Obama quoted from letters he had received from Americans welcoming Syrian refugees.""One woman from Pennsylvania wrote me to say, 'Money is tight for us in my household ... But I have a guest room. I have a pantry full of food. We can do this,'"" Obama said.""Another woman from Florida told me her family's history dates back to the Mayflower - and she said that welcoming others is part of 'what it means to be an American,'"" he said.
