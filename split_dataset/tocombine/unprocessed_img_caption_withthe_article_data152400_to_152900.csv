That scandal lead to Clinton's impeachment for perjury.Chelsea Clinton, now 33 and a special correspondent for NBC News, said on Twitter ""I completely agree!!!"" when the award was first made public in January.The National Father's Day Council cited Clinton's philanthropy work through the William J. Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, both started after he left the White House in 2001.In addition to his charity work, Bill Clinton appeared on the campaign trail in 2008 when Hillary Clinton ran for president, joking that if she was elected his honorific title could be ""First Laddie.""Clinton, 66, as well as Macy's Inc Chief Executive Terry Lundgren, will be honored for ""their success in balancing accomplished careers and the demands of fatherhood,"" the council said in a statement.Since the Father of the Year award was first bestowed in 1941, the citation has gone to Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, Generals Douglas MacArthur, Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, and sports notables Shaquille O'Neal and George Foreman.Years after leaving the White House, as he prepared for his daughter's 2010 wedding to investment banker Marc Mezvinsky, Bill Clinton said he was preparing for what he called the most important job he would ever do: ""walking Chelsea down the aisle."""

Mandela's latest health scare was splashed across the front pages of local newspapers but government officials have released no updates since announcing he was hospitalised in Pretoria early June 8 in a 'serious but stable' condition.

During previous hospital visits it had highlighted his ""good spirits"".His health is a cause for concern to the millions of South Africans who revere Mandela for his decades of struggle against white-minority rule and steering the continent's biggest economy to all-race elections.Hundreds gathered to pray for him at Sunday Mass at the Regina Mundi Catholic church in the sprawling Johannesburg township of Soweto.""We wish him speedy recovery, he must get well,"" Soweto resident Mlugisi Sekhosana said. ""We know what he did for us in South Africa. All the nation, black and white, we wish him well.""The government had yet to give an update on his condition early on Sunday.The Sunday Times newspaper took a sombre tone, with the headline ""It's time to let him go"", quoting a longtime friend of Mandela's, Andrew Mlangeni.""The family must release him so that God may have his own way. They must release him spiritually and put their faith in the hands of God,"" the newspaper quoted Mlangeni as saying.""Once the family releases him, the people of South Africa will follow.""
