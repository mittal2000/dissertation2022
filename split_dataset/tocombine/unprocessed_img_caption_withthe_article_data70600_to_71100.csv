The long-term study -- which began in 2003 -- was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It provides some of the strongest evidence yet that a more sustainable approach to farming is both good for the planet and good for farmers’ bottom lines.Still, many farmers are failing to adapt their practices and agriculture still accounts for a sizable chunk of U.S. total greenhouse gas emissions and industrial farming has raised significant concerns with soil and water quality as well.That disconnect prompted agroecologist Marcia DeLonge and her colleagues at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Cambridge-based nonprofit advocacy group, to question why findings like those coming from the Marsden Farm project weren’t being picked up on across the industry as a whole.The problem, according to an analysis released last month by the UCS and colleagues, is that research and education focused on sustainable agriculture only represents a small percentage of the annual support doled out via competitive, external grants issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture.Specifically, according to the UCS analysis, only 15 percent ($44 million) of the total amount of NIFA grants issued in 2014 ($294 million) included any elements of agroecology, defined as applying ecological concepts to creating sustainable food systems through techniques such as rotating crops and upping biodiversity on farms.Further, the analysis notes that only 4 percent of the grants were given to projects that could be considered truly “transformative” because they addressed economic support for farmers in addition to a changed approach to growing crops.The goal of their analysis, DeLonge told The Huffington Post, is to invite more transparency from the USDA when it comes to its funding of sustainable agriculture projects, in addition to making a case for more funding in that area. The organization has also launched a public statement with a similar aim that has thus far been signed by over 300 scientists and other experts.“We know what we’re doing right now isn’t working,” DeLonge said. “We know there is a huge number of problems that come from agriculture so how do we infuse a more big-picture perspective into the research? We know that when we invest in research, we see results.”For its part, the USDA says it has been funding “a very solid basis of research” in the area of sustainable agriculture and is getting a “good share” of the NIFA grants, according to Ann Bartuska, the agency’s deputy undersecretary of research, education and economics.Bartuska argued the UCS analysis did not take into account other relevant research taking place under the USDA umbrella beyond the NIFA grants, such as in-house investments in its Agricultural Research Service and Economic Research Service divisions and its National Agroforestry Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. But she did agree that continued prioritized investment in the area is needed.“This is a really important and critical part of our overall research portfolio in addition to providing tools to the rest of USDA, however, I think the numbers are not quite adding up to the total investment and it’s understating our investment,” Bartuska added.Meanwhile, DeLonge is optimistic that the message of sustainable agriculture is resonating with an increasing number of farmers -- all they need is the robust proof that doing so will help their businesses succeed, something that comes from ongoing research support.“I think that farmers are interested in practices that will help them grow food that people will buy and to do so in the best possible way,” DeLonge said.”There are a lot of people out there who are really concerned with the way that they are producing their food and we can only expect them to adopt practices that work with their bottom line and keep their farm going.”Joseph Erbentraut covers promising innovations and challenges in the areas of food and water.

2,POLITICS,How Elizabeth Warren Convinced Obama's Treasury To Aid Fraud Victims,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-treasury_us_5666fc19e4b072e9d1c78c5e,Student debtors might have faced a paperwork nightmare had the Massachusetts lawmaker not stepped in.,2015-12-09,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), left, greets Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 25, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of Americans swindled into taking on federal student loans may have Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to thank for saving them from a tax-driven bureaucratic nightmare.At stake was a potential boondoggle in which student debtors, after being told by the U.S. Department of Education that it would cancel their loans on account of fraud by their former school, would have to separately prove to the Treasury Department that they were, in fact, victims of fraud, and that they shouldn't be taxed on the canceled amount of debt.Warren's role, detailed in documents and described by people close to the process, shines a light on the often murky world of federal tax policy and illustrates how government decisions to aid distressed borrowers can sometimes trigger tax bills that end up hurting the very people policymakers tried to help.The Massachusetts lawmaker's move to help defrauded Americans concerns a Dec. 3 Education Department announcement that it would cancel $27.8 million in federal student loans owed by about 1,300 former students of Corinthian Colleges Inc., a now-defunct chain of for-profit schools.The department said it would cancel the debt after it determined earlier this year that Corinthian's Heald campuses had systematically misled students about their future job prospects by advertising false job placement rates. Federal law gives borrowers the right to contest the legitimacy of their federal student loans if they were defrauded into taking on the debt. More than 3,300 former Heald students told the Education Department under penalty of perjury that they had relied on the school's job rates when they took on federal loans to attend classes.But when those allegedly defrauded borrowers filed their debt cancellation applications with the department, the Obama administration had not yet officially determined whether they'd owe income taxes on the canceled debt.Some consumer advocates were worried. Forgiven debt is generally considered to be taxable income, and while existing rules usually don't require duped households to pay taxes on canceled debt that had been originated on the basis of fraud, there was some concern that former Corinthian students would have to contend with a thicket of procedures to avoid sizable tax bills if the Education Department wiped out their federal student loans.In an Aug. 11 letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Warren and three other lawmakers -- Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) -- urged the Treasury and its tax bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, to publicly declare that defrauded federal student loan borrowers need not worry about the tax implications of their canceled debt.""Borrowers remain in the dark about the tax consequences of the administration's actions,"" the lawmakers said in their letter. According to the lawmakers, Treasury officials had taken the position that they lacked the authority to declare that defrauded borrowers needn't pay income taxes on their canceled debt. Rob Runyan, a Treasury spokesman, declined to comment.The four Democrats then offered a host of reasons detailing why the Treasury should act, pointing to previous IRS rulings, court cases and sections of federal law that all seemed to support their position that cheated borrowers shouldn't have to pay income taxes on canceled debt that they wouldn't have taken on had they not been defrauded.The Obama administration remained silent on the tax issue for the next four months, despite the Democratic lawmakers' insistence that they make their announcement by mid-September.Meanwhile, consumer advocacy groups tried to influence their contacts on Capitol Hill to further drum up support for Corinthian students who had been ripped off.A few months later, on Dec. 3, the IRS and Education Department separately announced that some defrauded Corinthian student borrowers wouldn't have to pay income taxes on their canceled debt. Specifically, 1,312 former Corinthian students whose debts were canceled as a result of fraud wouldn't have to file additional forms with their upcoming tax returns or include any other information as part of an effort to convince the IRS they shouldn't be taxed.""The students whose loans are being forgiven were victims of fraud by Corinthian and failed to receive the education that they were promised and that they deserved,"" Treasury Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin said in a prepared statement. The IRS' announcement, she added, ""provides needed relief to these borrowers and eliminates potential uncertainty regarding any related federal income tax obligation.""Durbin and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said of the Treasury's move that ""anything else would be unfair.""In a sign of Warren's influence on its decision, the Treasury Department also thanked Warren for her efforts.The Treasury's chief congressional liaison, Anne Wall, told Warren in a letter that she had ""helped the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service focus our resources and develop a solution that is equitable and administrable for all of the parties involved.""But other defrauded student borrowers may not get similar treatment.In its announcement, the IRS said its decision was motivated not by fairness but by the burdens that would be placed on swindled borrowers to prove that their student loans were canceled because they were defrauded, and on IRS employees who'd have to rule on their requests.The Treasury and the IRS were concerned that the burdens would be ""excessive in relation to the amount of taxable income that would result."" The IRS limited its decision to defrauded Corinthian students.Other allegedly defrauded student loan borrowers can't rely on the IRS' Corinthian decision, which means that absent further moves by the Obama administration, they'll probably have to convince the IRS that their canceled debt shouldn't be taxed as income.The Obama administration wants Congress to change federal tax law so that other cheated student debtors don't have to worry about potential income tax bills.It may be a while before swindled borrowers even have to deal with it. The Debt Collective -- a group of activists who have helped organize hundreds of allegedly defrauded student debtors to stop making payments on their loans -- accused the Education Department last week of prolonging distress for duped student loan borrowers by ""creating a Rube Goldberg-type contraption to prevent as many people as possible from seeking the relief they deserve.""The Debt Collective claims the Education Department cares more about protecting its reputation after having allowed dodgy schools easy access to federal student aid funds for more than a decade, rather than aiding those schools' former students. The Education Department disagrees."
3,COLLEGE,Gun Advocates Plan Mock Shooting At University Of Texas In Austin,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mock-shooting-ut-austin_us_56688fa7e4b009377b238992,The campus was the site of the first mass shooting on an American college campus.,2015-12-09,"Police bullets kick up dust around the clock on the University of Texas tower, as officers return the fire of Charles Whitman, a sniper who terrorized the University campus with weapons fire for 80 minutes August 1st.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586169481500002300915eec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Gun rights advocates plan to stage a mock shooting on Saturday at the University of Texas at Austin to protest the campus’s gun-free zones. Dozens of demonstrators using cardboard cutouts of firearms and fake blood are expected to pretend to be shooters, victims and armed rescuers. A bullhorn will produce sounds of gunfire, according to the Austin American-Statesman, which first reported on the protest. Two groups staging the event believe that staff and students would be safer from potential attacks like the kind seen in San Bernardino, California, last week if guns were permitted everywhere at the state’s flagship campus. “In the wake of yet another mass shooting one thing is clear, Gun Free Zones are killing us,” said the website of DontComply.com, one of the event organizers. “These target rich environments are letting our children be murdered by evil people.” The other group behind the protest is Come and Take It Texas. Those licensed to carry a handgun may currently carry their concealed weapons in some university areas, like sidewalks and parking lots. A new law taking effect in August expands the area these people will be able to take their concealed weapons to places like dormitories and classrooms.The Austin university was the site of the first mass shooting on an American college campus. Charles Whitman a Marine sniper, killed 16 people in 1966 by opening fire from UT’s iconic tower on passerby. Before Saturday’s fake shooting , armed demonstrators will march through Austin with rifles and pistols. Gun Free UT, a group seeking a campus ban on weapons, did not immediately return requests for comment. Professors, who reportedly make up a considerable amount of the group’s members, have threatened to sue to keep weapons off campus. "

He also blurted, ""Protect the babies!""At the hearing, prosecutors laid out 179 charges -- including numerous charges of first-degree and attempted murder -- related to the shooting, which left three dead and 12 injured. They have not yet announced whether they will pursue the death penalty.Dear said at one point on Wednesday, “You’ll never know the amount of blood I saw in that place,"" CBS Denver reported.He also yelled, ""I will not meet with him again,"" likely in reference to his public defender, Dan King, according to the Denver Post.At another point, as King discussed his client’s mental state with the judge, Dear proclaimed, “I’m competent,” and said he wouldn’t “agree to mental health evaluations” for fear they’d “put me on psychotropic drugs [that would make me] talk like the Batman guy.”Dear appeared to be referring to James Holmes, who was found guilty earlier this year of shooting patrons in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during the premiere of a Batman movie in 2012. Holmes was on various medications throughout the trial after numerous assessments determined he was mentally ill.At the time of his arrest, Dear reportedly told authorities ""no more baby parts,"" fueling speculation that the attack was politically motivated.“We know that words matter. It is time to put an end to the dangerous rhetoric that has permeated our political conversations,"" Vicki Cowart, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said in a statement Wednesday. ""Enough is enough -- this violence, whether inflicted with words or with weapons, cannot become our normal.”"

But Tompkins stood firm against them and the regular attacks from right-wing Chilean politicians, who accused him of seeking to split the country in two in a conspiratorial land grab.Tompkins was much more than just a conservationist. He showcased the importance of land restoration, of rewilding and of building resilient communities.Astrid Vargas, who worked with Tompkins and his Tompkins Conservation foundation, told me in an email Wednesday that Tompkins has “left us an incredible legacy of remarkable restoration works in landscapes, species, agroecology, communities, plus his love and views on beauty, art, climbing, architecture, poetry, zingaro circuses, fencing, airplanes, music, the outdoors, and an endless string of passions.

The founder of the clothing brand North Face, Tompkins, converted into an ecology activist and committed to the vastness of the marshes in the heart of the province of Corrientes, the scene of a ""green war"" with the farmers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5668510c1600002a0094c065.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Doug Tompkins, the business leader-turned-deep ecologist who died Tuesday in a kayaking accident in Chile, was a true American hero.Gritty, uncompromising, passionate and compassionate, he took the hundreds of millions of dollars he made from having co-founded the North Face and Esprit consumer brands and invested them where his heart was -- in conservation.Unlike the majority of rich businessmen, who seek to give something back in the form of cash handouts only after their careers have added to the inequality and environmental destruction in the world, Tompkins devoted more than 25 years of his life to actively investing his money, time and energy into preserving ecosystems and biodiversity, because he realized that all our lives depend on it.In fact Tompkins, who was 72, poured more than $300 million into preserving more land than any other individual in history, purchasing over 2 million acres of wilderness in Argentina and Chile, and then handing much of it back to the governments as national parks.Many others would have given up when faced with death threats from business interests that wanted to log and farm the pristine wilderness he was seeking to protect. But Tompkins stood firm against them and the regular attacks from right-wing Chilean politicians, who accused him of seeking to split the country in two in a conspiratorial land grab.Tompkins was much more than just a conservationist. He showcased the importance of land restoration, of rewilding and of building resilient communities.Astrid Vargas, who worked with Tompkins and his Tompkins Conservation foundation, told me in an email Wednesday that Tompkins has “left us an incredible legacy of remarkable restoration works in landscapes, species, agroecology, communities, plus his love and views on beauty, art, climbing, architecture, poetry, zingaro circuses, fencing, airplanes, music, the outdoors, and an endless string of passions. Always flying above, like a bird over the most amazing landscapes, the landscapes that he so much cherished.”What perhaps made Tompkins stand out was his recognition that finding solutions to the sustainability crisis required a radically different way of seeing the world and a fundamental change in our economic system.He was clear that we need to end our fixation with endless growth on a resource-constrained planet and told me two years ago in an interview I did with him for the Guardian that when the economy contracts “[i]t's like pushing a giant monster underwater that's gasping for air. It goes nuts. Capitalism may have all sorts of things that are good, but ultimately it's bad for everyone.""Tompkins was clear that we need to recognize the inter-dependence of all life, and that humanity could not continue to prosper if it destroyed biodiversity.""If you extinct all the biodiversity and we end up living on a sandheap with a Norwegian rat and some cockroaches, that doesn't have too much logic to it,” he told me. “That would show that our behavior as a civilization today is to the pathological. But, if you make a systemic analysis, that's exactly where we're going.""Tompkins was a strong supporter of the deep ecology movement and helped fund many of the small activist NGOs, arguing that the big environmental groups such as Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) had sold out to corporate interests.He also sought to puncture what he felt was the completely over-optimistic view of those who believe that technology will save civilization from destruction.I remember that when I invited Tompkins to address the senior editors at the Guardian, where I was then working, he held aloft a smartphone and pointed out that while it made everyone's individual life easier, it represented the scaffolding of the techno-industrial complex that is destroying nature and society.In my interview, he also made the same point. ""If you just hold your cell phone for 30 seconds and think backwards through its production you have the entire techno-industrial culture wrapped up there,” he said. “You can't have that device without everything that goes with it. You see mining, transportation, manufacturing, computers, high-speed communications, satellite communications, it's all there, you see and it's that techno-industrial culture that's destroying the world.”Tompkins argued computers and smartphones represent ""deskilling devices; they make us dumber. We're immersed in a system that now requires the use of a cell phone just to get around, just to function and so the logic of that cell phone has been imposed on us.""""The computer is a mechanism for acceleration,"" he added, ""it accelerates economic activity and this is eating up the world. It's eating up resources, it's processing, it's manufacturing, it's distributing, it's consuming. That's what the computer's real work does and it does that 24/7, 365 days a year, non-stop just to satisfy our own narrow needs.""Tompkins felt strongly that humanity is at a crossroads, that civilization either collapses or we transition to a new economic system. He was stark about what would happen if we took the wrong road.""The extinction crisis is the mother of all crises,” he told me. “There will be no society, there will be no economy, there will be no art and culture on a dead planet basically. We've stopped evolution.""Tompkins worked alongside his wife, Kris, the former CEO of the outdoor clothing and equipment company Patagonia.Vargas points out how their love for each other sustained him through all the challenges he faced. Vargas talks of “his ever-present deep love for Kris, his Birdy, the love of his life, as he proudly put it. Every day, when he travelled through Europe without her, he would pick a special picture of the day, redecorated it in a fun way, and would then send it to her as a reminder that she was always on his mind and in his heart.”This morning, when I heard about Tompkins’ death, tears flooded my eyes because I realized that what marked him out was the courage to move away from a charmed life of privilege and money in order to live on the edge so that he could help us all to see beyond the horizon.

8,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Promises Crackdown On Tax-Dodging U.S. Companies,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-inversions_us_56685509e4b0f290e5215f99,Companies are easily able to exploit the U.S. tax system.,2015-12-09,Democratic president candidate Hillary Clinton announced new tax-related proposals at a town hall in Iowa Wednesday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56685c0d1300002a00738eb7.jpeg?ops=crop_0_424_3600_1972%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled a new proposal Wednesday to make it more difficult for multinational corporations to game the U.S. tax system. Democrats have criticized companies for executing what is called an ""inversion,"" in which an American company buys a foreign company and then transfers its main business operations abroad to avoid U.S. taxes, costing taxpayers billions of dollars.""I am passionate about this because the maneuvers that powerful corporations are using to game the system and leave everybody else holding the bag are just offensive to me,"" Clinton said.Last month, Clinton criticized the proposed $160 billion merger of Pfizer and the Dublin-based Allergan, which would allow Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower corporate tax rate. She said the deal, which would be the largest tax inversion ever, was unfair for American taxpayers. Clinton has since said she supports tightening rules for companies wanting to invert by requiring that they be at least 50 percent foreign-owned, going beyond the current 20 percent rule. A company looking to invert by merging with a foreign company would therefore have to merge with one that is the same size or bigger. She's also called for a new “exit tax” on companies entering into these deals.On Wednesday, a Clinton aide told The Huffington Post that she would go further than these suggestions to target what is called ""earnings stripping,"" which often accompanies a corporate inversion. When a U.S. company inverts, it will often load the U.S. subsidiary up with debt that is “owed” to the company's foreign headquarters. The company can then deduct interest payments on the debt from its taxable income, reducing its U.S. tax liability. Clinton said at a town hall in Waterloo, Iowa, that if Congress does not act to end the practice of earnings stripping, the Treasury Department could use its legal authority to crack down on the tax loophole. This action is something the Treasury Department has studied, though it did not announce any new policies to limit earnings stripping when it unveiled modest new measures to limit inversions in late November. (Treasury Secretary Jack Lew did say that the department wanted to take additional actions in coming months, including steps to limit earnings stripping.)The department had solicited public comments on ways to ""make inversions less economically appealing"" in 2014. At the time, Reuters reported that ""Congressional aides and lobbyists said the [Obama] administration was likely uncertain about its legal authority to tackle the practice and did not want to overreach."" Clinton's Wednesday announcement indicates that she doesn't believe there would be a problem with taking executive action to end the practice. Clinton pointed out that American companies like Pfizer have created new drugs with help from federally funded drug research and have counted on the Food and Drug Administration to approve their products.""Fundamentally, this is not only about fairness, this is about patriotism,"" Clinton said. ""If you became successful in America .... you have benefited from American tax dollars and flourished because of all the things that make America great, you should pay what you owe, just like everybody else.""Clinton's campaign said that the closure of the “earnings stripping” loophole would raise approximately $60 billion over 10 years, which could then fund initiatives to boost manufacturing, research and small businesses. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation targeting earnings stripping in 2014.Of course, any attempt to crack down on inversions and earnings stripping would upset Wall Street banks, which have made approximately $1 billion in fees on inversion deals in the past three years. Clinton is neck and neck with Republican presidential candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the race for campaign donations from Wall Street employees and executives. This story has been updated with comments from Clinton.Also on HuffPost:"

Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) has supported lifting the ban since 2014, and has played a key role in ongoing negotiations with Democrats. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It takes a long time to get anything done in Washington. So in January 2014, when the Senate held its first hearing in nearly 25 years on a crude oil export ban put in place during the 1970s, a path toward repeal appeared far out of reach.Since then, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chairwoman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the first senator to wholeheartedly support lifting the ban, has spent her time bringing attention to the issue. A key ally, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), joined Murkowski's push in the summer of 2014, and has worked hard to warm Senate Democrats to the idea.Established in response to the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the ban was aimed at shoring up domestic oil reserves and averting foreign imports. Now, 40 years later, the U.S. has surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world’s largest oil and gas producer, making the embargo more meaningless, lawmakers say.What once seemed impossible is now very real. If lifted, the move would be seen as one of the biggest policy changes for U.S. energy in modern history. It would flood the world market with American oil -- a big win for the industry -- and likely cause the country to lose some ground in its quest to become energy independent. Oil prices are expected to rise, probably along with those fickle gas prices, but the recent squeeze on production felt all the way down to the worker in the oil field would scale back. As it stands, Congress is closing in on a massive year-end deal with the crude oil export ban at its center. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said Wednesday morning there are three packages being discussed now. ""You have omnibus, extenders and this whole question of whether or not you would lift the oil export ban,” he said. Republicans are eager to lift the embargo. In hasty negotiations over a large omnibus spending bill and robust tax extenders package -- meant to permanently renew tax breaks that wed GOP business priorities with Democrats' priorities for working families -- crude oil exports may hitch a ride if Democrats can be convinced.Wyden added that lifting the export ban has been a “big focus” of the ongoing discussions. And as Congress faces limited time, crude exports are playing a much larger role than ever anticipated. “The good news is there is no one saying ‘absolutely no,’ and there is a range of belief systems in terms of what you would need in order to accomplish the lifting of the ban,” Heitkamp said Tuesday. “We believe we’re at a spot where we could actually get a deal.”In exchange for putting a measure to lift the ban on a big end-of-the-year deal, Heitkamp said the tax package will need to be solid, not a small two-year set of extensions, which leadership has said they may fall back on if a bigger deal can’t be agreed upon before the holiday break.“The best thing we can do is provide certainty,” she said. “I don’t think a two-year extender package solves the problem that we have with the inefficiency of the tax structure that we have today with renewables.”Under the bill, production tax credits and investment tax credits for renewable energy like wind and solar would be permanently renewed. And it’s something Democrats won’t concede if Republicans want oil exports. According to one Senate Democratic aide, Republicans “really want” the export ban repealed, and the details over a trade-off between the two parties now rest at the leadership level. “They’ll need to make big environ[ment] concessions to Democrats to make that happen,” the aide said. “It’s all at the leaders’ level at this point, so [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell and [House Speaker Paul] Ryan.”It's becoming more likely that the tax extenders package and the omnibus spending bill will move together on one vehicle, the aide said. It makes sense given how interconnected the two negotiations are at this point. Another ask Democrats have floated is a lengthy renewal of the Land Water Conservation Fund, which Congress let expire in October. While it's normally a noncontroversial issue, Republicans in the Senate and House have battled within their own ranks over it in the past few months, leaving officials at national parks and local recreation areas like baseball parks and playgrounds left wondering when they will get their next check. “They want the sun and the moon,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), when asked about Democrats’ wants. “It’s a negotiation.”Cornyn’s Democratic counterpart, Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), put it differently.“It clearly is an item that Sen. McConnell and Republicans are salivating over,” Durbin said of repealing the crude oil export ban. “It would be a windfall to the industry. We don’t know how much some have estimated -- $20, $30 billion a year in profits if they are allowed to do this.”Durbin also noted the impact lifting the ban would have on refineries, which have benefited from the embargo. In order for a majority of crude, a rudimentary form of oil, to be exported, it currently must go through refineries to be turned into gasoline, diesel and other refined fuels. Refiners like San Antonio-based Valero oppose a repeal, saying it would lead to higher prices at home for consumers. Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) is reportedly crafting a measure that would protect Northeastern refiners from the losses they’d have to swallow if the ban were lifted. On top of renewal of the Land Water Conservation fund, Durbin said he’s “heard a long list of things” Democrats would want in exchange. “There have been suggestions that there are things that the oil industry, if they’re going to make all this money, that they should be willing to help us pay for in this country,” Durbin said, indicating a lift in fossil fuel subsidies could be another idea floating around. Either way, Democrats are also going to want to take GOP-proposed environmental riders going after the administration’s regulations on power plant emissions taken off the table. While the asks may be steep, both sides are playing ball as the clock winds down on the calendar year. Tethering crude oil exports to the tax extenders, the omnibus, or one large vehicle carrying both is likely proponents' best chance of seeing this through. In October, the House passed legislation fully lifting the ban, but in the Senate a similar stand-alone bill would face bigger hurdles.With climate talks going on in Paris, environmentalists are looking to Congress, worried that while the U.S. works to secure its image as an international leader on climate change, lawmakers will undercut it. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, assailed Congress in an op-ed published in The Huffington Post on Wednesday over environmentalists ""suddenly having to divert their energy to deal with a threat from politicians back home.""Green groups contend a repeal of the ban would lead to an increase in production and, subsequently, the release of more greenhouse gas emissions. Lifting the ban, producers argue, could balance out market distortions, create jobs, and spur more U.S. oil production, which has hit somewhat of a glut with falling oil prices. A repeal could also secure higher oil prices for companies -- something they haven’t seen since the summer of 2014 when prices were double what they are now. As for the White House, it is not happy about lawmakers pursuing their own route to lift the ban, arguing that it should be left to the federal departments with jurisdiction. Within the past year, the administration has allowed lifts on certain types of crude oil for several companies, leading many in Congress to think the president might have more of an appetite for repealing the ban outright. In a press conference on Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest reiterated the administration’s position, but wouldn’t threaten a veto of the omnibus or tax extenders package if a provision lifting the decades-old ban on crude oil was tucked inside.Also on HuffPost:"

Arnold said that the Chipotle location in question had been closed since Monday and would likely remain shuttered for another few days as the restaurant tests its employees for the virus.The Boston College norovirus incident is the latest in a string of public health troubles for the Mexican grill-style restaurant chain. Since October, 52 people have fallen ill from E. coli traced to Chipotle locations in nine states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday. Norovirus is responsible for an average of 19 to 21 million cases of gastrointestinal inflammation a year in the United States, according to the CDC. The virus is transmitted either through food, surfaces or people contaminated with the virus.The worst symptoms associated with norovirus, which include acute nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, usually pass within a day or two. There is no vaccine for norovirus and -- because it is a virus -- antibiotics have no effect on it. The CDC recommends that people with norovirus drink a lot of fluids.Dr. Thomas Nary, director of health services at Boston College, sent an e-mail letter on Wednesday to students, faculty, staff and parents with detailed instructions for students affected by norovirus, advising them to stay hydrated and “avoid public spaces.” He said the university would be taking special measures to heighten hygiene standards on campus as well.Dr. Thomas Nary, director of health services at Boston College, emailed students, faculty, staff and parents Wednesday with detailed instructions advising students affected by norovirus to stay hydrated and “avoid public spaces.” He said the university had ""redoubled"" cleaning efforts in common areas as well.Final exams will continue as planned from Dec. 12 to 19, but students should ask their professors if they need “accommodation” due to the illness, Nary wrote.This article has been updated to reflect the number of students ill as of Thursday.Also on HuffPost:"

But the extent of the epidemic -- how it has overwhelmed the state's cities, hospitals and fire departments -- is still hard to fathom. Consider this: By the end of November, the Manchester Fire Department had responded to 683 suspected overdose calls during the year, or more than two a day. According to fire department data, the city had also witnessed 81 overdose-related deaths, the youngest being 18 years old, and the oldest being 68. (Manchester has a population of about 110,000.)The latest example of the epidemic's severity came in a town hall Hillary Clinton held Tuesday in Salem, New Hampshire, where the Democratic front-runner was asked about the role the government should play in helping the afflicted.""I’ve had two town halls right here in New Hampshire ... where the only subject was substance abuse,"" she said. ""And I have had some of the most emotional discussions with family members, with recovering addicts, with people who finally got the help they needed.”And then, Clinton asked for a show of hands from those who have witnessed or been affected by a mental health problem or substance abuse. That prompted this:In May, when Clinton first began touring New Hampshire and Iowa, she was stunned at the volume and intensity of questions about the opiate crisis, so she asked her staff to begin drafting policy solutions.

The children are sending holiday wishes to other children: those in immigrant detention facilities with their families.The group wants to end the practice of detaining mothers and children, and attended a press conference on Wednesday with House Democratic members calling for the same. But this year's letters aren't solely activism -- they'll also be delivered next week to the families in the three operating family immigrant detention centers, two in Texas and one in Pennsylvania.Fiorella Zuniga, a 9-year-old who penned one of the letters, began to cry during the press conference while talking about her fear of her mother being deported. She told HuffPost later that she had also started to cry when she heard from her mother that other children were being detained. ""I imagined if that was me and my family I would be really, really crying,"" she said. Women and children are spending less time in immigrant detention centers than they used to, thanks to a court ruling and pressure from advocacy groups and members of Congress. The average time they're held now is about 28 days, according to Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.). She told The Huffington Post she would like to see that timeline cut down to the minimum needed to screen the families and then release those who are deemed eligible for asylum or other relief while they await a final ruling. Roybal-Allard and other members of the Congressional Women's Working Group on Immigration Reform -- plus immigration reform champion Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) -- called for an immediate closure of family detention facilities. ""We want children to be in places where Santa can find them,"" Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.) said at the press conference. The children who wrote letters want that, too. Noe Gutierrez, 11, wrote that he wants to put all of the other kids ""in freedom from the detention centers plus your parents."" ""It makes me sad so we will try our best to get you free,"" he wrote. ""I wish to have you here playing with other kids.""""Feliz Navidad,"" he signed off. Here are some of their letters: "

Brokers would no longer be allowed to push their clients into high-fee funds just because the fund paid them.The Obama administration thinks that Americans could save more for retirement if their brokers weren't allowed to rip them off. The Financial Services Roundtable, a lobbying organization representing banks that oppose the rule, disagrees. It argues that we can fix the problem of Americans not saving enough money if Americans start saving more money -- 10 percent of their income, to be specific.That's an objective, not a policy. But never fear, the FSR has a plan to promote savings: Giving away free pizza to 100 people in Washington, D.C. The group handed out the free pies at an event last week promoting an initiative called ""save-a-slice."" You're supposed to ""save a slice"" of your income for retirement. Get it?Or maybe you'd like enter a contest and win $10,000 from the FSR by submitting a video explaining how you plan to save 10 percent of your income. ""Don't want to spend your retirement eating cat food on toast, win $10,000,"" for creating a video about it, a promo for the contest intones.FSR does have some good ideas -- making retirement plans at companies that offer them automatically enroll employees, for example -- but its big idea is unrealistic. Middle-class incomes have fallen over the last 15 years, so it's unlikely that regular people have more money to save. The American savings rate, currently just above 5 percent, hasn’t been at or above 10 percent for any sustained period in the last 35 years.And telling Americans to save more for retirement while trying to stop a rule that would keep Americans saving for retirement from getting swindled by high-fee funds they don’t need is exactly the sort of conflicted advice that costs investors billions.

20,POLITICS,Greenpeace Says Fossil Fuel Industry Misleads On Climate Science,Lynne Peeples,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/undercover-greenpeace-investigation-climate-change_us_5667464ee4b080eddf55ece1,The group went undercover to show that prominent academics were willing to take money from corporations for their research.,2015-12-09,"While accepting money from the fossil fuel industry to do research is not itself a breach of ethics, taking money from any source without transparency is ""totally unacceptable,"" said Peter Frumhoff of the Union of Concerned Scientists.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56676f841600002800e5562d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An undercover Greenpeace investigation released on Tuesday suggests that fossil fuel companies secretly funnel money into prominent scientists' pockets to manufacture doubt about mainstream climate change science.Greenpeace UK took an unconventional approach to the research: Members of the environmentalist group posed as representatives of fake oil and coal companies and asked two climate change skeptics to write papers promoting the benefits of carbon dioxide and coal in developing countries. The two academics the group approached -- Frank Clemente of Pennsylvania State University and William Happer of Princeton University -- reportedly agreed to pen the reports and not to reveal their funding source.The group's expose follows revelations from The New York Times earlier this year that Willie Soon, a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, accepted donations from fossil fuel companies and anonymous donors to write papers that challenged the consensus on climate science -- without saying where his funding came from. This academics-for-hire tactic has ""materially changed the debate about climate change,""said Jesse Coleman, a Greenpeace activist who participated in the probe. ""You could say that one of the reasons we're facing such dire climate change risks is because these fossil fuel companies are funding climate change denial."" ""It's the exact same playbook"" tobacco companies once used to ""convince people of something that is just not true,"" Coleman added.For decades, tobacco corporations deceived consumers about the dangers of smoking by covertly funding contrarian research. Manufactured data, concealed conflicts of interest and misleading conclusions, as The Huffington Post has previously reported, are also evident in influential research on vaccination, organic food, secondhand smoke, lead paint and chemical flame retardants. But perhaps no environmental or public health issue is as high-stake as global warming.Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that if the Greenpeace findings were true, they were ""deeply, deeply disconcerting."" He emphasized that while accepting money from industry to do research is not itself a breach of ethics, taking money from any source without transparency is ""totally unacceptable.""(Story continues below video.)The Greenpeace release comes during the final week of the COP21 climate talks in Paris, published just hours before Happer appeared at a congressional subcommittee hearing on climate change chaired by Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). In Happer's submitted testimony for the hearing, which leaned heavily on the contrarian side, he stated that ""climate science is far from 'settled.'"" As of Tuesday afternoon, he had not responded to HuffPost's request for comment.Clemente told HuffPost in an email that he stands behind the statements he made in the emails he exchanged with the undercover Greenpeace researchers. ""I am very proud of my research and believe that clean coal technologies are the pathway to reliable and affordable electricity, reduction of global energy poverty and a cleaner environment,"" he said. He also referred to his communications with Greenpeace activists as ""pirated"" emails.In the emails, both Happer and Clemente discussed ways to hide the source of funding for their reports, including the use of a secretive channel called Donors Trust, a foundation that encourages anonymous donations to support limited government. Happer also offered a route to get the paper through an informal review process by a major climate change-denying think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation. He suggested to the undercover researchers that it would be ""fine to call it a peer review,"" despite acknowledging that the paper would struggle in peer review at other journals. Coleman defended Greenpeace's decision not to disclose the true identities of its undercover researchers to Clemente and Happer. “Unfortunately, there just aren’t the disclosure measures necessary for us to find out by different means which corporations are funding this climate denial work,"" he said.Teasing out the truth isn't easy for policymakers or the public, thanks in part to industry tactics, according to two studies published in late November that chart the climate change counter-movement. The research found that corporate funding, including money from ExxonMobil, materially changed the public and political conversations about climate change. (ExxonMobil, along with Peabody Energy, are also under investigation in the state of New York over claims of misleading the public and investors about climate change.)Justin Farrell, a researcher at Yale University who authored the papers, suggested in an email to HuffPost that ""much more analysis will no doubt continue to shed light on the important implications of dark money, and the role of financing in what are ostensibly 'scientific' issues."" ""The social and political landscape of our country has changed in ways that have made it easier for money to influence science and politics,"" Farrell said. ""We need to pull back the curtain and let academics and other researchers in on the flows of financial and political influence that are important for identifying the influential actors in a given issue. Without the ability to do that, the American public is often left in the dark, and has a difficult time knowing who to trust.""Frumhoff agreed. ""We all need to be highly watchful and make sure that when someone speaks before Congress, or produces a statement of fact from a purported expert perspective, that we ask to know what their funding sources were,"" he said from Paris, where he is currently attending the climate conference. There, more than 190 nations are currently deliberating on how to address climate change and not, said Frumhoff, ""whether the basic facts are real.""Also on HuffPost:"
21,POLITICS,Another GOP Governor Calls For Obamacare Medicaid Expansion,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/another-gop-governor-calls-for-obamacare-medicaid-expansion_us_56686ab5e4b080eddf567dda,The wall of Republican opposition to helping poor people get health care keeps cracking.,2015-12-09,South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard speaks during his budget address at the state Capitol Tuesday. Daugaard proposed broadening eligibility for South Dakota's Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Add South Dakota's Dennis Daugaard to the list of Republican governors who have changed their minds about Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.The second-term governor pitched a plan to expand the joint federal-state health insurance program to as many as 55,000 low-income South Dakotans without using state money during a speech to the overwhelmingly Republican legislature Tuesday. Daugaard rejected the expansion three years ago, objecting to allowing ""able-bodied"" people to get covered.Since the Supreme Court ruled that states could choose whether to participate in the Medicaid expansion authorized by the Affordable Care Act in 2012, 30 states and the District of Columbia have opened the program to more poor residents, contributing to a significant decline in the uninsured rates in those locations. Although many Republican governors in the remaining states are still against it, several -- including presidential candidates John Kasich of Ohio and Chris Christie of New Jersey, and conservatives like Indiana's Mike Pence -- have deviated from the party line. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) came out in favor of the expansion in 2012.""I know some of you are not excited about expanding Medicaid, and I still share some of your thoughts. It bothers me that some people who can work will become more dependent on government. I hate that,"" Daugaard said to lawmakers in the state Capitol. ""But we have to remember the single parent with three children. Between work and child care, a parent in that situation sometimes can't work enough hours to get insurance.""Congress didn't intend for the Medicaid expansion to be optional, and federal tax credits to reduce the cost of private health insurance sold on the exchange marketplaces are only available to people who earn at least poverty wages, which are about $12,000 a year for a single person. In states that didn't expand Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of poverty, that created a coverage gap in which poor people have access to no health coverage options. The Affordable Care Act provides full federal funding for the Medicaid expansion until through next year, after which states will have to pick up an increasing share of the tab until it reaches 10 percent in 2021 and future years. Although Daugaard highlighted the plight of those low-income South Dakotans who would benefit from Medicaid expansion, his plea to lawmakers focused more on the budgetary benefits of his proposal, in particular its potential to reduce state spending on health care for Native Americans. Daugaard has been negotiating with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Indian Health Service to persuade federal officials to direct Medicaid dollars to pay for health care services Native Americans receive outside IHS facilities if they qualify for expanded Medicaid. Currently, the state shoulders part of that expense. The proposal included in Daugaard's budget request to the legislature and under consideration by federal authorities would result in greater savings on care for Native Americans than the cost to South Dakota for expanding Medicaid, he said.""Without a plan to cover these state general fund expenses, I have opposed expansion. I haven't said 'never.' I've always said 'not now,'"" Daugaard said. The shift in who pays for Native American's medical expenses must be approved by the federal government, with the input of South Dakota officials and tribal leaders, and approved by the legislature, Daugaard said. And the federal government will not OK the new funding system for Native American health care unless the state expands Medicaid at the same time, he said. ""I cannot tell you today that everything will come together, but if it does, we should seize that opportunity,"" he said.""While this is a complicated decision and we're going to have to weigh all the positives and negatives, in my mind, the opportunity to end this longstanding IHS reimbursement issue, to gain coverage for more South Dakotans, to improve the health care for Native Americans, to save money for counties and Medicaid providers, and potentially save millions in state dollars -- I believe those things outweigh the negatives,"" Daugaard said.Medicaid expansion remains a topic of debate in several states where Republican governors have struggled to convince GOP-led legislatures to go along, including Utah and Wyoming. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) also is considering changing his position and supporting the policy. In Louisiana, the election last month of Democrat John Bel Edwards to succeed Republican Bobby Jindal has reignited interest in participating in the expansion. By contrast, newly minted Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R) has called for scaling back the state's Medicaid expansion.See slides from South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard's presentation to state legislators below:Also on HuffPost:"

Griffin stressed the importance of the Times in the company’s portfolio, in response to a question.“If you cleaved off California from Tribune publishing, you would essentially have the Chicago Tribune and a bunch of medium-sized East Coast newspapers,” Griffin said. “That is a very different proposition. On a standalone basis, that would be much harder to do. The Los Angeles Times on its own is a tough platform.”When Murdoch first made his remarks on Nov. 27, Tribune denied that the company was being sold but did not at the time address the speculation about the fate of the Times.“As our Board of Directors noted earlier this fall and as we articulated in our November earnings call, Tribune Publishing remains committed to its strategy and transformation plan and is not engaged in discussions or a process to sell the Company,” Tribune said in a note to employees.The LA Times is currently undergoing yet another wave of buyouts, which have claimed more than 80 of its reporters and editors, according to CNN’s Dylan Byers.Watch Broad's full interview with PBS:"
23,POLITICS,Politics Are Dominating The Supreme Court This Week. That's Not Good.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-evenwel_us_566728aee4b079b2819055a3,"If a majority of the justices get their way, the rules of the democratic process could get tougher than ever before.",2015-12-09,"Voting rights activists demonstrated outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, as the justices considered arguments in two redistricting cases.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56677021160000290094bff4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court did three things on Tuesday, and all three had to do with politics.More precisely, they all had to do with the politicization of the rules of voting, redistricting and representation -- and how state and national laws, and the U.S. Constitution, keep it all in check. Or don't.The main event was Evenwel v. Abbott, a high-profile case that threatens to change the rules for who gets to put people in power at the state level -- much to the likely detriment of Latinos, immigrants, families with children and even prisoners.But before that, a unanimous court decided Shapiro v. McManus, an under-the-radar case dealing precisely with the role of federal courts in deciding these kinds of disputes. In a brief, eight-page ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia and his colleagues essentially made it easier for courts to entertain these cases.Then came the hearing in Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, the second order of the day on Tuesday. This case hasn't received nearly as much media attention as Evenwel, but it is just as politically charged.Like Evenwel, the Arizona case touches on the Constitution's ""one person, one vote"" principle -- largely uncontroversial for almost 50 years, but suddenly a source of contention for politicians on both sides of the aisle.Neither case is a walk in the park for the justices. The Arizona case, in particular, is all about whether the concept of ""one person, one vote"" allows partisan politics to play some role in the process of legislative redistricting -- that is, drawing and redrawing the state map for representational purposes.The words ""played a role"" figured prominently at the hearing. And for an hour, the justices pressed the four lawyers who argued the case for guidance on whether redistricting commissions -- like the one in Arizona -- can ever play a little politics in the process.""If you're going to say that no members of a redistricting commission can ever have partisan views, I don't know where you're going to get your membership from,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said at one point.

24,POLITICS,Politics Are Dominating The Supreme Court This Week. That's Not Good.,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-evenwel_us_566728aee4b079b2819055a3,"If a majority of the justices get their way, the rules of the democratic process could get tougher than ever before.",2015-12-09,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard two politically charged cases seeking to elucidate the Constitution's ""one person, one vote"" principle.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566770931300002900738e0c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court did three things on Tuesday, and all three had to do with politics.More precisely, they all had to do with the politicization of the rules of voting, redistricting and representation -- and how state and national laws, and the U.S. Constitution, keep it all in check. Or don't.The main event was Evenwel v. Abbott, a high-profile case that threatens to change the rules for who gets to put people in power at the state level -- much to the likely detriment of Latinos, immigrants, families with children and even prisoners.But before that, a unanimous court decided Shapiro v. McManus, an under-the-radar case dealing precisely with the role of federal courts in deciding these kinds of disputes. In a brief, eight-page ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia and his colleagues essentially made it easier for courts to entertain these cases.Then came the hearing in Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, the second order of the day on Tuesday. This case hasn't received nearly as much media attention as Evenwel, but it is just as politically charged.Like Evenwel, the Arizona case touches on the Constitution's ""one person, one vote"" principle -- largely uncontroversial for almost 50 years, but suddenly a source of contention for politicians on both sides of the aisle.Neither case is a walk in the park for the justices. The Arizona case, in particular, is all about whether the concept of ""one person, one vote"" allows partisan politics to play some role in the process of legislative redistricting -- that is, drawing and redrawing the state map for representational purposes.The words ""played a role"" figured prominently at the hearing. And for an hour, the justices pressed the four lawyers who argued the case for guidance on whether redistricting commissions -- like the one in Arizona -- can ever play a little politics in the process.""If you're going to say that no members of a redistricting commission can ever have partisan views, I don't know where you're going to get your membership from,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said at one point. The courtroom erupted in laughter.""There's a difference between saying something's a necessary evil and something's evil,"" Chief Justice John Roberts added, seeming to concede that partisanship is inevitable in redistricting decisions.Perhaps as a result of all the politics, something curious happened by the time the justices got to Evenwel: They all seem to split neatly along party lines.Because for nearly 25 minutes during Evenwel, not a single conservative justice posed a question to the conservative side.
