Modern-day Dale Carnegie",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cute-animals-productivity_us_5b9cdb8ae4b03a1dcc82780e,"Could I convince my husband that watching Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl is essential for my workday? Or that my impulsive visits to LOLCats are actually productive, not a complete utter waste of life and brain power like I had once thought?",2013-02-27,"In this Feb. 1, 2013 photo, an English golden retriever puppy sits with her litter in Fond du Lac, Wis. She will be trained to become a therapy dog for a teenager who was severely injured in a fall from a Wisconsin amusement park ride in 2010. Actor Charlie Sheen says he's donating $10,000 for the dog's training and other expenses.

When 2 p.m. rolls around I either need a truckload of coffee, which will inevitably give me a headache, a five-hour energy drink that will eventually give me the shakes, or a nap, which will most definitely leave me groggier than when I started.So, when I read that researchers in Japan may have found a safer answer to productivity, I jumped on it.Ready, set, puppy!I'm going to use puppies to learn. Yes, you read that right. Japanese researchers found that images of kittens and puppies make people more productive. Claim: Pictures of cute things improve participant's attention and productivity Could I convince my husband that watching Animal Planet's Puppy Bowl is essential for my workday? Or that my impulsive visits to LOLCats are actually productive, not a complete utter waste of life and brain power like I had once thought?Just imagine the profound changes for college students everywhere; No more stolen ADD pills, no more topless tutoring and no more reading Cliffsnotes in lieu of reading a real book. Puppies could save learning!Really, the puppy possibilities are endless. I needed to dig a little deeper.I decided to start Operation Puppy as the latest installment of Human Test Tube, a column in which I take scientific research and see if it actually works in the real world. While the results are only occasionally successful, they are always hilarious.So, could puppies really motivate in the real world? Operation Puppy involved recreating the lab experiment in a real life context. Researchers asked participants to perform a task, then showed them pictures from the following groups: 1. Pleasant Foods  2. Neutral Objects  3. Adult Dogs and Cats  4. Kittens and Puppies Researchers then had them perform the task again and found that the puppy pictures made people the most productive.I was skeptical. I enjoy pictures of puppies as much as the next red-blooded female, but to help with my to-do list? That seems like a stretch. I wondered if this experiment would work in real life. If I look at pictures of puppies, will I be more productive?Given all of the time I spend on Twitter, Reddit and Facebook, looking at cute pictures before performing a work task is not all that out of the ordinary. Perhaps, if I limited my cute picture browsing to something that could actually make me more productive, it wouldn't count as procrastinating!I replicated the experiment in an every day context by looking at Pinterest boards of the categories the experimenters used and then timed myself on work tasks.Pleasant Foods Neutral Objects Adult Dogs and Cats Kittens and PuppiesI should note that making these boards was not as easy as it sounds. The ""neutral object' board was the most challenging. First, you can't just search for neutral objects on Pinterest. I ended up searching for ""boring"" and found a board full of binder clips (someone must have severe OCD to be organizing all of the office supplies on Pinterest into boards). I repined all of them. I'm sure my followers were wondering why I was pinning erasers, ugly lamps and post-its. I'm probably losing followers as I write this. Second, it was very difficult to judge which objects were neutral enough. Whale pillow? Too exciting. Peppermint bubblegum? Thrilling to my taste buds. I figured if it caught my attention in any way it was not neutral enough -- which is totally the opposite of what I normally do on Pinterest. I did three trials for each category and took the average, as well as three trials for ""none"" which were the trials where I did not look at any pictures beforehand.Here are my results:  (The vertical axis shows the minutes it took me to perform the task.)Results:I had almost the exact opposite results as the in-lab experiment. The trials where I did no picture gazing beforehand were the slowest. Looking at puppies was the next slowest, followed by neutral objects and adult animals.Looking at pleasant foods made me the most productive, probably because I wanted to get through my work task as fast as possible so I could get a snack.(Thank goodness the neutral object trial did not make me more productive. Nothing is worth examining rusted safety pins for 60 seconds.) Conclusion of Operation Puppy:Although Operation Puppy failed to make me more productive, the experiment was not unsuccessful. Here is what I learned and you can use too:Brain Warm-Ups WorkThe trials I did with no preparation were by far the slowest. This means that warm-ups aren't just for 5th graders in PE. No matter what you look at, getting your brain ready for a difficult task will make you more productive.A Placebo Might Be Just As GoodEven though I was not more productive during the puppy and kitten trials, oddly, I felt more productive. I also enjoyed my tasks more. Looking at those cute and cuddly creatures might be worth it just for the warm and fuzzy good feelings. In conclusion, looking at pictures of puppies before work or during your lunch break will put you in a better mood, and is better than no pleasant picture gazing at all. Unsurprisingly, puppies make you happier even if you aren't faster. And really, isn't that a lesson for life? I'll take puppies over productivity any day.Citations:Nittono H., Fukushima M., Yano A., Moriya H.

She set out to begin a successful consulting,2013-02-27,"Heading the charge at a ""Shopping Spree For Free"" at The Lower East Side Girls Club",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdc0b2000003100fdbe4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Mary Alice Stephenson makes a splash wherever she goes. At 6' tall, the statuesque beauty stands out. Add to that her big smile and cheerful greeting to everyone and anyone, and it's just about impossible to miss her. Stephenson, a style and beauty expert, is a very unique denizen in the world of fashion. Originally from Birmingham, Michigan, the former Harper's Bazaar fashion director is using style and beauty to turn her passion into compassion for people in need. After years working as an editor and fashion director and styling covers for magazines like Marie Claire, Harper's Bazaar, Esquire, Allure and more, Stephenson had a moment of clarity in the most unlikely of places: an Albuquerque airport. ""I watched as the small airport filled up with cheerleaders,"" she said. ""These kids and teenagers formed a tunnel of pom-poms from the entryway to the gate where a six-year-old girl fighting cancer was coming down the tunnel. Make-A-Wish was granting her wish to go to cheerleading camp. It was the ultimate 'a-ha moment.' I knew then that I could create big, beautiful experiences like that for people in need."" Soon after, Stephenson returned home from a work trip, and happened to switch on the TV to catch ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" She felt like Oprah was speaking directly to her when she said, ""How are you going to use your life to make a difference in this world?"" Stephenson handed in her resignation to Harper's Bazaar the very next day. Merging her fashion career with philanthropy wasn't as dramatic as one might think. She set out to begin a successful consulting, styling and spokesperson career while carving out room for her philanthropic endeavors. Stephenson melded the two worlds with her role as the national fashion ambassador for The Make-A-Wish foundation, as well as creating fashion initiatives for Free Arts NYC, The Bob Woodruff Foundation, Grace Centers of Hope, Love Heals, The Lower East Side Girls Club and Get Reel With Your Dreams. The more she gave back, the more she realized that doing good was energizing and fueling her to do more. Gradually, the line between fashion and philanthropy disappeared. ""Everything I do in the fashion and beauty business -- whether it's for a magazine or a celebrity or a brand-- these are all relationships that I end up utilizing in philanthropy,"" she said. ""The industry has stood by me for 20 years. Brands like L’Oréal, Estée Lauder, Dior and CoverGirl; magazines like Us Weekly, Seventeen, Details; along with designers like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and more have all donated products and supported the fashion and beauty initiatives I do with many causes. I'm so grateful for their generosity.""Stephenson often joked that these photo shoots and projects were ""glamming for good."" People started tweeting and hashtagging it, and the Glam4Good movement was born.These days, Stephenson still consults for designers, styles covers for Seventeen magazine and dispenses fashion and beauty advice on TV shows, but turning the Glam4Good movement into a non-profit foundation and a brand is her biggest passion. And it ain't lip service either. Stephenson laughed as she coined herself ""A Budget Philanthropist."" She said, ""I can't write a big check. But I can give my time, my energy and my resources.""Inspired by Mary Alice's story? So were we. She shared some tips on how you can glam for good in your daily life. 1. Go public with your philanthropy. ""We live in a show-it-off culture today. Kids show off what they are wearing, their manicures and their bodies,"" Stephenson said. ""They need to show off how they help the world they live in, how they serve their communities and friends. Don't be shy about showing off compassion and doing good in the world.""2. Connect with others to do good. ""Facebook has been a game changer for me (Stephenson has over 230K followers on Facebook). It allows me to connect with the world and it gives people direct access to me so they can communicate to me what they need, and vice versa."" During Hurricane Sandy, Stephenson put out a simple ask on Facebook for supplies for the devastated Far Rockaway neighborhood and soon thereafter was deluged with donated supplies. 3. Tap into people's natural instincts to want to help. Stephenson acts as a conduit between charities and causes and the fashion industry. All it takes is sending out a message of what you need and when you need it. ""People are quicker to cooperate than compete. I find that kids, people and brands bend over backwards to help and love to post and Tweet about how they helped me to help others.""4. Take care of yourself. So often, Mary Alice sees women whose priorities are everyone else. ""When you look your best you feel like you can handle more,"" she said. ""I know the healing power of a sequin. Fashion does make a difference in people's lives, it creates joy.""5. Let your kids share in your big give. ""I had my son decide what to give from his toys to give to the kids that lost theirs because of Hurricane Sandy. It was the bag of Hot Wheels that he gave to the kids brought the most smiles! When I showed him pictures of the kids with his cars he suggested that we do it again ... and soon!""Watch Mary Alice as she Glams4Good in the video below:See Mary Alice and some of her initiatives, as well as more fashionable do-gooders:Want more Mary Alice?

2,WELLNESS,Working From Home: 9 Results Of Telecommuting,Katy Hall,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/working-from-home_us_5b9cdd71e4b03a1dcc828a46,When Best Buy implemented a “Results-Only Work Environment” for some of its employees — allowing them flexibility in work,2013-02-27,"Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo!, attends a session of the World Economic Forum 2013 Annual Meeting on January 25, 2013 at the Swiss resort of Davos. The World Economic Forum (WEF) is taking place from January 23 to 27. AFP PHOTO / JOHANNES EISELE (Photo credit should read JOHANNES EISELE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdd713c0000660009ee18.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Are speed and quality really sacrificed when people work from home, as Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer said to explain her new ban on telecommuting? It depends on the employee, the company and the job, so pointing to any one study to argue either way is not very useful. Intangibles such as Mayer's need to create a culture of innovation are also hard to predict or measure. None of the studies described below can be applied to the whole American workforce, but when looked at together they tend to show that flexible working arrangements give workers higher job satisfaction and a better sense of work-life balance — and sometimes even increase productivity. Most workers in these studies telecommuted only part of the time and had some choice in how they balanced office face time with getting things done at home. Here are nine results of flexible work policies: Reduced turnoverWhen Best Buy implemented a “Results-Only Work Environment” for some of its employees — allowing them flexibility in work hours and location — attrition was 45 percent lower in that group than in the control group of office workers, according to a University of Minnesota study. Workers in the ROWE group also reported reduced work-family conflict and better work-life balance. “By showing that a policy initiative like ROWE can reduce turnover, this research moves the ‘opting out’ argument—whether one chooses family over work—from a private issue to an issue of how employers can change the workplace to better meet the needs of employees,” said one of the researchers. Longer hoursPeople who have the option to work from home can work longer hours before experiencing work-family conflict, according to a Brigham Young University study. The researchers analyzed data from IBM employees in 75 countries and found that office workers hit a breaking point at 38 hours per week while workers given the option to telecommute could work 57 hours (two extra days!) before work interfered with family life. Eighty percent of IBM managers agreed that flexible schedules increase productivity.Distractions at homeEven if telecommuters are clocking more hours, they may not be spending all that time on work. Just as there are distractions at the office — useless meetings, chatty coworkers, office politics and gossip — there are plenty of things at home that are more fun than working. A study conducted by Wakefield Research reported that 43 percent of telecommuters have watched TV, 35 percent have done household chores and 28 percent have cooked dinner while on the job. If you can get your work done effectively and use downtime to do things you actually want or need to do, that might be the point. Healthier workersFlexible work schedules have positive effects on physical and mental health, according to a Cochrane research review. Employees who had more control over their schedules scored higher on blood pressure, sleep quality and duration and sense of well-being. Better connectivitySome telecommuters actually feel more connected to their jobs despite the lack of regular office time. A University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee study found that workplace interactions and interruptions cause stress, and constant contact with colleagues doesn't help workers feel more connected to an organization. The telecommuters in the study worked from home at least three days a week. “Teleworkers should strategically manage their connectivity in order to balance the benefits and drawbacks of communicating with others while organizations should focus on streamlining communication,"" said one of the researchers. ""This may include limiting mass emails, diminishing the number of weekly meetings, creating information stores and fostering an environment where employees can schedule uninterrupted time to work.”Higher productivityThis measure was self-reported, but most Cisco workers say they are more productive when they are not in the office. Employees also reported that telecommuting results in improved work quality, better quality of life and higher job satisfaction. Interestingly, out of the time saved from telecommuting, employees spent 60 percent of the extra hours on work and took only 40 percent for personal use. Saved moneyIf a company allows 100 workers to work from home half the time, it can save $1.1 million a year, according to the Telework Research Network. Telecommuting cuts down on costs for real estate, building maintenance, security, furniture and other office expenses. Cleaner airThe 5.2 million workers who telecommute only twice a month at a minimum save 10 million barrels of oil per year, according to a study by the Mobility Choice coalition. Telecommuters also save about $7 each day in transportation costs and avoid the time and headache of an oppressive daily commute. More trust and loyaltyEmployees who are allowed to work from home are more likely to be proud of their company and trust that managers were being open and honest with them, according to a survey by the Kenexa Research Institute. Scott Berry, a senior mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar Inc., told the Wall Street Journal that telecommuting has given him flexibility for family time — and deepened his loyalty to his company. ""I always had a good perception of the firm, but obviously it enhances my perception in that they're willing to trust their employees to get their job done without any direct supervision, that they're willing to allow somebody like me to move for family reasons and not business reasons,"" he said.
