During the show's 40th anniversary special earlier this year, Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg paid tribute to the best ""SNL"" breaks in history with the digital short ""That's When You Break.""

3,TASTE,9 Delicious Recipes For Hanukkah (Or Any Day Of The Week),"Jennifer Segal, ContributorChef, Recipe Developer and Busy Mom",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/9-delicious-recipes-for-h_b_8692146.html,"Whether or not you celebrate Hanukkah, you can still enjoy the delicious food that comes with it -- like crispy potato latkes, homemade applesauce and challah french toast.",2015-12-06,2015-12-05-1449318441-2317678-homemadeapplesauce.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-05-1449318441-2317678-homemadeapplesauce-thumb.jpg,"Whether or not you celebrate Hanukkah, you can still enjoy the delicious food that comes with it -- like crispy potato latkes, homemade applesauce and challah french toast. 1. Curried Sweet Potato PancakesThese sweet potato pancakes are spiced with curry, cumin, ginger and cayenne pepper. Obviously, they're perfect for Hanukkah but don't think of them just for that; they make a fabulous all-around winter side dish. GET THE RECIPE2. Chunky Homemade ApplesauceHomemade applesauce is richly flavored, tart and sweet -- almost like apple pie filling. Serve it with latkes or for dessert. GET THE RECIPE3. Oven-Fried Potato LatkesLatkes, or crisp onion-scented potato pancakes, are traditionally made on the stovetop but I prefer to fry them in the oven. They're no healthier, mind you, but just as good, half the mess and so much easier. GET THE RECIPE4. Chicken Matzo Ball SoupMatzo ball soup is traditional for Passover, but I make it on Hanukkah too. It's a bit of a ""potschke,"" as my mother would say, but it's not hard -- you pretty much throw everything into a pot and forget it. And the secret to light and fluffy matzo balls? Use a mix! GET THE RECIPE5. Onion Braised Beef Brisket This is my favorite brisket recipe, and it's surprisingly simple to make. There's no wine, stock or bottled sauces added; instead, the brisket is cooked on top of a massive heap of onions, which slowly caramelize and release their juices, making a flavorful braising liquid all their own. It's great for entertaining because it feeds a crowd and can be made ahead. GET THE RECIPE6. Roast Chicken with Herb ButterThis easy roast chicken with herb butter is the perfect cozy dish for the holidays. I like to serve it with latkes, roasted carrots and applesauce. GET THE RECIPE7. RugelachDelicious to eat and fun to make, rugelach are miniature crescent-rolled pastries posing as cookies. They're made by rolling a triangle of dough around a sweet filling of fruit, nuts, chocolate or pretty much anything your heart desires. Roll up your sleeves and give this classic walnut-raisin version a try. GET THE RECIPE 8. Grandma Annie's Chocolate Chip Mandel BreadMy Grandma Annie made the world's best mandel bread, and she didn't travel anywhere without it. It's a traditional Jewish cookie similar to biscotti, only richer and softer. You don't need to dip it in coffee to enjoy it -- it's delicious all on its own. GET THE RECIPE9. Drunken Caramel Challah French ToastPart booze, part french toast, part bread pudding -- how can you go wrong? Plus, it's the ideal company-for-brunch dish because you assemble it the night before, let it sit in the fridge overnight, then just pop it in the oven when you're ready to eat. GET THE RECIPE"
4,SPORTS,Bennie and the Giants vs. the Mooch and the Jets,"Rob Taub, ContributorWriter, Humorist & Television Commentator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bennie--the-giants-vs-the_b_8728334.html,"My father was a wildly enthusiastic football fan, and during the season, Sunday afternoons in our house revolved around the NY Giants.  My dad had great disdain for the people who lived across the street because they liked that ""new"" team -- the Jets.",2015-12-06,2015-12-05-1449338824-6893430-jetsgiants081208_560.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-05-1449338824-6893430-jetsgiants081208_560-thumb.jpg,"My father was a wildly enthusiastic football fan, and during the season, Sunday afternoons in our house revolved around the NY Giants. My dad had great disdain for the people who lived across the street because they liked that ""new"" team -- the Jets. Like any kid growing up in the tri-state area, I was enamored with Joe Namath, and back then the Giants never won anyway, so I eventually became a fan of both teams, but other than the 1969 Jets Super Bowl victory, I don't ever recall my father watching them play. As a journalist, over the past few years I've had numerous opportunities to cover the Jets, and I've developed a real attachment to the team and its fans. I've always found the intense dedication of Jets fans, despite the team's struggles to be inspiring and even heartwarming. Today's Jets-Giants conflict is something that happens once every four years and its often referred to as ""the battle for tenancy."" Although I'm picking the Jets to win today, I also decided to poll two of the most rabid fans I know to give a perspective from each side regarding the game's outcome and to determine exactly how the battle lines are drawn when it comes to choosing a team. Bennie Bentley grew up in New Jersey and was the captain and star running back of his high school football team. Anthony ""Mooch"" Scaramucci was the captain and quarterback of his Long Island team and today both are successful businessmen and passionate professional football fans. Bentley lives for Big Blue and Scaramucci's blood runs as Jet green as the money he talks about as the host of television's Wall Street Week. ""The Giants are in my DNA,"" said Bentley when I spoke to him on the phone yesterday. ""I've been following them for more than 50 years, ever since my father took me to my first game when I was fourteen years old."" Bentley admits to a brief flirtation with Joe Namath's Jets when the team won the Super Bowl but otherwise his allegiance has never wavered. ""Football is tribal,"" said Bentley. ""And the Giants are and always will be my team.""""The reason I'm a Jets fan started out because of geography,"" said Scaramucci. ""I grew up in Port Washington, and the train line ran right into Shea Stadium, so I became a fan at a very early age."" Scaramucci follows baseball as well but enjoys footballs shorter season because ""every game seems like the playoffs and it's much more exciting."" Geography may have made the introduction for Scaramucci, but his relationship with the Jets ultimately became (like Bentley) about allegiance to his team. ""I haven't had the best of luck with my team but I'm a very loyal person and I can't help it -- I've fallen in love with the Jets. It's all about loyalty. Not only do you have to stay with your team, but you have to make sure your kids experience the same torture and hardship that you have."" Scaramucci and his kids have spent many a Jets game bonding together, so Bentley's tribal commentary hits a note that is familiar for all of us. Scaramucci has become an extended member of the Jets family off the field, recently helping to raise more than one million dollars for the Jets Foundation and the Alliance for Lupus Research. As for the game, the predictions were as expected, with a little trash talk thrown in by Bentley. ""Jets fans are loyal beyond reason and Giants fans are loyal for a reason -- we usually win!"" I heard Bentley's wife Marla laughing in the background and then she yelled, ""Not recently!"" Comments like this do not affect the unflappable Scaramucci, whose SkyBridge Capital manages and advises on more than ten billion dollars in hedge funds. Scaramucci has always told me that there are ups and down in the markets and we have to endure the same with sports. But today Jets fans can expect more than an uptick, it will be an important gain."

I want you to know that the victims, their families, the brave first responders and, indeed, your entire community are in my thoughts and prayers after this senseless shooting at your town's [school/movie theater etc.] I assure you that I will send a nice comforting tweet to that effect, but after that I will do absolutely nothing to change the conditions that led to this latest mass shooting. I will, however, admonish the President for politicizing this tragedy by bringing up the issue of gun control and, to the extent that the shooter comes from anything other than a White Judeo-Christian background, I will demand that the President use magic words like ""Radical Islam"" or whatever else might be appropriate to inflame the xenophobia my party so diligently fosters.To the extent that I actually do something on the rare occasions that I find myself on the floor of the Congress I was elected to serve in, it will be to exploit the intense coverage of this event as cover to do something truly heinous like voting for the 60th time to repeal Obamacare or defunding Planned Parenthood (since I am part of the Bullets and Babies Pro-Life Caucus).If you live in a jurisdiction, such as California, I will highlight the strict gun control laws in place in your state or city, purposely overlooking various loopholes in your state's laws or the free availability of guns in border jurisdictions. I also will overlook the effectiveness of certain state and federal gun control efforts and painstakingly look into the camera and say something like ""you can't eradicate evil by legislation"".In addition, should I be on a program discussing reasonable measures that could be taken to reduce the likelihood or extent of carnage that occurs in these incidents, I will simply declare that the Democrats really just want to take your guns and send you all to FEMA camps.Now I can appreciate the deep sorrow and anguish you must be experiencing over the death of your loved ones. I may say something invoking the potential of their extinguished life, such as ""we did not just lose our friends and loved ones today, but we lost our future"". In reality, however, the potential I am most concerned with is that of my own reelection.Having been elected from one of many gerrymandered districts that overstates my party's popularity, I simply cannot afford to cross the National Rifle Association and its lobbyists. I know most Americans support reasonable gun laws, but most Americans do not reside in my district or give to my campaign.That is why I proudly support arming almost anyone, even criminals and the sale of cop killing bullets since that is what freedom is all about and shows how we as Americans value life.So please accept my ever so sincere condolences and thank you for your inexplicable passivity in not wanting to throw the lot of us out.Your Humble Servant,Congressman [blank]"

Students in my classroom at Compassion Road Academy in Denver have been preparing to participate virtually in these historic negotiations for months, and I cannot wait to share this experience with them as well as with you.This is my first-ever blog post, and I am excited that you have taken the time to read through my thoughts and experiences. As I write I am enjoying the accommodations at the Generator Hostel after a very long day of traveling, meeting new people and taking in the beauty of the city. I've been reflecting upon all that has lead to this point in time, in addition to thinking through the magnitude of the decisions that will be made by our world leaders gathered in Paris with me.During my travels, I found myself questioning all of the choices that we are faced with everyday, which have an impact on our global health. It is challenging to be a 21st century citizen, as we are constantly faced with decisions that directly or indirectly impact our world. Ultimately, this is the goal that I have everyday: as soon as I step into my classroom, I strive to help my students think through the choices they make and consider other ways to live their lives that ultimately have a softer impact on our fragile environment.World leaders at COP21 are tasked with one of the greatest challenges that our world has ever seen. I desperately want to believe that our political leaders and scientists can come to an agreement that will drastically reduce the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are being released into the atmosphere and are increasing the global average surface temperature.The time is now -- action must be taken. We can no longer turn our heads away from science. The evidence is clear -- human activity is causing the climate to change on a time scale that has never before been seen. As much as I would like to say that I am optimistic that action will be taken and that our leaders will implement sweeping reforms, I am worried, for multiple reasons.I believe that our leaders are going to continue to walk the line on climate change, and that true change is going to come only when all the world's communities join together to demand that more serious actions are taken. We are more powerful together, and it is my hope that the UNFCC COP21 negotiations serve as a catalyst to unite our communities in order to demand that the necessary climate actions are taken. But even if the actions that are needed are not taken right now, each step that we take brings us closer to achieving the low-carbon future that we need. We can only hope that we don't set the appropriately ambitious goals once it has become too late.Sending all of my positive energy and love for a strong agreement at COP21!Minneapolis-based nonprofit, Climate Generation: A Will Steger Legacy, is leading a delegation of 10 Education Ambassadors to COP21 through their Window Into Paris program, December 5-11. These 10 teachers - representing diverse subject areas, grade levels, and school communities from Denver, Atlanta, upstate New York, western North Carolina and Minnesota - are connecting their students to climate policy in action, helping to build both climate literacy and the relevance of this issue in their students' lives."

She holds a Masters in Architecture at the Savannah College of Art & Design and an MBA in Entrepreneurship from UT at Austin. Ingrid VanderveldtQ: What does entrepreneurship mean to you, and what underlying characteristics do you see in successful entrepreneurs?Ingrid: Entrepreneurship is doing what you love and making money doing it. Underlying characteristics of successful entrepreneurs are, bottom line, people who do what they say they are going to do. Another way of saying that are people of integrity- that others can count on to follow through, are transparent in their communication- are trustworthy. Being successful as an entrepreneur is all about relationships and relationships are all based on trust. So this is, at the end of the day in my opinion the most critical factor. People with passion to bust through walls and willing to get up when knocked down and learn from things that didn't pan out to be better on the other side is critical as well!  Q: What are you most proud of in your professional career?   Ingrid: I would have to say the day I decided to ""listen to my calling"" as opposed to my ego. The minute I let go and let God, my world changed. It was the day that I heard my calling was to ""Empower a Billion Women by 2020"" and after getting over the initial shock of the impossibility of that goal, and accepted that as my calling (and 100% going into service of it) people, resources and opportunities showed up at a scale I had never experienced before. Its the magic of truly doing what you are called to do and realizing that when you do- the Universe conspires to bring you everything you need. So I would say that and keeping my priorities in check in the midst of this global work- God, family, friends (of which the EBW2020 global community is), business. If you could do something in your life over again, what would it be? Not be so scared. Realize that everyone that has left a legacy in life is just as scared as I am on days and has no idea how the heck they will get through that day. Then they do, and they keep moving on. Its what Nelson Mandela says, ""It always seems impossible till its done"".Q: Tell us about an instance where you had to go against the flow to realize your goal.   Ingrid: LOL. Every day! I would actually say now- EBW2020 has a life of its own. My job is truly to get out of its way and simply ""step up and step in"" to what I need to do to play a helpful role in continuing to support its growth. That said- I can assure you that every day I run across people who think that the idea is truly ""impossible"" and then I get the opportunity to share that over the past 18 months we have reached over 700M people through our outreach/ social media initiatives. Dell played a huge role in that and for that I am truly grateful.Q: How do you measure success for yourself?   Ingrid: Did I wake up and listen to what I was called to do that day? Did I tell my husband and my family I love them? Did I tell my team how much I appreciate them? Did I share with the women of EBW2020 how proud of them I am that they continue to invest in themselves and how much I appreciate them sharing how else we can help them reach their goals? My greatest desire is to create a global sustainable future for all and that will happen through a new set of eyes. They eyes of women. Women reinvest 90% of what they earn back into their families, their communities and ultimately the world. So the faster women win- we all win. These are the ways I measure success. (Oh- and did I get a workout in that day and am I taking care of my skin that dries out with all the travel!) . With those ""success factors"" it always begs the question of money. I think about money all the time. The more I make the more I can give. So I have very clear goals on where I want to be financially and have total faith that very shortly- I will be there. I use money and numbers as my ""scorecard"". Did I hit my numbers? If not where do I need to reassess/ pivot or otherwise. Mistakes will happen so lets just readjust if/ when needed and get back on the horse. What drives you? Being in service of my calling to Empower a Billion Women by 2020.Q: What advice would you give to your 22 year old self? Ingrid: Chill out. Don't be so scared. You got this. Listen to your gut even when investors say ""I don't care what your gut says, I want to see the numbers"" (that really happened)....so trust your gut and know your numbers. Know that if someone else is going to make great things happen- why can't I? My biggest challenge is truly myself. So get out of my own way, surround myself with really smart people and do my best to support them in their success. When they win, we all get to win together.Follow Ingrid Vanderveldt at @ontheroadwithiv, and check out the other interviews in Going Against the Flow series at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charu-sharma/ and join the movement to empower 1 million female entrepreneurs at goagainsttheflow.com."
11,MEDIA,Syrian Caricaturist Ali Ferzat 'Draws' Foes' Ire,"Magda Abu-Fadil, ContributorDirector of Media Unlimited in Lebanon",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syrian-caricaturist-ali-f_b_8730646.html,"The unrepentant caricaturist was hospitalized, eventually recovered and left his homeland, but continued to draw -- his pen and tongue as sharp as ever.",2015-12-06,2015-12-06-1449392761-2803567-PrecariousbalanceAbuFadil.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-06-1449392761-2803567-PrecariousbalanceAbuFadil-thumb.jpg,"Get on the wrong side of the powers-that-be and you could end up with smashed hands, broken fingers, a bruised face, a bleeding body or worse.That's true of caricaturists who mock their regimes, and it's what befell Ali Ferzat when his scathing illustrations took aim at Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and the country's ruling elite. Smile (Abu-Fadil)""My illustrations were such that even if I drew one line, the authorities were terrified of the impact,"" recounted Ferzat, in self-exile in Kuwait four years after thugs beat the daylights out of him and left him on the side of the Damascus airport road.News of the incident and pictures of him in hospital went viral on social media and in traditional news outlets.He was banned several times in Syria when he was at a government-run paper, he said of the precarious balance he tried to maintain, adding that freaked out authorities would over-interpret what every line, every dot, and every potential nuance meant. Precarious balance (Abu-Fadil)The tipping point came in August 2011 as the ""Arab Spring"" snowball began growing, and with the outbreak of war in Syria when he felt compelled to take direct aim at the president. Ferzat, who had been drawing in state-controlled newspapers and had published his magazine, ""Al Domari"" (the lamplighter) -- which was eventually shut down because of its critical content -- was snatched as he walked home at night and ""taught a lesson.""The unrepentant caricaturist was hospitalized, eventually recovered and left his homeland, but continued to draw -- his pen and tongue as sharp as ever.""I swear I'll never let them rest,"" he said defiantly. ""Imagine, they said the picture of the drowned (Syrian refugee) toddler Eylan (on a Turksih shore) was a fabrication.""Ferzat's creative juices are stirred by his antipathy to dictatorships, to the military's power run amok, and to corruption in general.  Universal corruption (Abu-Fadil)He feels it's his moral duty to skewer ""the nasties"" and rally to the cause of the underdog, in his country and the Arab world. He is most ticked off by military leaders.He insists the harm his caricatures cause isn't personal, but against an issue or unacceptable practices, and he provides proof to make his point.""The fewer the words in a caricature, the more universal it is,"" explained Ferzat of his medium. He relishes recounting his adventures in countering the regime.  Off-key (Abu-Fadil)To him drawings devoid of words trigger analysis and help expand readers' thought horizons to discover meanings, which he said were a pleasurable experience.""My work titled 'no comment' means I leave it to people's imagination, but there's usually a goal and a message,"" he explained. No comment (Abu-Fadil)In 1983 he worked for a paper in Abu Dhabi called ""Al Wehda"" (The Union) and asked the editors to use an older drawing while he was on vacation. They selected one of an upturned hand with a table in the palm and the tips of the fingers drawn as Arab men with different national headdresses. A sign on the table said ""conference"" and the cuff read ""U.S.,"" implying American manipulation of Arab leaders.  Conference (Abu-Fadil)The publication of the caricature, which he re-drew on a white board in Kuwait during a conference and workshops organized by the Nuqat Foundation, had coincided with an Islamic summit in Abu Dhabi and about which he wasn't aware. It was taken as an insult and he was summarily fired.Ferzat said he targets dictatorial regimes and has been banned from Iraq, Libya, Jordan and Oman. He once drew a Libyan citizen peeing against a wall fashioned after the late flamboyant leader Muammar Qaddafi's famous ""Green Book."" Qaddafi's ""Green Book"" (Abu-Fadil)""I want to illustrate our painful reality, the leaders and their positions regarding what's happening in the Arab world,"" he said.On how he selects topics for his illustrations, Ferzat said artists are often bombarded by several notions and ideas at once but shouldn't be tempted to grab them and turn them immediately into illustrations. ""Everyone has an internal compass to direct him/her and that's how it works with caricaturists,"" he said. At odds (Abu-Fadil)There should be a thought process, development of the message to be delivered, and proper contextualization.""I'm not beholden to the daily grind of the media,"" he explained of his modus operandi. ""If I'm contracted by a paper, I send an advance reserve of 15 pieces, usually generic topics, and then do dailies events."" In 1996 Ferzat had an exhibition of his illustrations as paintings that sold for world-class prices. They were no longer just caricatures in newspapers.  Caricature painting targeting the high and mighty (Abu-Fadil)""A painting must be a beacon of light and hope and the skill is in the distribution of color,"" he said. As he showed workshop participants his illustrations and paintings, he demonstrated how color played a big role in setting the mood. ""Caricatures can reflect sad events with an emphasis on drama and tragedy: I had black and white illustrations for decades and later began to transform some of them into color, with some adjustments"" he noted.Sometimes he draws on black backgrounds with white correction fluid to reflect a painful reality. Hunger (Abu-Fadil)Ferzat was influenced in his youth by caricaturists in Egyptian weekly magazines that his father brought home and later realized he had a satirical spirit before he began drawing.The mission of art is a humanitarian one, he insists, and for caricaturists there's job-related work and there's creativity. He feels he's drawing for humans, not a group or an institution. Leaders' blah blah blah (Abu-Fadil)Not all is depressing, according to Ferzat. Caricatures have to have an element of hope for a better life. ""Most of my illustrations have hope and optimism. The bitter satire is to make a point; as an artist I can't keep quiet,"" he said."

Men are ready for the challenge, I think. After all, facing the unknown, being strong and mastering problems are what men are supposed to do!",2015-12-06,Group of young urban sportive men having fun with smart phone at city park,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9f19102000002d00fea1b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After several years of psychiatry residency I felt pretty comfortable doing group therapy sessions. Whether depressed, manic, or psychotic -- most patients could benefit from ""Dr Phil's"" budding expertise. Some colleagues caught wind of this and asked me to facilitate a group discussion with people outside of the mental health system. Leading a group didn't throw me, but the setting was a bit outside of my comfort zone. The group would consist of men of color at risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes who were enrolled in a 12-week health program to promote fitness, nutrition and life style changes. This brought images to my mind of a locker room or barbershop, which weren't exactly the best places to conduct therapy sessions. And my chromosomal kinship reminded me how painful the idea of a group of men sitting around ""talking about feelings,"" could be. With these thoughts fresh in mind, my job seemed impossible: In one session, I was supposed to talk to a bunch of regular guys about the importance of mental and emotional health. The topic of men's physical and mental health has been steadily gaining attention. From stalled men's health legislation in 2001 to the ""Movember"" movement, awareness of the health challenges men face now seems to be reaching a fever pitch. National studies and anecdotal evidence show men bringing up the rear in outcomes for chronic medical conditions, and leading the pack in deaths from suicides and homicides. When pundits try to explain why, they often use social narratives about how men have lower rates of health care seeking behaviors and poorer coping mechanisms. The idea of the stoic loner has been ingrained and reinforced through contemporary culture and the media. For men the message has been, ""Be in charge, be strong, resourceful and unfazed in every situation."" This may work in movies and books, but is quite a tall order to fill in everyday life. Men are crumbling under the heavy weight of trying to ""take it like a man."" I was told the first group would consist of up to seven working class men on a weeknight at a local primary care center. I agonized about goals, objectives and content during the weeks leading up to the first group. After exhausting all possibilities I told myself, ""man up."" At the first session, my anxiety was visible as I walked into the room. Slowly the men trickled in. Some had just come from work and others were more casual in appearance. They each took their seats in the room as I stood before the blank dry-erase board. Jokes and pleasantries were exchanged as the men spoke about the some of their challenges implementing the program's recommended diet and exercises. I broke the ice by talking about the importance of physical health and how it took patience to break bad nutrition habits. Finally, the moment of truth arrived: I introduced the topic of men's mental and emotional wellness. Where I expected to hear crickets chirping, the men in the room instantly attached to the subject matter. An older man appearing 60 years old raised his hand to speak. He was clean cut, wearing a sweater to protect him from the New England winter. His dark skin and soft-spoken nature reminded me of my father, which added to the weight of his words. He said, ""When I was growing up all you had to do was hold your liquor, win fights, and take care of your woman. Boys today have it a little different, but I'm not saying that's a bad thing.""Without missing a beat a man likely 30 years his junior wearing a sweatshirt, fitted cap and sneakers agreed saying, ""Yea, That's what I've been taught since I was a kid, and it's been killing me."" The conversation continued to flow with all of the men in this small group participating. They spoke about personal and social pressures to lead, and the imperative to not disclose any visible vulnerabilities. They were well aware of how this stylized caricature of men interfered with a full life - and their difficulties escaping it. These men also shared concerns about male friends and family members. Each group member had questions about the best ways to seek help, or speak with other men who were having difficulties. They also spoke about how broaching problems with other men could be seen as violating the rules that governed how men relate to each other. The group soon came to the conclusion that the best approach is to check in with a man when you feel something about him is ""off."" This approach would be low pressure, while allowing the other person to respond at his own pace. The men in this group taught me an important lesson, namely that I had to examine some of the ways I was biased about men. I learned that talking about problems need not be off limits for men. I am not suggesting pressing every man you meet with questions about problems or urging them to cry and let it out, but that's not something I'd recommend for anyone. When it comes to talking about the topic of mental and emotional health, what's important is knowing that often just opening the door for the conversation can be effective and helpful. Men are ready for the challenge, I think. After all, facing the unknown, being strong and mastering problems are what men are supposed to do!___________________If you -- or someone you know -- need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Is that too much to ask? Take a deep breath, exhale and realize that the end of the world is not at hand. Neither is the end of American life as we have known it -- unless we allow unwarranted fear to overpower our sense, as most of the candidates running for the presidential nomination of one of the major parties want us to do. So, of course, do the jihadists. We are hearing talking heads on mainstream media shows say that the incident in San Bernardino proves that the American strategy for preventing domestic terrorism isn't working. This is often said in the next breath after the same wise opinion-shapers have pointed out that the shooting last week was the worst terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11.Try to calm down for a moment, especially if you have been listening to the rantings of Donald I-Am-Megalomaniac-I-am-Strong! Trump , Ted Carpet-Bomb-the-Muslims-into-Stone-Age Cruz, or any of the other fear-mongers in the Republican presidential contest. Of course the killing of fourteen Americans and wounding of many more last week was a terrible event. But it has been more than fourteen years since 9/11. If this is (and it is) the worst terrorist attack in America in all of that time -- seven years under the Republican administration of George W. Bush and seven years under the Democratic administration of Barack Obama -- doesn't that strongly indicate that the strategy has been working very well, indeed? Mass killings have become an everyday event in America. What makes this one so much more frightening? Several of the other attacks that have taken place in recent months were also terrorism, but the terrorists were crazed white racists (Charleston), crazed anti-abortion zealots (Colorado Springs), or acted from various other twisted motivations. Why should we react differently when the terrorists are Muslim?Be Not Afraid.So, difficult as it is at a time like this, we need to take a step back from our fears and stand up for our American way of life, our values and our liberties. Officials certainly need to go through all the security measures that have so successfully been protecting our people at home for the last fourteen years and see what can be improved. But we do not need to go crazy with fear or change our lives or get caught up in anti-Muslim hysteria. That is just what ISIS--and Republicans--want us to do. Don't give in to them! "

Venezuelans voted Sunday in tense elections that could see the opposition seize legislative power from the socialist government and risk sparking violence in the oil-rich, cash-poor nation. AFP PHOTO/ LUIS ROBAYO / AFP / LUIS ROBAYO (Photo credit should read LUIS ROBAYO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1676b240000360076fcf9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Washington has been trying to get rid of the Venezuelan government for more than 13 years, going back to the failed military coup of 2002. The U.S. State Department acknowledged that Washington ""provided training, institution building and other support to individuals and organizations understood to be actively involved"" in the coup. They stepped up funding to opposition groups after the coup government collapsed. Since 2004, the U.S. has also supported regime change by electoral means, but the Venezuelan opposition has never been able to win a national election.Now Washington's hopes are high for the Venezuela's National Assembly elections on December 6, with the economy in recession, and grappling with shortages and high inflation. As usual, the U.S. government and its allies -- in the media, NGOs and even U.S. law enforcement agencies -- have been campaigning vigorously.But there is something even more sinister going on here. While the Venezuelan opposition is leading in national polls, it very likely will not do as well in winning Assembly seats as these polls would indicate. That is mainly because Venezuela's single-chamber legislature gives more than proportional representation to smaller states. It is not so disproportional as in the U.S. or Brazilian system, with their separate Senate chambers, but it is significant. Also, the governing party (PSUV) has millions of members and a record of getting their voters to the polls, while the opposition has nothing comparable.Since the media is focusing on the national polls, the stage is set for the Venezuelan opposition to claim fraud, as they did in the 2013 presidential elections. In 2013, the opposition took to the streets with violent demonstrations, and Washington supported them by refusing to recognize the results. There was absolutely no doubt about the results -- Venezuela has one of the most fraud-proof voting systems ever invented, which former U.S. President and election expert Jimmy Carter called ""the best in the world.""In 2013, it was the intervention of South America that forced Washington and its only two allies, Jose Miguel Insulza (the Secretary General of the OAS) and the right-wing Popular Party of Spain, to back down and join the rest of the world in recognizing the results. Lula in particular made unusually strong public criticisms of Washington for supporting this destabilization effort.Even if the opposition wins a simple majority in the Assembly, they may still claim fraud if they don't reach the two-thirds majority that would give them much more power. The current U.S.-led international campaign has dangerously focused not only on de-legitimizing the government of Venezuela, but also its elections. This effort has been joined by OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro, who published an 18-page letter trashing Venezuela ahead of the elections. He was strongly denounced for his actions by Uruguayan ex-President Pepe Mujica, whom Almagro had served as foreign minister until March of this year. And now the election of Mauricio Macri -- a politician who had previously appealed to U.S. officials to help him fight against his own government -- as president of Argentina has given the U.S. another ally in its campaign.The Brazilian government should stand firm, as it did in 2013, against this sordid attempt to undermine the legitimacy of Venezuela's elections. And Almagro has clearly violated his mandate as Secretary General of the OAS by actively campaigning against a member country. He should resign.Mark Weisbrot is a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C., and the president of Just Foreign Policy.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) campaigned at an Iowa indoor shooting range on Friday, defending gun rights two days after another mass shooting and announcing the formation of a “National Second Amendment Coalition” to represent gun-rights supporters. “You don’t stop bad guys by taking away our guns, you stop bad guys by using our guns,” Cruz told a room full of voters, referring to the shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead and another 21 injured.Cruz visited the same gun range in June, just three days after the Charleston church shooting.

Yet what do all the Democrats say? ‘These great gun control laws -- we need more of them.'”Cruz called gun control an “abysmal failure,” suggesting that California’s strict gun laws made it a prime location for a terror attack.“Look, if you’re a lunatic, ain’t nothing better than having a bunch of targets you know are going to be unarmed,” he said.Speaking to reporters ahead of the campaign event, Cruz criticized the investigation into the San Bernardino shooting, expressing concern that the media were airing footage from inside the home of shooting suspects Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. “It appears a search warrant was executed and law enforcement left and media are now walking freely in a crime scene, that makes no sense,” the first-term senator said. “The FBI should have secured that location and should be scouring it for evidence.""Cruz also slammed the Obama administration for consistently failing to target radical Islamic terrorists, and claimed it had the intelligence needed to prevent past attacks like the Boston bombing in 2013 and the Fort Hood shooting in 2009.“This is a consistent failure,” he said to a group of reporters here. “The Obama administration had the information to prevent these attacks. Because the Obama administration, as an iron-clad rule, will not even acknowledge that radical Islamic terrorism exists, it has been utterly ineffective at targeting the bad guys.”During the event, Cruz announced the campaign has signed up more than 24,000 gun-rights supporters across the country, one thousand of whom are from the early-primary state.In the last few weeks, Cruz has been gaining momentum in Iowa, picking up coveted endorsements in the state and rising significantly in the polls. A recent Quinnipiac University poll of likely Republican caucus-goers shows him Texas at 23 percent, overtaking Carson in the second spot and finishing within the margin of error of Trump.Cruz, acknowledging his success in Iowa, highlighted the number of attacks headed in his direction in the last couple weeks, specifically calling out President Barack Obama, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and a negative New York Times editorial for criticizing him.“I want to say from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and the New York Times for that powerful endorsement,” he said with a smirk. “You know what, they are right. If you’re a gun-grabbing, big government, debt-loving, weak-America leftist, then a Cruz campaign is your nightmare.”"

Not in 2016.,2015-12-05,Black Lives Matter protesters shout in Seattle on Nov. 27.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5862ec6e1500002e00e9d474.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- ""Voters pick the guy with the sun in his face."" That's how American pundit and talk show host Chris Matthews puts it.It's a truism of politics in a democracy that inclusive optimism usually wins. But it's especially on point in the United States, a country that defines itself as the home of fresh starts and reinvention.President Ronald Reagan won re-election in 1984 by declaring that it was ""Morning in America again."" George H.W. Bush won four years later by vowing to create a ""kinder, gentler"" country. Bill Clinton defeated him in 1992 by saying, ""I still believe in a place called Hope"" -- which, conveniently, was the name of his childhood home in Arkansas.And after the dark, divided years of George W. Bush's presidency, an obscure senator from Illinois won the presidency in 2008 with a campaign summarized by a now-iconic poster that had just one word: HOPE.Well, that was then. It doesn't feel that way now. There is no sun now, and I don't know if and when it will reappear.So far in the 2016 presidential campaign cycle, the mood in both major political parties and among the electorate as a whole is one of anger, division, wariness and resentment.It is an article of faith -- literally, our secular American faith -- that our best days always lie ahead. It's what we have wanted our leaders to tell us and what we want to believe.Yet Donald Trump -- himself a symbol of upward mobility and business success -- continues to lead the Republican field with a starkly apocalyptic message. ""The American dream is dead,"" he declares at his rallies.Trump, in fact, is the sum of all fears, summoning to his side every dark corner of American society: racial, ethnic and religious stereotypes at home; the specter of ""evil"" foreigners in China, Mexico and elsewhere aboard; the delusion that U.S. government leaders, starting with President Barack Obama, are secret agents with an agenda to destroy America.Far from attacking him for these views and tactics, most of the other Republican candidates, most of the time, have tried to outdo him with the grim nature of their own message. After all, Trump is the clear leader in the latest CNN poll. GOP campaign consultants are even writing memos telling lower-level candidates how to mimic Trump. (If he doesn't get the Republican nomination, expect Trump to run as an independent candidate, despite his vague promise not to do so.)Republican Jewish activists cheered Trump in Washington this week when he implied that Obama was a Muslim agent. Then they sat in stunned, uncomfortable silence as he caricatured them to their faces as a roomful of crafty, money-obsessed, rich Jews. (So what did they expect? That they could laugh along with him and he would exempt them from his inflammatory profiling?)The Democratic Party's side of the conversation is hardly more upbeat. Front-runner Hillary Clinton isn't campaigning as the cheerful inheritor of Obama's successes, such as they are. Pressured from the left, she is fashioning herself as a tribune for the resentments of struggling middle-class voters. Meanwhile, her progressive foes denounce her as a lifelong tool of Wall Street and other elites.As for U.S. voters, they think, by a 2-1 margin, that the country is on the ""wrong track."" Only 13 percent believe their children will be better off financially than they are.Why has the sun disappeared from American presidential politics? Here's a summary of the reasons:TERRORISM. Fear is rising in the land, and Obama's credibility as a voice of reassurance is at risk. He told Americans that the self-described Islamic State was contained in Syria and Iraq and that the U.S. homeland was safe. But then terrorists killed 130 people in Paris, and ISIS sympathizers killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.The president also vowed not to get involved in another land war in the Middle East, yet he is sending special operations troops to help combat the Islamic State.Republicans are more than willing to play to the growing fear. Democrats, led by Clinton, are caught between an anti-war wing that gave rise to Obama in the first place, and calls for more military and security-state reaction to ISIS.ECONOMICS. This is the most obvious and familiar reason, though it has recently been overlooked as concerns about national security rise. As campaign guru James Carville once said, ""It's the economy, stupid.""The real income of middle-class households in the U.S. has been stagnant for nearly 20 years, even as the richest have grown richer and the poor, as numerous as ever, rely on government programs. It's a recipe for resentment, which too often leads to racial backlash -- even though black and brown middle-class Americans have actually been hit harder than their white counterparts.RACE. Electing Barack Obama to the White House didn't end the story of race in America. Instead, it opened a new chapter of anger and frustration.Among African-Americans, that anger and frustration works on at least two levels. At elite universities and other institutions, black Americans are demanding change in a way they never had the power or opportunity to do before. On the streets, the fact that violence and police misconduct are still disproportionately aimed at black Americans has led to a vigorous new activism, called the Black Lives Matter movement.Their reformist zeal and rhetoric, in turn, has stoked fear and resentment across white America, especially among those who have been long and loudly suspicious of the nation's first black president.The two political parties are perhaps more demographically divergent than ever before -- a dangerous situation that often adds the flammable fuel of race to everyday arguments. A Trump rally, or almost any GOP presidential rally for that matter, is a nearly all-white affair, and the families there tend to be led by married (or remarried), church-going parents. The Democratic gatherings are starkly different: racially and ethnically more diverse, with fewer married and fewer parents.MEDIA. Social media creates networks, but divides nations. Liked-minded voters find each other and live their political lives immersed in the partisan reality that ""their"" news outlets and social media circles create.That division amplifies fear of the Other, of the mysterious Them whom a certain brand of American politician always has run against. Trump is only the latest, though one of the most potent, examples. His social media weapon of choice is Twitter -- a perfect place, it turns out, for his brand of campaigning by fear and accusation.GRIDLOCK. Washington as a whole and Congress in particular are so gripped by partisan division that they can barely function. But rather than look for ways of fixing it, the two parties look for ways to exploit it -- and thus make the situation worse. American voters cheer for their own narrow causes, even while their anger and contempt rises for leaders and national institutions.GUNS. America is awash in guns and gun violence. And yet as the blood flows, the political system seems incapable of imposing even the simplest limits on, say, semi-automatic ""assault"" rifles or full-bore background checks. Meanwhile, as Americans see more videos of gun violence, their response is to ... buy more guns. The ever-growing gun culture suffuses politics with an air of literal menace.IMMIGRATION. Trump began his 2016 campaign by promising to be the man who built a wall to keep out Mexicans. But now he and most other Republican candidates conflate that cynical pandering to fear with an even starker and more sweeping call to brand, track and exclude Syrian war refugees and even Muslim Americans.This kind of hysteria is not entirely new to U.S. politics. In the first half of the 19th century, Protestants rioted against what they saw as a culture-killing invasion of Catholics. Later in that century, especially in the South, white people used lynching and other gruesome tactics to intimidate black people after the Civil War freed them from official slavery. Jewish immigrants were persecuted, and even lynched, early in 20th century America.HISTORY RHYMES. The late 1960s was the last time that U.S. politics were this divided and driven by the language of violence and fear. The 1968 election was a bitter affair that capped a decade of war, tumultuous social and cultural change, assassinations and riots. It was a three-way presidential race featuring a stern Republican who was a master of xenophobic politics (Richard Nixon); a weak Democrat backed by labor unions but not progressive youth (Hubert Humphrey); and a third-party racist renegade (George Wallace), running in the name of the little guy. Nixon won a grim victory based on a promise to ""bring us together"" through ""law and order.""As the saying goes, history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Something about that gloomy campaign sounds familiar."

On Thursday, Congress failed yet again, when an amendment that would have required background checks for all gun sales did not pass the Senate.""This tragedy reminds us of our obligation to do everything in our power, together, to keep our communities safe,"" Obama said in his address. ""We know that the killers in San Bernardino used military-style assault weapons -- weapons of war -- to kill as many people as they could. It’s another tragic reminder that here in America it’s way too easy for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun.""Obama, who has said that failing to pass comprehensive gun reform is the ""greatest frustration"" of his time in office, said it was ridiculous that people on a no-fly list in the United States could legally purchase a gun.""That is insane. If you’re too dangerous to board a plane, you’re too dangerous, by definition, to buy a gun. And so I’m calling on Congress to close this loophole, now,"" he said. ""We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but -- at a bare minimum -- we shouldn’t be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get their hands on a gun that they could use against Americans.""Two of the assault-style rifles used in the San Bernardino attack were bought legally in California because of a loophole in state law.The White House is reportedly considering what executive actions Obama could take on guns, but a unilateral move could prove to be legally and politically difficult. One possible action Obama is considering is to broaden the definition of a high-volume dealer, which would expand the number of dealers subject to background checks, The New York Times reported on Friday.Obama ended his address with a call for unity and patriotism, saying that protecting American lives is ""work that should unite us all.""""That’s how we can honor the lives we lost in San Bernardino,"" he said. That’s how we can send a message to all those who would try to hurt us.""""We will uphold our values -- a free and open society,"" he added. ""We are strong. And we are resilient.

He was one of the first to enter Columbine High School in 1999, searching for the gunmen who killed 13 people and injured 21 more.“When you walked out of the building, it was like, ‘Holy shit. What did we just experience?’” he said of Columbine. “It was surreal. People didn’t know what to say … you felt like you were on an island.” Though he said it never got to the point where he could not do his job, images of victims would appear in his mind without warning long after the shooting.

They get easier in time, but these things stay with you,” he said.Cops are trained to confront tense and life-threatening events every day, but the sheer scale of mass shootings, like the one in San Bernardino on Wednesday — in which 14 people were killed, and 21 wounded, making it the deadliest mass shooting in nearly three years — are different. “These incidents have the power to render a person nearly defenseless emotionally,” said police psychologist Jack Digliani.The ensuing media coverage and national attention can also make it harder for officers to move on. “The media was so brutal. All of the so-called experts coming out saying how we could have done things better,” DeAndrea said. “After the first day, I quit watching.”In San Bernardino, soon after police cleared the crime scene, a group of mental-health professionals arrived at the San Bernardino Police Department to help officers process what they had just seen.“We do a lot of psychological first aid,” said Nancy Bohl-Penrod, director of the Counseling Team International, a private practice that responds to crisis incidents in Southern California. Bohl-Penrod and her team — comprised of chaplains, counselors, and fellow officers — began preparing officers for what might lie ahead: difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance, anger, isolation, and flashbacks. “There are parts of the event that get stuck in your memory. It keeps replaying on a loop: you smell it and see it and hear it.”Former Newtown police officer Thomas Bean was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in which 20 children and six adults were killed. He sued the police department for disability benefits (the debate overwhether police should receive workers compensation for PTSD is ongoing in several states). Bean said he drank and thought about cutting himself after the image of dead children was seared in his brain.Former Aurora police chief Daniel Oates experienced how mass shooting can shake an entire police department. One hundred and twenty-six officers were working the night that James Holmes killed 12 and injured 70 in a movie theater in Colorado. “What the whole organization went through was cataclysmic,” said Oates, who left Aurora in 2014 to become chief of police in Miami Beach. “The cops that weren’t there were tremendously traumatized because there was a sense of, ‘I wasn’t there to contribute.’”Oates brought in police psychologist John Nicoletti to meet with any officer who wanted to talk. Sergeants organized trips to the hospital for police to meet the surviving moviegoers they had helped. Eight days after the shooting, they gathered every officer working that night to listen to each radio transmission and walk through exactly what happened. While reliving the shooting can be traumatic, it helps officers see the big picture, Nicoletti said. Without it, they can spiral, wondering what they might have done differently to save more lives.Even three years later, during Holmes’ trial, many police officers broke down in tears remembering the bodies they carted to the hospital. “Hopefully weeks or months down the road, they’ve moved to where it’s not consuming and it becomes more of a memory,” Nicoletti said. “But there will be trigger events that wake up the ghosts.”With each mass shooting (and there have been many this year) police chiefs are thinking more about how to prepare their officers for such an event. “Fifteen years ago, there was no active shooter training, there was no mass casualty training,” said Dan Phillips, chief of crisis services for the U.S. Marshals Service. “That’s a huge shift in law enforcement.”These programs instruct officers on how to approach an active shooter, as well as how to take care of themselves in the weeks and months after the event. “We let them know there will be peer support and mental health professionals available. We tell them to stay away from the TV and media as much as possible,” Phillips said. “We prepare them as best we can that whatever you’re feeling afterwards is normal — it’s the event itself that’s abnormal.”Departments that have weathered mass shootings hope to help other cities prepare for the worst. A group of police chiefs is working with the National Alliance on Mental Illness to compile a manual for police departments on how to assist officers responding to high casualties and to deal with the resulting trauma.“There’s this perverse and growing fraternity of chiefs who have been through this,” Oates said. “Sandy Hook, Oak Creek, Wisconsin, now we’ve got Chatanooga, San Bernardino, Colorado Springs … it just goes on and on.”Also on HuffPost:"

""What I strongly reject is the suggestion that the videotape of the McDonald shooting was withheld from the public because of the election,"" Emanuel wrote.A Cook County judge ordered the release of the controversial video on Nov. 19. The city released it to the public on Nov. 24, the same day prosecutors announced first-degree murder charges against Jason Van Dyke, the officer who killed McDonald --more than a year after the incident.Emanuel said it's the city's ""longstanding practice"" to keep evidence of that kind private until an investigation is complete lest it bias any witnesses. The mayor said he didn't personally watch the video for a similar reason: he does not want his ""emotions"" to ""interfere with criminal investigations.""But Emanuel said that if he had seen the video, he might have made an exception.""The release of this type of evidence is one of many issues we need to rethink moving forward,"" he wrote. ""How do we balance concerns against prematurely releasing evidence and jeopardizing prosecutions with the community’s right to see such material in a timely way?""Emanuel also denied that the city's quick $5 million legal settlement with McDonald's family in April was intended to conceal police wrongdoing. Instead, he said that the city had merely obliged a request for a speedy settlement from McDonald's family in February.Nonetheless, Emanuel acknowledged that the onus is on him to regain the confidence of city residents and soothe public anger prompted by the city's management of the case. ""At the end of the day, I am the mayor and I own it. I take responsibility for what happened and I will fix it,"" he wrote. ""Nothing less than complete and total reform of the system and the culture will meet the standards we have to set for ourselves.""It's too soon to tell whether Emanuel's defense of his actions and efforts to restore public trust in his leadership will quiet calls for his resignation by activists and civil rights groups.Emanuel on Tuesday fired police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, whose handling of the McDonald case had been criticized.The mayor announced the appointment of a five-person Task Force on Police Accountability on Tuesday, which he touted in Friday's op-ed. The commission is charged with presenting its police reform recommendations to the mayor and city council by March 31.""If any good comes from this tragedy, it should be a historic set of reforms that prevents abuses, promotes transparency and rebuilds the confidence of all Chicagoans that they will be treated fairly,"" Emanuel concluded.Also on HuffPost:"

But what many people don’t know is that it is also an extremely expensive one.It is estimated that 30 million Americans struggle with eating disorders and that it is the mental illness with the highest mortality rate. Liana Rosenman and Kristina Saffran met while in treatment for their eating disorders as young teenagers. By the time they were 15, they vowed to do something to help others with the same disease who didn’t have the money to pay for treatment. They founded Project HEAL in 2008 and have since sent 36 patients to treatment.At Project HEAL’s fundraising gala in San Francisco on Friday -- which was co-hosted by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Huffington Post Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington -- Saffran told the audience about being diagnosed with anorexia nervosa when she was only 10 years old. She was hospitalized four times during her freshman year of high school for a total of seven months.“I didn’t think recovery was possible for a long time and I had many lapses along the way,” she said. “But I was lucky, with an awesome support group, top-class treatment and frankly, a great insurance plan, I got there. Full recovery from this disease is possible. That said, the journey that enabled me to get my life back cost upwards of $200,000 -- something that most Americans simply can’t afford.”According to Project HEAL, it costs $30,000 for one month of full residential treatment for a patient with an eating disorder. Project HEAL says it is one of only three organizations in the United States that funds treatment for eating disorders. For Kalanick, who co-hosted the event at Uber headquarters in San Francisco, it is a deeply personal cause. Kalanick’s longtime girlfriend, violinist Gabi Holzwarth, is currently in recovery from an eating disorder.“Unlike Liana and Kristina, I am still in recovery. Every day is really hard,” she said on Friday. “But I fight every day and I’ll never give up. There are a lot of girls out there like me who can’t afford treatment like I can.”The theme of the gala was “Fighting for 500.” Each year, Project HEAL receives around 500 applications from those who are motivated to recover, but lack the financial resources for treatment.The goal this year is to support all 500 applicants. Of the millions of Americans who suffer from eating disorders, Project HEAL estimates that only 10 percent of them get treatment due to inadequate insurance coverage.Kalanick began the night by saying, “This is tough.” He met Holzwarth at a Silicon Valley party, and soon after becoming involved, she told him that she needed help. He opened up to the gala audience Friday night about what it means to be a supporter.“We all have a sister, a daughter, a mother, a partner or a best friend who is going through a tough time. There is light at the end of that tunnel -- and they don’t always see it themselves,"" Kalanick said. ""As a supporter, it’s our job to make sure that they know that our love is unconditional, that their beauty starts from the inside and that our support will always be there to help them get back up, no matter what.”Huffington, too, came to the evening with the experience of being a supporter. Her youngest daughter, Isabella, was diagnosed with an eating disorder when she was 11 years old.“Anybody who is a parent knows that there is no fiercer love than that of a parent to a child,” Huffington said. “When your child goes through something like that, especially when it comes to your relationship with food -- which, as a Greek, is something that is sacred -- you just cannot imagine anybody refusing to eat. I kept thinking of my mother as I was dealing with my own guilt, thinking how did I bring this about? What did I do to make this be a condition for my daughter?”Huffington remembered seeing her daughter reject her birthday cake, and watching her hair come out in clumps as it was washed in a London salon. “Even after you move into recovery, a lot of the symptoms continue,"" Huffington said. ""She’s now 24 and gratefully, she’s doing well.

According to the National Eating Disorders Association, 10 million men struggle with eating disorders today.“How do we remedy this unhealthy culture?” Siebel Newsom asked. “A culture that limits our boys and girls by seeing women’s value in our youth, beauty and sexuality only.

Bloomberg Politics observed that Alito's latest financial disclosure form pointed to some holdings in Puerto Rico municipal bonds by either him or his wife.That means there's a possibility this case may result in a 4-to-4 split, which would leave the lower court appellate ruling from July in place and Puerto Rico without legal recourse. Its only option would be a bid to Congress, which is considering whether to add bankruptcy protection to an omnibus spending bill, among other proposals.This is the second dispute relating to Puerto Rico that the Supreme Court will be hearing between now and the spring.In January, the court will hear arguments in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, a criminal case that will determine whether the commonwealth and the U.S. are ""separate sovereigns"" under the Constitution's double jeopardy clause.A decision in Puerto Rico's debt-restructuring case is expected sometime before the end of June."

Federal Bureau of Investigation officials said mounting signs of advanced preparations, the large cache of armaments amassed by the couple and evidence that they ""attempted to destroy their digital fingerprints"" helped tip the balance of the investigation.""Based on the information and the facts as we know them, we are now investigating these horrific acts as an act of terrorism,"" David Bowdich, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Los Angeles office, said at a news conference.He pointed, in particular, to investigators' discovery of two crushed cell phones left by the couple in a trash can near their rented townhouse.Bowdich said the FBI hoped examination of data retrieved from the phones and other electronic devices seized in the investigation would lead to a motive for the attack.The couple had two assault-style rifles, two semi-automatic handguns, 6,100 rounds of ammunition and 12 pipe bombs in their home or with them when they were killed, officials said. And Bowdich said they may have been planning an additional attack.PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCEOne startling disclosure came from social media network Facebook, which confirmed that comments praising Islamic State were posted around the time of the mass shooting to a Facebook account established under an alias by Malik. However, it was uncertain whether the comments were posted by Malik herself or someone with access to her page.A Facebook Inc spokesman said the profile in question was removed by the company on Thursday for violating its community standards barring promotion or praise for ""acts of terror."" He declined to elaborate on the material.But CNN and other news media outlets reported that Malik's Facebook posts included a pledge of allegiance to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Asked about a reported Facebook post by Malik on the day of the attack pledging loyalty to Islamic State, Bowdich said, ""I know it was in a general timeline where that post was made, and yes, there was a pledge of allegiance.""While Malik and her husband may have been inspired by Islamic State, there was no evidence the attack was directed by the militant group, or that the organization even knew who they were, U.S. government sources said. Islamic State, which has seized large swaths of Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris in which gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people.Speaking to reporters separately in Washington, FBI Director James Comey said the investigation pointed to ""radicalization of the killers and of potential inspiration by foreign terrorist organizations.""But no evidence has been uncovered yet suggesting the killers were ""part of an organized larger group, or form part of a cell,"" Comey said. ""There is no indication that they are part of a network.""Bowdich said neither Farook nor Malik had been under investigation by the FBI or other law enforcement agency prior to Wednesday.And while federal agents have since discovered contacts between the couple and the subjects of other FBI inquiries, none of those ""were of such a significance that it raised these killers up onto our radar screen,"" Comey said.The Times gave no additional details for its report that Farook had been in contact with individuals from the Nusra Front and another unspecified militant group abroad.FAMILY UNAWARE OF EXTREMIST VIEWSFarook family attorneys, holding a news conference in Los Angeles, denied there was any evidence that either the husband or wife harbored extremist views.""She was like a typical housewife,"" lawyer David Chesley said, describing Malik as ""caring, soft-spoken"" and a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day, chose not to drive and ""kept pretty well isolated.""She spoke broken English and her primary language was Urdu, he said, adding, ""She was very conservative.""They said Farook, too, largely kept to himself, had few friends and said co-workers sometimes made fun of his beard.Farook, born in Illinois to Pakistani immigrant parents, worked as an inspector for the San Bernardino County Department of Environment Health, the agency whose holiday party he and Malik are accused of attacking on Wednesday.Investigators are looking into a report that Farook had an argument with a co-worker who denounced the ""inherent dangers of Islam"" prior to the shooting, a U.S. government source said.The couple's landlord in the town of Redlands opened their townhouse to media on Friday, leading to a flurry of reporters and camera crews surveying the scene after the FBI had finished conducting its 24-hour-long search of the premises.The landlord later asked media to leave the home. The couple and their 6-month-old daughter shared the home with Farook's mother, in whose care they left the child on Wednesday morning, saying they had a doctor's appointment, according to family representatives.Child welfare authorities have taken custody of the baby, and Farook's relatives were seeking return of the infant, hoping to place her with Farook's older sister, Abuershaid said.PROBE EXTENDS TO PAKISTANPakistani intelligence officials have contacted Malik's family in her homeland as part of the investigation, a family member said.""I only found out about this tragedy today when some intelligence officials contacted me to ask me about my links with Tashfeen,"" Malik's uncle, Javed Rabbani, said in an interview. ""I had heard in the news that this tragedy had taken place but I could never even imagine that it would be someone from my family. Of course, we are in shock.""He said his brother, Malik's father, had become considerably more conservative since moving with his family to Saudi Arabia a quarter century ago.Tashfeen Malik had not come to the attention of authorities while living in Saudi Arabia, according to a source close to the Saudi government. She had moved back to Pakistan five or six years ago to study pharmacy, Pakistani officials said.Christian Nwadike, who worked with Farook for five years, told CBS that his co-worker had been different since he returned from Saudi Arabia.""I think he married a terrorist,"" Nwadike said.Twenty-one people were wounded in the attack, the worst gun violence in the nation since the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.The San Bernardino attacks have raised concerns among Muslim-Americans of an anti-Islamic backlash. Two days after the San Bernardino attacks, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 51 percent of Americans view Muslims living in the United States the same as any other community, while 14.6 percent were generally fearful of Muslims.(Additional reporting by Mehreen Zahra-Malik in Islamabad, Idrees Ali and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Rory Carroll, Tim Reed and Yasmeen Abutaleb in San Bernardino; Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento and Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Writing by Scott Malone and Steve Gorman; Editing by Bill Trott, Lisa Shumaker, Toni Reinhold)"

Beijing is a strong ally of Pyongyang.When speaking to reporters last month, Liu did not rule out a new procedural vote, though Western diplomats say they have sufficient votes to overcome Chinese objections.China's and North Korea's U.N. missions did not respond immediately to requests for comment. North Korea has denied allegations of systematic human rights abuses, saying such charges are part of a U.S.-led plot to destabilize the country.A year ago this month the 193-member U.N. General Assembly urged the U.N. Security Council to consider referring North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC) after a U.N.

A criminal case was opened to investigate the incident.About 60 percent of SOCAR's oil production passes through the platform where the fire broke out, meaning the state company's output will be temporarily hit.The bulk of Azerbaijan's oil is produced elsewhere, however, including on fields operated by British oil major BP.BP Azerbaijan was not available for comment on Saturday on whether adverse weather in the Caspian or the fire on SOCAR's platform had affected its production.In a separate incident, SOCAR said on Friday that three workers were missing from another of its offshore oil platforms in the Caspian after an accident during the storm. The workers were still missing as of Saturday.Fourteen workers were killed in accidents on SOCAR's oil and gas platforms in 2014.Also on HuffPost:"

We recently spoke with photographer Marcus Bleasdale about his work in the Central African Republic.Pope Francis brought his appeal for peace into a war zone last weekend when he visited the Central African Republic, a country torn apart by violence between Muslim and Christian militias.Muslims and Christians alike celebrated the pope's visit. Once he left, however, violence returned. A Muslim man was found dead on Tuesday after he tried to leave a Muslim enclave encircled by the mostly Christian anti-Balaka militia in the capital of Bangui. Two days later, rebels from the mainly Muslim Seleka movement killed eight civilians at a camp for displaced people near the central town of Bambari.Fighting erupted in the Central African Republic in 2013 when the Seleka seized control of the government, and the anti-Balaka militias emerged to fight their brutal rule. The violence quickly spun out of control as atrocities by both militias against civilians mounted, leaving at least 5,000 people dead and nearly 1 million displaced. The conflict has been simmering since a peace deal was signed last July. Presidential elections planned for October were postponed after violence flared again in the capital.The WorldPost spoke to Marcus Bleasdale, an award-winning photographer who witnessed some of the most horrific days of the conflict. He and Human Rights Watch's director of emergencies, Peter Bouckaert, traveled through the war-ravaged country, collecting testimonies and images published by Human Rights Watch, National Geographic and Foreign Policy magazine. A photo book of his work, The Unravelling: Central African Republic, with essays by Bouckaert and a foreword by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, was published last month.Why did you call the series and book ""The Unravelling""?Essentially that's what we witnessed. We witnessed the unraveling of a country, the unraveling of a government and the unraveling of relationships amongst different ethnic groups and religious groups that had been forged over generations. Historically, Central African Republic has been a place that people came to for refuge -- they came from Chad, Congo and Sudan over the last 100 years or so. Different ethnic groups and religious groups have been living together and intermarrying for years and years. This whole eclectic relationship that had developed in the country unraveled within weeks.You’ve covered the Central African Republic, and other conflicts in the region, for decades. Were you shocked by how fast and badly things unraveled in CAR?I wasn't so shocked about the original takeover of the government by the Seleka movement. What was more shocking was after the Seleka were dissolved, how quickly the uprising against the Muslim population started, and how aggressive and violent and personal it became, very, very quickly. Why did you feel it was so important to document this descent into violence?I first went to document the human rights abuses under the Muslim Seleka government with Human Rights Watch in August 2013. We returned in December, and were there on Dec. 5 when the anti-Balaka had this quite clearly coordinated attack on several towns throughout the country that lasted several days. When we returned in early 2015, the Seleka movement fled Bangui to northern regions, and Bangui and other towns rose up and started to attack the Muslim population and their property.It was extraordinarily underreported by the world's media. There were times when I could count possibly three, four or five different journalists and photographers in the country at any time. It was just desperately under-covered, so much so that nobody knew what was going on. The United Nations wouldn't travel into the regions because of the security issues and the restrictions they had. So, the only way we were going to learn about what was going on and engage people -- like the French government, for example -- to come in and try to calm the situation down with peacekeepers was do this reporting with Human Rights Watch.Has working on this conflict changed you, personally or professionally?Yes, definitely. It was an extraordinarily violent conflict, and a very personal one in that most of the killing was very accessible. We were present on many, many occasions in which people were being attacked and killed in front of us, and there was nothing you could do about it because it was mob rule. When there's 200 to 300 people killing one person in front of you there's nothing you can do but record it, to make sure that the people who are committing the atrocities are held to account at a later date. When you see that sort of behavior and you see it at such proximity and carried out with such hatred, of course that has an impact on you.Has it changed the way I work? I think it's more that I appreciate how it is more important than ever to cover these underreported stories, especially when news organizations don't have the resources to put people on the ground. We were in the Central African Republic on the 20th anniversary of Rwanda's genocide. We were witnessing again this very personal hatred, and I think if it wasn't for the NGOs and human rights groups who were there and their very effective reporting and advocacy, it could very easily have been another Rwanda.Do you have a favorite photo from this series? I don't think any of the photos I took at that time can be classed as favorites. It's not the easiest body of work I've ever had to take and use.But I think the one that moved me most was the one I took of the reunification between a mother and her son, after her son Eliam had been abducted by the Seleka with his father. We found Eliam and his father exhausted on the side of the road with his father after they'd managed to escape from the Seleka, and we took him back to his family. That was a very moving moment. That moment of hope, of enduring love between a mother and her son, was probably a moment that will stay with me for a long time.The conflict in CAR can often feel so remote to outsiders. Who are some of the unsung heroes that you think people should know about?There were a lot of people, from both religious communities as well as civilians, who protected people during the attacks. There were many priests who protected the Muslim populations in their towns. They risked their lives in order to secure the safety of people who are from the religion that was attacking their own people. There are many stories of many imams doing that and many stories of many priests doing that -- too numerous to mention. Do you think the pope’s visit will have any impact on the conflict?This is a question I've been asking myself. I think what it can do is bring attention to what's going on there, but yet again, despite the amount of interventions we have made into countries like the Central African Republic over the years, we seem to be still unsure about how to move forward.While I think democracy is the way forward, it's very difficult to see how we can have an election in this country without the majority of the Muslim population, who are in camps in Cameroon and in Chad, and call that government legitimate. And at the same time, there are still armed groups from all sides roaming around and the intimidation that goes on is huge. So, I don't see how we can force a process on a country so early, without trying at least some form of demobilization and disarmament of militia, and reasonable security for the civilian population.The pope's visit will focus attention on the issues of Central African Republic for what, five minutes, 10 minutes, a day, two days? But, really what we should be doing is focusing our attention on this whole concept of the policy of forcing elections on a country that maybe isn't quite ready. What is perpetuating the violence there at the moment?The Seleka movement is fracturing -- some parts of the movement would like to sit around the table and have a dialogue, some are quite happy with the status quo, and others would like partitioning between the Muslim population in the north and the Christian population in the south. There is as much intergroup fighting as there is fighting between anti-Balaka and Seleka.If you travel into the regions you can see that these organizations are essentially mini fiefdoms. They're profit centers for the commanders in those zones. All of the natural resources the country had -- gold, diamonds and timber -- are earning the people controlling these remote areas a fortune. It's clear what's happening when you see the types of weapons that people have. The anti-Balaka are no longer walking around with just hunting rifles, they're now armed with AK-47s and RPGs and reasonably professional grenades. It's also clear that the Seleka are receiving outside funding and support.Do you plan to return to CAR in the near future?Yes, I'm currently doing a project there for National Geographic magazine, continuing the work we've been doing there.This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:Also on HuffPost:"

We recently spoke with photographer Marcus Bleasdale about his work in the Central African Republic.Pope Francis brought his appeal for peace into a war zone last weekend when he visited the Central African Republic, a country torn apart by violence between Muslim and Christian militias.Muslims and Christians alike celebrated the pope's visit. Once he left, however, violence returned. A Muslim man was found dead on Tuesday after he tried to leave a Muslim enclave encircled by the mostly Christian anti-Balaka militia in the capital of Bangui. Two days later, rebels from the mainly Muslim Seleka movement killed eight civilians at a camp for displaced people near the central town of Bambari.Fighting erupted in the Central African Republic in 2013 when the Seleka seized control of the government, and the anti-Balaka militias emerged to fight their brutal rule. The violence quickly spun out of control as atrocities by both militias against civilians mounted, leaving at least 5,000 people dead and nearly 1 million displaced. The conflict has been simmering since a peace deal was signed last July. Presidential elections planned for October were postponed after violence flared again in the capital.The WorldPost spoke to Marcus Bleasdale, an award-winning photographer who witnessed some of the most horrific days of the conflict. He and Human Rights Watch's director of emergencies, Peter Bouckaert, traveled through the war-ravaged country, collecting testimonies and images published by Human Rights Watch, National Geographic and Foreign Policy magazine. A photo book of his work, The Unravelling: Central African Republic, with essays by Bouckaert and a foreword by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, was published last month.Why did you call the series and book ""The Unravelling""?Essentially that's what we witnessed. We witnessed the unraveling of a country, the unraveling of a government and the unraveling of relationships amongst different ethnic groups and religious groups that had been forged over generations. Historically, Central African Republic has been a place that people came to for refuge -- they came from Chad, Congo and Sudan over the last 100 years or so. Different ethnic groups and religious groups have been living together and intermarrying for years and years. This whole eclectic relationship that had developed in the country unraveled within weeks.You’ve covered the Central African Republic, and other conflicts in the region, for decades. Were you shocked by how fast and badly things unraveled in CAR?I wasn't so shocked about the original takeover of the government by the Seleka movement. What was more shocking was after the Seleka were dissolved, how quickly the uprising against the Muslim population started, and how aggressive and violent and personal it became, very, very quickly. Why did you feel it was so important to document this descent into violence?I first went to document the human rights abuses under the Muslim Seleka government with Human Rights Watch in August 2013. We returned in December, and were there on Dec. 5 when the anti-Balaka had this quite clearly coordinated attack on several towns throughout the country that lasted several days. When we returned in early 2015, the Seleka movement fled Bangui to northern regions, and Bangui and other towns rose up and started to attack the Muslim population and their property.It was extraordinarily underreported by the world's media. There were times when I could count possibly three, four or five different journalists and photographers in the country at any time. It was just desperately under-covered, so much so that nobody knew what was going on. The United Nations wouldn't travel into the regions because of the security issues and the restrictions they had. So, the only way we were going to learn about what was going on and engage people -- like the French government, for example -- to come in and try to calm the situation down with peacekeepers was do this reporting with Human Rights Watch.Has working on this conflict changed you, personally or professionally?Yes, definitely. It was an extraordinarily violent conflict, and a very personal one in that most of the killing was very accessible.
